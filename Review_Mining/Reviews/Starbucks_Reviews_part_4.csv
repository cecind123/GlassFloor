good,"Great leadership. Fantastic benefits. Love the work environment"
good,I loved my store and the people that I worked with on a daily basis. Once you are able to get the job down it isn't difficult but it can be stressful because people REALLLY need their coffee and are rude. My biggest con is that the health benefit hours are hard to reach if you're only working part time and there is no way anyone can live off of 9 dollars an hour. If you work all the days of the week its still almost impossible to making an actual living with no outside help.
good,"Too slow paced for my liking, i was hired at a bar inside of a grocery store and got paid 8.50 which compared to the 7.25 i was making was somewhat better but not enough."
good,"Muy buena empresa para comenzar a laborar, un lugar donde sin duda puedes aprender mucho y desarrollarte tanto personal como profesionalmente."
good,"This was my favourite place to work. Every shift was fast paced and fast moving but it gave us all the benefits of experiencing so many different and beautiful personalities that I feel that Starbucks helped shaped me into the positive, inclusive, friendly person that I am today. I learned great communication skills, problem solving, and understanding of what it means to be a great person as well as a great worker. I also learned how to be swift on my feet while being sufficient with the time given, but also perfecting everything in a timely manner that is a skill I have also acquired from working at Starbucks. I will always recommend working here to anybody looking to be working in a bright and social environment."
good,"Great atmosphere "
good,"I've had quite a few jobs and, despite the stress and the long hours, I would say that working at Starbucks was one of my greatest opportunities. A great company to work for, full of support and a tight-community. Getting to work with people that you genuinely care for and enjoy being around; getting through the rough days together as a team. Is it hard work? Oh, yes. Does it get stressful? Absolutely. Are all the customers fantastic? No. Is it fast-paced? You have no idea how fast. But making your customers' days, sometimes being the first person they talk to that day or the bright spot in their bad day makes it all worth it."
good,"I had amazing trainers and great managers, they made it easy to enjoy my workplace. Learned about patience and that not every customer is right . It is always convenient when you are able to confine in your managers so that the day goes by easier."
good,Overall my time with the company was fun. The ability to transfer store across the nation is a huge upside. When you have an SM who cares that is a huge upside to the moral of the store. Down fall would be the run around with opportunities to climb up the ladder from SM to ASM.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work, the people were all really friendly and the staff was great.  It was really busy but that made it fun and and time go by really fast.  Making drinks was the best part of the job"
good,"Starbucks is all about passion and culture. As a Brand Champion, it was my responsibility to make sure the baristas performed their duties according to the Starbucks guidelines and procedures."
good,You have to want to be a part of the bigger picture and culture. Take pride in all aspects and deliver great customer service. The benefits are really great.
good,Les gens que j'ai rencontré au Starbucks sont encore des amis proche aujourd'hui.
good,"Fast paced work environment & fun and work-oriented staff. Management is always willing to help out special requests, and is extremely understanding of most issues."
good,Good Job for starters and resume building. Good benefits and good company to work for. Ability to multi task is required fast paced on rushes but always fun
good,"My review for starbucks, i greatly enjoyed my two years that i worked there. Met and worked with a lot of great people, and got to know my customers extremely well. "
good,My favorite thing about Starbucks as a company is not only do they try to create a welcoming culture at their stores but they also make sure any problems are handled with the utmost care. There is a great system in place for those looking to move up. It does take a long time to move up.
good,"As most places management was horrible and unfair with unprofessional relationships as far as favoritism instead of professionalism."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at starbucks everyone I work with was friendly, supportive, and flexible. I was able to make a steady living while living on my own in college. the hours work around my crazy schedule."
good,"Most folks here like the environment and love their teams, but would love to be paid more for the amount of work they're expected to do. Benefits are what keep people around. The perks are okay, and management is fine, but it's clear that a lot of upper management has never worked in retail stores based on the workload decisions they make."
good,"I liked working at Starbucks, great training and management.  The only drawback is the pay is low and it can be hard to get enough hours. It is fun and fast paced."
good,"trabajo rápido y constante, atención a publico constante, buen ambiente de trabajo, trabajo en equipo."
good,"I was a shift supervisor for the company and honestly, it taught me a lot to move forward in my later career. I will say, it's one of those companies that, whilst there certain standards that need to be upheld company wide, your experience (partner and customer wise) will most definitely vary store to store depending on the area you're in and the personalities of the management there. Some stores can be strict on policies, while some are very lax in partner creativity and customer interactions. All in all, its a great place to be."
good,"Great company to work for especially if you’re still in school. It is a good part time job. If you work hard and are good at your job and coaching others, you can move up pretty quickly. After working for starbucks for over two years, I’ve finally gotten a 35 cent raise which still doesn’t even come close to covering the cost of living. I will hopefully be eligible for benefits for the first time since I have steadily gotten to work at least 20 hours/week(which is the requirement)."
good,"It was an amazing atmosphere to work in. People were friendly and the company offers a lot of support to their employees. General work day would be clocking in and getting right to work weather on the bar or register it required focus and upbeat personality, can't get easily frustrated."
good,"Each barista is assigned tasks as a part of the overall customer service objectives"
good,This company is great for those seeking to gain skills in customer service and still seeking to have time for school or other work opportunities. They are very flexible with availability and there is room for advancement in the company.
good,"Excelente escuela de trabajo, con posibilidades rápidas de crecimiento, apoyo entre partners y gerente."
good,I love the company just a little unhappy with my management and store. I'm an opener so it gets hard sometimes because I feel stagnant there is no opportunity for growth.
good,"It's very satisfying to work as a barista and you have plenty of benefits. Most customers are very pleasant people, you're their guide to understanding their order. If I worked for a different location it's very possible it would be perfect - I just wish that my management did more for the employees."
good,"Great coworkers, fast paced and fun. Easy shift swap, can get time off when needed. Great benefits, so much free coffee and food. 30% off all the time for partners."
good,"I really enjoyed working as a barista, and i loved my co-workers. I just didn't make enough to take care of my family. It's very fasted paced and you have to remember a lot of drinks. Although, i think that's what makes it an awesome job. You'll find out you as a person are capable of so much and Starbucks will show you that."
good,"Starbucks has such great culture, putting customers first, but also respecting employees in the same way. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the most important part is to make moments of connection with customers. When you learn/know how to make those connections, it just makes the job that much easier and that much more enjoyable. You develop so many good skills, including people skills, time management and efficiency, etc."
good,"*Positive Energy"
good,"I enjoyed working there. The management was good, my coworkers (or partners) were easy to get along with, and interacting with the customers was nearly always fun. I only left due to health reasons as I have an allergy that made working there impossible."
good,My journey started great and ended not the best somewhere upper management didn't live the culture the company has for us which concluded my time. I will always love what the company stands for but with the new management they're bringing in who did work there way up they have no clue what its like in the day of the life.
good,"Being that Starbucks is my third job but it was really great. They would offer me more hours if it was not for my other job but they even offered me to come back if I did not like the other one. It is really fast-paced, at least the store I worked at. But it was a really great team and everyone was really friendly."
good,"The environment was great. My coworkers were so warm and inviting, and everything was open and honest between workers and managers. There was never any confusion, everything was given a thorough, step by step instruction the first time around. And even if someone doesn’t remember, there were helpful tips and clue cards everywhere to help during busy shifts."
good,I loved working at Starbucks! If it were a sufficient way to support my family I would go back in a heart beat! The culture and community of Starbucks are amazing!
good,"Working at Starbucks really taught me how to have patience, and learning to work at a fast pace. I learned to how Work with my co-workers as a team. I learned to help them out and support them when it was needed and even when it was not needed."
good,Overall a great work environment. The culture is the key to the companies success. Mission and values are alive and well. Focus on the customer and the partner is relentless.
good,"Always stayed busy, teamwork was everything. Must work on selling more products as a shift supervisor and advancing others to do so as well. Merchandise setup and sales was my strongpoint."
good,"Loved my coworkers, customers, making coffee, and learning about coffee. I felt like I learned and grew so much working at a Starbucks Reserve Store. I now have a working knowledge of coffee which I use all the time."
good,"I learned to be patient, to stand up for myself and to be confident. The most important thing is to help others and work as a team. That is one thing that was lacking a bit."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The environment from both the customers and employees was very satisfying.  However it does not align with my career goals.
good,"Starbucks has been my longest and most favorite job. I’ve been a barista, I’ve been a supervisor and I have been an assistant manager. Starbucks offers plenty of opportunities to advance your knowledge and career title."
good,"I loved working at starbucks. Fast paced work environment, with great benefits and ample growth opportunities. Extremely flexible hours, with great store to store policies!"
good,ejoyed my time at starbucks but torwards the end i did not enjoy working for the manager. company was chnaging and that change really turned me off with the company
good,Typical workday can be stressful but enjoyable as long as baristas work together and everyone does their part. When everyone has a good attitude the days go well! Able to work your way up if you show responsibility and time management skills.
good,"I love this company and i was extremely satitfiied with my job for years. I've worked in many different stores in PA and NC and each one had it own quirks and personality. Starbucks tends to attract really nice employees and great managers. There are exceptions to this as with any company but usually I've seen the ""bad eggs"" find their way out faster than in most companies. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,Working at Starbucks was a good experience I enjoyed the people I worked with and especially the manager and my trainer they have good benefits especially the college benefits.
good,At the university Starbucks it was always busy with student orders and made the day go by fast. Learning to memorize orders and multitask making both hot and cold drinks were also fun.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work especially if you're a coffee lover like myself. It's definitely a quick paced work environment but luckily your surrounded by coffee to fuel you throughout your shift.  I can proudly say I also love the company and everything it stands for.
good,Management is bad depending on where you are. But it is very easy to move up. Pay is decent and working environment is great. I would improve the way the drive through is run.
good,"The right location with the right team makes any environment enjoyable to work in.  I had great leadership at the location I worked for and it made the experience fun,entertaining and worth going that extra mile for every person."
good,loved my job until I moved to a new start wasn't the same. would go back if I can but to my original location. miss my Starbuck family. great place to work
good,"I absolutely love my job as a Starbucks barista and wouldn’t change it for the world. It’s the best work environment and everyone makes it fun to be at work. From day one everyone treated me as part of the Starbucks family and never made me feel like the newbee. If your looking for a great part time job, or even a full time job, I would 20/10 recommend starbucks!"
good,"setting up the Espresso Bars, Making coffee and ice coffee thur out the day, cold brew every other day. "
good,"Great work environment, easy going co-workers and great customer clientele. The hardest part of my day would be finding that work-life balance. Giving my team my all also requires them knowing I will be there to support them when it is needed and vice-versa with my family. I really enjoyed connecting with customers and creating the cozy experience the brand is known for. I have a deeper understanding of the retail side of the business and can really appreciate how much each store manager is afforded the opportunity "
good,"Starbucks is fun to work at because the staff feels like family. It is comfortable and professional. Everyone is polite and even if it is extremely busy, it is still fun."
good,Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for. It is as close to perfect as you will get working in the service industry.  I love connecting with my partners and my customers over new beverages and our day-to-day lives.
good,"fun but chaotic environment, one must be calm and be able to handle tasks responsibilities fast and though. Must have great communication with team in order for things to run smoothly"
good,"In my years of working for Starbucks I enjoyed most of my time except when I changed locations. Only reason it wasn’t pleasant after the location change was because of the horrible “business only” attitude the store manager donned, almost to a sociopathic level. The lady left ALL human element out of the equation for managing the staff here for the sole purpose of keeping her numbers and stats looking exceptional for the district manager. Literally demeaning to staff and micromanaging any minsicule error for anything as trivial as to how you dump the trash into the dumpster. Every other location I worked at was a terrific, pleasant experience, and the company overall cares about its employees. I wouldn’t deter anyone to work for Starbucks just for the poor experience I had at one location, I would simply advise to work at another store."
good,Was a fast paced job and could be stressful at times. Training fully prepared you for the job and management was helpful in ensuring customers and employees were cared for.
good,"I really like working here, they really take care of there people. But they have a hard time taking care of the middle management. They work the hardest in the whole company. Longer hours less flexible schedule and crazy pressure."
good,"Depending on how high volume your store is, it can get stressful. However it is a great place to work, flexible hours, opportunities to get promoted and for bonuses. The best part of this job is all the people you meet--both coworkers and customers."
good,"filling ice, taking orders, making drinks, making food, checking temps, cleaning"
good,I like Starbucks because they offer free drinks and offer discounts on food plus they cover insurance and pay for holiday also whilst working at Starbucks you will like the place overtime
good,"Fun place to work once you find the pace that works for you and learn to make the drinks. Tuition repayment, free Spotify, food and drinks. Close kit family with team and regular customers."
good,My job is very fun because of my awesome coworkers and the people I️ get to meet on a daily basis- it can be stressful- but it doesn’t take away from the fun times we all have! I’ve been there for almost 3 years now and it’s been a blast since day 1.
good,"While the stress level can sometimes be through the roof, Starbucks cares about its employees. At least at my store, there is always room for constructive criticism between manager and partner and partner and partner. If you work hard, there is always an opportunity to move up, there are lots of benefits, free meals, and a great team of people to work for. The hardest part of this job is sometimes the most important; the customer service is key to this job and sometimes, our customers are not easy to get along with. However, the atmosphere between coworkers along with the customer connections that are positive make this job worthwhile."
good,I had a blast working at Starbucks and moved up rapidly it just wasn't going in the direction of a career I had in mind so I left for another opportunity.
good,"each partner was responsible for covering all positions in restaurant."
good,"It really it the best company to work for. I love my management team and all the resources given to us to connect with others around the country. A very diverse environment, very open to people of all walks of life."
good,"I truly loved working at Starbucks."
good,"Friendly, fast pace environment, regular costumers, demanding and specific menus, very focus on procedure to provide the best experience to costumers around the world, I loved to work surrounded by the smell of coffee."
good,"At Starbucks I learned not only how to deal well with customers as well as how to properly work under high productivity, but I also learned a lot more than I expected about coffee. I don't think its unfair to say that Starbucks typically isn't known as a place known for its good coffee. Good service and options for lattes and fraappuccinos for sure, but most coffee enthusiasts don't tend to talk about Starbucks. So it really surprised me the amount of stuff about coffee beans they taught me while I was there. About how they can be prepared, what different regions mean for different beans, the growing conditions, the terminology for different beans, how they're roasted, etc. Out of all the experiences I've had at Starbucks, the actual wealth of knowledge that Starbucks has on coffee is probably what I'm mostly grateful and I feel should be recognized."
good,"I Love starting at 4:00 am and getting the store ready to open. The partners I work with make my day fun and a joy to get up for work.  My shift supervisor is the main reason I have no problem getting up to open with her, she is amazing and a great leader. She teaches me something every day.  Connecting with customers, getting to know them and making their beverages is the best part of my job.  Everyone is welcome at Starbucks and it's great to see students in there studying, business meetings going on and old friends meeting for coffee.  It's teamwork all the way at Starbucks, it takes all of us working together to make it successful.  And at the end of the day its still Coffee.  The Best Coffee!!"
good,I really loved my time at Starbucks. Management was great and they were very flexible with my schedule. I loved the atmosphere and the people you get to meet.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. It has a fun, but quick environment. For full-time employees it has a great benefits program, but for part time it wasn't bad (discounts worldwide and stock options)."
good,"I learned about picking the right products and taking them to its exact locations. The management needs to be better, hardest part is being able to work on your feet the whole 8 hours or more."
good,"Great place to work, you make alot of connnections with customers, Just that opening at 4AM overbalances your life.It can take a toll on your sleep pattern."
good,"Great job but, can get really busy. Very fast pace work environment makes time go by faster. I work with great people which makes going into work fun."
good,Good job for students. Not a job to live off of. Go to school for a career. Management was good and liked working with co-workers. Customers loved the way I made drinks.
good,"Starbucks was where I really delved into the business end of running a restaurant, versus simply going through the operational motions. I learned how to communicate effectively and grow as a leader."
good,"Working with the Starbucks Co. for a while now and honestly it was the best decision, great management, great workplace, and much more. It has taught me a lot. It has taught me to work with others as a team instead of an individual work place. Everyone is there to help each other and not put each other down."
good,"I had the pleasure of opening a new store location as a new partner when I was hired by probably to company’s best manager possible. He has since moved on from Colorado to Seattle to open another new store there. Through his and the wonderful culture he and his amazing shifts provided I myself was promoted to a shift within three months and ended up transferring to another store. Unfirtunalty as wonderful as my previous experience was, the development experience into a fully functioning shift was rushed and sorta just never really completed. Despite asking many many times for more and better training and ways to achieve it in and out of my store my manager seemed only to care about bullying her staff which lead to me continuously making mistakes and not wholly.capable of being a shift and even that being the case she kept me scheduled on closes every shift I had for months on end where I had no one with seniority AND shift experience to help coach me through the many many things no one showed me. I was terminated in fact but ended up being rehired back to my original store about a year later. I again am not currently with the company but my passion for coffee and genuine love for the culture and just the company itself has stayed with me. Even just as a barista, shift, trainer, and coffee master (almost anyway just a couple weeks were left dang it) was truly more than a job or a paycheck, and every day still I would give anything to be hired on again for the third time in a new state and pick up and finish what I started,  being a partner was and stillvery much is a long run"
good,"I loved my job there as a part time and got along with everyone in the team. It was a big family and we all helped each other out. However, it was only a part time job while I’m in college."
good,Starbucks is a great company that takes care of their workers. If you are lucky enough to work at a great store with a great team then your time there will be perfect.
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Shifts can seem long and arduous if you aren't committed but can be fun if you enjoy the team you work with. Fun, family-like environment."
good,"The age which Starbucks employees happens to be just young enough to occasionally provide subpar, immature, or problematic moments throughout the day. "
good,Starbucks was a very productive and hardworking environment. Constantly had to stay on feet because of the customer in-pour. My coworkers were friendly and supportive and that helped me to be my best.
good,Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. The benefits are greta. The best benefit is that starbucks will pay 100% of your college education  through ASU.
good,"As a barista you are trained to ring up front, warm food, wash dishes, make drinks and run drive-thru (if applicable). A fun job if your coworkers and manager is chill."
good,"Best things about working at Starbucks is the people you meet and things you learn. Flexible hours, Lots of different skill sets needed. Makes you multitask and overall become a better you."
good,"A typical day at work was serving customers their drinks and maintaining our stations and lobbies clean at all times while making sure all of the customers were served with outstanding customer service. I learned how to deal with difficult situations including dealing with  irrational customers and not to let them effect my work environment. My manager felt as if she was my family she treated everyone the same and never placed anyone above the next person regardless of their position in the store. The workplace culture was amazing no negative attitudes on the floor, everyone kept an upbeat attitude and customer service was amazing. The hardest part of the job was at times working both the coffee bar and the cash register when someone called off. The most enjoyable was being able to work with all of my coworkers because the environment with all of them was amazing"
good,This mostly fast pace work place still lets you have great positive interaction with the world. A very supportive and welcoming work environment. This company is very willing to work with the abilities limits of its employees.
good,"A typical day was pretty busy so time goes by fast and you have to be able to learn quickly and keep up with the fast pace. I learned a lot about working with other people. Management is very helpful and collaborative with other employees. The workplace culture was amazing for me, everyone was very friendly with each other and it made coming to work much better. Hardest part was the days where the line never shortens and there's always stuff to do and never enough time to do it, but you get through it. Most enjoyable was my coworkers, they were the only thing that made it bearable."
good,"Starbucks as a company is very unique in comparison to a lot of other companies. "
good,wonderful crew and company. a typical day you would open the store get ready for the needy people who want coffee then go home and sleep. the hardest part was that it was only part time hours so even if you loved working there the company does not want full time employees.
good,"Working the morning rush was a lot to handle, but with time became second nature manageable. The key was to carry a smile and keep customers happy. Also carrying a smile helped other employees get through their day too. The hardest part was being a barista, but that was the my favorite part as well. Once you got into a groove, got through the rush, it was rewarding and fulfilling."
good,It was so much fun but it wasn't the paying job I wanted/ needed to maintain the lifestyle I wanted for the future. However it was a nice high school job that taught me a lot and I am grateful to of gotten the opportunity.
good,"I love the company, the staffing can be a hit or miss due to people just wanting the money and not valuing the connection, however , I find that the environment doesn't change when you have just a few people who uphold the mission. Benefits are definitely a plus especially if you’re looking into school, the ASU program is a great start, healthcare benefits are especially great, and the Bean Stock grants are just added opportunities Starbucks gives to their employees. I learned how to connect to people without the added awkwardness which is amazing. However, if you don’t like fast paced working, problem solving, cleaning and the occasional random angry customer you could run into some problems."
good,Amazing opportunity to work with various brewing methods and a ability to gain a vast amount of coffee knowledge. Some of the best and most talented people you'll ever meet will be your coworkers.
good,"If you go into a Starbucks in the morning you can already tell how hard everyone works to get everything out to you in a timely manner. As soon as the store opens many people come in for their coffee and food items. Every member is extremely friendly even in our fast-paced environment. The hardest part of the job is the customers, any customer services job is hard although. Sometimes it can be difficult to handle but we always provide a smile and a refund if they are unsatisfied. It is understandable that they get upset when its busy and they are in a rush. Other than a rude customer, which only happens every once in a blue moon, the job is a great place to feel comfortable and is like a second home to the team members and the customers."
good,"Truly my favorite place to be, good work environment, amazing partners, genuine people to be around. Really good management/supervisors, felt like my concerns as a partner were listened to and welcomed."
good,"Working at Turnberry Isle Licensed Starbucks is extremely fun. You are surrounded with great positive co-workers. Not only you work at Starbucks, you also work throughout the hotel itself. A typical day at work usually very busy in the mornings and slow in the afternoon/closing. The hardest part of the job for me is remembering customer's name. Mostly the job itself is fun and creative."
good,"While working at a great company with high standards such as Starbucks, I obtained a higher work ethic through learning meticulous standards and procedures that involved making the company's beverages. I felt like I was able to put my ability to attend to details to work here while learning to maintain exceptional customer service in a consistent manner. This high-stress job was mostly elevated in working the drive-thru in which time management, consistency, and attention to detail as skills were used together to provide a positive customer experience to those in need of a quick beverage as well."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks while I did. My co-workers were awesome and everyone treated each other very well. Once I got through training, everything got a lot easier and working there just became about meeting new people."
good,starbucks fue mi escuela para la calidad de servicio ♥
good,"loved meeting the regular customers, "
good,Great exposure. Working in groups. Flexible timings in case or emergencies. Able to meet new people and learn new techniques for fast learning. Great work atmosphere.
good,"It was consistently busy and that made work go by quickly but it was also very stressful during holiday hours."
good,My license store treats me very well. They are very motivating and successful. Everyone is treated as one big family. There is alot of respect behind our doors.
good,"Excellent job for young adults while in college or high school, with opportunity to advance to shift supervisor with good work ethic. Company really cares about its employees."
good,"Inspiring leadership though this may have changed with franchising.  Role and development very much depended on the line manager and I was lucky."
good,"Starbucks cafe offer's their workers a great experience, their management is great and also their training is so easy, great experience to work for them"
good,"Flexible scheduling, fun co-workers, socializing with regular and new customers. It's what I call my 'fun' job, as this is only part-time for me, but I can easily foresee opportunity to make it a full time and advance further when the time is right for me."
good,Starbucks company cared for their employees. very compassionate towards personal life issues and family oriented. work days were planned out accordingly and management was always helpful and available
good,"It was an incredibly fast-paced work environment, but with the right team, the shifts went extremely well with all the support possible. I learned a lot of communication between coworkers is extremely important to ensure the whole floor is running smoothly. Management was also extremely supportive professionally and personally. The hardest part of the job might be when an employee would call off, and we would be short staffed leading to a congestion of work. The most enjoyable part had to be when another barista and I would complete a whole line without any missteps. Those moments were very rewarding."
good,Loved working here. The coworkers were fun and easy to work with even when it’s super busy. The mornings can be a little stressful because it’s so busy but it makes the day go by faster! 50% off food and drinks while you’re working. The pay is great. I started at $15 an hour and it went up $2 in the year I worked there.
good,"I know my customers and my customers know me. We talk, share our days and life with each other. Our team is like family. We work very hard as a team to get the job done!"
good,Very fun environment to work in. Very flexible in every area. Treat their employees very well! Starbucks had to be the best company I’ve worked for. I loved it!
good,Working at Starbucks is a great opportunity to use your social skills and your multitasking skills. The staff is close like a family and your regulars are fairly nice. A good part time job
good,"Working in starbucks lets you forget about things outside when working"
good,Starbucks always provided a welcoming and professional environment to all their Partners. There were abundant opportunities to work in various sectors of the business. I was allowed to develop both my business and technical skills while working with and providing solutions to our clients around the world. Yes - and all the coffee we could ever drink surrounded us.
good,"A typical work day requires a lot of energy because you're constantly speeding through making drinks and getting food for customers. I learned efficiency and time management, as well as learning to work with customers when they were in a bad mood.They ran their stores really well and encouraged us all and in turn, we were a close team. The workplace culture is very laid back and fun, with the undercurrent of speedily working while ensuring everyone is communicating with one another and to the customers. The hardest part of working at Starbucks was the early mornings, but you get over that pretty quickly once it becomes a routine. The best part about that job was getting to go to work and hang out with my friends and enjoying the sweet customers who made my day every time they walked in the door."
good,flexible and supportive ! I love my Starbucks family and the company as a whole. They really dk care about your career with them and will do everything in their power to give you what you want.
good,"Very positive, memorable experience. Flexible scheduling, decent managers, but pay is low for all positions (barista-manager) in relation to workload."
good,"The shifts go by very quickly. Having consistent flow of traffic helps you manage time properly and get things done in an orderly fashion. This job has taught me to cash handle, time manage, coach on the spot, and focus on customer connections with trying to make every moment right. The hardest part of the job is when we are down a person because of a call out or a no call no show. Being down a team member can be very difficult, especially when we are busy. The most enjoyable part are the customers. They make our day as much as we strive to make theirs. They remember us by our name and we try our best to not only recognize them but to remember their drinks and make sure they leave wanting to come back the next day."
good,"If you love good benefits and love staying busy, Starbucks is a great place to work. If you get overwhelmed easily though, it may not be the best option, it is very fast paced."
good,"I enjoyed each day I worked."
good,"I had an amazing time working at Starbucks, it had a great atmosphere and everyone was kind and outgoing. I found it really easy to learn new things with help from my trainer et.."
good,Quick paced but very collaborative team effort. Must be willing to work well with others but also carry your own weight. Learned how to multitask and improved my memory
good,Making drinks for the public you learn many likes and dislikes for each person who comes into the door. Problem solving skills are instilled into you very early on. Costumer service is a top priority and making every momment right.
good,Valuable place to be in managment learned all about the different kinds of stress and the requirements to run a business even from the level of a supervisor
good,"Starbucks is a great job for a single college student that only has to provide for themselves. "
good,"My Review on Starbucks is overall amazing with great management and amazing service, I only left for lack of hours/pay. I would highly recommend this job to any friend or loved one."
good,"Working at Starbucks has provided me with many opportunities to grow both as a person and professionally. I am a fairly shy person but after working at Starbucks for nearly 3 years, I can pick up a conversation with any customer that walks in the door. Management varies by store but there are many tools that Starbucks provides to help us all succeed."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I thought it was a very nice place to work. I was often off before noon and could spend the rest of my day doing school work.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed working for Starbucks. Everything was perfect from the coworkers, the environment, the customers, the benefits, the policies- EVERYTHING. My only complaint is that (maybe it was just in my area) advancing positions was only given to those who were favorites. When a lot of us tried to report it, nothing was ever done. It was always a ""We will start an investigation but not really"" kind of thing. The DISTRICT manager always gave a heads up to those who were investigated if he liked them and they always stayed with the same problems. Also, with a Starbucks salary, you can not support yourself. That's why I will always tell people, if this is your first job or one of your first jobs and you are still living at home with your guardians and just want some extra money, then YES, Starbucks is a great place to work... BUT if you want to support yourself (like I was doing), then no.  The employees from Starbucks talk about this topic way more than they should."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks however, I was one of the older employees.  They have good benefits which is great if you are a student. They do require all the employee to clean the store themselves as opposed to hiring or contracting it out to a third party.  The money Starbucks saves on janitorial services helps them provide medical benefits to their employees. Most employees don't mind doing a little cleaning in trade off for benefits.  They have a good training program.  I was very impressed that they take all the espresso machines apart and sterilize them daily.  They are very clean and adhere to OSHA standards.  The change out the ice daily meaning they never dump new ice on top of old ice.  They date all their cream and food products to discard properly."
good,"Just as you expect it to be, dealing with customers and creating hand crafted beverages that follow Starbucks core values. Benefits are great and would reccomand."
good,One of the coolest companies I have ever worked for. The customers were the best part and to this day I still keep up with some of them. You really feel pride in wearing the green apron.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. The team is always put first, and there are so many great benefits. I’ve made great friends, definitely apply."
good,"Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs. It was fast paced but with the right support that could be a fun way to work. I made a lot of life long friends during my time with Starbucks.  As with any job, customers can be difficult. But typically, it was fun, fast paced, and great discounts and benefits."
good,"Management is awesome, the company as a whole cares for all the partners.  You not only get to work with amazing people you get to meet so many wonderful interesting people with the customers you serve. A wonderful place to work."
good,Great job to have as a student. The environment helped me learn how to navigate in fast paced environments. This job helped me balance school and outside career endeavors.
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. I worked there many years ago but I still appreciate and miss the job culture. We worked as a team for the most part and that’s definitely something that I miss.
good,Günü gününe yatan maaşı ve birçok muadiliyle kıyasladığımızda çalışanına verdiği değer ve şirket politikasının bu konu üzerinde durması harika.
good,Starbucks has taught me to go outside my comfort zone and allowed to me to develop myself as a supervisor. Allowed to learn skills I will use going forward and hopefully allow me to find a career
good,"Starbucks is extremely fast paced with an entire culture within itself. It requires you to learn an entire industry of coffee, but when taught right, can be very fun."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work.  They tend to hire a similar kind of person and everyone really gets along great.  You get great benefits and discounts when working at Starbucks.
good,Working at Starbucks was a great learning Experience. very different from retail and fast pace. I got the chance to be on the other side and make some very tasty drinks and very happy customers. depending on ones availability it worked mainly on around that  time frame. night shifts are calmer and morning are busy and can sometimes be stressful but everyone pulls through. pay was great for what i was doing and couldn't really complain. and they provide a lot more avenues for us to look through if we are ever in a bad space in life. I would say for anyone looking for there first job or change of pace Starbucks is the ultimate go to option to do so.
good,"Typically, you will meet people who are desperate for caffeine, and you will probably be one of them."
good,". great environment, meet new people"
good,Definitely stressful at times but the job is very fun. Would recommend working there. Would love to work there again when possible! Very fast paced and time flies when you're on the clock. You're often left wanting to work just a little longer.
good,Great management makes the difference. Strong company with a diverse culture and an inclusive atmosphere. The overall world vision drives the companies mission.
good,Working at Starbucks is a great job especially for college students. The hours are flexible and we get our schedules out 2 weeks in advance. Every week we get a free pound of coffee and on our shifts drinks are free.
good,"As the title says, a good first job, not to stay there forever unless you plan on advancing."
good,I work for a Starbucks inside of a Smith's. Everything is great and this is the best food industry job I have had. The only problems that I see with this job is conflict between Starbucks and Smiths management and the difficulty in becoming a full time employee.
good,It allowed me to work in a face paced area to prepare me for fast paced hospital areas. Though management was poor I was still able to get my job done in a productiv manner and able to put a smile on customers faces
good,"It's a good company to work for because the rules are very plain, simple, and efficient. A lot of people working there are young and in school. It's a good environment to work in and the managers treat people well."
good,"I'm always vocal to my costumers, having a conversation with them get to know them.Ii learned the importance of team work. The management take care of their employees."
good,"The stuff was lovely to work with, the job wasn t to hard and the shifts suited my needs. Learnt many things about coffee and starbucks as a company highly recommend"
good,"When I worked for Starbucks, I really enjoyed working with people. It was a great atmosphere and energetic. I was trained within 2 weeks and I learned so fast and quickly."
good,"I worked at a Starbucks kiosk within a Ralphs. We were considered Ralphs employees but were trained by the Starbucks company and used all their coffee and equipment. The management was amazing but sometimes they would forget to order a few things and cause customers to become upset due to the lack of a product.  I really enjoyed being able to talk to people and making their coffee. I learned a lot about the coffee industry and acquired new skills and a love for coffee. The hardest aspect of the job was dealing with a high volume of people, but my co-workers always made it fun and less stressful."
good,Everything is fast paced. It is always busy during the mornings. Could get stressful as well if you are behind on drinks or food. Also very competitive against other Starbucks.
good,"Fast-paced, upbeat working environment"
good,"Starbucks was a cool place to work during college. Great benefits. Fun co-workers. Flexible schedule. Tips were good. Job was not challenging, but kept you busy."
good,"the customers are great and you can really get to know the regulars, and the people are good to work with, need to be able to be at work at four in the morning. it can get extremely busy."
good,"if a manager doesnt like you they will find a way to legally fire you. some fellow employees will also throw you inder the bus making stuff up about you and telling management, when you ask management who it is they refues to tell you yet they have hr policies saying the contrary"
good,Staff was by far the best part about the company. They definitely cared about their employees which was great for morale; my only gripe would’ve been the scheduling but even that was handled with ease.
good,"I have overall enjoyed my experience working at Starbucks. The people are kind, the atmosphere is great. It is a very fast paced job. The benefits are amazing"
good,"Working at Starbucks, i have been educated on not just the human spirit but also how to feel like i am part of a family. Its not just the individual store atmosphere , its also the customers , the community . It helps us get more involved in what going on in the world. One of my favorite things about this company is how involved they are in their partners growth. They provide all the outlets necessary to ensure we have the platform  to grow as human beings. To grow not just our education, our careers and our personal connection."
good,"Cleaning and keeping the store clean while trying to help customers have a quality experience which is to create a welcoming environment, make a quality beverage and/or food item in a timely manner. Co workers make the job and the managers deal with all the issues and behind the scenes. I enjoy meeting new people whether it be co workers or new customers. access to coffee and food and great benefits also are a huge plus!"
good,"I spent many years working at Starbucks and definitely had my fair share of ups and downs. Overall, it’s a great company to work for with great benefits and decent wages. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who think they are owed everything."
good,A typical day at starbucks is easy. you deal with random customers sometimes but its nice to see the regulars. its not a hard job if you can comprehend basic instructions
good,"If management wasnt So Bad I would still be employed with the company. I loved how everyone was included and everyone was treated fairly. I would definitely go back to work for the company, just another location."
good,"I love this job and I love connecting with customers everyday through our love for coffee and you really get to develop bonds with regulars, and a lot of new costumers become regulars because their first experience with you was amazing. Unfortunately it does not pay well, and if you are living by yourself, especially as a student, you cannot support yourself. The benefit for education through ASU is great, however if you wish to go to Medical School, online classes are not allowed at all for prerequisites. So it is a useless benefit for me. I do think they should extend the benefit for education such as Apple has, then it would be worth the pay."
good,i would start by cleaning the cafe and then i would take over the drive thru and take customers drink orders . Also i would make the customers drinks too.
good,"It all depends on the manager and the culture they create.  My first manager was great and was on top of everything, thus spreading the same message.  Everyone cared about their work.  Once I transferred, my new manager, though nice, was disorganized and displayed an attitude of not caring, so no one else did.  Many times I was left alone to work at bar during peak although there were at least three other people in the back.  At my new location, everyone does the bare minimum and I'm leaving because transferring out of here is near impossible and I'm just tired of being the only one working."
good,"Amazing company with plenty of room to grow learn and inspire others. Creating moments with guests and coaching a team to give world class service. Culture, inclusion and love"
good,great for students and people who just need some extra cash . Definitely not a job for someone who has major bills like a mortgage or car loan . This job will only give you annually raises of cents at a time.
good,I liked working at Starbucks I learned a lot working there and I liked the work place the co workers where great to work with too . The hours where flexible
good,I enjoy working for Starbucks. They genuinely care for their partners and are always going the extra mile to make sure we are cared for! I’ve been with the company for 5 years and have seen plenty of growth in myself and my coworkers. We are making an impact!!
good,I stayed with starbucks so long because I valued the realtionships I made with my co-workers. The customers are - on the whole - very friendly and I enjoyed a lot of the perks of the job too.
good,Great Place to work with good benefits! A lot of  room for advancements. Compensation isn't great but you can always walk your way up.  It's a great work environment!
good,Its a great place to work. I would recommend anyone to work for this company. The benefits are great. The employees are great and management is wonderful. The work pates is fast.
good,"This job is very gentle to newcomers through training, and I was often reminded that the important part was to be comfortable and confident in my job. To that end, trainees are well educated and cared for as much as possible considering it was a work environment. Our main focus has always been (and probably will always be) to develop a sense of community, both between workers and customers, and between coworkers (called ""partners"" officially). That all being said, Starbucks isn't a job for the faint of heart or the easily discouraged. Your best friends are the most reliable people on the job, who can work calmly under pressure and still get their work done, even when you're being mobbed by people looking for the weekly discounts that often catch you off guard."
good,"Management has a clear role that was great. Breaks were scheduled into the daily schedule which was nice. It was fast paced, fun, can be challenging. We received tips."
good,I started as a barista and was promoted to store manager in a year. I like that the management really worked to train and develop my management skills and I liked the day to day interaction with customers.
good,"I learned a lot from this job and my role. I work greatly with teamwork and commitment to the job. Management is alright because theres a lot of drama juat like any other job but overall its alright. Hardest part is the customers, they be acting up all the time and are extremely disrespectful."
good,"Very friendly work place, not much business growth, I worked with Starbucks for 5 years. Personal growth store Barista Champion and Coffee Master 2018."
good,It was a good working environment .. a great place to work when your straight out of high school and there’s great pay .. the overnight is ok but it gets stressful after awhile
good,Excelente patrono. Consciente de las necesidades de sus empleados. Fomenta el aprendizaje y la confraternización.
good,"I cannot speak for all Starbucks', but for my specific store the work environment was amazing. I would highly recommend it! My manager worked well with my school and sports schedule. Even though I didn't use the benefits, the company offered exceptional compensation."
good,"It’s fun ., I like it ,, but I want to work more money,, because of my costs of living commissions,, i am hardworking person. I wanna work more hours ..I dnt ask for calling off at work. No absences nor lates at work.. and I love working at customer and making them smile and their coffee too since I love to drink coffee.."
good,I love this job. Sometimes it is pretty stressful but the experiences and relationships are so worth it. The manager at the location I work is an amazing boss.
good,It takes a unique person so be able to make conversation and show interest in other peoples lives.  This is an important role at Starbucks. Making people feel welcome is important by simply learning the names of the regulars and what they drink. They appreciate the personal connection.
good,"get to know the people you'll be working with before applying to"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at starbucks. It was great getting to know your regulars as well as new customers. However, I worked during a rough patch for that location. I had 4 different managers in 4 years, not counting the fill in managers. But, each one was willing to work with individuals to stick to their preferred schedule and to let those who worked best together stay together. I was going through undergrad at the time; the managers understood what I needed as a student and worked with my school schedule very well."
good,It was awesome when I was there. No drama and the workers were like a big family. I would love to go back but I would need a raise or be offered a manager roll.
good,"mejore:"
good,"Ótima empresa, com oportunidade de crescimento e benefícios."
good,always enjoy my time at work. occasionally there are managers that I feel like they don't do their job properly and have an issue running their stores
good,"I found Starbucks to be a very enjoyable place to work although it was stressful at times. Communication is extremely important in this job because, the employee who takes the order is not the employee who makes the drink. Therefore, communication is key to ensure that everything goes smoothly especially when orders reach peak. I gained valuable communication and customer service skills from this job."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  I enjoyed the fast pace although at times it can be chaos.  I wouldn't trade this experience because it introduced me to a lot of new people in the community and I enjoyed it.
good,"5-6 days a week I would be the primary opener and get there at 4am for set up. By 6am the restaurant would be completely packed every single day. Line out the door for hours and hours and a huge line in the drive thru as well. I worked all the positions as a barista but primarily on the coffee machine themselves making drinks or the drive thru window handing out orders and constantly interacting with guests. I was always assigned those two places because I physically move faster than most people, and with my prioritization and customer service skills there was no one better than me for that position. I really enjoyed working there because of the very fast paced environment and also the prioritization and focus skills I had to learn/apply everyday."
good,Good benefits but this prevents good pay. Limited hours get old fast. Tips vary depending on what location you work at/drive thru. Free tuition at ASU with their program means its hard to complain about what isn't so great.
good,I was fun work at starbucks. all staff was fun. customer always right and staff can handle with the good attitude of the customer. im quit as barista cause i need a new experience
good,very quick paced job always have to reevaluate a situation on your toes very fun environment to work in as long as you have a solid manager and team behind you. Great for college students or anyone in need of a flexible schedule!
good,"I love working at Starbucks, great company wish i got paid more and wish that i got treated better by my partners . i worked hard and didn't get appreciated more."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. Of course there were customers who were unbelievably rude, but then there were regulars who would always make my day as well. Same with coworkers. You definitely need to be able to move at a fast-pace and be able to multitask so many different things at once, but it's nothing that isn't possible. The discounts are amazing and there's a lot of random perks from the job. The company treats its partners OUTSTANDING compared to a lot of other ""part-time"" jobs. It's a really flexible job, with great benefits, tips every week, all things that helped make it a perfect job for me in college. I was able to work at Starbucks, work on campus, take on more than full-time units, and spend time with my little family. I would definitely go back to working at Starbucks if I ever need to."
good,I loved this please it helped me start my growth in customer service and hospitality I would recommend this job for any student or person looking to start a good career
good,Working at Starbucks was as stressful as any customer service job. It was relatively fun and easy because you could be creative if you wanted to. A lot of times our recourses were stretched thin and we had to make do with what we had which resulted in poor results.
good,"love my coworkers and my customers!!"
good,"Great place to work, especially for people going to school. Good environment and flexible hours. Learn to multitask and as well as communicate with customers."
good,"I applied for this job as an in-between on the search for something better later on. But, quickly I found that the culture was enjoyable and fun! I am a big lover of coffee and this was a perfect way to try out new things. In terms of my location, I worked in a small, but fast-paced and high maintenance store. "
good,"I learned a lot of management skills, How to handle a team while being in charge. A typical workday could be very fast paced or pretty slow depending on the say"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you love coffee, which I did! The company stands for making a great coffee beverage from the best ingredients."
good,The people you work with is what will make or break this job. Its a fun place to be. They are more strict on cleanliness than other jobs. Most managers are great but some managers are bad there is very few but they still exist. I would not recommend this job if you do not like people because everyone must interact with the customers we are the welcoming third place.
good,"While I worked at Starbucks, I greatly enjoyed the customers and fellow employees that became a second family to me. The culture that Starbucks provided encouraged people to come in through the door and make our store their ""third place."""
good,"Los días en el trabajo eran muy buenos, me gustaba mucho ya que hablaba con personas de otros países, me gustaba preparar café, la razón por la cual salí fue por seguridad y distancia pero a excepción de eso todo lo demás muy bien."
good,"Great place to work, I love the culture, meeting different people and learning the history of coffee and teas was nice, highly recommend working for starbucks"
good,Amazing place to work with great benefits Starbucks is my second home you have the ability of picking up hours at other stores that need the assistance
good,"great company to work for. fun environment , easy-going team. lots of perks. flexible schedule. opportunity to grow. overall good experience and skills to take with you."
good,Starbucks treat their partners with a great deal of respect.  I left a great job at Starbucks for a very poor job at Stop & Shop for what were empty promises.  I would happily work at Starbucks again if given the opportunity.
good,"I love Starbucks, all my co-workers knew each others names even the new people. Always friendly smiling faces walking about. Just a good space to be to relax and unwind."
good,It was a great experince. They worked very well with my school schedule and I am grateful for that. They were very friendly and i learned alot about customer service. I also learned alot abouit patience.
good,"İş yükü çok, mağazanın yoğun olmasına rağmen çok zevkli bir çalışma dönemiydi. Tek sorun maaaşının düşük olmasıydı. Onun dışında işin kendisi, iş ortamı, yöneticiler çok iyiydi."
good,"The work was really easy although faced paced, I enjoyed the different tasks available and my coworkers were friendly. I would definitely say that if you have the opportunity to work at more than one location, that you do so."
good,Some days were busy and others were not. I loved working with my crew. It is typically a positive atmosphere with lots of team building with coworkers. The hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers.
good,"I worked at Starbucks inside Kroger from March 2018 to August 2018 before I moved residences. I loved it. It is a fast-paced environment, but it was very fun."
good,Everyone has an assigned position to keep things clean and ready for helping customers. Some positions will be suited for different people but other positions will help from other positions if possible.
good,Stressful at times but the busy environment seems to make the work day go by quickly. The hours are very flexible so great for college students like myself.
good,Fun and engaging workplace. Benefits are out of this world because the company knows how to treat its employees. This is a place for potential career growth.
good,"I LOVED working for Starbucks in Seattle. The company mission is what drives the actions for everyone from baristas to managers. Working at Starbucks in another state was not the same experience, they are just too far from the heart of the company to have the same passion and dedication (although only 8 hours drive apart)."
good,"I started at Starbucks when I was 20 and left right after I turned 26. Starbucks gave me the chance to grow as a person, develop great communication skills, as well as, give me the opportunity to receive my Bachelor's degree debt free! I have nothing bad to say about the company at all! The skills and values I learned at Starbucks helped mold me into the adult I am now!"
good,"I loved my job and coworkers. I had great hands on shift managers and co workers. I did not how ever like working with the store manager she was always late, called in sick and did not will out our orders or schedules correctly resulting in a lack of staff and a lack of product at our store. I did how ever love every other part of the job fast paced fun co workers and new people to greet everyday."
good,"It’s super fun. Like all jobs, it can be stressful. Other than an hour or so in the morning, it’s super great! You get a 30% with your partner numbers, three free drinks (30 minutes before and after, and during breaks), you get at least one 10 minute break on a four hour shift. 6+ hours has a 10 minute and a lunch (30 minutes). You get one 10 min every 2 hours. When I moved to here, I felt so pampered! Like wow so many breaks! They also really care about you and being more of a family than a work place. Everyone is super nice and smiley!!"
good,"I've never felt so connected to my coworkers than through working at a Starbucks, i've met some of my best friends, and i haven't met a coworker i didn't like.  It is easy to butt heads with people since you are in such close proximity, but its almost always quickly resolved. making connections with regular customers is a real treat too, those people make my day. Benefits while working for Starbucks are absolutely unlike any other company i have ever worked for, sick days and healthcare are available at 20 hours- which is unheard of. The only real draw back is hourly pay is terrible, and promotion feels almost impossible. They prefer to hire management from the outside, instead of promoting within."
good,"Typically I had a shift management position but without the title. I did inventory and helped others with the tips, I also made beverages and it is very fun for me. The job have some down moments, which is the pay that each employee deserves or work hard for."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work.  It also prepares you for a fast paced working environment.  It also teaches you how to multi-task and helps with your memory.
good,"A lot to learn at first, but was a very fun job to have.  I loved my coworkers, my management team, and felt like I was valued as a worker.  I would have loved to stay, but needed to relocate for college.  I hated leaving that job, as my coworkers had become a kind of family."
good,good place to work and meet new people the hours are changing every week one week you could be in the high 30s and the next week in the teens but its easy to get shifts and get those hours up fast paced and very customer first great company to work for out of high school and or in college they work around most schedules
good,Son flexibles con los horarios de estudio. Todo bien
good,"The people are great and the benefits are full fledged, I only leave because of the lack of IT based positions in my area, if I could I would love to stay with this company."
good,shifts range from 4 am-9:30 pm depending on what you need. Free food & drink item each schedule & one free bag of coffee a week. 30% discount on everything
good,"A day at Starbucks is quick paced, multitasking, taking care of customers and of course your team members! Its a great place to start and always warm and welcoming. They live to their determination for it be to the ""third place"" in everyone's life."
good,"Starbucks offers important benefits to its partners. I am a mother and a shift supervisor so receiving health care coverage for me and my daughter is beneficial. Starbucks is also invested in Stocks which allows partners to cash out their stocks every November. As a partner of the Starbucks corporation, I recommend this job to anyone. Students benefits from Starbucks as well because they are flexible with the schedule."
good,"treats employees very well great environment and great staff and management. Flexibility, free drinks and food on every shift. Free coffee to take home etc."
good,"I loved that every day your role could be different, you don't feel like you're stuck at one thing for the rest of your time here. I love that Starbucks takes care of their employees, they want you to have a life, give back to your community but I do wish I could work more and advance faster."
good,Starbucks is a great starter job to have. They provide good benefits and the flexibility to do whatever else you want to do while being there. They are an ideal spot for those in college or those who just need a part-time job while maybe leveraging another job.
good,"I had no complaints, it was a bit of a drive which caused me to change jobs sadly. However I did fully enjoy working there, and the people I worked with were very nice."
good,It was great while I was in college. I enjoyed the customers and the employees. The pay very well considering your other options to work in the area. Must be flexible.
good,I briefly worked at Starbucks. During my time there I was promoted once and had a promising future (according to my district manager). I had to leave due to the little pay. I am a single mother with childcare to pay for. Unfortunately don't receive anything for child support so it wasn't enough to sustain us.
good,"Extremely customer service oriented, when partners work well together the shift runs smoothly, new promotions drinks and deals are usually easy to remember and promote to customers."
good,Find your niche and work at your own pace. It would definitely change your outlook as a customer. Especially if your one to buy off the secret menu. It’s will humble you.
good,"I imagine it may have a lot to do with the fact that I was a temp filling in for someone, but they gave me a lot of freedom in deciding how I went about accomplishing the tasks given to me each day. "
good,I enjoyed working in the work place. A typical day at work was always fun. I learned a lot more about coffee and tea then I would have ever imagined. Most of the management was great while others not so much.
good,Starbucks is an entertaining place to work. It couples sales with fun in a nice ambiance. Starbucks provided me with a way to grow and understand how to handle sales in a fast paced environment.
good,"I grew at Starbucks, from a Barista to a Shift Supervisor..I learned to make sure our customers were satisfied. Even if that meant going out of my way to fix whatever the issue may be, small or big."
good,Everyone super friendly and ready to work. It’s always good to come in with a smile and greet every coworker!ive enjoyed working there and still do! It’s not really a job you get tired of going to.
good,"A life at work is a learning experience each day that goes by, meeting new people from different backgrounds, sharing knowledge and skills. At Starbucks, I have learned that for you to sit there and enjoy a hot cup of coffee, it goes way back, starting from the small and large scale farmers in different regions. form the weather, the climate, the altitude, all these elements directly affect the taste of coffee. that's sometimes you will taste coffee as caramelly, chocolatey, citrus and so on. the list is endless. all these I have learned from my experience with Starbucks."
good,"Great benefits, great policies, great staff. I would work for Starbucks again in a heartbeat. Starbucks is a company that actually cares for its employees"
good,Everyone was very nice and easy going. I really enjoying my co workers and manager. I only worked 4 weeks there due to the fact it was a work experience but I would definitely work there again!!
good,At Starbucks yes it can be a stressful job but they do try to take care of their employees the best they can. There are so many different programs that they have to be able to help their baristas at work and also at home as well
good,"Starbucks cares about its employees, internally called ""partners"". If you work a minimum of 20 hours a week, you are qualified to have health benefits, life insurance, and much more. As soon as you are hired, you are automatically an investor in the company - you are given stocks every year you work with them."
good,"Such an awesome place to work! I love that it feels like a team, family atmosphere whenever I'm here. I feel so welcome and coming to work is fun and fast paced rather than going somewhere I dread every hour that I work there."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to get your feet wet. It is also a place for advancement as well, so if you're looking to grow in the coffee business, then it's definitely a great company to work for. You learn a lot about the way the company is run and can really implement it into your own business if you are looking to do so. You will meet some great people and make really good connections. It truly is an up and down, but overall fun experience!"
good,"I had three separate management teams, due to transferring locations. I did not like 2/3 of them. On the third management team, I hit the jackpot. I was contemplating working literally anywhere else before her. I worked another year there happily under her. "
good,"Definitely a first time job for any new adult. This is Starbucks at the airport and not a corporate Starbucks. The benefits were great and the union was available when needed. (Which was rare, the company is great to work for)"
good,My time at Starbucks was fantastic. My coworkers became a family and we were all able to delegate when help was needed. The manager was very kind and knew what we needed as a team.
good,"The role as Barista at Starbucks is a job alot of people love the sound of, and it is an amazing job when studying or working part time. The hours are mostly quite flexible, the pay is average and the opportunity to make friends is really great."
good,Employees are treated fairly and kindly. Most coworkers are helpful and easy to get along with. Dress code is pretty easy to follow and pretty comfortable.
good,starbucks was great i enjoyed working for th company. I enjoyed making drinks and the people i made them with. kjndiaisdjnakjsdniASJNDJKandjANSDKJSNaskdhSJFNkj
good,A typical day at work was always busy. I quickly learned to multitask and how to satisfy guest as fast and friendly as possible. I learned how to effectively communicate with guests as well as my team members. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we were running low on items and had to quickly know how substitute using other items while trying to not upset a guest. The most enjoyable part was the therapeutic feeling of hand crafting beverages and working with my cooperative team members.
good,The one big thing i took from working at starbucks was knowing how to work well with others and offering great customer service to all guests who walked into our stores.
good,"it was fun, fast paced, and enjoyable. "
good,It was a great place to learn a lot about ones self. It helped me to come out of my shell and feel appreciated with all the people I worked with. It gave me a strong work ethic and a mind of learning.
good,"Starbucks is hard, but once you get used to it its a lot of fun, I worked with a lot of cool people, and I learned a lot from them. It's tiring (especially in the morning."
good,I love working for Starbucks. They care about their employees and there is room for growth and advance. They offer employees insurance even if you work as few as 20 hours per week.
good,"I love Starbucks as a company, and couldn't be more proud of their culture. They offer an open welcoming place for everyone alike. The benefits can't be beat. As a salaried manager, I am not required to have a degree or work more than 40 hours. The work-life balance far exceeds that of many other retail salaried positions, relative to the needs of your store at any given time. Full healthcare benefits are offered to all partners who work an average of 20 hours per week. The company also grants us stock every year with a 1-year rolling vesting period at zero cost to us. The work is sometimes physically exhausting/demanding which can be difficult over time. However, working at Starbucks has been the best decision in my career thus far!"
good,"Great place to work. Hardest part was waking up early to open the store, but there's coffee- it's not so bad. Highly recommend- enjoyed my time there."
good,"Good cultured and warm surroundings. I love working here but the hardest part is busy hours when there is no breaks and it gets pretty stressful. There is certain workers at every job site that get a little ""too serious"" and tend to act angry towards others. Besides that, pleasant place to work and pleasant people to work with on a daily basis. Although, hours and money is critical and this job is mostly a great job for younger adults."
good,"The typical day at work is that when you show up there are many things needing to be down. Bar will always need more milk, lids, cups, or ice. There is almost always someone needing to prepare the store for the next day and for the morning staff. The biggest thing you will have to learn is task management like deciding what needs most doing. And the culture is often one of being nice and helpful."
good,Starbucks is a pretty easy job once you know how to make drinks and where everything is at. Depending on your manager the work environment will either be fun or you wont want to come to work
good,Productive and welcoming workplace environment. I work with a fantastic team and every store I pick up shifts are incredibly welcoming. I have learned many social and multi-tasking skills. The hardest part of my job is insuring people have a good experience in 50 seconds. The most enjoyable part of my day is my regular customer and the connection I have with them.
good,My work involved configuring internet access for cup labeling machines after calling stores and verifying the equipment in each store. We would remote access the back office computer and then apply subnet mask and other configuration to each device. Our team called eery store in North America.
good,I would make sure the management is good before you start working there because the management that was with me always seemed to cut my hours and she never did any work.
good,Starbucks was a welcoming job that inadvertently taught me a lot about business and proper customer service. This fast paced work environment allowed me the opportunity to work directly with the public as well as learn how to manage inventory.
good,"only needed the job for a few months to pay off a credit card. Would work here again with higher pay, good company to work for, I always tell anyone looking for a job they should work for Starbucks. If I ever need a job outside my field I love, I will absolutely go back"
good,"Starbucks Philippines is where I found high standard in terms of service and an amazing family at workplace. I was hired for the Christmas season where it is expected to be the most busy time of the year since it is the popular time for ""Starbucks Planner"" sticker collection. I have experienced a never ending queue everyday and that exciting moments when we first greet everyone coming inside the store, patiently wait in the queue,get their best interest of our items,call for the customer's drink and hand them over with great enthusiasm. This experienced is exactly I will define as  ""work-under pressure"" as I remember I started doing blended beverages but also ended up learning hot bar whilst also doing pastry or working at our personal cash registry whilst doing pastry and also trying to sell-out merch and other promotional stuffs and switch over other necessary task. I would say that in general it was great, amazing, diverse kind of work place."
good,Few changes needed but overall a general good place to work. Good job security and plenty of chances to progress. Would not discourage someone from applying for a job here as the people I work with are good hard working people that enjoy a laugh at the same time. Thus creating a fun place to be during the shift
good,"Excellent company to work for if you don't mind a stressful job. Starbucks is open seven day a week, three hundred and sixty five day per year.  You don't get pay for holidays, but you get time and a half if you work on a holiday"
good,"Very rewarding but be ready to work hard and clean a lot.  Fun work environment with great staff.  Job includes; cleaning, making drinks, providing friendly customer support, and being quick and efficient with everyday tasks."
good,"I am truly appreciative of my experience as a Barista,being a Barista I have earned an exceptional amount of knowledge based around coffee brewing, quality customer service, and being able to accurately complete a variety of tasks in a timely fashion in a fast pace environment."
good,Fun & energetic lifestyle with customers & coworkers. Management could have been a bit better when it came to certain situations. For example having product knowledge was on of the major issues I had with management. There was some favoritism unfortunately but I was able to still keep composure past it.
good,"Starbucks was always a fun & fast paced environment. I learned some many things about coffee that I had no idea about. As a supervisor I learned a lot about money management, guiding the work of others, deploying employees, and how to manage a schedule."
good,"I had an incredible time working at Starbucks. I met great friends behind and across the counter, had mostly good days at work. Working the morning shift can be very intense, and depending on team work can go smoothly, or can crash and burn. But with great leadership, working at Starbucks has been an great experience for me. They provide wonderful benefits that you can't find with other part time jobs like it. They are flexible with work load, and you can progress as much as you want."
good,"Day to day operations were pretty much the same, just different customers. really enjoyed the people worked with. They were a great team and very nice people."
good,"typical day was mainly just getting the usual things on the list done, like bathrooms and making sure everything is stocked, cleaned, sanitized, scrubbed and most of all refrigerated. sometimes the managers don't always notice right away or notice in time because of the fact they go on a schedule when to check the thermometers so sometimes you will stick your hand in the fridge and its slightly warm. other than that the good and the bad customers on daily, along with another daily shenanigan, something someone amongst the workers do to get everyone a good laugh. need it at Starbucks. management is good all depending on where u are, u got a problem take it up to higher part of the ladder and usually things fall into place as they should. most enjoyable parts were the hardest parts because there were sometimes u wanna just go nuts with the topings or the whip cream canisters lol. resisting the urge is the funnest but yet the hardest part of the job. the suspense!"
good,"My typical duties were to clock in, clean and restock after the morning shift people, which usually there was a lot to do since they were the busiest shift. Once they left it was my task to juggle drinks, and cleaning at the same time. Outside of that I regularly stocked basic things like silverware, coffee beans, and other drink mixing ingredients."
good,The management has always been helpful and friendly. The opportunity to advance is fast paced if you apply yourself. Overall this would be a good company to work for.
good,"Love working at Starbucks, but the hourly pay is terrible.  Benefits are great, and that's the reason I stay there.  I get full benefits at 20 hours a week.  I love my customers!"
good,"Working at Starbucks is rewarding and fast-paced, and is an excellent choice for both college students and anyone looking for a dependable long-term job. "
good,"It really it the best company to work for. I love my management team and all the resources given to us to connect with others around the country. A very diverse environment, very open to people of all walks of life."
good,Everyone that you work with is like family and patrons that come in are a lot like friends. You get a free pound of coffee a week. Fun place to work. Ambiance is nice. They will pay for your education.
good,Respectable clientele and nice atmosphere. The job was engaging. The management was respectful and kind and willing to help. Higher up managers would always check in and get to know you and encourage you.
good,"Starbucks es una empresa en la que da gusto ir a trabajar, el ambiente es cálido y siempre todos tus partners intentan ayudarte. Es una empresa en la que se preocupan por sus empleados."
good,Beautiful company Great job to move up in. Company fail stop hiring outside managers from fastfood restaurants. Promote more baristas to management they know much more about the company as a machine than corporate. They're on the ground they should be running things.
good,"Who doesn't love coffee, let alone Starbucks? Starbucks is definitely a day starter. Customers come to Starbucks to start their day with freshly brewed coffee so its fairly busy in the morning. Considering the location of the specific Starbucks I work in though, we are way less busy than the stores in Manhattan, however business is always there. Working at Starbucks the first couple of weeks was a challenge. There are so many intricate names and you have to remember how to make drinks but it's easier once you get used to the system. I notice that Starbucks is a very diverse franchise as well. There is not just one particular group of people you see. One of most enjoyable part of the job is hearing customers say ""Wow you know my name!"" It keeps them feeling warm, welcome and wanted and one of the principles of working at Starbucks is getting to know the customers... ESPECIALLY if they're a regular customer. Customer satisfaction is always guaranteed at Starbuck's."
good,everyday is all about coffee.i have learn a lot about coffee knowledge and now i am a coffee lover.working in store is more tired but at the end still enjoy it.
good,"I absolutely love working at Starbucks. I haven't left yet, but I'm currently looking for a ""grown up"" job which I will leave Starbucks for. Honestly though I could go on for hours about how great of a company it is. They're LGBTQIA+ friendly (you can change your name on the registers AND schedule if you go by something other than your birth name!!), you're allowed to have colored hair and tattoos and piercings (though if it's a nose piercing or something similar you have to wear studs, but still, that's allowed!), and their dress code is really chill. As long as you wear mostly plain clothes that are earth/natural tones, they don't care too much what you wear. The only uniform requirement is the apron."
good,The work environment at Starbucks is excellent.  The teams are enthusiastic to help one another at getting things done.  I find that to be very important.  There are challenges but work flow and support is always good.
good,"Fun, and busy work environment, great customers and amazing partners to work with. Company has very good benefit plans, stocks, and a partner discount for everyday use."
good,"Really great atmosphere to work with, all the employees were very nice and easy to get along with. Most customers were very nice and respectful and although the store could get busy it was always manageable with the team. The free beverages while working is definitely an added bonus."
good,"Its honestly amazing to work for starbucks. You learn a lot of skills and is a great introduction to the fast paced workplace. Its challenging at first but it gets better, because you get better."
good,"Starbucks has good roots that makes for a good company. at the heart of the company they care."
good,"You most likely will not have a ""typical day"" at work as it seems to be always changing due to customer demand mostly. It also depends on what time of the day you plan on working as there are different tasks to preform in the morning and evening. Overall great place to work."
good,"Got to meet many new people everyday, plus had my regulars. I enjoyed working with my team, they worked hard but also made it entertaining most of the time."
good,"What a time. Starbucks has definitely been my favorite job thus far. I thrived on the hectic morning rushes, whether I was making drinks or taking orders. My coworkers were a lot of fun and kept me from stressing when the line was out the door. I would highly recommend this job to anyone. It paid well and I got to meet pro from all walks of life."
good,"The customers were great, but how the other baristas treated someone new to working is not okay where I use to work. it was a toxic environment that was making it hard to work in."
good,"So, it was a really great place to work, but the pay does not match the workload for the SM role.  Also, they don't extend any discounts for drinks to spouse/ partners"
good,"While the monetary compensation is perhaps a bit lower than is ideal for managing to pay all of the bills human incur and still being able to live a little, the benefits are encompassing and fairly easy to maintain eligibility for. Work is rapid fire and customer oriented, which means it can be by turns easy and an exercise in frustration. Merchandise and food discounts are fairly good."
good,"Starbucks is everything I've ever wanted in a responsible/caring company.  HOWEVER, they need to STOP bringing in leadership from other companies that don't value the same culture of connecting with people first."
good,Great experience in managing time for customers order and prepartion of the drink and foods within short duration.Flexibility working any shifts be it a early morning or closing shift.
good,"The culture of Starbucks has always been a friendly, customer oriented environment. I am happy to have been part of such an amazing, positive team that worked together to provide unforgettable customer interaction. Coffee was a gate way to talking to others and getting to know a variety of different people and age groups throughout the day."
good,I loved my job. It was stressful sometimes but it was a nice job. The hardest part of my job was the people sometimes it was hard to help everyone. We always had fun together though.
good,When it comes to being a barista you have to be create. Customer appreciate that way you will have regulars. They will know your smile and they can taste the love you put in every drink.
good,Very fast paced and you have to be willing to work hard. Time management is key to ensure your work is completed for the next barista. Work hard and do your best.
good,"Worked there with no prior barista experience.  My managers encouraged me and invited me to learn more about what being barista has to offer.  Because of this encouragement, I was able to build a better network of people and establish social skills and make friends with different people over our mutual interest of a specific blend or flavors.  This, along with better timing of beverages to make sure to serve nothing but quality products."
good,"This was absolutely my most favorite job that I've ever had. At my first location, everybody was a friend, the regulars were cheerful, and the managers were simply the best! But after I transferred to a new location, the employees didn't talk to each other and the general manager was loathed by the whole crew and he cut the hours that he promised me. In the end, still a super, super fun job, but you should preview how the crew interacts before committing to a location."
good,I feel working at Starbucks changed my view of how respectful people take us with handling the care of a beverage they are Starbucks is great ..you should really work there.
good,Working at Starbucks is fun and a great place to work part time. The benefits are great and being part of the Starbucks culture is something I will never forget.
good,"Absolutely loved my time at Starbucks! Progressive company, very health conscious options. All employees are required to know nutritional facts on items. Really quickpaced but adaptable."
good,"Respetan siempre tus horarios de estudio, es rotativo y part time, muy buen clima laboral, en constante crecimiento y aprendizaje."
good,Love working for Starbucks  great work force fast pace .. very skilled organization help when needed .. will send a lot of people to work here if you interested
good,"As a barista, in a typical day of work, I would be expected to craft food and beverages, clean the store, maintain stock, create saleable displays for items, and engage with customers on a conversational and professional basis. In my time there, I learned how to keep a business clean and functional, how to count product for order, how to create beverages, and how to properly interact with customers. The workplace culture was incredible, as the coffee industry seems to attract many ""hip"" people. You can really tell that many baristas are extremely passionate about their work. I believe that the hardest part of my job was keeping up with workload in the mornings and at lunch, but it was well balanced by how rewarding it was to really get to know the regular customers."
good,starbucks was my most favorite job until this day the work environment is awesome and my co workers made it to where i couldn't wait to get to work. i was lucky to have an awesome manager at both stores that i worked at who were really flexible with scheduling. it doesn't take long to learn how to make all the drinks i knew how to make most of them within the week asking questions but i had all of them down within 3 weeks with no help.
good,"very busy, fast paced. the culture is different, you learn quite a bit about efficiency. There is a lot of ""partner"" programs for assistance. my manager was great and so was my experience working there."
good,"great company to work for, flexibility in hours and location. easy to simply transfer to another Starbucks for any reason, even if you dont enjoy the environment of a particular one."
good,"Working at starbucks was an enjoyable experience. I loved assisting and getting to know customers as well as working in a team setting. Working in this environment, I’ve gained many well needed customer service skills."
good,"It really depends on the team, but overall it has a very friendly, collaborative environment. Partners are proud of bringing the company's mission and values into life. And everything ends in coffee tastings."
good,Working at Starbucks was not like any other job I've had. The days seemed so fast because of the recurring customers who always came in with a smile. A very Freindly company overall
good,"Aprendes mucho de todos lados hay mucho que conocer ,"
good,"healthy and fun environment to work, we treat each other as family, help is available anytime and we trust each other. Our manager is very easy to approach."
good,"Starbucks taught me how to learn effectively, although the pay is usually minimum wage and slightly more for those in supervisory roles if you're just starting out your career and looking for knowledge then Starbucks is a great place to work. It's not the greatest for those with families simply because the salary does not provide for much more than a single person. The company has high expectations with low pay but the right person with the right attitude would thrive in this environment because you do learn a lot about running a small business (I understand starbucks as a whole is a major company)."
good,"Co workers are cool and relaxed, the job can be a lot during a rush but when it settles down you get, a chance to talk with your co workers, their are training, so you can get to know the company and it’s coffees."
good,"A Typical day at work for me is to do the care minimum within job position standards, which could be completing the shift and afterwards go home. I've gained an enormous amount of customer service skills in this arena of work. I've learned clear, verbal, and communication skills, interacting with others."
good,"It is a energetic, welcoming environment with amazing co-workers. It is a space with room to fail and learn even more and grow your barista skills as well as your social skills."
good,It was a great experience for me. I really enjoyed most of the people I worked with and I really enjoyed the customers and how kind they were. The benefits were such a huge bonus as well.
good,"I've worked at more than one starbucks location and my first store was the best work experience that I've ever had - supportive staff and supervisors, excellent training opportunities, wonderful customer experience, and support from your team when you needed it."
good,I love the environment and getting to know the regulars and hear about their lives. It is such an accepting place to work and hang out. Making peoples day start and end with something delicious and reviving makes the world go round.
good,"My store made the job that much better. the benefits and discounts were awesome. although the job could be stressful when it gets busy, the customers and the people you work with really make a difference"
good,I highly recommend working at Starbucks. I was unfortunately employed under an awful manager who thoughtl harassment was okay. I enjoyed the fast paced environment and everyone else that I worked with and the atmosphere brought with it.
good,"Learned a lot of things such as"
good,Working at Starbucks is a fast paced environment that requires you to work hard and be careful to detail. Working at my store has had its ups and downs but overall was a fun and entertaining environment to work at with very fun people working with me on a daily bases.
good,"Easily the best for-profit company I have worked for.  Good people who care about others and the environment are in charge and that socially conscious mission trickles down into the rest of the corporate environment. I wish the popularity contest could have dissipated a bit, but sometimes that is just part of a corporate environment."
good,"great job for students. easy to work around your school schedule. "
good,Starbucks was a great place to work the only negative was some of the managers were not open minded. Hours are flexible and you can ofter change shiffts with others to accomadate your schedule.
good,"i overall loved the company. it was fun, although i left due to personal reasons.i liked being able to talk to customers daily, and the ability to chose which day part you worked."
good,"I have worked with Starbucks as a Licensed Store Manager for 7 years. I loved working for Starbucks I feel it is an amazing company. Being in a licensed store is a big difference, since you have another company or private party in charge of your day to day decisions, but Starbucks was worth it."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work. Starbucks is easy to have fun at while working, and it's rewarding to make customers smile. Starbucks teaches many life skills."
good,Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs I ever had.  I loved meeting new people and interacting with customers.  My co-workers were also my friends.  Free coffee and benefits were pretty cool too.
good,"Working at Starbucks was in the least, a great experience for me. I learned so much just in the training process. I learned about the origins of Starbucks coffee, why they choose it, and the differences between coffee all over the world. I learned how to multi-task and work with a like-minded team. I worked in all three locations we had in the airport, so at times for me, it did get hectic but I love the rush. I love how Starbucks always makes sure you know everything about what you're doing so that conversation or help needed from a customer is so much easier and a lot less stressful. I recommend working at Starbucks all the time. It's a great place for advancement and growth Thank you :)"
good,"Travail dans une ambiance familiale et souder."
good,"Starbucks has been a great place to work. Although the job is fast-paced, it is always lively, and keeps you on your toes. The company itself has been wonderful, they care about their partners (employees) and make working for them an enjoyable experience. I've learned a lot since I started working at Starbucks, met great people, customers and fellow partners, and appreciate how much Starbucks cares."
good,"Fast pace, the best part is we all work as a team to get the job done. I've learned so many new drinks working there but all my partners help me if I ever have a question."
good,"For young people or food service pros, Starbucks has a great culture, tons of locations and a fun but fast-paced workflow. Would recommend to anyone looking for a job to get through school or get management experience!"
good,"Starbcuks takes alot of care for the people they work with and serve too. It does take alot of time to focus on at first, but once you get along with everyone and understand everything working here is so much fun and easy."
good,"Starbucks is a fun and easy entry level job. We deal with some hour cuts regularly, but its a fun job and good skill to have. It is very fast paced and can ben stressful at times but it is easy."
good,Good atmosphere with hands on training. Great career to learn the basics of the food industry. Good advancement opportunities and a great way to obtain valuable customer service skills.
good,"I began working here this September and I love the environment. At times it can be stressful, as I work at a university and every shift we get huge rushes that can last for a while. I have learned how to multitask as well as handle stress under pressure. I love interacting with the customers."
good,I worked at starbucks but under safeway company so therefore i got paid weekly & my uniform was all black with black shoes. It was fun working at starbucks but it can get busy!
good,"Starbucks as a company takes very good care of their employees. The cafes' are run by different managers so the workplace can vary drastically. Co-workers also make a huge difference. No place is perfect, just keep that in mind."
good,"I started with the company as a barista and was able to work my way up through the ranks in 4 years. The company and management are very committed to developing it's employees and enjoys promoting from with-in."
good,"A very challenging but rewarding place to work. There are abundant learning experiences, perhaps the most rewarding being the chance to work with the public. If you enjoy talking to people, and like the idea of crafting amazing beverages then this if a great place to work."
good,"It's a everyday learning to the barista in day to day basis. It has a fun and friendly workplace environment. The company treated all the employee equally, the most enjoyable part of my job is to interact with different kinds of people."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for people who are looking for a relatively easy part time job, as well as a place for people interested in moving up to management or corporate positions. Benefits and perks of the job are great."
good,Busy almost everyday. Made great connections with coworkers and customers. The customers can be a huge handful and do not know how to respect others at times but my regulars are what make me love my job.
good,Working at Starbucks is extremely satisfying. The work environment that is created through the store manager is extremely positive and motivating. I highly recommend working with this company
good,"Each day I have new experience, and enjoy it . I learned how to communicate with people during their coffe time , I usually get them order and listening to them and make it ready and during make a coffe I start talking to them, "
good,"but the customers can be terrible.  I like the focus on education, and the flexible hours.  The best part of working at starbucks is the endless clients you get to meet and connect with."
good,I worked for Starbucks for years and loved it. They have excellent benefits and they really do care about their employees. I always consider going back just because of how fun it was.
good,"All the perks are awesome as a partner, just barista pay is minimal, and you start to rely a lot on what you make on tips, if it was a good week. The team I work with are easy-going yet focused on the work. You make a lot of friends in this job with who you work with. "
good,"I absolutely love working at Starbucks! I go to work before the sun is up with a smile on my face everyday! Only down fall is finding a location your personality matches, every store is different. They want you to take the time to connect with guests and give them a genuine experience which is a lot easier in a cafe store but drive-thrus get more babies and puppies to interact with (my favorites!). Every day is a new adventure guaranteed to make you laugh!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to build teamwork. Starbucks company is very flexible with working around the hrs you are available for. This company helps and encourage, strong leadership skills, as well as being very sale drivin. It's a company that teaches you legendary customer service, and also helps build multi tasking skills."
good,"At starbucks warehouse the people were fun to work around everyday it was a competition to see who would pick the most cases for the whole or hour.. I loved that the company appreciated the workers by giving gift cards to you in your family in also money.. Although everyday was real busy, the people around you made it fun.."
good,I have an awesome team and boss.  I came to Starbucks for the ethics and standards the company aims for and I got that.  I love the teams ability to pull together and create a fun environment
good,Starbucks is by far the best place I have ever worked The management is very supportive when interest is expressed in career advancement and they are willing to take the time to train aspiring managers and supervisors.
good,With Starbucks its easy to always have a smile on your face and make someones day just by making small talk. The days fly by within the fast paced environment.
good,"Great place to work. There is a lot of talk about advancement but very few opportunities to move up. I saw many promising employees of 10 plus years get passed over to someone being hired outside of the company."
good,"Working part-time or full time this is wonderful organization. The environment is fast paced, but relaxing. Opportunity for advancement and very competitive pay/benefits."
good,"I love the atmosphere thats created for both customers and employees. Its always comfortable and amiable. "
good,"Starbucks takes really good care of their partners. Where else do you get stock options for working 20 hours a week? The schedule can be a bit wonky - closing one night and then back to work at 6am the following morning.That said, it is a good place to work."
good,Working for this company was very fun. Being with co-workers and talking to the customers was not stressful at all. When a customer was unhappy we'd be quick to fix the problem right there and then. Creating beverages was one of the best experiences of my life.
good,"Being a popular company, you as a barista got to become familiar with the customers, building a bond with them. You also learned the power behind teamwork. Without a strong team, the job would be near impossible."
good,"The Starbucks experienced I received came from the contractor HMSHost at Denver Int'l Airport. They weren't exactly run like a regular Starbucks.  Though they have the same standards in drinks and the Starbucks vision, it failed when management could not make up their mind as to what they wnated the store to become. For having a pretty high turn over rate because of management, it was a great place to work when the team clicked. Even if it was 90 transactions every half hour, it went by well when we followed what Satrbucks had originally taught us. The company is amazing, the management at that store at the time was poor."
good,It's fast paced and rewarding. Lots of opportunities to learn more about your craft. It has a great work culture. It can get stressful when it's busy.
good,This was one of the best places to work. I did not want to leave when I did. The only reason that I did was because I had a new job opportunity that I did not expect from another company.
good,"Everyday was enjoyable. The customers I took care of a got to know. The people I worked with, one co worker and I even pushed each other to excel in service and speed. It was fun and relaxing and had healthy competition."
good,"Depending on your boss, great work-life balance, pays for asu, benefits, customers are amazing, stressful at times but worth it. Coworkers definitely make it an enjoyable workplace."
good,"it was a cool experience , but so face paced, took some time to get the hang of rhings for me but i like the people i worked with. i realized i wanted a job that was paying more so my time there was short"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks and I had a hard time leaving the company."
good,"Working at Starbucks is hard work, but because of the culture and atmosphere, it's also a fun place to work. Excellent benefits, very flexible schedule and room to advance and/or relocate."
good,"If you want to go to college, ASU makes Starbucks the perfect job for you. 100% reimbursement. You just can't beat it. I just graduated with my BA in Liberal Studies. It wouldn't have been possible without my time at Starbucks."
good,"Great benefits, great company but hard work. Lots of things to remember but a good challenge. Big disconnect from corporate to the small stores. Good upward mobility in the company."
good,Starbucks is the perfect place to work for a person looking for a challenging fast paced work environment.  Starbucks is a demanding physical job that really teaches one to socialize professionally and multi-task at an expert level.  Advancement is always an option and Starbucks has a wonderful reputation for transparency and worker equity.  All viewpoints are respected and welcome at Starbucks and a culture of diversity is encouraged.  You will be challenged to think three steps ahead and you will be asked to step outside your comfort zone but you will be rewarded with employment by a company that truly sees and respects its employees.
good,"Having a customer facing job, made for a great opportunity to build relationships with customers and develop a strong skill in customer service. It allowed me to learn how to work in a team, I had the opportunity to travel around branches to train newer members of staff and get involved in the community providing support to local charities."
good,"Base de satrbucks son sus colaboradores, es importante que estenos bien para asi dar exelentes resultados, el  trabajo nos permite conocer a nuestros clientes hasta llegas hacer amitad con ellos por  la frecuencia en la que nos visitan."
good,"Starbucks employees should be making 15.00/hr to start because of how knowledgeable and technically capable people expect you to be. However, when you get some college-age kid who just needs a job for some cash, no amount of training or connecting is going to persuade him to sweep or mop when he could just as easily be paid to stand around and talk."
good,This is a good place to work for a short time. The benefits are great and decent vacations and nice work environment. Management could be a little better. The most enjoyable part of the work are partners and customers.
good,"I very much loved my job at Starbucks. I found it had the right amount of passion and hard workmanship. It was a job that if you applied your self and were diligent you would get a lot of joy and self-satisfaction out of the job. Persons that work there are taught early on to find a strong personal involvement with the product, and I think that translates exceptionally to the overall ethic and quality of employee."
good,there so much to do you need to have your head in the game to work there there no time to play when it busy and work needs to be done people want to get in get there order and go to work
good,"I grew up in this company. I worked really hard and was able to begin my career there. The culture and philosophy is inspiring. A typical day at work includes miscellaneous admin, working on bar, brewing coffee, point of sale, cleaning, and inventory. The hardest part of the job is finding a work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is....all of it. It's an amazing job."
good,This has been my favorite out of all my jobs. I loved this place! The atmosphere and the customers were amazing. Overall this job was great! Starbucks is awesome!
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is challenging at times however it is also rewarding due to interacting with so many different people. The hardest part of the job would be adjusting to interacting with so many different people, however, this is the most rewarding part of the job as well as you meet interesting individuals on a daily basis."
good,"I learned a lot at starbucks both as personally and professionally. It's a high paced environment with a lot to learn both off the bat and as you continue with the company."
good,"Customer service is key. Very high paced work environment. The store is always busy with something to do. Must be a good multi-tasker. Work consisted of prepping, cleaning, customer service, and making drinks."
good,Working at starbucks got me ready for the real world. Overall it was fast paced and very stressful. I got tired of making all those drinks everyday and I couldn't stand it anymore. It was overall a good experience
good,I enjoyed my 3:30AM shifts and being able to be off the job when typically everyone is just starting their day. I enjoyed the collaborative team environment and creating delicious drinks for our daily customers.
good,"Team building was wonderful, the training we received on a daily and quarterly basis was phenomenal! The company really invests in the team to train them and make the learning process exciting. I never would've imagined there was so much to know about coffee and tea."
good,Ótima empresa porém gerencia foi desigual com funcionários
good,This was a great job good work environment great coworkers. The only reason I had to leave this job was a shift in management the left me with no other option but to leave.
good,"I loved working at starbucks. The coffee is amazing, the management supports and pushes you to further your career, and the work is not overwhelming. It was a fun and high paced environment but the company really appreciated their employees."
good,"Difficult for advancement if you want to stay within the company. Very fast-paced. Great job security with great benefits. Stressful during the holiday season, and time off is never guaranteed."
good,"i enjoyed working with Starbucks company, i enjoyed the atmosphere and the customers :)"
good,It is a very good company but I just don't want to be doing this for the rest of my life.  Its also a wonderful place to work and they treat their partners very good
good,Love Starbuck's culture. A great place to learn how to multi-task. A typical day at work is making drinks and completing assigned tasks. You will be able to learn how to operate a register and espresso bar. The manager can be flexible with work schedule.Starbuck offers 30% to all their partners as well as a free one pound of espresso bean and/or a box of tea. They also offer free drinks and food for their partners every work day. I would recommend this company to college students.
good,Extremely happy environment and very encouraging team mates. All willing to take the time to hel you learn and succeed. Also a great job to express culinary skills.
good,Fun place to work great people! The benefits are so amazing you can go to college for free free health care and dental a 401k plus you earn stocks! It’s great!
good,Great company to work for.  Provide great benefits.  Excellent starting point or returning to the company.  Wages and benefits are great for those that need them.
good,"Great benefits, great food and beverage perks, good pay, fun environment. They will pay for you to get your bachelors degree online through ASU. Amazing if you are heading into college!!!"
good,"Starbucks benefits are second to none. However, as a store manager, the expectations are very high with less than adequate resources to accomplish those goals. Labor is tight, hours allotted for operations management are ridiculously low. I was told to meet YOY comp goals after a new store opened down the road that was cannibalizing my sales. Store managers are expected to do the role of a barista and shift supervisor 80% of the time while still being the sole store manager in each location."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. A very fun fast paced environment, I loved the chalkenge of quick customer contact.  I equally loved the challenge of the grumpy person, turning their day around by great customer skills.  I loved the benefits Starbucks gave to even the part time employee."
good,Starbucks will always remain a huge part of who I am. After spending over a decade working for Starbucks I can honestly say that I am not only a better worker but also a better human overall. I've met so many amazing people working for Starbucks that that alone makes me always want to go back.
good,"-customer service exactions are high"
good,"When working at Starbuck your day is never boring, or slow. Slow times equal cleaning and prepping for the impending rush. You are constantly learning new drinks and perfecting for ability to make old ones, while quizzing your co-workers and creating drinks for samples to entice customers to buy."
good,Working at starbucks is a fun hard working place where when its down time we have time to play around while making sure everything is together for the rush we will have. It is a diverse work place with many different race working together to meet customers needs in a quick but neatly manner.
good,For people who are ever wondering how to meet anyone or had great coworkers this job could do. Mangers are pretty good with helping you learn the drinks and then your good.
good,"Strong culture of collaboration and passion for the business, but the downside to that is it can be challenging to get decisions made quickly. Can have a variety of careers here."
good,"I absolutly loved working at starbucks. If i didnt have plans to start traveling more and working from home i wouldnt leave. Its a great company.  Scheduling is great, most managers will work with you so it is possible to have a set schedule so its great if you have a second job or if you are in school."
good,"awesome benefits and pay, fun and fast paced environment. Always stayed busy which made the work day fly by.The energy was very high and upbeat, sometimes though the grumpy customers were a little difficult to deal with but nothing i couldn't always find a solution to and send them off with a smile."
good,This job gave me a great foundation in customer service and retail skills. It was my first job and I have coworkers that remained my friends to this day.
good,"Its an okay company. Depending on the location they'll work with your schedule, decent benefits.  "
good,"It's a great place to work in a collaborative environment.  There is ample opportunity to development oneself and others.  The balance that we place on partner, customer, and business is aligned with the company mission and values."
good,"Starbucks is a nice place to work for. My store has a great manager, and the staff is also great. The day-today is basically taking orders, making drinks and  handing out the orders. Sometimes it can be alot especially when there's a lot going on in the store."
good,By far the best workplace with the greatest team.  Blessed with so many wonderful people in the community and received a lot of support.  Wish I had more advancement opportunity.
good,"Every day is busy with any requests, but after working there for a while it becomes easier and the customers are fairly nice. I do not plan on leaving the company anytime soon."
good,"Loved working at Starbucks the company was great and my manager was awesome. The only reason I left was the tip stealing that I was flat out accused of and had detectives at my house, long story short the person that stole them was a shift leader and admitted it, I never got an apology from the DM or GM, my manager haugged me and knew I didn't do it."
good,I loved working for Starbucks. I'm actually applying for a position today. I have worked on and off due to relocating or adding to my family. Love the company!
good,"loved working at starbucks. the hours when i first started were amazing, there was so much to learn and do, i was never bored. it seems like a lot to take in when you start... but i promise you pick it up really fast."
good,Tried to further my career within the company but felt like I was being held back by store managers who didn't want to lose me. I stay with Starbucks because I love what I do but usually end up part time because I feel stuck.
good,"Fun to come to work each day and to work with such lovely partners and have the chance to speak with amazing customers. "
good,Friendly and hardworking environment. You feel like you’re being taken care of and all of your issues are handled properly. Great management and work experience.
good,"The entire experience can entirely vary on where you work and who you work with. In my case it was very fast paced due to being a drive thru store, but overall my staff was reliable which helped with the overwhelming work at times. My manager is one of the best I've ever seen at her job so management was great as well."
good,"Love the atmosphere Starbucks brings, there's nothing like working with people who eventually become friends for life. Great North Star program which amplifies team success."
good,I loved this job without the head management issues. A lot of gossip and rumors about anyone who had things happen in the family or wouldn't stay later than scheduled
good,Great environment for learning and connecting with people. The ability to be creative and fair compensation and benefits opportunities to grow and develop with company
good,Amazing workplace to be in if you love people and enjoy a fast paced environment. The best part of working at Starbucks is getting to know the customers and providing them with exceptional service.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for I just need more hours and pay. I have graduated college and need to find a more suitable job, something that fits in with my degree."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to get involved with!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was amazing. I had a wonderful management team at my location, and I got on well with all my fellow baristas. It's a wonderful place to work, because, even though it's a massive overload when you start working there what with all you need to learn immediately, you get into the hang of things within the first two weeks, and then there's just a comforting routine to follow."
good,"I would highly recommend working for Starbucks.  If not for Hurricane Harvey issues and personnel family issues, I would still be working for this company."
good,The company is one of the best to work for as far as a job goes. They have more benifits than any other company I know of. They have almost always recognized any life partner you choose. They give you a free bachelor degree. They also have adoption assistance. All you can drink while you work. A pound of coffee or a box of tea a week to take home.
good,Starbucks have a lot of room for growth and also very fast paced. You have your down time to cleand and stock and use the rest room and your peak periods were very intense. Very fun to learn about the different types of coffee
good,This was a great job and fun. Meet great people and connected very well enjoyed learning things about my customers. I had several customers that only wanted me to serve them and make there drinks. Made me feel very good that i can provide great customer service. I learned pairing pastries with certain teas and coffees. It wasent just a ordinary coffee shop it was a on hand learning. You was able to work your way up in this buisness.
good,Great place to work. Store manager was one of the best leaders I have ever seen. Fostered a great environment for employees to try and balance work and home life.
good,Starbucks was my favorite place to work and I liked my manager a lot. My coworkers and I became like a family and I enjoyed working with them very much.
good,"This company takes care of its people, you get a significant discount, free food/drinks when you work, paid sick days off as a part time employee and stock/heath benefits as well.  The hardest part is learning all the drinks and unruly customers from time to time but the customers are also the most rewarding part of this job."
good,"Starbucks is not for the faint of heart. It’s a constant fast-paced, high-stress job that requires not only a sense of urgency, but also the ability to multi-task before, during, and after “peak” hours. Team-based environment, and day goes by quickly."
good,"Getting to know customers and their favorite drinks"
good,Wonderful place to work. Brand new Starbucks I was able to be apart of opening. It was also apart of hotel Le  Veque Tower which was also new. Great experience coworkers and managers where awesome. No complaints about working there. Everyone worked great as a team getting things done and helping each other out if needed.
good,"working at Starbucks it was really fun working with my co-worker, meeting new people making new drinks being created with drinks I love the fast working. Also love seeing customer happy even if they are having a bad day"
good,"very vast place to work, must be able to learn things quickly and in a orderly fashion. Must be able to work in a profession manner and well and maintain a friendly relation with customers"
good,"I worked in a variety of locations during my three years, with a variety of complexities and in many different roles.  This job is nothing short of incredible, as long as you're willing to do the work and eat a slice of humble pie now and again.  Great benefits, plenty of advancement opportunities as long as you're willing to do the work and put in the time, and an overall friendly and supportive team of coworkers."
good,Great Company for positions before and after Store Manager. Consistently rated most ethical company. They care about there partners. Great benefits even at part time work.
good,"Great benefits, fun environment to work in, very fast-paced, trainers are usually very attentive and friendly, and company has a good focus on the importance of their partners. Daily and weekly freebies like a free daily food items and drinks and a weekly free pound of coffee are a plus, along with 30% discounts at Starbucks and Teavana."
good,"The company offers many benefits to its partners and advocates for a fun and welcoming work environment. Although stressful at times during rush hours, it's overall a fun and easy place to work."
good,"I worked at a university location which was managed by Aramark. Loved my team and my direct manager. No negatives to say about the company, just wish the baristas could have been paid more."
good,"I love Starbucks and would recommend it to anyone looking for part-time work.  Great benefits for anyone with 20+ hours, their college achievement plan is the best."
good,The people that we work with can make all the difference in the world.  We are always willing to help each other out as much as we can.  Fun but still professional environment.  My manager is willing to help resole an issue with scheduling conflicts and make our environment pleasant.  It can get a little crazy with how busy we can get but we communicate and move our partners around to keep us going through the tough the peak hours.  The partners and management team make it a great place to be.
good,"Working at the second busiest Starbucks in New Jersey was a great challenge. With a major hospital just around the corner and the store conveniently located on a busy street, there was never a moment where we weren't working hard to give customers a great experience. As long as you put in a good shift and work hard, you'll never have any issues. But growing questions from our customers about exotic new flavors and the production of certain goods (i.e. what's made around peanuts) inspired me to research more about what we have and how that impacts the customer's experience. There were many occasions where answering tough questions led the customer to spend more at the store, and trust our knowledge going forward to subsequent interactions."
good,"great benefits, fast paced environment, hard to get bored, enjoyed my time there, easy to move up in positions, great coworkers and work environment ten out of ten would recommend"
good,Brilliant co-workers and work environment. A day at the workplace is always exciting and full of activities to engage in. You receive excellent training in about every task and procedure. Salary could be better but isn't terrible.
good,"I come to work never knowing if I would have to come in early or stay late due to employees not showing up for their shifts, or schedule problems. I was usually at window because one of my strengths is connecting with customers, as well as living up to our motto of making sure every customer leaves happy and satsified. The hardest part of the job is making sure the drinks were perfect because there are standard recipes, but every customer customizes the recipes, so its hard to make sure they like there drink, and making sure it is perfect. The easiest part of my job is connecting with customers and learning their drinks, and the little details about them, and building a relationships."
good,"I enjoyed constantly keeping busy and clean. Whenever you finished one task, you can always get ahead and start another task. I also liked connecting with new customers but also the regulars. Working with a team who enjoy their job makes you enjoy your job."
good,I worked at a starbucks that was inside of Macys. We were often busy and m position was often on cash register. Learning abbreviations for the food and drinks was very challenging but if I had stayed longer I would have gotten it right. We received 2 paid 5 minute breaks if working 6 hours or less. My co-workers were fun and inviting and eager to help.
good,Overall total pay package is great! Take advantge of paid college while you work 20 hours/week and obtain your Bachelors Degree online through Arizon State University. Over 40 online majors to choose from.
good,"I actually really like the company. My manager wasn't the best, but overall the company does care about it's employees and a lot of the time, it's a lot of fun at work/"
good,"Excelente clima laboral, beneficios de bebidas gratuitas, capacitaciones constantes e inspiradoras, ademas de el apoyo constante de los supervisores y cada compañero barista para superarnos uniforme mente."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for providing continual career development opportunities along with excellent benefits! I developed enormously as a person especially in communication and leadership abilities. It is a very fast paced, high-performance culture. Some of the hardest moments have been when we are understaffed and it is therefore hard to go above and beyond in giving excellent customer service or not being able to complete tasks for the next crew coming in. Some of the best moments have been: making a customers day, whether through giving a great beverage or a listening ear; as well as partners supporting and uplifting each other in their positions. Teamwork is highly critical to this kind of environment and is definitely something Starbucks creates and fosters. "
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for.  It is very fast paced and very diverse.  They offer free college through ASU online giving partners the opportunity to obtain a degree.
good,"Great benefits! Working in a team environment. Open door policy to ask questions, regarding daily work. Support. Computer data base easy to learn. On the phone interaction with customer from all over the United States. Can get stressful, depending on the customers mood, regarding spills, that damaged customers property, of physical burns to adults and children. Workout room on top floor for employee's."

good,I really didn't know what i was getting into when i started working for starbucks.It was like ok good coffee.Then it was like alot of different ways to make coffee.So i learned and i enjoyed every minute of it..Thank you Starbucks
good,"A typical day at work was always fast-paced. It will get busy non-stop, especially the morning shifts, and have to learn to be on your feet all day. One good thing is that you'll be able to get to know your customers and regulars who come in on a daily basis. I enjoyed being part of the environment where I get to satisfy a customer with their order so they can keep coming back. One thing I disliked was the hours i received."
good,Very enjoyable and pleasant place to work. The employees are great and super up beat. Customer service is exceptional. Shift supervisors are always great.
good,"La verdad es que entre sin saber absolutamente nada y me fui con una gran experiencia , los gerentes , jefes y supervisores son excelentes tanto en su desempeño laboral como personas. Aprendí a prepara distintos café , frapuchinos , como usar la caja registradora , nombres de distintos café , a como interactuar con los clientes . Etc."
good,Paiys great long hours multitask quick learning lots of things to remember other then that and management it was good always busy never a boring day under different circumstances I would work there again
good,"A good place to work part time, with many benefits including a markout every week of products for at home. Also, the sense of teamwork being vital was important, and other staff at my store really made an effort to help anyone (staff/customer) who needed it."
good,Able to develop confident level while communicate with all level of people. Learn how to brew coffee and make beverages and provide good customer service and also table service
good,"While at Starbucks there was ample training and information to create quality hand crafted beverages. Starbucks has a workplace culture of assuming positive intent of their customers and seeks out a positive, personalized, intentional interaction with each customer."
good,"i enjoyed my time with starbucks they aren't very understand when it comes to sick days or family issues."
good,Llegar al trabajo y me asignaban una labor ya sea cajera o en bebidas  y siempre con actitud positiva y amigable frente a los clientes
good,"Fast pace but enjoyable environment. People skills required, coffee knowledge is taught. Benefits include health, dental, vision, 401k, and College achievement plan to ASU."
good,"Very fast paced environment,"
good,A typical day here is pretty fast paced work environment.  Everyone helps each other out.  It is a great work atmosphere.  I love everyone I work with.  Manager is awesome and understanding and always there to listen if you need help with anything.
good,"Each day was a different role. You could either be up front on the register, greeting customers and taking orders, or by the oven helping to get food in a timely fashion manner. Being on bar and drive-thru was my favorite part. Although it would get stressful at times, I had pretty great co-workers who always pushed me through it and helped every one in our store. This job helped me be more patient, and really care about others needs. Over all, I enjoyed working at this location."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced working environment. I learned to have good customer service, energetic, and a smile. Management could be improved. The hardest part is trying to make the best of everyone's day. The most enjoyable part is having a compliment from customers and asking if you are the manager!"
good,I loved working here. Serving thousands of customers a day at the Carowinds location. Exciting to see how the different types of drinks match different type of people.
good,"It was my first job and I learn a lot of experience and how to get along with coworkers."
good,The benefits were great and the  people were great to work with. I enjoyed interacting with the customers. Management genuinely cared about the achievements of the employees.
good,Working at Starbucks is a very interesting !  You'll learn all kinds of exciting things about coffee you'd never known before.  It's a great chance to socialize and network with all kinds of different people. Most of all it's a job where you get the moment to possibly make someone's day awesome  with just a delicious cup of coffee and a simple smile.
good,This was my second job and i enjoyed it. I had good co workers even though i did not get along with most of them that did that not stop me from doing a great job. I didn't like the second manager because just because. I enjoyed working with customers on a daily base and met terrific people throughout my ears working there. I love the benefits including the 401k.
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company, not only for its amazing benefit policies, yet what they stand beside ethically. The work culture is very open-minded. A sense of judgment, and feeling out of place is something that does not happen when working for this company. I would say the most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is it is like having a second family. The relationships you make, and the skills you gain from it."
good,"Definitely a great job for students! Decently flexible hours, free coffee, and great coworkers. Very fast-paced, but it teaches you to multitask and work through stress."
good,depending on what position needs to be manned for the day the work day will go by quite fast do to the high traffic of customers coming in and out of the building.
good,"Super great coffee, teas, frozen beverages, great pay (with tips), lots of fun, free pound of coffee every week, plus all the beverage you can drink on the job,// nice assortment of pastries, too."
good,"I only put one star for management, for only the last store I worked for. The manager was not suited for the position, and was very abusive and racist towards customers and employees. They were later stripped of their management title after I left. "
good,Great work environment. Also provide amazing benefits through the company. Pay is very insufficient. Learned a lot about management skills through being a supervisor.
good,great job for students with a tight schedule. managers are very accommodating when it comes to scheduling and availability. great ability for advancement and awesome benefits.
good,A typical day at work usually lasts from 6 to 8 hours. Helps build customer service skills and critical thinking skills. Learning and retaining drink recipes is a little challenging but becomes second-nature with time and practice. Tips are weekly and add as a nice bonus. Free coffee and food during shifts.
good,"I literally never had a job I loved working for as much as Starbucks. I worked here for 2 years before I finally decided it was time to move on. I am a military spouse so I got relocated right before I was promoted to shift leader. When I got relocated, non of my raises were transferred as well. I worked there for 2 years and was making the same as new hires. I voiced my concern, stating I clearly am more experienced as it shows, because I always get placed on the most complicated rolls on the floor, yet no one would help me what so ever. I was also expected to do three or four tasks at a time when everyone else who made more than me had to only juggle one or two. Anyway, the hardest part of the job was learning all the tasks properly since we only had a week really of training. For the most part everyone who worked there would be very nice to your face and talk trash as soon as you were out of ears' distance, and this is literally everyone up the corporate chain as well. If you can get past all the petty drama and realize you're their for money, not friends, it is a pretty amazing place to work. The customers are to die for and i loved the fast-paced challenge of everything."
good,Great place to work. Fun and quick paced. Must be able to multi task and manage time. Great benefits and a family type environment. Must be able to think quickly and deal with difficult customers.
good,I really happy to be apart Starbucks Coffee Malaysia.. much experience I had been learned from here. And now I'm still prefer to work at starbucks singapore
good,"One of my favorite jobs unfortunately I had to resign to relocate because I already took a personal leave, such a cheerful workplace I loved all my co-workers and enjoyed my time there trying to get back inside the company now."
good,"I mostly worked mornings so it was decently busy.  The best parts were the employee discount and free Spotify premium.  I also worked a second job at in n out concurrently, and I have to say:  there were many more rude customers at Starbucks than in n out (I worked at Starbucks for a quarter of the time as I did INO, and I had 4x more problem customers)"
good,"I definitely enjoy this job! I would never leave if it paid more. The wages that are given to us are not enough for the work that Starbucks demands of us. Overall a great company to work for, but the compensation not so much."
good,"Fast paced environment with lots of growth opportunities.Employees are great,very helpful and welcoming ,Senior management team is also very helpful and always available if needed."
good,Being a barista is definitely fast-paced and you definitely have to know your drinks to be successful. You see lots of faces every single day and great customer service is certainly stressed. There should not be very much down time with all of the cleaning and constant responsibilities.
good,"Was a nice place to work at , time goes fast since it's a fast paced job. Daily task for cleaning during every shift.  Everyone is called a partner so we can all work together. Enjoyable to work. Customers are usually happy when they are greeted"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you like a quick-paced environment with the same tasks every day. While there can be a lot to remember with all the different drinks and such, the job itself really isn't that difficult. Occasionally you do have a shift supervisor or a manager that isn't great, but that you can find anywhere. "
good,"Provides a decent amount of advancement. "
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced. Your mind has to be in many different places at once, but I enjoy it. I've learned to never stop moving and I've gotten better and multi tasking. While working for Starbucks I've also gotten better at communicating with management."

good,"I enjoy talking to customers hard worker dependable always on time would stay late if needed"

good,The work is 95% on your feet. The most enjoyable part is interacting with fellow employees and customers. Extensive trainings and increased tea and coffee knowledge.

good,"A fun place to work but make no mistake, coffee is a serious thing! The company provides all the training and certifies the barista. You must provide every drink in a timely manner while upholding Starbucks drink quality and providing the Starbucks experience to every customer. The company has lots of room for advancement and offers health benefits to part time baristas."
good,"Muy buena empresa, con muy buenas prestaciones. mucho enfoque hacia sus trabajadores-."
good,I worked at one that was inside of dillons. It was awesome. I loved all the managers. I really enjoyed making coffee and all the different drinks. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely the people I worked with.
good,"Ive worked in a corporate and licensed store, I prefer the corporate store, because they follow starbucks prodecures more and properly train their employees"
good,"Nothing hard about working at starbucks. Only busy at times, but there is not one task that is complicated or hard to learn. Great benefits. Availability to choose your own schedule"
good,I worked at Starbucks in the field and corporate office.  The culture runs strong in both environments which puts the partners interests first over corporate profits.
good,working for the company is an amazing experience and teaches you a lot of different attributes that you take with you for the rest of your life. it was an overall good experience
good,I love working at Starbucks but for the work that I do I don't feel truly appreciated pay wise. I have been working at Starbucks since I was 19 years old. I am about to be 26 and I feel that I need to change my scenery. Starbucks has amazing benefits. I have gained many loyal customers who became my friends. Everyone that I have met has been brought into my life for a reason. The best part about my job is the amazing people I get to work with. Honestly thats the reason I've stayed for so long. I have worked with many many people. I am the last one standing for the group I started off with. I have watched everyone grow as people at Starbucks. This was the best job I have ever had.
good,"I absolutely loved this job, because I love working with coffee. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who is interested in learning more about the wonderful art that goes into making a great tasting cup of coffee. "
good,Una gran empresa para estudiantes ya que te da la facilidad de compaginar estudios con trabajo
good,"I would love to work at Starbucks because it's good the people inside are really sweet , I'm really friendly kind & genius I use a lot of manners. Also id like to start saving for a car. This job would really mean a lot to me. I wouldn't wanna work anywhere else but Starbucks."
good,"Fun and rewarding work, great management, perks, great training process and very team oriented work with fair pay and benefits. Good work life balance as schedules are flexible."
good,"Lots of space to learn and grow but within your current payscale and salary. Once you are in a position, it is very hard to get out of it and accelerate without networking and playing a game. Work life balanced is very manageable depending on department."
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on the time of year, but it typically consists of being adaptable to working any of 4 positions with skill and accuracy, while maintaining good conversation and pleasant customer service with anyone that might walk through the door.  What I've learned is that a good, pleasant experience for a customer will bring them back day in and day out, and that a smile and kind word go a long way in making sure that I customer feels welcome, appreciated, and helped.  Management was great, other than the occasional scheduling problem with availability, but that's to be expected with the amount of workers they manage.  They are always kind and willing to work with people.  The workplace culture is very diverse, while also being very inclusive, and everyone knows how they should be working and helping each other and are always eager to do so.  The hardest part of the job would probably be just maintaining the cleanliness and stock of the store while finding time to do everything that needs to be done to close.  The most enjoyable part is just talking and making connections with customers and coworkers."
good,"This company was actually a pretty legit place to work, as long as you don't upset anyone or call upper management out of their b.s. Other than that pretty cool fun and friendly people all day."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks because...come on! Who doesn't love the smell of coffee. It would have been nice to cut the amount of grouchy, coffee hungry customers in half at times, but it was my pleasure to tend to their needs and have them walking away with a smile."
good,"Great place to work at, only thing is compensation is simply not enough to live off on. Learned to effectively work in a team environment and how to effectively multitask."
good,I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge working for Starbucks. I would not trade any minute of it. I love my job and my partners. My team and myself work together and achieve goals and we love it.
good,"sometimes you have good days sometimes bad, depending on your shift mostly depends on the customers you deal with. Ive met a lot of new people and a lot of the barista Ive met we have became good friends"
good,"Working at Starbucks has been wonderful. The people I have worked with. The customers that have become regulars. The culture of Starbucks is very inclusive and a great place to work. It is very flexible around studying and extracurricular activies."
good,"It can be a wonderful place to work if you allow it to be. The benefits are AMAZING. You are given stock, amazing insurance options, education options, tuition reimbursement and opportunities to advance. Customers can be difficult to deal with sometimes but that is anywhere you work. The only thing is that pay varies depending on which store you work at. Also depending on the store manager they can be hard to deal with as well. "
good,It is an excellent part-time job for a college student. The job also has great perks and benefits. The early morning shift is difficult to adjust to if you're not an early morning person. Shifts go by fast during the morning rush though.
good,"Working at Starbucks has made me a more understanding, more outgoing person. I am able to problem-solve and manage people now and I learned it in an environment that supports its employees. I had a great team because at Starbucks, they train people not jut baristas."
good,"A typical day is very very busy. I Dealt with a lot of frustrated customers at time then sometimes there where cool funny customers. The management was ok , not understanding about some situations."
good,"Work Life balance is values"
good,"I really enjoyed my role within Starbucks - the staff were so so friendly, making drinks was great fun and the benefits were really good too! Would definitely recommend it as a place to work."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. They start you off at $10.00 an hour, you can set up a 401k, and even go to school through them. You get a lb of free coffee or tea a week. Get discounts on the food there and are able to go up in the company if you really take it seriously and work hard. You can meet a lot new people and it is over all a fun environment to be in. It was great for me as a single mother. Hours are flexible. I mainly worked the opening morning shift from 4:00-10:00 AM. Some Starbucks are open 24 hours and drive-throughs are particularly awesome. Also you get weekly tips from the tip jar that are divided out to everyone. They do not discriminate there. You can also become a coffee master."
good,"Very good benefits and a good environment to work at. The co workers were very welcoming and although it is a face pace job, the day goes by fast when you get the hang of things."
good,"Working at Starbucks was never slow or boring. You always have lots to do and it is good serving regular customers who come back time and time again."
good,Working at Starbucks is a wonderful experience. I am allowed to meet new people and also make their day. I am a shift supervisor and i am given the opportunity everyday to make a person whole mood change with just a cup of freshly brewed coffee.
good,"Great atmosphere. Excellent student part-time job."
good,"The best part of working at Starbucks was the people. They were wonderful and so were many of the customers. However, you had to be quick and do things right the first time. That was the most challenging part of the job."
good,Walk in and clock in its busy in the morning and after people get out of work we stay busy i communicate with the customers and get there drinks for them.
good,Starbucks is so flexible with your availability such a fun and professional environment very good job to get close with your customers at and actually connect
good,"Starbucks work around your class schedule if you are in school. If you're not in school yet, there is opportunity to get free education through Arizona State University."
good,I enjoyed the morning crowd and rush and the team I worked with to get through it each day. They knew their responsibilities and acted appropriately in timely manner.
good,"Very fast paced, and friendly environment. Awesome customers, and management works with your schedule to provide a balanced work life balance. "
good,"Great coworkers, great management, customer rushes come out of thin air but because of your reaction with the other employees it is almost nothing. Great place to work."
good,The culture of the workplace is very nice you meet a lot of people and do your best to make them happy before going off to work. The best part of working for Starbucks is knowing you have made someone smile.
good,Es un muy trabajo pero un poco cansado por los horarios
good,"I have been with Starbucks company for two years, and I love the growth and goals that Starbucks encourages its employees to have. Within the two years I have worked there I have been promoted twice, and my knowledge of coffee and business has improved greatly. Team work is a big part of the culture and also connecting with customers is a must. Working here has been a great overall experience preparing and expanding my growth for my future career."
good,"I quickly made friends with my fellow partners, and we saw each other as family. The job itself is easy and an amazing first job or job for anyone looking to make valuable connections with both the Starbucks family, and the Starbucks customers. Making customer connections was my favorite part,personally, because there is nothing more satisfying than seeing people immediately smile after taking a sip of their favorite hand-crafted beverage."
good,great place for a first job and for someone looking to get a higher education. Wonderful place to learn customer service skills and how to prioritize tasks.
good,"This an incredible job to work for. There is plenty of job growth if you are willing to relocate. Great benefits and workplace culture."
good,"It is a really fun place to work, they do an amazing job at keeping employees happy and you get to interact with the same customers often so they become your friends."
good,"A typical day working at a Starbucks drive-thru usually consisted of face-pace moving and a whole lot of customers. The competitiveness between Starbucks stores make the job more intense. Not in a pressuring way, but more of a motivation to do better. Management was maybe the downfall to my job. I loved working for Starbucks, but often times shifts couldn't get covered and those who worked while missing co-workers suffered harshly. If you have ever worked for a drive-thru I'm sure you can relate. The employees were what made me stay so long with the job. I made many friends through my work, to which I have never had that sort of experience and cherished the connections I've made with people. The hardest part of the job is training. It took me about 5-6 months to become a certified barista, but at that point I had learned everything I needed to know to feel comfortable making beverages and creating personal connections with customers. Overall, out of the several jobs I've had, Starbucks was a dream job to me."
good,"I had a super hard time with my visual impairment, but my coworkers were all super helpful to make accommodations so that I can work better and be happier too. It does get stressful at times when the coffee shop is super busy, but my store really worked on team effort and communication to help each other to ease the workload for everyone. I loved it and wished that every customer had the opportunity to work there and see what their coffee is all about!"
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me how to thrive in a fast paced environment, constantly helping customers and crafting drinks. The Starbucks community was very friendly and the job was incredibly demanding and hands on. I learned a lot about customer service and honed the ability to focus on the multitude of tasks given to me."
good,"Starbucks was amazing , you go in make drinks ,talk to costumers , sell the retail and have fin with your co workers. its a very fast pace environment which is nice and there's always something going on. sometimes it can be a bit demanding but its worth it."
good,"It is hard when you first start, but if you like to stay busy, this is a great job! I personally love it. The pay is decent as well for high school and college students."
good,"Worked my way up to management, felt the hours were too erratic and stressful. Not enough quality of life, but the discounts are nice. This is a dirty job."
good,"Once you get by the first 3 months it gets easier , the coworkers are always so amazing and nice to you always available to help. I think everyone should work at a Starbucks once  in their lives to understand all the work that is always put in daily"
good,"Overall, a well ran site. Plenty of management on site to give and offer help. There is never a shortage on willing team mates. The store focuses on giving the best customer service which promotes a very enjoyable atmosphere for both customer and employee alike."
good,"Attend to customers needs, make sure all facilities are clean and safe to use, and make sure breaks are taken accordingly. Will always have a steady stream of customers. I would handle money to make sure all tills and safe was at the amount specified that needs to be there. Partners are always friendly and work as team. A great environment if you like working with others as a team. I learned management skills while I was a Supervisor; learned how to manage my time as well. My favorite part of the job was coming in and seeing partners as well as the regulars that came everyday. I loved having conversations with them and hearing how their life was doing."
good,"You need to smile everyday, everytime you're in front of the customers. Need to be more approchable and give your full attention and energy when on duty. I learned how to balance my time between personal and work. I learned that I can be fast when it comes to my movement and also active. Management were good and friendly also. They encourage you every time. They appreciate all your hard working and other things that can make you more persistent and more active to your duty and all your efforts. Maybe the hardest part were be able to really manage your time to relax and to be productive. Being more active and make the customers feel good and they don't feel awkward. Not showing that your sad, or tired in front of them. I love when I can make my own coffee for the customers. Showing how I put my effort and love to all the drinks that I make. I get to know more and new things about coffee. New knowledge and learning for me that I can apply to my everyday life."
good,"I worked in a very cultural starbucks with people of every race, color and size and it was so interesting. I loved the people I worked with and all of my customers."
good,"Great culture and good people. They really work around my full-time job. I love my team. I love the customers, especially our regulars. I love the benefits."
good,"You have to complete a various about of tasks, sometimes multitasking. I have learned how to communicate with customers and employees. Hardest part of the job is learning how to sequence the drinks and learning all the different types of drinks. It is a great environment to chill."
good,while working at this job I learned how to do many this such as make drinks on the espresso machine. I learned how to brew coffee and I also was taught how to clean properly.
good,"Starbucks as a whole is an amazing company to work for. I hate that there is no personalized raises, no matter how much you work, yearly you will get a raise. Which really is discouraging for those of us who really go the extra mile. Management also can be iffy, but luckily for my location we have an amazing manager."
good,"Starbucks ha sido la punta de la lanza en mi vida laboral, me ha dado la oportunidad de desarrollarme en varios ámbitos de gran importancia y valor dentro de cualquier empresa tal  como: "
good,"Starbucks offers a wicked comprehensive benefits plan to part time employees, customers receive a free pound of coffee or box of tea every week, and also the pay is decent (tips included)."
good,This is a job that takes a character. You will be thrown with a ton of different things your way and you must be able to compensate for all of the jobs you're doing at once.
good,"The managers wasn't very well rounded. Lacked on communication skills, he was a very unreliable manager. Didn't care about availability. Worst manager I've ever worked under."
good,"Starbucks is a lot of fun, I enjoy my co-workers and the relationships I have with costumers. We are usually very busy in the mornings, starts getting slow in the afternoons. Great benefits and drinks!"
good,Boa empresa ótimo atendimento ao seus funcionários boa relação na empresa
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Star Bucks; being able to satisfy customers and make their days a lot better made me feel special as an employee. The Starbucks that I worked for isn't a real Starbucks, meaning you customers cannot use their Starbucks rewards but they can use their cards to pay for drinks. Renown owns the license from Starbucks, so basically Renown employees but Starbucks quality beverages. Since I worked at a hospital most of our customers were other employees from the hospital, but also patients family members that heard bad news do come to decompress. Being able to treat those customers are very special moments and memorable."
good,"There are only good things to say about Starbucks as an employer. The benefits are great and theres never a heavy workload as long as everyone is working as a team and you have a strong shift lead. "
good,"Very good environment."
good,"Great company to work for, the staff always gets along and you become a family, lots of benefits, raises every 6 months, customers become really close with you."
good,"In the near four years since I've started working at Starbucks, I can honestly say that it's one of the few jobs I've had that I've thoroughly enjoyed."
good,Physically this is a hard job because it is fast paced and there are constantly customers in the store so you are always moving. The culture is very different there and some of the employees are so negative. Especially the 20 somethings. Management isn't consistent and different than I have ever experienced. Sometimes to the detriment of the employees. But if the manager runs the store right and hires good people it is a fun place to work and you enjoy going.
good,"Nice company in general. Pretty flexible scheduling for students, but there's not always enough hours. Luckily you can work at other stores if you need more hours. Major con is the low pay."
good,I was really enjoying my self working over there ... They help me to know more about coffees... Great culture followed by all the partners ... like to work again over there as a shift manager...
good,"En Starbucks aprendí mucho sobre las diferentes variedades de café y sus diferentes preparaciones, además de la historia de esta gran cadena."
good,"Fun place to work, great benefits if you like coffee and plan on attending school and need financial help. Management was very kind and understanding and worked to help make schedule work."
good,"A Starbucks com seu legado consegue conquistar qualquer pessoa."
good,I learned how to give great customer service. The people you meet are great. You get paid every week. The hardest but rewarding part of the job is moving up in management.
good,"I have been a Starbucks partner for almost 2 years, and it is hands down my favorite job I've had thus far. It's an excellent company for young adults as well as experienced professionals in upper management. The company really takes care of you if you are a hard worker. Would recommend to anyone looking for job at anytime."
good,"I truly have enjoyed my time with Starbucks Coffee. When i started this job at age eighteen, i had no idea i would fall into the culture the way I did. The people around me allowed me to grow both professionally and socially."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work part-time especially as a student with the flexibility of their scheduling alongside their benefit plan. What makes me excited to go to work every shift is the amazing culture that is fostered within the company. You feel like family to those you work with and because of that you are very committed to the company.
good,"As a Starbucks Barista, it is very easy to join the coffee giant and have a good, busy shift, each and every day. The company offers many benefits to its partners (employees), and job advancement. While working at Starbucks I learned the introductory skills of leading a business and its employees to success. Training each partner to succeed in coffee sales, and customer growth takes great leadership, knowledge of product, and customer service. I learned how to focus on food sales, coffee sales, and increasing the average ticket per hour. I was also taught to study the districts focus on achieving goals and expectations led by store managers. I work side by side with both my assistant store manager and store manager to deliver the best possible customer service possible. I look to apply all of the skills I learned to any future career."
good,"Could work here forever if there was Full time hours available. Very awesome staff, very amazing management, loved learning about different drinks, benefits!!"
good,"Exciting and fast paced workplace, get to see and talk to a lot of different people. Management is usually there and willing to discuss any concerns."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a year and a half, and it was amazing. I was deeply saddened when I made the decision to leave. This company truly takes care of its partners. Despite poor management in some instances, I loved my time there."
good,"I personally  had the best manager I have ever had working at my store. The people I worked with were fun, they were mostly college students. Flexible hours, my manager worked hard to give me the hours I needed. The pay sucked though, really bad. The bad pay was supposed to be offset by their great benefits, however I was still on my parents insurance so I didn't have to worry about that,. Its fast paced and you cant make mistakes, but you meet and work with cool people."
good,but unfortunately i was put with the wrong management and was forced to leave the position. if given the opportunity i would gladly go back to work for the company.
good,"Great place to work, always new things happening  and the customers are nice, making drinks is fun and very fast paced its a cool place to work"
good,If you are looking for something that is fun and will allow you to grow Starbucks is the place.  I learned more about myself working there.  It is great place to work.
good,The management is amazing at my location! It's busy but time fly's because of it. The people are great to work with coworkers and customers.
good,I absolutely loved this job. I was a barista for seven years. I would have stayed longer but because of the amount of income and hours it wasn't bringing in a lot into my house hold. I grew very attached to my co- workers and customers and over all it was a great experience.
good,I enjoyed learning new positions and new job. I met many people here and constantly got to see new faces. I was always reminded by the guests who much they appreciate us.
good,"hard work but well trained staff, great company to work for, early start to the day, but short shifts. Great pay and chances for advancement"
good,"Great company to work for, provides me with great opportunities and benefits. You will work hard for those benefits. The day to day can be challenging but it is a fun work environment with a great culture."
good,"I applied to Starbucks simply because I was a student who spent way too much money and time in my local branch. So, while I only applied to ensure some pocket money and great coffee, what I received in return was totally unexpected."
good,it's a great job to have as your first job. Also it's one of those jobs where you could advance in the company. Company is good to their employees and it makes you want to stay there. By far one of most enjoyable jobs I had.
good,Learning how to make people's coffee is an enjoyment to help them. The management is great with the flexibility of school.
good,"Un dia tipico requiere mucha dedicacion para hacer sentir al cliente como en casa, aprendi que siempre es mejor contar con el trabajo de un equipo perfectamente motivado y dirigido a lograr los objetivos de la empresa, con compromiso y profesionalismo. La gerencia siempre mostro el interes de hacerte crecer como persona y como profesional lo cual agradezco de corazon porque adquiri habilidades y conocimientos que me seran utiles en cualquier campo y momento de mi vida. La parte quiza mas dificil del trabajo era encontrar la manera de unir diferentes puntos de vista del equipo de trabajo pero al final se lograba perfectamente una union entre los miembros del equipo. Lo que mas me gusto fue que nunca lo vi como un trabajo ya que me encantaba lo que hacia ahi y el tiempo que duro fue bastante  constructivo para mi formacion profesional."
good,"very exciting and would def recommend this job to everyone "
good,I enjoyed being able to meet goals and metrics. I was able to increase sales and performance due to management trainings and encouragement
good,"Working at Starbucks required enhanced customer service skills, ability to multitask, and a good attitude. It was a fast paced environment that always had you moving whether it be making drinks, ringing people up, or organizing/cleaning the kiosk."
good,Working at Starbucks is just a great experience for the new members of the workforce. Management is usually pretty flexible with hours if you are a student.
good,"friendly and courteous customer service provided, great job potential and growth, fair treatment of work employees, high volume business and high energy work environment"
good,This place knows what its doing to keep its staff happy. Best benefits you can get from any part time employeer as well as excellent culture and perks
good,"They care about their partners and have so many benefits in place to support us. "
good,When have a great leader the job great an fulfilling but when u have a boss that does not kmow how to lead can make can make your job difficult. Ppl dont generally leave companies but rather their boss
good,"A typical day in the morning is very busy and full of a lot of problem solving. I learned how to be patient while still fulfilling each customers needs and making personal connections. My manager did not like conflict so there was often a few problems among coworkers which made the workplace a little stressful, but nothing that couldn't be resolved by a third person. The hardest part of the job was managing other people to make sure the store was clean at the end of the day during a time crunch. The most enjoyable part to me was seeing my favorite customers every day and walking into a place that felt like home. My especially favorite part was counting the tills and safe."
good,"I would get to work at 4:30 am and start brewing coffee and making sure everything was ready for when we opened. Throughout the day, we had rushes of people and food and drinks constantly going. Definitely keeps you on your feet. I loved my original manager. She was very laid back but she left and no one liked the new manager. He was very by the book and you couldn't sit down for 5 minutes without him yelling at you (and I was 8 months pregnant). The hardest part was the rushes of people and getting them through the line without messing up the orders. I loved my co-workers and we had a lot of fun together. Oh and the managers manager brought my newborn baby into a work related issue so I quit."
good,Fun place to work! Very upbeat and relaxed atmosphere. Managers were willing to work with schedules as they changed. Would recommend to any college student looking for a fun and easy job!
good,I really liked the work place and i loved the people that I worked with the other members of the team were really nice and there was good training. The only thing that wasnt great was the managemnet
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced environment! It always keeps you on your toes. I love the benefits, free coffee, and being able to connect so well with our customers. We truly are their third place (aside from home and work) and it's fantastic to be a part of that."
good,"A Starbucks partners' personal experience with the company depends completely upon the District Manager & Store manager. The company offers excellent benefits, flexible hours, tuition reimbursement. Personally, I have had an outstanding 3 years with Starbucks; I have had an excellent experience with every store I have worked at."
good,"I really do enjoy my job in Starbucks, meeting all day new people making their days better , have a little chat, make of our workplace their second home is why I am really into this kind job. "
good,I absolutely loved working here. Fast paced environment and lots of jobs to learn so you can pick up more shifts and hours.
good,"I worked here for the best part of two years during my later teens. I actually really loved this job for the most part but after a year or so, we received new management and with that the atmosphere in the workplace changed and it wasn't the same. We were all very hard working, Starbucks is a very fast paced environment and you can always pick up new skills. I particularly loved building relationships with our regular customers, you get to know them by name and it makes your role in such a big company feel more personable."
good,"Being part of thr Starbucks team is like being part of a large family. Your partners are there for you, and you are there for them. This is a job where you try to help the people around you, which means you are always working for each other and for the customer. My favorite part of the day is being on register, and getting to influence the customers with a smile or a compliment. You can really make somebody's day."
good,A typical work day can pass very quickly in the mornings while night shift can be slow. This job consists of lots of cleaning during down time. Starbucks supplies specific instructions for all tasks making a first time hire not feel as overwhelmed.
good,"Working with Starbucks was/is a great for people looking for work experience in a fast paced environment all while keeping up with wonderful customer service. You will face many challenges either with customers and/or coworkers and working with Starbucks will teach you how to overcome these obstacles. In the end, make you a competent and professional worker."
good,Amazing company to work for. They really do listen to all of their partners. Provide tools and resources to do an effective job. Pay for baristas could be better. Upper management does an exceptional job of developing managers.
good,"At Starbucks I met a lot of new people daily, plus our everyday same customers who were always friendly. I was very comfortable talking to our customers, it was as if we knew each other for years!"
good,"En esta empresa forje mis conocimientos sobre la gestión y operación de una sucursal de Starbucks, entre como barista, el puesto más bajo y de ahí fui creciendo como supervisor, sub gerente y por ultimo gerente de tienda en el cual tuve grandes logros como bajar la rotación de un 105% a un 43%, incremente un 10% la venta vs años pasados, mantuve una productividad de 10.5% durante mi gestión, de igual manera tuve a mi cargo 11 a trabajadores, les di crecimiento a 5 supervisores y 2 gerentes de tienda"
good,"Excelente estancia, tus compañeros son como tu familia, tus jefes se convierten en amigos, sin duda es un excelente lugar para trabajar; sin embargo lo feo viene cuando los clientes no te respetan."
good,"Laborar en Starbucks es una agradable experiencia, dentro se encuentra un clima laboral privilegiado; Se derogan responsabilidades diferentes cada día por lo que resulta muy versátil; Se cuenta con una amplia flexibilidad para con las necesidades del partner y una gran calidez humana; Se obtiene un salario limitado; Es una gran oportunidad para estudiantes en formación."
good,"I really loved working at Starbucks. I can say this is one of the jobs that enabled my to expand my communication skills and my self confidence. Starbucks provides all the guidelines to makes a simple employee a professional barista. Management is very strict to the point even the manager got fired at some point. Co-worker were mostly girls, friendly but a little too gossipy. I cant judge all Starbucks managers, but both managers we had were unorganized. The hardest part of the job was to be able to learn all the menu. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we had free drinks."
good,"J'ai beaucoup appris Starbuck comment préparée les boissons leur goût,leur saveur, d'où il vient"
good,I have learned to multi-task many different things while controlling a high-frequency store. My day consists of both becoming a barista and a supervisor when told to take charge. I ensure everything runs smoothly by using organization methods and making sure what needs to be done gets done. You learn a lot about setting certain priorities straight while working at Starbucks.
good,Great work experience. Great work environment and work culture. Not the best benefits but the work culture makes up for it.
good,Love the environment really get to know your customers personally ! Connect with people and always have a chance to grow within the company . Any time you need to reach out to corporate they respond asap and really care about you .
good,"Going into work everyday was always a blast! Connecting with customers and starting their days off good was always a delight for me. Some days were crazier than others but worth it, always lines and fast paced environment."
good,overall fun place to work if you are trying to get by school or have other jobs on the side. management it too intense but not bad work culture
good,"It was a long time ago that i was there but I had a Blast there and I loved my customers and learning there drinks and getting a rush of customers and having to work fast to make drinks and boy did i bang those drinks out loved it, but i am sure it is differnet now."
good,I felt really supported by the work environment I encountered at Starbucks. I was surrounded by positive employees and a clean store. I felt that Starbucks did a great job of training me and it gave me a wonderful sense of confidence in myself at work.
good,"My goal with every new customer i meet is to obtain first name basis relationships. I genuinely care about the quality of day or experience they have throughout the day each individual has. It is important to me that i benefit someones day in the kindest way possible. Starbucks offers their employees the opportunity to make each persons day a little brighter, one cup at a time. in addition the the delicious beverages, a warm smile goes a long way. It is my passion that makes it brighter, and this company gives you something, or someone, to love about each and every day."
good,"Gained good experience with customer service. Learned how to keep a clean environment as soon as I would step foot behind the counter. The management was good, they held you accountable but because they were also baristas they were able to look at every mistake from your perspective also and were very understanding."
good,"I worked part-time as a barista for 3 years while working on my bachelors. Scheduling was very flexible, pay was very good for a minimum wage job (after adding tips). Only con was management and upward mobility."
good,I am very much happy to work in this organisation just some personal reasons I am leaving this good timings two offs in a week good promotions good team
good,"I LOVED my Starbucks experience. I had wonderful managers and co works at all 4 stores I worked (ended up working at several stores because i moved states a few times). My experience provided a good ""break"" away from my carrier and if i so chose i could have gone further up the company latter. However, the swing type of schedule as a shift manager proved to not be for me in the long run. I would recommend it though for anyone either looking for a steady job through school or even as a career path,"
good,"ambiente,comunicação e treinamento são muito bem passados e nos gerentes temostotal autonimia"
good,Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. The work environment is challenging yet very rewarding; everyday is a new day filled with new faces which makes the job even more fun! Company benefits are amazing too.
good,"I enjoyed this job very much. I only left to go to a management position at another place of employment. This atmosphere was enjoyable, I enjoyed the other team members."
good,"Great working individuals, very fast paced, benefits are amazing."
good,"I liked organizational culture of Starbucks, love like-minded people i worked with, loved managemnet. The only disadvantage was too much work for too little money. But again, my location was very busy."
good,"excellent learning experience"
good,Working with starbucks is a good company friendly people j get the hours which is good only downside of being there for almost 7 years is the pay rate isn't that greatest it could be better.
good,"A standard day at the job would involve all stations, which were Till, Coffee bar, and cafe cleanup. All three roles involved customer interaction so there was always a reason to smile and to be as helpful as possible. The staff were all relaxed and always happy to help with any problems a colleague or customer had. I learnt how to keep calm under pressure here as we used to get coach loads of people coming all at once which could mean non stop drink orders for up to 2 hours. This would mean we would have to be quick and make sure that the correct drinks were made so that customers were not late to get back on their coaches. The management were always there for you with any problems that may arise and they made sure that they contributed during the busy rushes."
good,The training program is very innovative and upholds the core values of the company. There are various ways of uplifting the spirit kf each employee to stay passionate on their chosen coffee journey. Every day at the store is a fruitful learning experience. Every barista has the freedoms to be their own unique selves!
good,Mi trabajo es tener siempre limpias las ventanas para que el cliente mire la higiene con la que trabajamos porque el cliente es la prioridad número uno
good,"You are constantly on your feet running around to fulfill orders but also to keep the store clean and presentable. Supervisor others and deal with any complaints, all while maintaining a friendly and welcoming demeanor to the customers. You learn how to multitask quickly and efficiently. As a supervisor you are in charge of most of the ""behind the scenes"" maintenance of the store including daily ordering, money handling and management, health and safety measures and several other skills."
good,"Es un lugar muy agradable para trabajar, tienen muy definido el trabajo en equipo, siempre buscan mantener a los partners unidos, algo que me gusta mucho este trabajo es la calidad y el cuidado de lo higiene en la preparación de bebidas, y el servicio al cliente es lo más importante para ellos."
good,A wonderful store with great management and team members. Hours are scarce. A very fun work environment. Work load is never too heavy and the pay is acceptable for how easy and laid back the job is.
good,Sehr zum weiterempfehlen die Team arbeit macht sehr viel Spass bei hektischen Zeiten bleibr Das Team trotz allem ruhig und konzentriert die Gäste fühlen sich sehr wohl und kommen immer wider gerne zurük.
good,Starbucks has offered be great experiences with customers and fellow coworkers. I have enjoyed my time at Starbucks thus far as an entry level employee. The benefits are incredible and the work expectations are fair. I will always recommend Starbucks to anyone who asks.
good,a great place to work if you are interested in part time work and receiving benefits. have not worked for Starbucks in  over 10 years so not sure what the current policy is on part time benefits.
good,Working at Starbucks is very fast paced and you must be able to keep up. I've learned responsibility and leadership. Coworkers are great and always willing to help. I've worked at several stores with great management and only one or two that weren't as great. I think the hardest part of this job is being able to multi-task and you are also held to a certain standard to be your best. What i enjoyed most while working at Starbucks is always learning something new and being able to have new experiences
good,"Attending the needs of partners, customers, and business. Coaching and giving feedback to employees and management team to ensure       expectations are met, and customers are highly satisfied. My job is enjoyable when customers come back and treat the team as their family. As well as, all business key performance indicators are highly succeeded."
good,I would have to say that the best thing I ever learned while working at Starbucks is a skill I utilize to this day. Always look at the situation from the client's point of view. It removes you from the stress of whatever you may be feeling at that moment and changes your point of view immediately.
good,"Very fun place to work, especially if you are the creative type because some customers love when you freestyle on their drinks which keeps them coming back."
good,"I had several responsibilities when I was on the clock. I had to make sure the daily brewed coffee was always fresh, made sure everything in the store was always stocked and cleaned. I made sure I went out of my way to make the customer's experience was exceptional. I made every drink with love. What I enjoyed the most about my job was getting to know different people every day. The regulars became my family, I was sad when I made the choice to quit."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work as a high school or college student at the barista or shift supervisor level. If you are looking for a long-term career you can find it here too! Becoming a manager of a Starbucks store is an achievable feat for the ambitious worker.
good,Working as rgm nd taking care of partners business nd customers.good company with good work culture.working 5 days is grt approach.
good,"Starbucks is always busy with customers, you have to make each and everyone of them feel welcomed. There are lots of new things you will learn each day for example you might learn to make a new drink to the customers desire, not too sweet not too sour. In order to make the day go by fast and to have a good shift you must interact with your coworkers and make the most fun out of creating beverages and serving customers as well as cleaning and organizing."
good,"I have worked at two separate stores in two cities, and I loved all of my fellow Baristas and Supervisors. I've worked for Starbucks for nearly two years and I really have loved it. I've learnt how to deal with many different types of people which was difficult, it isn't always easy to be kind to people who are rude to you, but your team mates always manage to make you smile and forget. The hardest part of the job is when you have a line to the door and everyone is a bit stressed but surrounded by the right team, it will feel easy. The most enjoyable part is being paid to socialise with people, to talk to them and have fun and have a laugh, not many jobs pay you to make friends with your customers."
good,"what i learned is how to make a lot of different drinks for customers and talking to them and learning about them"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. There are many benefits to working at this company and many opportunities to grow. It has helped me grow and become a better person, I'm not as shy as I used to be and I am not afraid to go after what I want."
good,"One can definitely learn to manage time wisely, as well as keep up with beverage quality, store cleanliness and customer service."
good,"Starbucks was a customer based job that was very relaxing and enjoyable. I worked very closely with regular customers and always enjoyed my time there, I spent the majority of my time dealing with customers and answering phones, The only con was the very low rate of pay."
good,"Starbucks has shown to me and all the other employees that they really care about each and every staff member. We are not called employees, but rather partners. We are all treated the same and with the same respect, whether you are a barista or a manager. No two days are the same, you have customer rushes at different times, you always have new drinks coming out and the customers every day are different, with the exception of our regulars. I have learned so many great skills, like working alongside people with a multitude of different personalities and work habits. I have enjoyed working with all of the people at my store, they make my day enjoyable."
good,"Work is long when you have an 8 hour shift. There is so much that needs to get done in one day. The hardest part of the job would be customer support, you are literally running around making sure everyone has everything."
good,"I really enjoy this job, having been with the company I think that is saying a lot. I have learned valuable skills on how to effective manage others in a fast paced environment. I have learned how to develop others to be the best they can be helping to build a stronger team. If anything I just wish the pay was more."
good,"Normalmente los días sábados eran muy agitados en Mirador, casi no tenías tiempo ni para respirar pero gracias al liderazgo de nuestro gerente y su equipo de trabajo sabíamos muy bien de qué manera trabajar ante la frustración y así, disfrutar de nuestro trabajo."
good,A typical day at Starbucks included multiple rushes throughout the day to keep us busy. I learned how to manage my time and clean any supplies I might have needed between drinks. My manager was always willing to work with any change in schedule that I may have needed. My co-workers were always a lot of fun to be around and I built lasting relationships with all of them. The hardest part of the job were the hours between shifts where I was working alone and had to handle any rush encountered before the closer would come in. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customers I met.
good,"Its a pleasure working for this company, my main duties were serving customers with the best possible service I could offer. My Co workers were awesome and I enjoyed working with them."
good,"Buena relación con compañeros de trabajo, aprendí todo lo necesario para ser un barista, la parte más difícil es los conflictos con clientes, pero siempre los supe llevar."
good,It is very easy and the customers are pretty great. GREAT Benefits.Free pound of coffee each week. Fast track to success
good,"It was a good atmosphere to work, everyone was helpful, I have learned lots from everyone, holding a management position in such a company really a good experience."
good,Starbucks  was one the best companies  I have worked for. And after I left the company  just having them on my resume has gotten my foot in the door to many great opportunities .
good,"one of the most amazing places i have ever worked for, management needs more improvement but overall its a good place to work at."
good,While working for Starbucks it always demanded to work in a fast paced environment. It was necessary to work as a team. They had great benefits for employees like free tuition to finds a bachelor's degree. All my co-workers were always friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job as a supervisor I had to pick up peoples slap for not pulling their own weight or being under staffed during peak hours.
good,"Nice place to work, great flexibility, great customers! Enjoyed the new coffee experience along with tea.  Benefits available for part time along with profit sharing. Working for Host, which is franchise  to operate in airports. Have worked for Starbucks outside and very great experience for 4 years prior."
good,"The ability to communicate with a diverse group of people on a daily basis was amazing! Wonderful benefit package and so many perks given for being a partner here. I learned a lot about time management, inventory control and team management while working for this company.  My co-workers became a second family to me and it was a very enjoyable experience. I recommend a job at Starbucks to anybody!"
good,"The atmosphere is comfortable, the pay is ok, the management however could use an upgrade, I feel as the managers should care more rather than give negative feedback."
good,enjoyed my time there worked there while i was in school great place to network you never know who may be coming in your store for the free wifi.
good,"Enjoyed working there, the management is terrible and ran by kids. They smoked weed on the job. Enjoyed it while it lasted."
good,"An amazing company to work for as a first job. You learn amazing customer service skills as well as patience. Constantly moving and working. You interact with thousands of people a day, although it can be tough it's also really fun. "
good,"My team is phenomenal, and it starts with my store manager. She provides a culture of acceptance and fun. She stays productive while giving us the freedom to be ourselves and incorporate our personalities into the Starbucks experience."
good,This was by far one of the best jobs I had. I enjoyed making coffee and the vibe of the people I worked with and the people that came into the store. People would thank us for making their coffee and it was nice. We got see and meet all kinds of people everyday and it was interesting to watch the people that would come into Starbucks.
good,"Best place I've ever worked. The business itself is greatly caring for the workers, and its a blast working with the amazing colorful people I had the pleasure of working with. The team, AND the customers are like family. Do yourself a favor, work for Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks was overall a great company to work for. It is an extremely fast pace job. I thought it was very well run. It is heavily based on satisfying the customers, making sure they walk out of Starbucks with a smile on their face.  Some of my coworkers were great and some were the opposite, but learned how to work together to maintain a positive and customer satisfying workplace. The hardest part of the job had to be the after school rushes every weekday."
good,"Really a great place to work. Starbucks main goal is to be fun, fast, and friendly. Learned so many new and exciting things working at starbucks. Love all my coworkers and manaegment."
good,"Typically, the day runs very smoothly as you are assigned a position (i.e. bar, register, store support) so you know your responsibilities for the day. I learned a lot about coffee, as well as making genuine connections with customers and other partners. Management is pretty great, especially because there are so many resources for partners if there are ever any problems. I've had an issue with my store manager and was easily able to resolve the issue using the partner hotline and asking questions based on the situation. The hardest part about working here is that it is very fast paced, so you need to be a quick learner and be able to work as fast and accurate as you can. One other thing that is hard about the job is that the customer is always right, and Starbucks sometimes receives very difficult customers, or customers who simply seek free things. However, the good far outweighs the bad. The most enjoyable part about working for starbucks is that it's not only work, but it can be a creative outlet and the partners and benefits are wonderful."
good,"The fast paced environment is good for some, keeping hands busy and minds working. The stress that comes with it is not always worth the pay."
good,Starbucks is a fun and challenging work environment.  Everyday presents a new set of challenges and opportunities to meet and exceed customers needs and expectations.
good,"i love working at starbucks i enjoy the job and the people that i work with. wish that it payed more than it does. i like being ableto talk to people all day, and meeting new and interesting people."
good,The type of job that you look forward to working. I have loved the time I have spent with Starbucks and appreciate everything they have done for me.
good,"I have learnt a lot of things from here like how to work with people, role, responsibility. Moreover, CEO is very friendly, when a lot of customers come, he always ready to help the staff"
good,i worked here all through college and it was nice not bad at all. Starbucks has great benefits. and a college program that is awesome. give it a shot
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks is full of ups and downs.  I've learned that no shift ever runs smoothly, but the end goal of every day is that the team works together the best they can for complete customer satisfaction as well as business growth.  Our store is only as successful as our team and our team can only be successful when we encourage one another, and hold ourselves and our peers accountable for our actions and our goals.  I would not be as strong of a barista or as reliable had I not been able to accept constructive criticism from my peers and manager.  The most challenging part of the job is accommodating the needs of a customer whether they are frustrated or not, all the while adhering to the stores policies, or your store happened to run out of their food or drink item.  But I've found that the most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is the relationships you cultivate among your peers.  You become a family and suddenly it feels less like work."
good,Nice environment to work in. Meet and work with great people and really build your social and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is learning the drink routines but once you learn them this job is a piece of cake.
good,"Fast paced, great management, wonderful coffee, fast learning job. Being a Barista means you can never expect the same from every customer and the same from every drink. Everything is always changing and so do my co-workers, which are lively. Hardest part of the job is keeping up to pace, when drink times are 45 seconds, it's sink or swim, and I guess I'm swimming. Seeing the different people, and different peoples' reactions and love for coffee are the reasons why I'm loving this job."
good,"Typical work day would be coming in around 1 pm, at which I would check who needs breaks and who needs their lunch breaks. I would count in the safe and switch out the cash registers. From there I would start cleaning as long as I had enough employees on the floor. I would help out when needed with customer interactions and sales. I learned that no matter how old someone is they may not look at the importance of job duties, or just don't care. I found many ways around that by getting into their heads and understanding what motivates each individual. Most of my co-workers were amazing, but the hardest part of the job was motivating the people that didn't want to work that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with our customers and our regulars."
good,"The hardest and yet the best part of the job are the customers. We get difficult particular customers but we also get great customers who become friends. My co-workers are fantastic and they are what keeps me at the job. we also get stock grants, and discounts on stocks. Part-time employees are also eligible for benefits after 3 months. Every 6 months you get a review where depending on your overall score you get a raise (usually 20 cents, not much but something). If you choose to go further you can be promoted to shift supervisor where the base pay is $13. Hours are very flexible at Starbucks. Managers and district managers (like a general manager but we call then district managers) are all very approachable."
good,"Starbucks was a fun and exciting company to work for and they REALLY listened and took care of their employees.  Lots of room for growth BUT, the wages for terrible."
good,I've learned so much about working directly with the consumer and customer care / support. And what it means to bring quality ethics and work to and from the field.
good,Great fast paced place to work requiring the movement and friendliness of other. Free coffee and making great connections
good,I love working for this company but I feel stuck in my growth and need something a little more that I can work towards. My Store Managers have all been great except my current one that singles me out and places all of the blame on me. everyone else that i have worked with or for has been fantastic.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. It can really depend on what store you end up in when it comes to co workers, but the corporation itself was great!"
good,"One of the most enjoyable jobs I have ever had, working with young people who have unending energy, create laughter in the moment and teach the true meaning of life.  Training is at the forefront of each promotion, ensuring you always feel supported and have the tools to succeed.  Typical days always start with a great cup of coffee, the opportunity to connect, really connect with people and create an awesome experience for both youreslf, your team and your customers"
good,"I have worked with Starbucks Corporation for several years now and have enjoyed it very much. I have learned that customer service is where I need to be. Its a great place to expect challenges and excitement. Starbucks withholds a very high standard with their employees, the dress code is to always be professional, the attitude and behaviors are to be genuine and respectful at all times."
good,As a barista I prepared and served espresso-coffee drinks along with other hot food items. It was a great work place with good vibes & great employees.
good,"It's a great place to work, management is a little rough at times. My manager doesn't have an assistant and I think it get hard for her to do everything on her own sometimes. Shifts get really messed up and people are getting in trouble for not showing up at proper times. Little things like that continue to occur. The place can be pretty messy, and people aren't necessarily following proper procedures, even shift managers."
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar y desarrollo personal, mucho desarrollo para primeros puestos,  poco desarrollo para puestos mayores."
good,"Five o'clock rolls around, the sun not even awake yet, and the time for coffee has come. The cafe is soon decorated with the smells of ground coffee from all over the world, and sometimes that alone is enough to help you forget it is only five thirty in the morning! After setting up everything needed to ensure a successful day the doors are unlocked and its time for business. A typical day may include helping anywhere from thirty to fifty+ customers every half hour. This means making sure coffee is always brewed and that your barista has all the tools they need for optimal efficiency. There is a lot to be done but with determination and the right mentality it is more often than not manageable. "
good,"I found this job very enjoyable, especially the interactions with coworkers and customers. the compensation is great, especially the benefits package. Just don't expect to get rich."
good,"No matter how many people walk in and out or how many drinks you make or mess up, the feedback and task you are getting and doing for your customers will be worth doing this job."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks- but I believe you DO need to be driven and focused to enjoy the job. Getting promoted to Shift Supervisor was one of my most challenging work experiences, and the company demands a lot of responsibility, but I believe that they do reward well, especially compared to the rest of the fast food industry."
good,Fun place to be unless you get a bad manager so its luck of the draw either they are cool or they have a power trip. Geeezgeeezgeeez
good,"For the most part, the customers and coworkers are amazing. The company is 100% on your side as an employee. There is a lot of work to do each day, and sometimes that work can get frustrating. However, each day you walk in and people smile because you are there."
good,"	Maximized customers dining experiences by providing excellent customer service, correctly preparing drink orders, and accurately processing cash and credit card payments"
good,I absolutely loved working for Starbucks; my team of baristas were so fun and I always looked forward to working. Training was not as hard as I expected it to be. The free drinks and food were great benefits to working with the company.10/10 would recommend to someone looking for a job.
good,I enjoyed being an employer for starbucks. Its an outgoing atmosphere. This company respects the employees life and needs. I would enjoy going back to work there.
good,"Es una empresa con una dedicación a sus empleados y clientes, preocupada por los detalles que puedan modificar cualquier momento."
good,"As a shift supervisor or manager, I would open the store, manage cash handling for the store, including deposits, change orders, balancing tills, etc. I work with the baristas to make a personal connection with each customer, and help them find a happy community area where they can either work or socialize. Managers are exceptionally fantastic multitaskers, driven, and very understanding of life outside of work. The coworkers are almost all friendly, great coworkers. However the work environment is somewhat immature, and and the managers tend to play favorites."
good,"During my year at Starbucks, I learned about different types of coffees and teas. I also learned how to work in a fast paced customer service environment. It was a fun place to work because the regular customers were always so nice and my coworkers were a pleasure to work with."
good,"I had fun working at Starbucks during my first year in college, however I moved on to push myself to do more. My co-worker were always pleasant. The hardest part of my job, was not being scheduled enough."
good,"Loved the Job, Excellent Management, Lovely Customers, Humanitarian Treatment. Really enjoyed the day to day running of the company and feel like i learnt alot whilst i was working there under excellent management."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fast paced, and requires great customer service. I have learned how important it is to value every single customer. I have learned how to deal with pressure in the work place, and how to build friendships with customers. Management is filled with wonderful people, and are all understanding and reasonable. All of my coworkers are wonderful. Everyone gets along great and are all very welcoming. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is trying not to become overwhelmed when it's busy, and you have twenty drinks waiting to be made, with all different types of customization. You can feel pressured and stressed easily, and dealing with this makes the job very enjoyable. A wide variety of customers make this job so much fun, everyday is different and filled with new people."
good,I've learned a lot about myself and my work ethic as a result of being employed at Starbucks Corporation. I also am completely committed to Starbucks mission statement as I have adapted it in my daily interaction with people.
good,"Great work environment, always a good time. Customer service is key. Comfortable place to work perfect for students work around their school needs."
good,Starbucks has an amazing culture and excellent training programs. You can't help but grow personally at Starbucks with all the develop and education programs available to all positions.
good,I worked for Starbucks for many many years. I really loved the fast paced environment and the ability to connect and form relationships with customers. It can be very difficult to move up in the company. The management depends on whom the store manager is. I have come across managers who are very hands on and understanding and willing to help you achieve your goals. Others who are very distant and have lack of caring.
good,"Co- workers was like my family so kind and nice people"
good,"Considering the high volume nature, the pace makes the job challenging yet fun. Accuracy and excellent customer service are key. Some locations experience high customer fluctuation, making management sub-par at times. No matter the location, however, it seems that the same level of respect and appreciation for the customer reigns true."
good,I loved working at Starbucks mostly to talk to coworkers and it was such a fun environment there was always something to do and having to multi- task like crazy.
good,Starbucks is a fantastic company. They care about their partners and with a little hard work they are happy to help you advance in your career. It is a fun job where you get the opportunity to really know your customers. Know you customers by drink and name is their motto and they truly expect that which is commendable in this day and age.
good,Definetly a place to grow in management and develop life long friendships. I worked there for nearly 10 years and had a great experience there.
good,"Starbuck's has to be one of the best jobs I ever had. A day usual start at 3pm as I worked night shift. It was stressful and a fast paced job. I learned a lot about organizing money and management. I learned how to process a work schedule and how much went into day to day. I loved my partners (coworkers), they were hard working as well and they helped me learn. The hardest part was probably the food preparations, counting the waste and staying in the company exception. The best was getting the love from our grateful customers. It was an amazing job."
good,"One of the funnest jobs you'll encounter."
good,"Fun place to work with friendly employees."
good,"A typical day at work includes team work, customer service and individual work. I have learned a lot about customer service and what it takes  to work as a team. The hardest part of my job is completing difficult tasks in a timely matter. The most enjoyable part is being able to make people smile and working as a team."
good,"The co-workers is the best part. Having to juggle school and work is the worst part. Managers are awesome. It's really cool how there are classes to become a ""coffee master."" You have to be able to multi-task and at the speed of light too."
good,"It truly depends on the store that you're working at. Starbucks isn't just about making drinks, its about customer relationships and for me since I've worked here for a long time the hardest part is letting go because the culture of Starbucks is amazing and letting go of the customers that you know so well."
good,For the little time I was there it was lots of fun work there. You felt like you where wanted there and that the workers where like family.
good,Starbucks was a great experience for me I was able to work my way up to shift supervisor and learned how to handle money and lead my team to provide the best customer experience possible.
good,Starbucks was a very fast paced job but you learned so many neat things like learning how to make the drinks. You met so many different kinds of people from so many different countries.
good,"Great work environment with supportive management and upbeat co-workers. "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet and serve different types of people every single day your working there!"
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work.  People are friendly, customers were great, each shift was fun. The job however did not have a career path."
good,Excellent company to work for with room for advancement. Hard work always gets noticed sooner or later. You just have to put forth that extra effort
good,"awesome job opportunity, awesome experiences and awesome people. Great company, with awesome help, also very caring and open company"
good,"Working for Starbucks is more than just making coffee, it is fast-paced and requires patience and urgency simultaneously. From learning someone's life story to selling a gift card, it is all about the interaction with the community. There is room to move up, accessible ways to help your community, and utilities to better yourself. A great job with an amazing CEO."
good,The job was hands on and fun to do. The people I worked with were wonderful. They were understanding with all request. Easy to do. Great clients!
good,"we all know that Starbucks Coffee is one of the most busy coffee shop all over the world. It caters many different kind of people, from challenging customers to the very nice person you will ever meet. We always have this toxic days specially during peak period. but being a Starbucks partner we don't mind how hard our shift is, it's because of the positive working environment that we give for our customers as well as our partners. we really enjoy our job and putting our core values in our heart. that's the thing I really love being a Starbucks partner and I still treasure even I'm not part of it anymore. It really made a mark.  ."
good,"Delivering the Starbucks experience to customers."
good,A typical day at Starbucks was beginning with brewing coffee. Taking orders receiving payments. making beverages. I learned how to maintain calm in stressful situations. Management here was great. I had the best manager i could have asked for. Supervisors were strict but awesome people to deal with. My co-workers were the best we made time go by super fast by doing our job yet having fun. The hardest part of being a barista is all the multi tasking that it requires.
good,"Great company! Very ethical! "
good,I absolutely love working for Starbucks. They have always done everything in order to help me advance in the work place while encouraging my strengths and helping me overcome my weaknesses.
good,Outstanding Environment for the Growth and Development of Future Leaders in our country. High focus hiring Veterans and promotes awareness of our nations footprint. Amazing family benefits.
good,"A very social and diverse place of business. Everyday you're bound to meet a new customer and possibly a new friend. I enjoyed learning the correct methods of crafting excellent beverages from coffee, tea, even blended. I still use much of what I learned at Starbucks today and have purchased a personal espresso bar in which to continue enjoying what I learned there from home. Many of the coworkers including managers I still communicate with today and I would consider them each close friends, even the hardest days at work they could turn into the most enjoyable. In respect there weren't many duties I would consider difficult while working at this establishment although cleaning the store every night could at times be slightly on the dirty side. All in all it was a excellent place to work and still miss many of my days there."
good,"Era um lugar bom de trabalhar,  com ótimas pessoas competentes."
good,It was a fun job to have. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and mastered preparing coffee beverages. Handled customers at the register on a daily basis.
good,"From the moment you clock in you are very busy, not only when you have a line of customers there is always a lot to do. Training at Starbucks is amazing, you are able to learn from recipes, than work ethic and great customer service skills. Management is very good, we all are partners, so doesn't matter what level you are, we are all treated the same. Co-workers are fun, there is a lot of diversity in people, so it is a very fun place to work at."
good,Created great friendships and memories with customers and partners. I fell in love with coffee here. Training was constant and effective. The company gives great benefits as well.
good,Starbucks has taught me how to communicate better with customers and a sense of responsibility when you have to operate the cashier and make drinks and close the shop up by yourself.
good,"The company takes very good care of their employees and customers. The benefits are amazing and pay is above minimum wage. The partners are very supportive, positive, and friendly. I love this job! Just cannot relocate at this time."
good,"I loved this job so much; I loved my manager, I loved that I was always able to get hours, I loved the members at the gym. Our manager was also very friendly, very accomodating, and very enjoyable to be around."
good,"Open store and set up RTD case and pastry case, prep frapp base, weighted out coffee grinds for the day, added milk to bar fridge, add new bottles of syrup to stations if needed, prep mocha, worked drive thru, cash handling, customer service, took orders, made drinks, warmed up food when needed, cleaned store every 10 minutes, "
good,"Many early morning and evening shifts however my co-workers and the customers always made it a great day and fun experience!"
good,I was always very excited to go to work if I knew that it was going to be busy. My co-workers were awesome to be around and were very supportive. The leading shifts were great as well. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with everything going on around you.
good,"El ambiente con Jefes directos y compañeros es muy sano, así como también con los subordinados. Los días son pesados por la operación de la tienda. Las prestaciones son bastante buenas. Lo que más me gusta de mi trabajo es el trabajo en equipo y poder ayudar a mis chicos en temas como horarios con su escuela para equilibrar su vida personal y laboral. La parte más difícil de mi trabajo es no poder respetar mis horarios para yo tener un equilibrio y calidad de vida."
good,"Helping customers in deciding what coffee maker, espresso maker and coffee to get to  help them out at home. Management and co-works are extremely friendly and helpful. Satisfying the customers is the most enjoyable part."
good,overall its a fun job for college student. Working around  a group of young people can be fun and flexible hours for school schedule. Good insurance benefits too.
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic environment of working, and the co-worker 's interruption and costumer's connection are both experiences I am treasuring with."
good,"Fast pace."
good,Starbucks was awesome!! The benefits were amazing as was the company!! It is a fast paced work environment which does help make the time go by faster! I would suggest this job for many people.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you develop with the people you work with and the people who you serve coffee to everyday. The best days are when you are constantly reminded of these friendships.
good,I enjoyed working here very much. I enjoyed getting to talk to so many people. The management was very strict but very nice. The hardest part of the job is waking up at 3am to get to work by 4:45 which makes it hard to live your life.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. Great benefits and good people. You get to know your customers on a more personal level when it comes to the customers that come in every day. Sometimes it's difficult to keep up the pace when it gets busy but the co-workers are always there to support in any way possible.
good,"I am able to enjoy a fun filled day of work among a thriving company. I truly enjoy the work environment Starbucks has cultivated. I am able to go into work with a sense of pride knowing my store is warm, and welcoming to all individuals. I also really appreciate the fact that we are offered great benefits. There are endless reasons that most partners love working for Starbucks."
good,"Loved making handcrafted beverages and connecting with customers over coffee.  I loved the passion that I developed for coffee working there and that Starbucks had a Coffee Masters program that I could participate in and teach to others.  The only complaint is once I became a manager I wasn't treated with the same respect as I was as a barista.  Managers are expected to hold the hands of all of their partners and bend over backwards to meet their needs, however if a manager is in need there is no flexibility."
good,"Great company to work for. Its goals and mission. Its importance for environment and work condition for how the coffee is made overseas."
good,"Working at Starbucks is usually a pleasant experience.  Fast-paced, never a dull moment, mostly friendly customers, an overall positive workplace.  The company as a whole has great benefits and takes care of its employees, though one has to be flexible with their schedule and be prepared to work some weekend and holiday hours."
good,"Stores vary based upon who is managing the store."
good,"I would greet customers and gather orders, making sure their order was completed perfectly and that each customer left satisfied. I was able to further my people skills and learned about the management aspects of the store as a shift lead.  My management and co-workers were what made my experience there so enjoyable.  We were all able to have fun and get the job done.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with customers that were not pleased. As a shift lead I would view the problem and do everything in my power to turn the unsatisfied customer to a very pleased individual.  As I had previously mentioned, my co-workers and manager were the most enjoyable part of the job, along with the great coffee we made."
good,Starbucks is a very relaxed typical cafe environment. There are always pleasant people to work with and around (customers). There is a lot always going on much work to be done not much sitting around.
good,"Typical day at work would be to take customer orders, ring up orders on registers, make customer drink and food orders, clean dishes, counter tops and machines. Work closely with co-workers, very fun work environment. Always something to do, never standing around. Benefits are great and so is pay/ tips. Always looking for improvements and pay raises/ promotions."
good,"a normal day at work is fill of rushes,  busy, and sometime it filled with confusing when costumer name is not properly put on the bag but end of the day is just coffee"
good,Typical day would be non stop lines and beverage routines. Learned what customer service really means and how to satisfy what a customer needs. Hardest part of the job was dealing with extremely unruly customers. Best part is the family connection you make with associates. Need something with more chance for advancement though for family and personal reasons.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would consist of deployment of tasks to partners, and maintenance of till audits and organization of breaks. I learned here how marketing and business flow work. Being able to have the opportunity to manage wad ideal for me. The hardest part of the job was the early 4 a.m. arrival, and the effects of a irregular schedule. The most enjoyable part was the partner and customer interaction."
good,"Great environment, great benefits.I enjoy working for Starbucks, it's all about the employees, but sometimes mid managers play favorite. Howard is a great leader and I LOVE HIM."
good,"The values of the company are incredible,  it´s amazing to work there, have a really well tough care of employees but in support areas  its very hard, in Colombia there are just 4 Managers for areas so it´s a lot of work."
good,"Fast paced, customer service job. Learn routine and get great hours. Fun environment to work in with awesome coworkers. Learn to become a team player. Great benefits."
good,"Perfect job for anyone. Hours allow students time to study, working adults an additional income and career minded folks a ladder to climb. If you apply yourself you can acquire a well rounded business education. If you want to excel Starbucks provides the tools you need."
good,The culture makes this company great. The people are great. The benefits are great. I have nothing negative to say about Starbucks.
good,"Starbucks is *very* fast paced, and if you want the hours you have to be at the highest volume stores. The pay is minimum to average, but the free coffee beans, drinks, food, as well as the stocks, health insurance, and vacation for even part time employees is wonderful. A typical day will differ whether you work open, early mid, late mid, or close, but all day-parts will involve making drinks, ringing a cash register, cleaning up equipment and facilities, as well as some retail work. The hardest part is the hours: as a barista or a shift manager you may have to open (arrive 4:30am) and close (leave 11:00pm) several times each week! However the schedules are very flexible if you have needs of any kind. The best part is the environment. I have personally watched many people return to their job at Starbucks because of the atmosphere. Management and coworkers will change from store to store, but the air remains the same. Good company to work for, just ask Forbes."
good,Love working for Starbucks. I got to travel and work at different stored meeting other co-workers and having had the pleasure of working with some great people and great customers.
good,"It was so fun working for Blockbuster. It's a shame the company has virtually been eradicated by digital media, but there was a time for it, and it was really exciting and fun to work for them!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is also the hardest part of the job. You meet some amazing customers and coworkers who really affect your life, but the majority of the clientele can be difficult to deal with and draining on a daily basis. I don't believe the staff is paid well enough to deal with how draining it can be. Its a super fun job, and there are many benefits, but the benefits are a one size fits all kind of package that does not fit most of the sizes it is trying to fill into."
good,It's always a busy day in Starbucks but I learned that  following instructions is a number one key to have a delicious handcraft drinks. Working as a team will make a huge difference because the line up  will become smooth. My co-workers are very hard working and initiative and it is very important to have that kind of attitude.The hardest part of the job is when one of us will make a  short notice sick call and it affects our job because we need more people if it gets busy. It's hard to get others to cover the one who called in sick; The most fun part on my job is that I can try the most recent beverages and make it at the same time. I know all the secret Starbucks recipe which I feel proud of myself since I am a coffee drinker.
good,"starbucks is a company which you could learn marketing, customer service, skill development and ...etc. It's not all about yourself, it's also about a team."
good,I've really enjoyed my time at Starbucks and love the whole culture of the company. I've learned a lot of what being a team player means and also on how to be sufficient in my work ethics. My manager is fantastic and really enjoys her job at this company and she makes working for Starbucks really enjoyable.
good,started off as a barista and quickly progressed to supervisor. I loved the atmosphere and diversity Starbucks maintains. I delegated employees. open and closed premises. prepared bank deposit and made sure inventory was to par.
good,great customer service over. cleaned and worked at the cash register
good,I had many fun years a great job for a highschool or college student very flexible.
good,I love my job. I love problem solving and interacting with the customers and my partners. The company gives a lot to their employees.
good,This is the ideal position for me to share my passion and excitement about the product being promoted. I enjoy coffee and sharing these precious moments with family and friends.
good,"The culture is very friendly and people oriented. A quick mind with a sense of humor will go far in the company. You will have lots of fun with co-workers and probably make friends for life there. The hardest part about Starbucks is that despite all of the benefits packages that they offer, the pay is strikingly low and most of the people that work at the entry level, need help from government entities to make their ends meet if they do not already have a different source of income such as 2 or 3 jobs."
good,"At Starbucks there are fantastic customers and co-workers, with caring managers. While working here, I learned how to create quality with productivity and efficient work ethic. Co-workers work together with consideration and family-like approachability. The most difficult task of my job at Starbucks is the closing tasks when the business starts to pick up and the rush creates a bit of tension and stress. However the overall experience is great! After completing a long line up of beverages for customers and providing an experience for them as well, there is no better feeling than making someones day a little more special."
good,"loved working here, had to cut it short due to relocation, would love to find similar work."
good,"Typically, a day at Starbucks begins the second you begin your shift. There's no telling when the rush is going to come, because Starbucks now serves to breakfast, lunch, and dinner foods. Therefore the work environment can be slow or very fast paced. One can expect to jump between register, bar (making beverages), and drive thru multiple times on any given day."
good,"A typical day at work includes assessing and analyzing daily and weekly goals in order to achieve targets, leading and coaching partners, and providing legendary customer service to ensure the starbucks experience has been provided."
good,"Lots of responsibility whether it be with opening the safe, balancing your drawer, handing cash, depositing and cashing checks. Always being consistent with your work and paying close attention to what your doing so that at the end of the day you know your drawer is going to balance correctly. Customer service was the most important part of this job. Always having a smile on your face, willing to help customers out no matter what the case might be and making sure customers are satisfied before they leave Liberty Bank. Having leadership skills was a huge part of being a teller at a bank."
good,"Great place to work. Provides benefits, very flexible, and opportunity"
good,"A parte de ofrecer un gran trato a los clientes, tenemos la gran suerte de que el ambiente laboral es excelente."
good,"Great company, but day to day work is hard with very low pay.  For students this is the job for you!"
good,"Starbucks is a very good company to work for with great benefits. It has taught how to provide excellent customer service, work at a fast pace, multitask, and to become more of a people person. The co-workers and management work together well and support eachother. The most difficult part of my job is the compensation not being enough. Everything else was equally enjoyable."
good,"Overall fun place to work and a really good company to work for, but the turnover rate at the location I worked at resulted in it being constantly understaffed.  In the time I was employed at Starbucks, we had 14 partners leave and only had 12 fill their places.  Considering the average training time for a partner to be comfortable making drinks and taking orders was about a month, this made the workplace extremely stressful.  Management was inexperienced and communicated poorly to the rest of the team."
good,".goes by quickly due to the high volume of customers coming into the store. "
good,Really flexible scheduling! Can be stressful getting ready for QUSI and during peak times.
good,"Typical day at work, I can honestly say I love my job. not a lot of people can say they actually love the job. what I love about my job is the customer's. The customer's are what make my day go a lot smoother and easy going. the only reason why am looking to better my self is, financially. I have gained a lot of experience being with the company. I have learned to communicate. my communication skills are superb. We practice this by, delivering world-class and legendary customer service. The management there can be better, but other than that it is good. I love working as a team and my co-workers are a great example of that. We help on another when one is struggling or needs help. I can say we are more like a family. I have been with the company for over three years now and I can honestly say there is nothing I cant do within my job description. The most enjoyable thing about my job are the customer's seeing them everyday is the most enjoyable part of my job and making them satisfied with the Starbucks experience."
good,"If you have multiple jobs or are going to school, Starbucks works perfectly with your schedule. Great company to work for."
good,fun productive job management wasnt great but overall the job was great
good,I loved it it was very fast past and fun.  Management at the time was shaky and not trustworthy.
good,I loved working for this company because of how fast paced it was. The store I worked for had great co workers. Also I liked how we could work for other stores in need if we needed more hours. The one thing I would say I didn't like was the district manager.
good,"Great place to work, amazing atmosphere, great benefits, great people, and many opportunities for advancement!"
good,This job was one of my favorites although I worked there only a short period of time. I really enjoyed the customer contact.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because Starbucks is always searching for a way to better serve their customers. They are consistently finding ways to bring  the customer better beverages, food and in store experience. Keeping up with the changes was occasionally mentally grueling but I can say that it taught me how to think fast and become more susceptible to change. Change is essential for progress."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. They were completely flexible with my school hours. Unsurpassed benefits. Daily interaction with the customers were highly encouraged. Many of the customers I knew by name, their wife/husband, children, etc. I had an amazing Manager and District Manager who always wanted to know what was going on in your life. Not because they were intrusive but because they honestly cared and showed concern. Amazing company."
good,"a awesome place to work if your in school , you get tips once a week !"
good,"Surrounded by positive and friendly Coworkers and customers, Drink recipes can be a little overwhelming to learn at first but eventually it will all come together. Communicating with both Customers and coworkers make this job really fun and one of the best places I have ever worked at."
good,"Managing employees, providing excellent customer service."
good,"Considero que Strabuck es un lugar agradable , puesto que su enfoque esta en tener clientes satisfechos, me ha dejado una enseñanza de como diariamente a pesar de ser rutinario siempre hay experiencias nuevas y como dia a dia se tienen retos, aprendí que la disciplina y la constancia es que te lleva al éxito, no basta con ser una marca reconocida sino tenerle pasión a lo que haces, ser tu mismo yy autenticidad es el plus que le das a tu trabajo y es asi como aportas a tu equipo ser dinámico y pro activo ta da excelentes resultados a tu personas y tu empresa, lo mas difícil creeo es que logres como líder que todo tu equipo entienda como tal la responsabilidad que llevas dia a dia , sin embargo no es imposible puesto que si tienes todas tus herramientas bien canalizadas logras a sobrellevarlo, lo que mas me gusto ha sido definitivamente la marca, ya que es de alta calidad, el trabajo en equipo,y la pasion que se tienen por la cultura del café, sin olvidar como hay clientes contentos y frecuentes."
good,"I was mostly just in training, but it was a good workplace filled with friendly people who were willing to help me learn. A normal day at work consisted of serving customers in whatever station was necessary, whether it was as a cashier or Starbucks crew member. While I was employed here I learned how to pace myself and satisfy customers in an appropriate and timely manner. By far the best part of the job was that I was able to help people have a better day as we went through the day. Unfortunately the hardest part of the job was remembering all the drinks and how to make them, this was in the end why I left, because I realized I was unable to fully meet the requirements of the job. Thankfully management was understanding, and while I was there all of my superiors helped me along every step of the way, and when I had to leave there were no hostilities because of it."
good,"Since this Starbucks is located on Cal Poly Pomona's campus, we tend be busy all throughout the day. I have learned how to work quick and efficiently while giving excellent customer service. The management is great and I love working for my managers. My co-workers come in all shapes and sizes and I really enjoy working with them. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing the smile on a customers face after going beyond their expectations of customer service."
good,Starbucks was a very fast paced place to work. Very high standards for how they did everything. Employees we're pretty nice and i seemed to work well with most.
good,"Starbucks places a high value on work/life balance. This company has amazing benefits for all partners (employees), including a stock purchase plan and you earn shares (stock options) beginning on your first day of employment."
good,"Amazing place to work at although it got busy sometimes, its a great feeling to work with fellow baristas to get through the day."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for over six years and what I can say is that every day is truly a new day. Although your job tasks are generally monotonous, it never feels that way. Of everything I have learned in that work environment, the most important would be how to skillfully multitask. "
good,"This company know how to take care of their employees. Whether you full time or part time you are offered benifits, stock options, and other benefits."
good,"Working in Starbucks made me gained a vest experience in all aspects, high quality of customer service, running the shift by taking  responsibility of the store, working under pressure and beating sales target."
good,"Every day is a typical day at work, learned how to build a regular guest and delivering a professional customer service, management training and work environment is best can ever have to deliver the most delicious drinks. Nice coworkers, team work"
good,Great job for the person that needs flexible hour. They will make you grow in many areas
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho é a comunicação."
good,"This was a very fast paced environment and was busy non-stop.  I learned a great deal about people and interacting tactfully with them regardless of their mood or disposition,  "
good,"En verdad me siento muy contento por la experiencia vivida en esta empresa, ya que todos los partners son muy cálidos y viven una cultura organizacional muy unida. La considero como una empresa de puertas abiertas"
good,"The crowd can be immature at times, but overall, the company holds a standard I have a tremendous amount of respect for."
good,"Fast paced, fun, and fulfilling job that requires a lot of physical work most people wouldn't notice. At times it get can be repetitive, but your team and customers always makes the job worthwhile. I am the morning shift opener at my store, and I enjoy fresh coffee in the morning."
good,"Todos dentro da empresa estão conectados pelos mesmos propósitos e isso faz com que todos se unam bastantes, traçando laços de amizade e carinho muito forte entre a empresa e funcionarios, e passando isso parar os cliente, que com o bom atendimento e satisfação, voltam sempre com vontade de mais Starbucks"
good,"The culture was the best part of the job.  I rarely woke up dreading going into work, unlike jobs I've had before and after.  However, the hours are that of retain, in that they are nights, weekends, and holidays.  The benefits and perks that come with the job (free coffee) were always appreciated though."
good,"Being at work at 6 am, and getting to leave at 230 was great. I had an amazing work and home life balance. I learned all about coffee, how its made, different tastes and smells.  Management is fantastic, along with benefits and hours. The hourly pay was severely lacking. Hardest part of the job was the crazy rushes! it gets busy, and chaotic.  The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the customers! They are always friendly, and in a good mood. I enjoyed the regular customers that I had every morning!"
good,"I have been a loyal partner for 7 years.  Best job I have ever had.  Pleasing customers, seeing people smile and a quick upbeat environment to be yourself."
good,productive fun place to work.  Meeting new people from all over the world and getting to know them and what they drink.  Its almost like having an extended family except you only see them when they come into the establishment.  I love connecting with people and networking.
good,"Working for this company has been a fun and interesting experience for me. We like to have a laugh or a talk here and there with each other and customers. Starbucks allows me to meet amazing people from a local cop to a secret service officer. I am well known at my store for my outgoing, refreshing, bubbly personality and drinks. I am very creative so when one of my customers allows me too to try something new with there drink i feel as though my work is appreciated and trustworthy. My manager is awesome, she knows what shes doing when it comes too her job. My manager and coworkers/friends are all amazing and make my day every time we work together. The hardest thing about this job would probably be the hourly pay rate. All in all I love to work, I am dedicated to my work and I don't take any of it for granted period."
good,"great team, great coffee. all you really had to worry about was making the customers experience exceptional"
good,"I come to work for the customers. Im there to make them as comftorable as possible and exceed there needs and demonstrating intiative with routine tasks. My job is fun, you get to meet new people everyday and interact with such great personalities. "
good,Been with Target for years great job to work for just time for a change of paste.
good,"A typical day at work would be meeting and greeting new and regular customers. I made coffee, kept my work area clean and organized. What I learned while working for this company was that great customer service goes along way! The management at this company was good. I don't believe there was anything hard about my job, maybe just waking up at 4:00 am every morning. The most enjoyable part about my job was my co-workers and customers. Working with unique and different individuals is so much fun!"
good,"interacting with guests on a daily basis always a fast paced environment."
good,"I worked here for the longest. They used to offer a really incredible benefits, stock and retirement package. Now I hear they don't. Go figure. But seeing the same people every day (regulars) was great and I had many laughs and good times with co workers and the community residents."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. It teaches you life lessons that you can carry with you for the rest of your life as well as the importance of having values and morals. I would refer this company to anyone!
good,"Starbucks offers incredible benefits for not only full-time but also part-time employees. The company is known for it's community involvement which I loved."
good,Starbucks barista's who work part time still receive full time benefits. I enjoyed working in a fast pace and generally positive environment.
good,"Likely the most fun ive ever had at a job, starbucks always encouraged a fun work environment. My coworkers quickly became family. I felt every bit of work I had done there was appreciated and valued."
good,"Ich kann hierzu nicht viel schreiben, außer das wirklich alles top war und ich diesen Job geliebt habe."
good,My typical day is based on mostly the day of the week and also the weather. Time of day also has a major roll in the activities that I partake in that day. Management is very laid back but can definitely crack the whip when need be. My co-workers are just like a second family. I think the hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that you can never please. Most enjoyable part of my day would have to be seeing the smiles we put on our customers faces on the daily bases.
good,Everyday is different and co-workers are awesome! Pretty busy so work goes by fast.
good,"Great customer service practices, and great way to grow and network not only with other partners but also with customers who come in on a regular basis."
good,Starbucks was the most fun ever! LOved this job. Although sometimes iverwhleming it was still fun.
good,"It's fast paced, co workers are friendly and fun. We build relationships by learning and remembering their names, favorite beverages, being friendly. Making them laugh and delivering delicious food and beverages. Management wasn't too great. He would not hire any men at his store  harassed us daily The hardest part of my job was having to work when the Store Manager was there. He ruined everyone's day, he caused tension, and nervousness within us. When he left or had a day off we all had a mental celebration in our heads. You can see the difference in our moods when he was and was not there. The most enjoyable part of my day was making beverages."
good,I love working for starbucks. However I wish it was easier to move up within this company. Just trying to achieve small goals such as coffee master is difficult in this particular area. Management is ok store managers seem more inclined to make friends with baristas and play favorites then handle store issues.Shift leaders are amazing!! They all work so hard and listen to all barista and customer issues. I wish that some shift leaders were promoted to store managers faster though because they have so much experience and they know how to take care of their team.
good,"A typical shift involved taking customers orders, completing transactions, preparing drinks and food items and suggestively selling retail products while maintaining the store and my work area to a organized and health code standard. Over the years I learned to adapt to heavy volumes of customers and drinks and to manage my time and coach those around me. The management in most of the stores I worked in was mixed in ability to cope with the responsibilities that were given to them and to be honest that was the hardest part of the job most days because when the supposed leader doesn't have a plan for their shift, things get rather unorganized and the shift can degrade quickly which affects not only the product, but the customers view on the business itself. The most enjoyable part I would have to say was the people that I got to know as regular customers. I really enjoy being around people and getting to know them, even if only for a few minutes a day/week/month. It's a great feeling knowing that you are influencing somebodies life in a positive way, even if you are getting paid by them to do so."
good,having fun with the atmosphere and the career development. well management system
good,Somedays were really busy but I still had a great time serving all of the people I came into contact with. I recommend this job to a lot of students cause this company really helped me with the business of both school and work.
good,"I learned how to stay calm during stressful situations, a typical day at work could mean not stopping for a minute (except during breaks). You have to have good customer service skills, seeing as you are working with customers all day long. The hardest part of the job is making sure you are engaging with customers and remaining friendly and helpful, even when you may have a line of 10+ drinks to make and are feeling stressed out. It's always enjoyable when a customer takes the time to thank you and tell you that you're their favorite barista, it makes the stressfulness of the job disappear."
good,great company with values and standards. has a clear direction
good,"In general my days started out at 4 a.m with three shots of espresso, opening the store and coaching my team to take on the fast paced day ahead. Leading, training and cherishing the coffee world that we worked in. The most enjoyable was seeing my team grow in knowledge and speed to complete their job goals with ease. The hardest part was learning all of the coffee, teas and drink mixes when I first took on the role as General manager. The company has created their own language and passion in their guests which is truly unique and interesting to learn."
good,"A day at Starbucks is anything but easy, one may look at a barista and figure the job is as easy as can be, but in fact it comes with great stress and hard work put in in order to be successful.  Each day bring millions of customers through our doors some happy and some just waiting to start trouble.  As a barista i have to look past the bad and treat every customer as as individual and make sure there every need is met to their expectation, if they aren't happy then then i haven't done my job.  The baristas on the floor during a particular shift have to work together to get the communication flowing and help to get the drinks as well as food moving fast to the customers.  When the stress from the commotion of everyday work goes away it is a fun job.  the people are fun to work with and really help each other out and the pay as well as benefits are god as well/"
good,"The job is a fast paced environment, where one must be ready to deal with various types of situations. I learned how to manage people in a proper manner without making them fill as if they were below me. I learned how to handle situations where the solution isn't always what you want to do or how you would have handled it outside of the job but it is the right way. I learned how to separate business from pleasure, and employees and friends. I love the variety of people that i get to see and meet every day, I love making people smile and perhaps being that one person that can turn their whole day around for the better. The hardest part about my job is seeing how some situations are handled and not being able to stand up and do something about it."
good,"As shift manager of the Batesburg, Sc. Pizza Hut for five years it was my duty to insure full customer satisfaction to every customer that would come in and dine with us or any customer who ordered out to go. It was also my job to train and supervise each employee until they progressed and knew their job to the best of their abilities. I would work with them every day and was very successful and proud to see them grow so fast. I made it my duty to insure we were fully prepared for business each and every day. Some days were tougher than others as anywhere is, but we all pulled together and worked as a team to get things done. There was rarely ever a dissatisfied customer in my store and I made sure it would stay like that. I have experience in customer service, insuring food safety and food quality, maintaining a weekly inventory, unloading trucks,etc. I could do it all very well. In my second job as a customer Service Associate at Lowes I assisted any customers that needed assistance in products that needed to be ordered and set them up with appointments to come back to pick their order up. Also giving them any information about products that we sold in the store. I worked hard to find the best quality that would fit their budget.I also priced items and restocked making sure the shelves were full and neat. I ran the cash registers when needed and helped gather all the carts from the parking lot when we were too busy and when one guy wasn't enough. Again working as a team to get things in tip top condition in our busiest times. And last but not least my job as a Barista at the"
good,"In a typical day at Starbucks the baristas, shift supervisors, and store managers all work together and rotate duties.  These duties primarily include working the register, crafting beverages, and tasking/cleaning.  I have honed in on my communication skills and become even more comfortable than I already was in interpersonal interactions.  It's rare to find a partner whose company I don't enjoy, but it has happened.  Usually, though, everyone works together to maintain a light-hearted, positive, and motivating environment.  The hardest part of the job is the hours.  I tend to work PM shifts which do not get out until 12:30 a.m.  I've also worked open shifts that start as early as 4:00 a.m."
good,"Great place to work. Co-workers are hard-working, intelligent, passionate and motivated. Development and training is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I would usually be the one who would open the store with the shift supervisor at 4:30am. I enjoyed the early morning start of the day. I would set up the coffee and pastries. I loved the customer service of the job, putting the customers' satisfaction first. I enjoyed cashiering and serving the customers. "
good,"Starbucks offers a great work environment and excellent benefits and advancement. Working for this company has taught me an appreciation for the art of Coffee drinking, as well as the value of connecting with people over a mutual desire to connect over a hot, or cold, beverage. I am still good friends with all my co-workers there, and the manager was more than supportive of my personal goals. He even kept me in the system a month after I left in case my new job didn't work out. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the level of multitasking it requires, especially on a busy day. The most enjoyable part being the opportunity to make a friend with every customer and co-worker and creating a personalized drink and relationship for each person that walks through the door."
good,"A Starbucks barista has to communicate and assist with customer’s needs to create the ultimate Starbucks experience. A barista's job entails of working as a team, being knowledgeable about the products, and performing janitorial duties. Baristas follow the standards for quality drinks, merchandising, stocking, rotating and storing products. Daily duties are grinding coffee, making product, breaking down espresso machines, multi-tasking, managing time, and most importantly providing outstanding customer service follows store policy and procedures for operational flow at each station."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks but only when my manager wasn't present. She was very aggressive and disrespectful to her employees. Other than the issues with management, Starbucks was a great company to work for."
good,"Since I open twice a week, I have to place the order which comes two days later, so we have the necessary inventory to make it through the next few days. Doing the deposit with the tills from the previous day, and counting out the registers before the end of my shift."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with a fantastic outlook on the people they hire.  The company doesn't just hire anyone but they hire people regardless of their age, sexual preference or mental ability to learn.  That is something that I respect in the company.  The chance for advancement I ranked low only because of the work that the employees do.  Yes, there are some employees who can advance to shift managers or assistant managers but that possibility doesn't come to just anyone.  Job security is high but likelihood of advancement is low.  The management is very good and reasonable.  I enjoy the people I work with and love the atmosphere.  I hope to see Starbucks become enriched in what the company stands for, which is a stable forefront in the community and the ability enrich the people they serve."
good,I learned to deal with people and issues while helping them out. This job provided me with invaluable skills and I'm extremely grateful.
good,"I like the job and meet some amazing and unique people. The regular customers that came through the door end up becoming friends. If i go to my old store, people still remember me and ask how I am and how are things. Its kinda like a family. Great Job. The only con was people that wanted to move up in the company seemed to get very stress and you really don't make much more if you move to shift or assistant manager. You have more responsibility and more stress. I saw a lot of people come and go in 3 years. "
good,Nice people. Friendly atmosphere.Great pay. Transferred here from West coast. Culture shock!
good,Starbucks has taught me a lot about customer service and working with a team of individuals in order to achieve a common goal. 
good,"Typical day at work would be fast paced, sometimes high pressured, but still fun and enjoyable. It is definitely a place for people with a lot of energy and great positive attitude. Starbucks is a great place to meet nice, interesting people and the fact that a lot of communication is involved makes the day go quick, just like hanging out with friends. I have learned to time manage, I have improved my multitasking skills and learned how to tackle fast occurring difficulties and improve the situation."
good,"Working for Starbucks Lloydminster was on of the best things I have ever done. The Boss was an amazing woman, who worked alongside her partners. She would always make sure that everyone had the shifts they wanted. I moved up in the company in 3 months. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of my shift. I loved that job. "
good,"Cash handling, coaching and developing employees, generate and lead marketing programs"
good,"I worked for Starbucks Customer Relations at SiTEL and enjoyed my time there.  If there was a problem, they were very willing to help you and work with you to improve.  My immediate supervisor was a great man to work with.  I was sorry to leave."
good,"This was by far the most positive experience that I have received so far from a work environment. The employees, and management are actually a team. I loved the customer service aspects about the positions as well. Finally, career advancement at this company was at my disposal, as long as i put in the necessary work required i was promoted instantly. "
good,"I absolutely love this job! My management and coworkers are great, and so are most of the customers I deal with every day."
good,"We always managed to have a lot of fun while doing out jobs"
good,"Great company, great workers, great customers. Free drinks!"
good,"My boss, John Krass, was wonderful! He was a joy to work with and made the work environment even more enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks is a great job to have. You get decent pay, and access to awesome benefits. You learn a lot of neat things about the world of coffee. Management is hit or miss. The hardest part of the job is keeping a good attitude when you're constantly making frappachinos for people who are rude to you. The best part of the job is the co workers. Ive always made amazing friendships with my coworkers."
good,Came in every day expected to to be happy to be there.managers were fantastic. co-workers were fun to be around. and the most enjoyable part of the job was making a fun and safe environment for customers and seeing there pleased faces by the exceptional cup of coffee that i have made for them
good,To some it all up priceless.
good,It was a very fun and relaxing enviroment and the customers were great and management was always on top of everything.
good,There is no such thing as a normal day at Starbucks. This job will always be different everyday and it will keep you on your toes. I've learned to be more attentive to what customers are wanting. I also realize that something so small goes along way. Such as asking how the customer is doing or just giving away a free beverage. The management is overall awesome. They really do care about the employee's well being. The hardest part about my job at Starbucks is the high volume of the store. It does get a little hectic but if you stay focused and don't get stressed out it really is a fun place to work at. I have to say the most enjoyable part about my job is the customers and interacting with them. Most of my regulars are hilarious and are so kind.
good,"The co workers are great, the management is very organized."
good,My day consists of creating inspired moments in lives of customers. It's not just coffee. It's a smile. A small conversation. A word of encouragement and a delicious hand crafted beverage. Attention to detail is an important aspect of this job as well as working with your partners. Overall Starbucks is one the best companies I have worked for.
good,A typical day as an opener was just routine setup and prep. The managers were more like friends or family than managers (In the positive context). Great values and a tremendous focus on ethics not only for the workers but the world around us. The pay was awful but the environment made up for it.
good,"Loved this job! Greeted customers, cash handling, cleaning, and making coffee/tea drinks for the customers. I was a Barista! I learned patience, understanding, and how to really listen to people and their requests. My co-wrkers worked well as a team. The hardest part was getting tto work by 4:30 AM for pre-opening for pastry set-up. The most enjoyable part was seeing my regular customers and being a sound-board for them."
good,Fast paced job that keeps me on my toes. Understanding what product the customer wants and delivering it to them.
good,Working at starbucks has many perks the only con is low pay and hours are mostly part time.
good,An excellent work environment with strong values and ethics. Emphasis on superior customer service and customer loyalty
good,All the staff were easty to get on with and the job itself was not extremley difficult. The hardest part was clean up but this was never the same employee each night and it was shuffled weekly.
good,I love going to work managing the crew an enjoying the customers
good,"I was reasponsible for opening every morning, I was also responsible for doing inventory every wednesday as well. I worked on the cash as well as on the bar. I enjoyed working there, I had a once in a life time to start a new adventure so I took it and moved to Vancouver. If I was still in Ontario I would still be working at star bucks. I loved my co-workers and My boss was awesome"
good,My experience thus far at Starbucks has been a satisfying one. Management at my store is top notch. Co-workers are a big part of making this job enjoyable.
good,"Start my shift by counting in the safe & becoming cash controller. I serve customers, & continue a smooth flow of traffic in the store as their are usually lines out the door in the morning & in the afternoon. I clean & sanitize. Good time management skills, sending people on breaks & keeping my shift calm & as relaxing as possible."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de se trabalahar,dão otimas oportunidades de crescimento.Foi o meu primeiro emprego serio mesmo e aprendi muito com eles ,eu era muito feliz fazendo parte da empresa.As pessoas com quem eu pude trabalahar era mais do que colegas de trabalho viraram parte da minha vida...Infelismente tive q sair por preblemas pessoais mais se eu tivesse oportunidade voltaria sem pensar duas vezes.Foi uma esperiencia unica."
good,"Working at Starbucks is quite an easy and fun experience. Making drinks isn't at all difficult once you get the hang of it. The company provides great training, benefits ( 401K, company stock and health benefits)"
good,This company genuinely cares for their customers and employees.
good,It was a fast paced clean work place & I would love to work for them again!
good,"A typical day at Starbucks included spending time making sure customers were taken care of and happy with their drinks and pastries, cleaning the store, training new employees, continuing the training of existing employees, handling deployment."
good,"I would arrive to work and get set up for my shift. Counting the safe, tills, stocking, preparing coffee for the shift, preparing and dropping deposits if necessary,employee management and break coordinating, preparing for the next shift to be as productive as possible. I learned how to provide the best customer service possible, the co-workers are wonderful!!! the hardest part of the job is satisfying customers that seem to be impossible to satisfy. I take this as a challenge!!! The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer walk out happy and satisfied!!!"
good,un excelente ambiente laboral buen sueldo prestaciones superiores a la ley facilidad para relacionarte con clientes compañeros y superiores
good,-Very positive environment
good,"I loved working here. It's too bad they cut back my hours so much. I really would have liked to have kept my job!!! If I didn't need more hours in order to pay rent, I believe I could still be working there today. It can be a rough job, but I really liked it. It was fast paced, fun, I got to meet a ton of interesting people and the work was rewarding."
good,I love working at Starbucks. I love how the ability to remember someones drink can change their whole day and make someone happy they chose to order from you.
good,Productive and fun workplace
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. Unfortunately, baristas do not get paid well."
good,"La creación de bebidas relativamente tranquilamente hasta las horas del almuerzo donde surge una hora pico manteniendo alerta a los integrantes del equipo. La gerencia siempre fue muy cumplida y sensata, enseñando a cada uno de los integrantes lo importante del trabajo al igual que el placer de servir."
good,I loved working at starbucks!
good,Excellent benefits
good,Loved the people and the job it was fun and a great place to meet new people.
good,"The first month i was very nervous. As time went by, I became more open and joyful. Something about the atmosphere gave you a homey feeling. Management was very understanding and helpful with anything u needed help with. Co-workers worked well and like a real team. Hardest park was waking up at 4:30am for an open shift. Mostly, it was the best job ever."
good,"working for Starbucks was an excellent and enjoyable job. The traingin recieved was excellent and helpfull. The managment team was excellent, helpfull and loyal to there employees. The compensation for this job was not good, however it does improve with time."
good,"Starbucks is an incredibly fun place to work. The partners typically enjoy being at work, learning about different coffees, making beverages just how the customers want them. The pay is excellent and the benefits are phenomenal."
good,"Flexible hours, good benefits, fun atmosphere, great culture/values. There is room for growth, but not a lot of income potential."
good,"Early mornings were always a blur, learning to multi-task was a must. It was a joy to see the regular customers daily."
good,"cashier,stock,barista,cleaning and management was very nice and helpful when it was needed."
good,When i worked at StarBucks i felt at home. I loved my co-workers they were ery helpful when i started and very friendly. Every day i went to work i always felt welcomed and very inthused to be woking there. I learned how to be more open with my co-workers and more out going when it came to customers. Management was very help with every aspect of running a business they would actually lend a hand every now and then to show us that they care and love being behind the seens of it all. The hardest part of the job was leaving. the most enjoyable part of my job when working there was just being able to be around a second family cause every one was so worthy of working with one another and being able to have a job like that was a blessing...
good,I loved learning about coffee and making the many drink we offer. I usually open the store which means set up the pastries window after receiving and signing off the order. I have excellent customer service skills. used my organisational skills all the time. it was so fast paced and busy it was fun for me.
good,"You are always on the move, and have to work directly with the public. This can be a good thing, occasionally it is not. If you are working with a good team of people the job is fun."
good,Supervising my own crew while enjoying customer service and doing admininstrative work on my shift. Also making coffee beverages with satisfaction.
good,Open Store Procedures
good,Good place for entry level manager. Good benifits and perks.
good,I love the customer interaction.
good,I would come in midday and clean up and help costumers with orders make drinks and help with anything my manager needed.
good,"Starbucks was a very fun place for me to work because as I was helping meet customer needs, it felt like I was constantly working in fast motion due to the constant replenishment of caffeinated drinks. It was while working here that I learned a lot about company product and the process of making coffee. From my experience, the management and staff would always provide assistance if it was needed. I would say that the hardest part of the job was helping caffiene-governed people in the early mornings. Other than that, I found this job to be very enjoyable."
good,Typical day includes greeting customers and making their drink
good,i loved it they had great benifits and it was a pleasure. i had it all then i lost it all
good,"despite the short hours of hard hard work, Starbucks really a great company to work for. It goes beyond making drinks for customers."
good,working at starbucks thought me the differences between passion and commitment. i'm working there while having fun.
good,"i really like to work there, but i had to quit because my college, and it doesn't match with my hour at school , so i had to quit. i have alot of friends worked at starbucks"
good,"starbucks is a great place to work because of its friendly, warm atmosphere."
good,At Starbucks I had ups and downs as in any job. Some managers where better than others but I love the culture and my old co-workers where amazing. If you take advantage of their benefits you can really enjoy this job.
good,"Pros:"
good,I believe that this is a great entry level job. They do well with teaching new baristas utilizing a standardized training plan by designated barista trainers. You get a great sense of community with both coworkers and customers alike.
good,Busy place to work. Always on your feet  if you like to stay busy and work with other who have same interests it’s a fun place to be. Always something exciting and new coming into the store
good,Starbucks is one of the few companies in which understands the importance of their employees as much as their customers . Great benefits . Decent pay depending on position .
good,When I started working a Starbuck was really stressful because I didn’t know anything and it was very busy and I was feeling lost and confused. But after a while I learn everything was easy to remember everything really quick because with the patient and with a good coach everything was easy.
good,"Codziennie mogłam współpracować z ludźmi bardzo otwartymi i koleżeńskimi, co wynagradzało trud pracy."
good,"Always busy. If you are a busy body, a great place for you! There is always something to do and most of the customers are fun. The regulars are my favorite, make their day, get to know them and their drink! They appreciate it!"
good,I like workings at Starbucks plus the people I work with is like a family we open up at 4a I come in with a smile on my face ready to work even with it being super early I still come in like it’s the afternoon
good,"Loved every minute. Worked with awesome people, great work environment. Schedule was consistent. Management was very approachable. Overall super fun if you like a fast-paced environment."
good,"Good company, education benefits and medical insurance. It's not a bad job fairly easy. Not much needs to be said but indeed needs this to be 150 characters..."
good,Fun & friendly environment from open to close. High pace at times was the hardest aspect of the job. Learn with your partners about the service you provide & enjoy every drink that you get to create. Your customers will love it.
good,"It is fun making drinks although with a fast-pace environment. Baristas are nice, customers are friendly, reasonable salary with very good benefits such as 1 bag of coffee or tea every week, free drinks while working and a 30% discount on food! Highly recommended"
good,"On an average day I stand on my feet for 5 hours, make coffee, and talk to the customers. One of the biggest things that stands out about Starbucks is how welcoming they are to every person that walks in. It is nice to know that when my customers come in they are getting the best. My favorite thing to do at work is making coffee or standing in the drive-thru. It is fun and fast and it gives me this sense of accomplishment when the rush is over. Working here taught me how to communicate better and also how to be more independent. I was fifteen when I started and was shy, now I am almost eighteen and I talk to everyone."
good,"A typical day at work, of course depending on the weather, can be pretty hectic just have to push through it and be patient with the people. Don't always expect the people to be amazing but you will have your customers that are pretty amazing"
good,"I became skilled at typing quickly and charting necessary information related to the case I was working on."
good,Starbucks is a place where everybody fits in. They provide a safe place for many of those that don’t have anything else. It’s at a high speed pace & you get to work in teamwork. They are super big on giving employees their breaks on time (:
good,Manager was always opened to hearing thoughts and opinions to better improve partners schedules as well as for the cafe. Enjoyed my time working there as scheduling was flexible and built great relationships.
good,"I was responsible for making custom beverages and serving customers at the register, over the intercom and at the pick up window.  Also keeping the store clean and organized."
good,"Starbucks prides themselves in outstanding customer service, but it is important to note that they always put their partners first. I always felt that the company had my back. "
good,"picking product for orders, pallet building, inventory stocking fast pace job.  long hours. good job for young person who wants a career lots of room to move up in the company."
good,The best thing about working for a company like Starbucks is the community that naturally surrounds it. You not only become friends with your co-workers but your regulars that come in everyday. It's not only a culture of coffee but a community of people that come together and care for one another.
good,"I appreciated the standards Starbucks withheld and the atmosphere they created. Engaging with customers was a great practice to sharpen my customer service skills. It was stressful in the mornings and got very fast paced for someone new. If Ii didn't have to move because of my husband's military schedule, then I would have probably adapted to the pace, in time."
good,"Great job to work at with excellent benefits. Kind of hard to move up when the turnover rate is very high, other than that it’s the perfect job to have if your in school"
good,Having a lot of great people with awesome teamwork it’s a warm great welcome to come and enjoy instead of hating. What made me miss the most is mainly the great management they have set for us.
good,I worked at Starbucks for about 4 years. It was a great starter job for college and the flexibility was great. You meet so much people here and end up creating long-lasting friendships/networks. The job work is pretty self-explanatory and you learn as you go. Best part of Starbucks is their shareholders option and company discounts for other places.
good,"If you have customer service experience they will hire you. Starbucks needs you to handle cash, keep a pattern while making drinks, support the rest of the system or supervise the system."
good,This was a great first job for me as it taught me the importance of customer service as well as task management. The training was very smooth and management cared about their employees
good,Good entry level job with oppurtunity to advance after only a short amount of time working there.  Coworkers are always in great spirits and the management seems to care about my wellbeing.
good,"I loved my time with Starbucks. My store had one of the best teams and overall, the experience was worth it while i was there. That being said, upper management is definitely a disappointing mark. I understand that certain metrics have to be met, budgets have to be squared away, but no one above store manager that I met ever embodied the Starbucks mentality. It was always a negative experience with negative atmosphere."
good,"Really great team & service! Alot of fun times working shifts,great customers,pushs you to go futher and focus on customers experience while maintaining well balanced attitude and cleanliness."
good,"The culture, benefits, and the work itself can be satisfying for all people of different backgrounds and experience. The management helps each individual focus on their strengths and develop their weaknesses. It is an awesome company and a great place to work, particularly if you drink coffee!"
good,"Great, accepting environment. Perfect job for someone in school or someone who needs a flexible schedule. Good benefits and free schooling with some provisions."
good,Just be prepared to learn quickly and to move fast. By remembering all the ingredients into all the drinks at a timely manner. Everything that’s dealing with Starbucks is fast regardless but it is fun it’s almost like a daytime bartender.
good,It was a great job with amazing benefits just wasn’t for me they were all friendly and all knew what they were doing and the training was easy but this job is for like a college student or someone looking for part time ( well at this location )
good,Loved this position. It allowed for great experience in a very fast paced environment. I was taught many different parts of the overall functions of the store.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks,the fast paced environment was nice to keep busy and have time pass by fast. The most stressful part of the job as well, during rush hour we would get 10+ orders through walk-ins and mobile orders. However, once it was over it was relaxing and satisfying knowing we accomplished all the orders. My co-workers were very kind and it was easy to adjust and get to know everybody. I enjoyed being able to work in such a welcoming place!"
good,Every morning I saw familiar faces who always came in with a warm greeting. Working at Starbucks was the most rewarding job because I got to start my customers day off with their coffee and a smile and they'd come back everyday and catch up because staff and the customers become friends over time.
good,"I love the benefits and the culture within the company, I feel included and welcomed. I love what Starbucks stands for and trying to create the “third place”"
good,"Work days always fly by at Starbucks, as clientele keep you busy. Management did a great job with communication and understanding just about everything! I miss this job dearly, as it was very accomodating to my daughters life and mine as well."
good,"It was a great environment to work in, I learned a lot about how to talk to customers, how to expect the needs of customers, and how to overcome mistakes and obstacles. The hardest part of the job were memorizing every single new drink on top of the other drinks and the most enjoyable part of working there were the people, both my coworkers and the customers."
good,Although it can get busy and stressful sometimes it is an amazing place to work overall. I would recommend this job to anyone. Bonus if you like coffee!
good,"People help me a lot to be more confident. They are not only my colleagues but also my friends and my second family. Besides that, I learned about how to manage well a store, specifically in the F&B industry."
good,"This is my second time working for Starbucks and I'm excited to be back! Excellent work environment and people to be working with, plus they give awesome benefits even to part-time employees."
good,My daily work was being a part-time barista. I had a great time there when I got so many opportunities to join staff training courses and coffee tastings to enhance my beverage knowledge and customer services. Punctuality and being super fast in all you do is highly required. Starbucks' brand vision is the most impressive thing that I learned because I did see the consistency in visuals between me and my colleagues that I ever worked with.
good,"When I was working there when I first moved to Dallas I had high hopes but I wasn’t motivated, enthused, or encouraged. I was drained and exhausted, but I believe I had to do some more soul searching. So I jumped from job to job not thinking of the consequences that I now know is no good and now still I believe I still have a long way to go with me being 31 years of age"
good,Starbucks values their customers experience. They build their core responsibilities around satisfying the customers. There should always be a smile on your face.
good,"When I got into the daily duties that one need to follow while working in the store with all excitement and enthusiasm, which leads you to be a honest and fearful person. Helps you to improve your Communication skills."
good,"It's a fun and active job that will keep you busy. Can be stressful at time, but is fast-paced enough that it goes by fast. The partners are great and have become great friends, and management was always helpful and understanding as well as willing to work around your schedule. Lastly, you get really great benefits as an employee that works there and the pay is above minimum wage."
good,A typical day is very fast paced and keeps you busy. Most of the time the work is fun and fellow coworkers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with technical or mechanical issues with equipment that seem to happen every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is making beverages for customers.
good,Truly and amazing company to work for. They have good company values and really do care for their workers. They offer several benefits which i personally found incredibly helpful in other aspects of my life. I had an amazing manager who was very accommodating and understanding of my intense workload and school and helped schedule me accordingly. I have worked for this company for a few years and only have good thigns to say about it.
good,"It is a very involved customer service position, and there is a lot of technical things to learn, but the managers and supervisors were very patient teachers and made the learning process very manageable."
good,"Great workplace environment, manager was great, colleagues were excellent to work with, pay was fair and work was fair with hours and always flexible with me"
good,learned various skills in the retail location and learned the ins and out of the business. every day was different and allowed me to add in skills that i learned in training.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you enjoy working with others. It's definitely a demanding job - at least once a day you'll have to deal with a flood of people rushing through for coffee. It can be hard maintaining a positive attitude given the fast pace and the number of customers you have to deal with at any given time, but if you enjoy working fun, outgoing people and getting to know your customers on a more personal level, it's all worth it."
good,I love working at Starbucks they are an amazing company to work for and they really care about their employees. This job helped me grow and gain a ton of knowledge for wherever I go next. It is kind of a fast past job at times but you have a lot of great people that help you through it.
good,"Benefits are great, work place environment is also great, however it can be physical tiring with constant repetitive movements & being on feet all day. Extreme multitasking, patience, and people skills are needed."
good,since I was a student it worked really well with my timetable. Loved how all of them were welcoming. Being new helped a lot to get support from your seniors
good,"Starbucks has been a great opportunity. I thrive off the expectations from my manager and the phenomenal support I receive from my fellow coworkers. My supervisors do a extraordinary job at making sure we all work together as a team. A typical work day includes making handcrafted drinks such as; lattes, teas, the frappuccino and refreshers. The most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with a customer that I have gone above and beyond to make their experience wonderful."
good,"I like my work for the comfort and warmth that we create, I like talking with guests and listening to them, I love their smiles when they enter the coffee shop, I love this atmosphere of friendliness towards guests and to each other."
good,I think that every location is very different. You could end up working at a store with some not so great managers or coworkers but I feel like you would get that in any job. The Starbucks location I worked at was incredible and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Overall Starbucks as a corporation treats their employees very well. I would say the pay is low but the benefits and coffee education is wonderful. It is a job you can feel excited about waking up for in the morning. The dress code can be slightly challenging but at the same time its very flexible.
good,"Very fast pace job , very demanding job , low pay, very friendly company , making drinks and memorizing will take some time. Recommended job if you love fast pace and coffe !"
good,"Starbucks was honestly the best job I have ever had, which is why I've continued to work here for 5+ years. As a college student, it was great having the flexibility in my schedule, as well as opportunities such as going to college for free. I've met a lot of my close friends through Starbucks."
good,"During rush hour a typical day can become and will become challenging to any member, whether a partner is new or a floor supervisor. With that said I have inherit a lot of patience, listening skills, team work and most important the art on how to deal professionally with peculiar customers. Depending who is the manager and which location you are in, the work culture and ethic for the most part will be respectful and inclusive."
good,"Like any job dealing with the public, it has its frustrations, its ups and downs, and I know that the Starbucks partner experience varies GREATLY from store to store based on the manager primarily, as well as who they hire/let stay; but my experience at the cafe store I worked at was an absolute dream, and I'd recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. If you can remain optimistic, and keep a smile, customers tend to open up to you over time, and soon you'll have so many inside jokes/nicknames between them and your co-workers that they'll feel like extended family. It lies primarily within the individual baristas to maintain their positive attitude, and keep outside the store drama outside where it belongs (we've had plenty of venting and emotional time outs in the backroom, but once you're on the floor it's showtime) Strong communication and an ability to discuss issues openly without turning them into (or taking them as) personal attacks is also crucial. All of that being said, I felt closer to my Starbucks family than I do with 2/3 of my biological family."
good,"I am an experienced Manager (10+ Years), and I am looking for a new opportunity to learn a new industry and offer a strong skill set of customer service to help grow your Company."
good,I loved working for Starbucks it was a great experience and i learned a lot of different ways to make a cup of coffee. the management was sometimes aggressive but it is a fast paced company so I get it
good,"Great experience, really Helps maintain Focus. hardest part is the fast pace of the costumers and remembering all the different drinks and pastries but I love it"
good,Inadequate wage for part timer but sufficient enough if you are a full timer. It’s much better if you’re at supervisor level and above. You can get much more if your shift ends after 12am.
good,If you like to be challenged you will enjoy this job. Planning ahead and time management are skills that will be acquired through this job. The ability to smile through the pain of a busy time and to lead through is required. While it is difficult at times it is rewarding.
good,"I love working at Starbucks. Most times it doesn’t even feel like work because of how much I enjoy it. The only downside is like any other minimum wage job, it’s not a high paying job and it’s hard to make a living off of."
good,"Excellent place to stretch your skills. All about a culture of kindness and respect. You will meet amazing customers, create a fun work environment for baristas and shift supervisors and the entire job is far less demanding than anything in full service or quick casual."
good,"A typical work day at starbucks consisted of meeting our customers satisfaction with their coffee, latte, cappuccino, refresher and more. Always was a challenging job because it was so popular lines where always out the door, multi tasking, and making our customers happy."
good,It was good working for star bucks. I got to meet a lot of different people from all over. I had fun working there . This job is for young high school kids and college students.
good,Great place to work but always felt like there would be seasons where hours/income from startbucks was just not quiet enough. Maybe things have changed since I worked there.
good,"Always a perfect experience, and what really makes that is the genuine happiness/ friendly demeanor/ always welcoming and pleasant staff!"
good,"Hours are flexible "
good,"I really enjoy working at Starbucks because the other employees make it fun to work as a team. You definitely need to be able to handle stress well though, as it can be very busy and customers want to be served fast. Although baristas don't get paid very much hourly, even part-time employees can qualify for benefits like health insurance, which makes it worth it. Starbucks is a large corporation so management is very picky about how you do your job, but my manager is kind, encouraging, and flexible. I like that the company holds their employees accountable and pushes them to be better at their job."
good,"The benefits are amazing; free drinks, food, coffee beans, health care, dental, college scholarships, etc. The workplace environment is fun and fast-paced, and informative for new employees."
good,"Trabajar en Starbucks Canada como gerente fue una experiencia maravillosa, crecí en mi carrera laboral como no lo había hecho en ningún otro trabajo, es duro trabajar ahí pero las recompensas tanto monetarias como personales hacen que valga la pena."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced environment where you have to learn fast and think on your feet. They expect you to know what you’re doing and at Lone Tree, Park Meadows, they tend to be lax at training new baristas. It took me months to learn the bar and I eventually changed jobs."
good,"I personally enjoy working for Starbucks as my manager is very easy to get along with and professional. Your experience will depend greatly on your coworkers and management. The work is hard, stressful, fast-paced and hard on your body. Very easy routine though, and the skills come quickly due to the repetitive nature of the work, although it takes around 6 months to reach full competency. Benefits are amazing, free drinks and food each shift, discounts on products, and upward mobility is very good. Expect to be on your feet a lot, expect to clean a lot, and be a team player. The pay could definitely be better where I am at least (Florida) but the company culture makes me want to stay. If you are a people person and enjoy connecting with customers, have a passion for coffee, and are looking for amazing, low-cost benefits, this job is for you. If you are unreliable, lazy, get stuck on your mistakes, or are unable to lift over 30 lbs, I would suggest another job."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks. The customers can be very demanding, and you can become very emotionally drained after working here after awhile. Otherwise it's a good job that has the option to pay for your schooling online."
good,It was a great experience I loved the job and it’s perks  also the staff everyone is always friendly and that gives The time at work to go fast and easy it also makes you look foward to working the next day
good,Best place to work if you like to meet people and get to know them. Flexible hours. Great benefits 401K. Every day is different and meet new people everyday.
good,I loved working for Starbucks because they are a very reliable company that listens and cares for their employees. Their benefits are great for every type of person as well. I would definitely work for this company again.
good,"Great place to work , but it completely depends on the type of manager you get.  An be fairly overwhelming but overall I loved my time there. You must be great with customer interaction and solving issues. Organizations and cleaning is a must."
good,i love working at starbucks. it was a fun atmosphere.. i love how busy it is and i love how it feels to connect w partners and customers. I love making people happy because of what i do..
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks because of the dedicated employees and regular customers whom I built relationships with. The work was challenging, demanding, and created a sense of community."
good,"College and benefits, with coffee perks! Can’t ask for anything more. Anyone who is looking for  a job to help get them back on track for their personal goals. This is a great company!"
good,its a fun place to work and open culture to different background people. The hardest part of job is promotion in career. The most enjoyable part of the work is get great compliment feedback from customers and their satisfy smile.
good,I worked as a barista while in school. I started at a great store with a strong team. I transferred to a not great team when I moved for school. Still pretty sad that I left one super good team for one that was disorganized and an uninvolved manager. I say that to say that it could go either way. Benefits are great and definitely worth it.
good,"I was working in BRS airport durring 2 years. it was a pleasure honestly."
good,Wonderful benefits and a great culture. The company will pay for your bachelor degree without holding you to the company.  Great insurance for all employees working 20+ hours a week.
good,"Teamwork, personal growth and room to learn. Positive support system from each other. Pushes you to be better. provides you with resources to encourage optimal learning."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with excellent benefits for their full time and parting employees. The pay is a bit low, but you do receive cash tips weekly. To me, the benefits that come with the job were worth the hourly wage."
good,"I’ve worked at Starbucks for 8 years, 4 different stores in 2 different states, it’s a really good company to work for. Take into consideration working on your feet for 4-8 hours a day, it’s a face paced job with new recipes coming out frequently so you never stop learning."
good,awesome people at the store i worked at. you get a nice discount on coffee. managers were easy going but had standards. you have to be a self motivated person at starbucks. 3 shifts for early mid and late workers 10/10 place to work
good,"Leuke collegas, gezellige werksfeer. Collegas zijn echt een team en zijn bereid elkaar te helpen. Wel hard werken door de drukte van het outlet. Alles gaat erg systematisch te gang waardoor het duidelijk is wat je moet doen en hoe je dingen aan moet pakken. Daar houd ik van! Daardoor kan je erg efficient werken en veel voldoening halen uit je shift."
good,Empresa séria com ótimos benefícios e possibilidade de crescimento
good,I loved learning how to make all the drinks. My coworkers were always super supportive and kind to me both when I needed help in the store or when I needed advice for things that weren't in the store. Wonderful experience overall.
good,It is a great place to work.  Starbucks allows for its employees to grow and learn.  You meet plenty of great people and it is a great place to network.
good,"Can become busy but it keeps the day moving."
good,"The company is great, but the low hours makes it hard to pay bills. They are big on customer service and require you to engage in conversations with customers."
good,"I met a lot of amazing people there, and it was really fun making the drinks, and experimenting other ingredients and I loved seeing all the regulars come in everyday and gain their trust."
good,"I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work for Starbucks. This was my first place of employment and I would recommend it to anyone who is new to the workforce or anyone else who wants a flexible work schedule. They offered me a great place to learn the value of hard work, for this I am grateful."
good,"The pay isn't great, but the benefits mostly make up for it. Depending on your area, management is hit or miss. In WV, our wonderful district manager and store manager left, so we were stuck with terrible temporaries. They were the only reason I left, but I plan on returning in another area! Overall, definitely the most welcoming and fun place to work."
good,"Starbucks can be fun if you enjoy being busy and multitasking.  The environment can depend on what coworkers and management are like, but in my experience they've always been positive and fun."
good,An usual day at work. Learn a lot of new F&B procedures and stuffs. A good management. Workplace is very friendly. The hardest part is to make the closing shift. Enjoyable thing in Starbucks is the friendly environment among the staffs.
good,A typical day is moderately busy. Everyone is happy to come in and the interactions with the customers make the job. The hardest part is learning all of the drink standards and recipes but it becomes muscle memory over time.
good,"I loved working here. Everyone was SUPER NICE. Training was kinda bad not gonna lie, but that’s only because we get super busy in the mornings (I worked mornings) and I understand. Bid on your own schedule which was nice, lunch was paid for certain meals, overall very pleasant experience except for the very few rude customers but that’s expected. "
good,"good experience overall, depending on the traffic of the store the hours you get might vary. operation system is the same throughout the corporation store so you can also add hours by offering help at other stores"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. They are always trying to implement the third place atmosphere for not only their customers but for their employees as well. I never understood that fully until I transferred from my home town in Michigan to the Houston area here in Texas. I was lost and without a place to make me feel comfortable in my new surroundings, but my team and store made me feel right at home. If didn't want to be stuck in my house, I would go to Starbucks and read or watch things on my iPad. It is my home away from home."
good,"You are expected to be fast and accurate with your work, but most employees are willing to help you learn and practice."
good,"One of the greatest parts about working at Starbucks, is having the opportunity to develop a relationship not only with the people you work with day in and day out, but the people you serve every day."
good,"There are two different areas that you are assigned to work in over the span of a 10-12 hour work day. Both sides required speed and quality in order to have a good work day in, and the numbers never lied about the amount of effort that was put in on your part. Every day was a new opportunity to test your ability to learn more and perfect what you already knew."
good,The experience at Starbucks has taught me a lot going into my new job as far as ethics and standards that should be kept in a work place as well as being able to keep up in a fast paced environment
good,"I honestly can't think anything negative to say about working at Starbucks. They're a great company who genuinely wants their employees to succeed. They offer generous discounts, tuition reimbursement, and career advancement opportunities. I can say with absolute honesty that I truly loved going to work each day."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work when I was in between jobs I started to work for Starbucks. I ended up working close to full time hours and promoted quickly. Stayed longer than anticipated because benefits and company culture is top notch.
good,Fast placed but generally easy work. Can get stressful when customers line up and keeping everything stocked but you usually have plenty of help. Great flexibility on schedules and benefits if you stay with them long enough like health insurance and stock discounts. Pay can be a little lower than other fast food places especially if tips are low. I made around 7.50-7.80ish after tip taxes and everything were taken out.
good,"Fast paced job but it was fun once you got the hang of it, management was nice and I liked the dress code policy. It was hard sometimes when it got super busy though"
good,"great place to work, the atmosphere and culture are warm and inviting.  There are at times high levels of stress but for the most part it is fun and i truly enjoyed the experience."
good,"Starbucks has the best benefits of any job I'd ever worked. The only thing that would have made it better was if the wage were a little higher. Overall a good job, taught me a lot of skills I've used in jobs since"
good,I would suggest that for the high amount of work one does it should be higher pay. I enjoyed working with the people there it was fun. I learned customer service skills and multitasking.
good,"I would arrive at 1pm in the middle of the lunch rush until closing.  I learned about working in a team, making specific personalized drinks, as well as cleanliness and food safety guidelines.  My managers were always encouraging and insightful.  The people I worked with were always very excited and caffeinated which helped during the long hours.  The hardest part of the job was to always look at myself and see what I can do would help the store run better as a whole.  I really enjoying the variety of people you could meet in a location like that."
good,I really enjoyed my small time at Starbucks and wish I could go back and work there again but with 2 small children its hard to work the schedule. The manager and staff I work with was great and we all got along and worked wonderful together.
good,Spent two years there and loved it all. Became shift manager in less than one year. Management was good and paid attention to their employees for the most part.
good,Starbucks is a fun up beat place to work. It is fast pased and crazy busy. If you enjoy to work with people that can make you laugh and never have a minute to sit still this is your place!
good,"I love working at Starbucks. I feel lucky that I am part of such a well run team. I started working there after I had decided going into teaching was not for me and needed a next move. I began to thrive and was promoted in just over a year to shift supervisor. My manager continuously finds ways for me to thrive and use my talents in new ways. They offer great benefits not just in health insurance and sick time, but you get a free pound of coffee, free drinks, and free spotify premium. Mostly I love working with my awesome team to make great drinks and connect with our customers. I laugh a lot at work, but also we get a lot done. I don't always want to work cause you know life and tiredness, but I always enjoy myself and often leave work in a better mood then I started."
good,The connections that you have with customers and the atmosphere.The kind work environment .Making cool and delightful drinks and creating Inspiring moments.
good,Being a barista is physically and emotionally demanding.  You must hustle every minute to complete your tasks and serve customers.  You must be friendly to customers even when they are not friendly to you.  You must prepare orders quickly and accurately.  If you can do these things you will love it.  The regular customers and coworkers can turn into lifelong friends. You will be a part of a team that supports each other.  The company offers generous benefits but the pay can be a little light.
good,I absolutely loved working for Starbucks!  I was given opportunities to advance quickly and even was offered the chance to manage the training program!  The philosophy is awesome!
good,"Excellent job for learning life skills."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, it's a fast-paced friendly working environment and I would recommend anyone to work there. It's a perfect job for people still in school or for anyone looking to make a little extra money."
good,"This job is fast paced and can be stressful, however it offers flexible hours and is great for any student or person looking for a part time job as you can work very early or quite late depending on the store you work at. The hardest part of the job is the demands they put on you when sometimes they understaff, however the best part of the job is the bonds you form with your partners."
good,"I am a starbucks fan for life, I worked and made a living for myself for 13 years, it for the most part was a fun and positive enviornment to work in. I was a supervisor for 8 of the 13 years and as a part time job for a young adult it was great however once I wanted to develop and got into a lead role I definetly felt the work load was a little much, also the corporations world took over, I liked the small intemate coffee shop feel it use to hace, all in all it was a good job with good bems and people small int"
good,I really like Starbucks because i got to meet cool people and make them a drink that would help them get through the day. It helped me develop more character and i got to meet people in my community to make friends.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to get experience working with people, helping customers, and working hard. The culture is busy, but friendly and is an enjoyable place to work overall."
good,"Starbucks constantly offered new opportunities daily, with customers as well as the business itself. The management was understand and flexible when it came to school versus work."
good,"Typical day at work is very team based, a lot of encouragement to get through the ""rush"". The management oversees that everyone is taken care of in terms of time off, and other needs. I wouldn't say anything about the job is too difficult, sometimes you get a guest who is upset and  it gets resolved easily with no harm no foul. Most enjoyable part of the day is working with your team, and interacting with the guests."
good,"I was an opener and Starbucks. I always started by setting up the pastry case and prepping the store for the day. i learned hoy to multitask and memorize all of our customers drinks. I really enjoyed learning about coffee and all of the work that goes in to making one cup of coffee."
good,Genel olarak Starbucks'ın çalışma ortamını seviyordum. Kurumsal bir şirket olmanın hakkını veriyorlar. Gördüğüm eksikliklerden bazıları her zaman müşterilerin haklı olmasıydı. Sonuçta ne kadar işimizi iyi yapsakta müşterilerin bazıları terslik çıkarabiliyorlar. Yaşadığım diğer eksikse işe sezonluk alınanların SHAYA ürünlerinden indirimli faydalanamamasıydı. Çalışma ortamında ötekileştirmeye sebebiyet veriyordu.
good,"Flexible work schedule with weekend requirements. Hands-on/ front-line management of complete store operations with multiple contacts of support from senior leadership and corporate. Management of staff consisting of PT employees, responsible for training, coaching and developing them within their roles. Report to a District Manager with business metrics and attend monthly meetings to create growth plans based on seasonal marketing campaigns."
good,"working at Starbucks you cam tell you are a family, everyone generally gets along which makes the whole progress more enjoyable. i have worked there for over a year now and everyday im still ready to go to work."
good,"Just like any job, the store you’re in and the management team play a huge role in your success with the company. I was fortunate enough to have both. I experienced both poor management and excellent management and it made a world of a difference. Feeling supported is the biggest help when working at Starbucks. The job is fast paced but extremely rewarding, the benefits are great and with a good work ethic you can go very far in the company."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, the environment is fun and exhilarating. I enjoy working with carefree people who like to have fun at work, but also get things done."
good,Great place to work making coffee is awesome. Wish I could’ve stayed longer. I was in school at the time and had two jobs. I had to leave to refocus and get somethings together. But great company.
good,Thorough training program. Supportive partners (employees/peers). Pay isn’t on par with places around it but the benefits are all there. Partner can receive benefits after 20 hours a week.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, it was super busy but I loved it. If I could go back I would. Making drinks, making people smile for just a cup a coffee was my favorite!"
good,"Working at Starbucks really has incredible benefits and if you enjoy fast paced environment (like I do), it is the place to be. It really depends though on which location you are at and the temperament of your shift supervisors and mangers."
good,Love working here!! Training is super easy! Just make sure you pay attention and take notes!! Team work always makes the dream work! Always set the following shift up by doing preparations and help clean.
good,"Starbucks is a fun and social workplace with high potential for advancement. Starbucks cares about inclusion and employment equity. Days are exciting and frequent changes in position/roles throughout the day keep you mentally stimulated. Employee benefits are great if you are looking for long-term employment with Starbucks. Starbucks is a great place to work for students, as there are great benefits for students such as tuition bursaries available after one year with the company."
good,"I actually worked for Teavana where I was heavily trained in tea and tea culture.  I learned a lot about the process of growing, processing and making of tea.  The Managers were always horrible.  Out of four bosses only one was decent.  Workplace culture was full of positive teamwork from the co workers.  Hardest part of job was the stressed out, demanding Managers.  Most enjoyable part of job were the co workers and educational value of the product."
good,I loved working at Starbucks from my first day there. The people who work there are probably my favorite part of it. I met many beautiful souls while working for the company. I also personally resonate with the companies values which is what drew me to the company in the first place. My overall experience working with this company has positively affected my work ethic and has helped me discover several skills that I apply to many aspects of my life today.
good,"It's nice to come into work and make drinks and help customers out as a team with a collaborative effort. Over time you learn the recipes and are able to complete the drinks quickly, making it more fun to work there. Of course it was always a great feeling when customers were happy with their drinks. Just like everywhere you will get some customer complaints but they're usually minor and your team is there to back you up! Overall, very fun and if I wasn't busy pursuing a medical career, I would gladly come back to work again."
good,"Great overall experience at Starbucks, awesome management and team bonding. I would recommend Starbucks for anyone who is in a transitional season in their life."
good,"Starbucks is as absolutely incredible company to work for. My coworkers are a breed of their own, without them the job wouldn’t be the same. But more importantly, the company cares about each individual employee, whether it’s a having a flexible schedule, helping out financially, or allowing their employees to attend an online school at no cost (ASU). I highly recommend Starbucks as a company to work for, they go the extra mile for every single employee."
good,"Very fun place to work at, flexible hours and unlimited coffee supply. Able to work flexible hours while attending school. You are able to create your own schedule."
good,The job was mostly fun. People are very particular about their coffee beverages and orders can get a little weird. The training process is amazing. They take the appropriate time you need instead of what they think it should be. The pay isn't as great as it should be when you consider the average beverage is pushing $4.00 and you sell so many! It is a team effort and the tips are split evenly.
good,Starbucks was such an amazing opportunity at a young age to teach me the customer service I still use to this day. The company it self has so many great people and advantages
good,"Hour pay sucks but they make up for it with health discounts and paid time off "
good,"Enjoyable place to work, lots of customer interaction, varied days. You learn a lot about the difference between the blends of coffee which gives you pride in the places you work for."
good,"There is a lot to do to work at Starbucks standard. Opening the simple, get to know regulars. I was picked to train new employees and l really enjoyed training."
good,"What you get with a larger corporate entity is great. Take advantage of all the perquisites to get the most out of the work! The pace of change is constant and innovation can be hard on infrastructure, but their vision remains strong and they care most about people and connections. If you can’t see that through the corporate demands, it’s not the place for you. It can be a headache and not all the stuff that comes down is to your benefit or the customer for that matter. But, that being said, it’s a great place. Find a store you like!"
good,Being able to interact with your customers is a must at starbucks. Everyday I met new and interesting people who i loved getting to know and talk to. I also loved interacting with all the regukars that came in!
good,I’m not a fan of coffee but the Only down side to working is being on your feet all day but other than that working at Starbucks is fun. Great people and you only get a few bad customers ever once in a while
good,"•	Welcomes customers by determining their coffee interests and needs."
good,"My direct boss supported my role and gave me the flexibility needed to do my job. I was able to travel and meet some fantastic Starbuck partners and affiliated suppliers. The company focused on providing the best for their customers. It was challenging, but rewarding. I was able to broaden my field of expertise and gain additional business acumen."
good,"I love working for Starbucks, but like any food service job managers will call you at the drop of a hat. Tons of discounts and compensation. Would recommend to everyone"
good,"I worked at Starbucks several years ago, and really enjoyed it. People working at the retail stores are very passionate about coffee and meeting the customer’s needs, which I loved. The managers I had (I transferred once when I moved) we’re great, and it seemed like they were being developed very well. Overall, I loved working for this company, but sadly left because I needed more compensation for my living situation."
good,Good enviornment for growth and committment. Managers and employees really work well with you and are understanding to most situations. Although slow on the transferring process.
good,Great company to work for. Consistent hours and a great environment. Always had fun during shifts. Believed in their products and always had great quality
good,The Job Is Very Chilled. There is nothing Really Hard About The Job. The Big Part Are When you Have Rushes You Got To make Sure You are Focus Pay Attention They Customers Will Be Coming Fast
good,"A typical day as a barista consisted of helping guests almost constantly from the time you clocked in to the time you clocked out. Down time was typically utilized to clean, restock and prepare for either the next influx of guests or the end of the shift. With each level up in management your job consisted of everything already mentioned with the addition of helping your partners (employees) achieve the company's goals as well as the partners' personal goals."
good,"I've enjoyed my experience working for Starbucks. Great benefits."
good,The people that I worked with were fantastic! The benefits are very flexible and very accommodating! It made me feel like I'm not working whenever I start my shift.
good,i loved working with my manager and coworkers and the relationship between workers and customers was extraordinary but unfortunately the store closed which lead to me changing my job
good,At Starbucks we are able to do our jobs while having a little fun.  At the end of the day our job is always completed.  The environment is always laid back.  everyone is down to earth and we are all like on big family.
good,"Ambiance de travail agréable "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks could either be hectic, or relaxed. Normally the latter. Everyone at my local store is phenomenal, and has done nothing but to aid me in advancing mt skills and helping me with things such as applying for benefits, recipes, company rules, and even me personally. The customers and the people you work with could either be the worst part of the job, or the absolute best. As a barista, it is essentially half of your job title to curate this experience, ironically. I've picked up many marketable skills and also many personal skills from my fellow baristas and my upper management, that are nearly invaluable. For a first job, it might be overwhelming or counter intuitive at times, but the experience, benefits, skills, and friends you obtain working for this company are the quintessential reasons for working here."
good,"My manager overall was amazing. The store manager really determines how your whole experience at Starbucks is, but if you take the time to look for one you like, you’re in for a decent job that’ll do good."
good,"The company treats it's people like people, meaning no one talks down to you. They don't demand the impossible just the very best of yourself and that makes all partners feel worthwhile which translates to great customer interaction. If the customer is happy they will continue to return because of the great atmosphere provided by happy partners."
good,Good job with good benefits especially for part time. Fast paced atmosphere and m very corporate and by the book but worth it for the pay and benefits
good,"You would go in and your shift would pretty much fly by because you always had something to do. There was never a dull moment. I learned a lot about the food service culture and how customers tend to treat food service staff. The job was fun, and everyone was really warm and inviting. The hardest part of the job was waking up and getting to work by 4am, but if you're a morning person you should have no problem doing that."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks mostly for the simplicity of the job, a typical day was pretty steady and fast paced. I learned to be more confident when talking to customers and how to be really occupied but at the same time have a friendly conversation with the regulars."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involves interacting with your team and customers as they come through the cafe and drive thru. As a shift supervisor, I am in charge of deploying my partners and dividing tasks among all of us to keep the store running properly and efficiently.  I have learned a lot about time management through this position. I also count and par tills, along with counting items for inventory. The workplace culture is all deeply rooted in team work and making sure we create best moments between partners and customers. Which can also be sometimes the hardest part as well. In the midst of chaos we want to make sure we are still connecting with our customers and remaining calm during the busy times."
good,my experience was not great. but overall the company is good to work for. thank you for the opportunity but i a m over it personally. i tried to grow but NJ people are rude.
good,Very good job. Great benefits. Free coffee. Great coworkers. It’s really a great place to work for. If you are looking for an entry level job that you can work your way up in then I would suggest Starbucks.
good,"A typical day consists of lots of people and fast paced drink making. You will definitely learn how to multitask and move quickly. The management is very supportive and helpful. They have always been ready to jump in where needed and provide support. The work culture is Amazing! Everyone around seems like family and we support each other in our decisions in and outside of work. The hardest part of the job would be the stress level. It does get very busy and it is a physically exhausting job. The best parts of my job is being able to work alongside friends, and being able to make personal connections with our customers to hopefully make their day a little brighter."
good,"Fast paced, 10 minute breaks not enough. Great discounts across the nation. Great part-time job if you go to school. I just wish they’d ed Pat more for those who do more"
good,"I typical day will consist of a lot of cleaning, prepping and talking. lots of movement, you are basically never standing still unless you are on a break"
good,Everyone who I meet everyday is good. And Coworkers are also fantastic
good,"The people you work with and meet at Starbucks are amazing, its really a fun place to work and get to know people. The free college education, food and coffee mark outs, and health insurance at only 20 hours a weeks is a wonderful plus as well."
good,"My shop in Yardley had lovely team spirit! We would allocate tasks and prepare for day and night crowd. I loved being a barista but wanted to advance more in my pursuit of being an English teacher so I transitioned out of it. For an entry-level job, Starbucks provides health benefits, 401k benefits,and eventually grants and stock options. I stayed at the entry level while my co-workers went for advanced placements."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fantastic! I loved the high paced environment and the challenge to make the personalized drinks for the clients. If you cant handle being consistently busy, this isn't the right job you."
good,"Love my job just hated the disrespect from customers every so often. Never gave a costumer a hard time either way. I wouldn’t take this opportunity away for anything, this job taught me things. And i also really love the frequent customers that come in and put a smile on my face."
good,"I love it at Starbucks! Free drinks and a food item per shift, good benefits, great people, amazing customer connections. Easy and face paced. The cons are how early shifts start. I get there at 3:30am or 4am most mornings."
good,"Excelente empresa, excelente para trabajar 24 hrs a la semana"
good,"Starbucks is a great place too work, offering a verity of befits and being flexible with your schedule, but the downside is the pay rate at Starbucks is low so it has its pros and cons on certain levels"
good,Love the work here was a learning experience. Made lots of drinks for customers love customer service. great teamwork overall and made plenty of new friends.
good,I enjoyed all of my time at Starbucks. Management was very nice and caring and my coworker were great to work with. This was a great place to work while going to school
good,Great culture for coffee a lot of busy minded people so if your not on the go kinda person then you'll most likely hate every one you serve. The staff can have a lot of fun still however.
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced place to work. There is a lot of turnover in employees and management. In three years I had 4 different managers. There is a lot of cleaning and heavy lifting but I feel like that should be expected. It was a fun place to work and building relationships with customers and coworkers was awesome."
good,"Starbucks teaches you how to multitask and become a team player. It also strengthens your memory, learning all of the drinks they serve. They teach you to follow directions and processes. This is a great first step to get into the work world and if you like people this is also a good place to be."
good,"If a student, this job is perfect for work life and school stresses as it ices to learn and maintain. Benefits are good, and the free coffee will become your best friend"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con crecimiento y sobre todo muchas capacitación"
good,Great company with good benefits and job security and advancements. Allows partners to help make every customer's day truly better or off to a great start.
good,"Amazing but I wanted something different, the experience I’ve gained at Starbucks is definitely something I can take into the future. Starbucks has really helped me become the person who I am today, has molded me to the best customer service rep I can be."
good,I learned how to communicate well with customers in a fast paced environment. I was able to master the drinks as well as give advise to customers that came in.
good,Starbucks was a fun and competitive environment.I always felt like I was being challenged and management cared about my person growth with the company
good,Great place to work especially anyone interested in going to school. Flexible with hours. Fun and always learning new things about coffee and pastries.
good,"Working for Starbucks has been fun and exciting. I  had a great time working in a youthful environment and was given many opportunities to develop within the company. "
good,It is great to work at Starbucks because partners are allowed to be themselves and voice their opinions to those running the company. Starbucks supports it's partners during hard times and rewards when applicable.
good,I came in at a time of management change ending with a new manager who's new to the business and management. The entire area was going through a major change and it was the busiesttime of the year so things were hectic for a bit. Job security is definitely not an issue and nowthat things are getting on their feet it's much better. Chances to move up with being open to learning and working hard. Overall I enjoy the work.
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for a while and they are dedicated to their employees. Sometimes it may not seem so, but ultimately, the benefits outweigh the cons by miles. Great managers and partners enhance the experience. Most importantly, you grow here and learn skills that translate to other jobs. There is a place for all walks of life at Starbucks. That is one of my favorite aspects of the company."
good,"Overall, I feel Starbucks is a great place to work. It can be used as entry level position to gain experience while attending college or it can be seen as a career. Starbucks frequently promotes from within. I have former coworkers and people I trained personally who are now becoming store managers and so on. It is by no means an easy job but Starbucks will prepare you for future endeavors without a doubt."
good,Have enjoyed working within a diverse community and was able to help provide jobs to opportunity youth.  Have enjoyed sharing my love of coffee with partners and customers
good,Starbucks taught me a lot about management and responsibility. Lots of on the job training. The district managers were great! I only left because a non weekend working job was offered to me.
good,"I worked at a branch in the middle of the city next to Christmas markets and although very busy I did enjoy my time working there. I was technically a barista however I didn't make any drinks but rather I cleaned, collected mugs, plates etc. and kept condiments stocked. really good pay, flexible hours and over all a chilled atmosphere despite the constant flow of customers."
good,"Started when I was 16, and fell in love with my fellow partners, the benefits and the core beliefs of Starbucks. Pay is always above min wage and plus you get tips distributed among everyone. Very strict sanitation standards, and the store manager usually has a good grip on scheduling and accommodating people. Full time, my shifts are usually 6-8 hours and with every 6 hours you get a 30 minute unpaid break and 2 10's if you have an 8 hour shift. I worked at drive-thru stores which are HECTIC so I'd recommend a cafe store. The first 3 months I was so lost and confused but if you survive and get over that hump it's really satisfying seeing customers happy to see you and make drinks that people really look forward to."
good,"Great place with friendly coworkers, everyone has been assigned their own duty and it goes very smoothly.  It was cool learning about stuff like milk steaming techniques and tasting different coffee blends and etc."
good,"I really enjoyed my experience with them, but the higher ups like District managers and even store managers don't know any how to treat workers, its very number driven and less of the experience given."
good,"It’s been my favorite part time job. I wish I would’ve applied here when I was 18 and not at 21. I’ve grown a lot working here. I love the people I work with and I enjoy working here. Most customers are really pleasant and it’s a nice feeling to have people happy to see you when they come in for their coffee. Just today, there was a customer who came in and told us that even though he has a coffee maker at home, he comes in for a coffee at our store because he loves to see us. It’s such a positive place to work compared to other places I’ve worked at. I’ve also covered at various other stores and I’ve had mostly great experiences with all the Starbucks partners I’ve worked with. It’s a great place for people who like to be a part of a team."
good,"its a great company that gives lots of benefits even for part time, depending on how busy of a store you work at its very fast paced and very team oriented."
good,"A great company to work for and they offer many benefits. At times, it can be stressful and fast-paced. Be prepared to provide exceptional customer service."
good,"I enjoyed my time there and would consider returning. Overall the company treated me well, but I did have problems at individual stores which I feel like had more to do with being in a very small, but very spread out district. Although I would return there, I would not consider taking a position other than barista as I experienced little satisfaction in being a shift supervisor."
good,Truly loved working here and recommend this job to anyone looking for a flexible part-time/full-time job. Starbucks really works around your other schedules which allows you to be flexible with another job or school.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. They strive to make customers number one. Their employees are treated as family and can move up in the company if they meet the expectations. I have learned so much while working at Starbucks. My experience has given me so much more confidence in myself and the job that I now know I can do.
good,"Following a carefully structured protocol to progress and become a loved barista."
good,Ótima empresa para se iniciar no mercado de trabalho.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a wonderful time. It is one of the few jobs that I was actually excited to go to every day. I was in a great area, but I know that everyone's experience is different depending on their team and location."
good,"One of my favorite jobs, good company. No complaints. I worked here for a year. My managers were understanding and professional, while also friendly. My coworkers were awesome. Flexible schedule while I was attending school."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks because there is a range of duties that employees must work at being proficent in. Mistakes are not taking too seriously which allows one to be more comfortable working yo improve
good,It's a good company for a young person to work at. it's a great starter job or seasonal or part time job for anyone looking to make extra money and receive some benefits. Great for learning customer service and retail. Great for someone who is retired as well.
good,"I love working at Starbucks, getting to know regulars and bonding with my fellow baristas. I love getting to know the customers who come often, it makes the customer connections strong."
good,"Great job and wouldn’t mind doing it again!"
good,"Flexible hours, always possible to obtain more work hours, perfect job to build communication skills and leadership skills, and perfect job for a college student."
good,very fast environment with hard-working teams and some great managers.  some pros are benefits and stocks and cons would be late nights (almost 1am) early mornings
good,"Nice environment, fun people. Got free coffee, nice pay and got to meet new people from everywhere, the customers were nice, the only bad thing was we only got tips at the end of the month and they were divided between all of us."
good,Work is good. I enjoy my work day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rush and maintaining long lines while keeping customers satisfied. Good customer service is a necessity.
good,"At Starbucks I was able to have flexible and consistent hours weekly. They have great benefits for employees as well, such as a 401K and stocks. I didn't always love the pace, but it was a good experience and taught me how to work hard."
good,Friendly managers and co workers. They give the ability to float to other starbucks if they need you also you get paid plus tips weekly. They train you on how to make new drinks for every season.
good,I would really love to work at Starbucks again. The work experience was fantastic Nd the relationship I formed with my customers made me enjoy work even more.
good,"Starbucks was an amazing experience for anyone that wants to learn how to make beverages at an extremely fast pace. The environment was great, the workers constantly asked if I or anyone needed assistance with any issues. The manager always made sure to help out when the job became extremely busy which is why Starbucks Inc. is an amazing job that hire great friendly people."
good,"Starbucks has an awesome culture and is accepting of all walks in life. Within a month of working at my location, I was promoted to a Shift Supervisor and within 6 months of working there, I received 2 raises for my dedication and hard work. I would definitely consider working there again."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. It is a fast paced environment and the overall the management is good. The environment exercises your people skills with customers and fellow partners. The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes along with keeping up to all of the health codes while helping a long line of customers, during the rush hours it can feel like it is understaffed, but most of the time it is fine. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and fellow partners."
good,"Starbucks is a really fun workplace, and I improved my up-selling, customer service and of course making coffee skills there. I love people there, my coworkers are some lovely people who are always taking care of each other and help each other."
good,"Working at Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs. It taught me good customer service skills while working in a fast-paced, stressful environment. The best part was just going into work having fun with what I do while also getting to meet new people."
good,Starbucks is great company to work for. They offer a flexible schedule in a positive environment. The only negative is that they don't pay a living wage.
good,"Es un ambiente muy divertido si estás con el equipo correcto, sin embargo no se separa la vida personal del trabajo. Tiene mucha oportunidad de crecimiento.. "
good,The hardest was probably making the drinks but its also the most enjoyable part. I was in kentucky so i mean it was interesting for sure. I would definitely recommend working at starbucks.
good,"Working at Starbucks was great but since I had moved and didn't have a car or a license at the time I no longer could work there. A typical day at work was different at my previous store because it is a travelling store. It's constantly busy but sometimes busy is nice because it makes the day go by faster. Management is okay, I can't be too rough on them because they turned the store right side up after it was down for some long. I can understand why they were stressed.Workplace culture is everyone works as a team. You are all there to give the Starbucks experience. The hardest part of the job is that you have to learn fairly quickly, you have to be on top of the ball. The most enjoyable part was making connections with customers who I got to know more and more everyday. I have old regulars who if they see me will always stop to say hi and for that I'm forever grateful I got to meet those people."
good,"Working at Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs to date. My co-workers were always helpful and friendly, we were all like family. The job was fun and interesting and kept you busy all of the time. The benefits are awesome and everyone really got to know and love the customers especially the regulars. Great place to work!"
good,"My experience at Starbucks was not great, but not terrible. I had an amazing manager that was kind and so down-to-earth. My supervisors on the other hand varied. One was terrible, which made work miserable for me there.  Other than that, the environment is super welcoming and I have learned a lot from this job. I have learned how to deal with a wide range of people(some very terrible people), make drinks and work cooperatively with my workmates."
good,"My store can get busy, especially in the drive thru but everyone works in a cohesive group so things usually run smoothly. During down time, it is cool and everyone gets along."
good,"Starbucks offers a culture I find unmatched in most companies. They provide a safe stable work environment, world class training and advancement opportunities. Through the connections with both the team and the customers I learned a great many things about customer service, leadership and overall functions of a supervisory position."
good,I've learned many skills about communicating within a company as a co-worker and how to communicate as a worker to a customer. I've also learned how to multi-task and time management like never before thanks to Starbucks. My leadership skills have blossomed while working for this company by becoming a passionate trainer and then shift supervisor.
good,"I enjoyed working in a Starbucks. However, I did not care to work for Target. I had worked in the Starbucks kiosk in a target and though Starbucks was good, everything else could have been much better."
good,"Como experiencia personal, la tienda donde yo uve la oportunidad de trabajar me ayudo mucho a aprender demasiado, ya que la plantilla y el jefe con los que trabaje de la mano fueron parte clave de la satisfacción que tengo sobre la tienda y la marca"
good,"I was a supervisor at Starbucks. The working environment is extremely good and partners support each other. We call partners to each other instead of the supervisor, so that all the partners feel close with each other. The salary and benefits they offered in the beverage industry are definitely competitive. I have learned how to manage a team and become a team leader in a crew. The hardest part of the job would be caught up the learning process. The training period is minimal; therefore, you have to be a fast learner."
good,"I learned the basics of customer service, how to handle disputes and understand how to provide people with a positive attitude."
good,"Great coworker, flexible hours, interesting job and brilliant management."
good,"I'd usually get in and start with opening the store with one Barista which included turning on all the machines, prepping the teas, coffee, and sauces. I'd then move to cleaning tasks which was basic cleaning jobs like windows and dusting. I'd usually have to assist the other barista(s) intermittently. Then I'd move to an order if necessary which included ordering inventory. Next I'd move to a pull which included pulling out inventory for use. All the meanwhile giving out breaks for myself, the first barista and whomever was on the floor by this point. After finishing all this, I'd begin really assisting the store for business including restocking, double bar, double ringing, and food orders. In between major rushes with heavy loads of customers I'd begin cleaning and prepping the store for the next shift supervisor which included dishes, trash, floors, inventory prep, and restocking inventory."
good,"great company, amazing leadership. great growth opportunities. "
good,Is a great time first job for people who do not have much experience with cash register working with other people or speaking with customers getting good experience in the Drive-Thru
good,very fast paced but I've learned a lot. would recommend for younger employees or people looking for career advancements. love seeing customers faces when they received their drink and were happy with it.
good,"O ambiente é muito agradável para trabalhar, a cultura da empresa é excelente e valoriza muito o funcionário, eles prezam muito por um bom treinamento."
good,"Every time I go to work I am excited to be with my co-workers and interact with customers. Love the environment and the people I get to meet. Learned how to have a conversation with strangers, work as a team, and work efficiently."
good,"Fun workplace with fast paced days and good people, days don't end too late allowing a good work life balance, salary could be better for the pace of the job."
good,"Great company culture. Can be stressful if you work at high volume store but overall fun work environment! Benefits are great if you choose to utilize them such as healthcare, free college through ASU, bean stock, etc."
good,"Starbucks not only turned me into a competent barista but also taught me how important it is to be a leader. I had no real noteworthy work experience prior to this job and felt helpless in the beginning but now, I feel as if I can do anything because of how they train you and build your character into someone who can deal with difficult situations no matter how bad it gets. This let me become confident and in return, I wanted to help my workplace become a better place and overall I can definitely say I have become a better person not only at work but in life. I still keep in touch with some of the partners I met years ago unlike most workplaces because of how strong they teach you to build lasting relationships. I highly encourage those who need a good place to start out to apply to Starbucks as it will help them improve not only in the customer service industry but as an overall human being."
good,"I would always recommend. The only disadvantage is the pay which is big for a lot of people, but if you have wiggle room it's the best place in this pay realm of fast food service."
good,"Starbucks created a healthy team dynamic, and encouraging workplace that had room for growth and followed their mission. Benefits were a big plus for working here as well. Plenty of transferable skills."
good,"It was a great place to work at but very challenging, everything was new to me but I managed to work it through. Coworkers are great but you must have patience to try to learn everything since they get new drinks like every week."
good,A typical day at work involves leading a team to create hand-crafted beverages that drive customer connections and meaningful relationships. The workplace culture is warm and inviting. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to meet new people and learn something new about the community every day.
good,"Very easy job. Once you get the hang of making drinks, it is a breeze! Plenty of breaks and benefits make the job even better. Definitely, recommend for any age."
good,"It was a great job for working in high school, and paid off for developing team building skills quickly. The job had decent hours for anyone who is not too picky on times."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, only thing that pushed me away was management. It’s such an amazing environment, it’s constantly on going which I love. 💞"
good,"Overall great company to work with. Great benefits. Depending on if you're in a cafe store or a mall locations management may not be flexible with your availability if you're also a student. High expectations to constantly be bubbly, energetic (obviously friendly), and will push you out of your comfort zone especially if you're shy. Learned a lot about myself working here and definitely helped me grow as a person. Fast-paced environment to keep you mentally stimulated. I learned quick and showed interest in being promoted and was promoted within a year of working for the company. Fun environment and ""Third place"", but you will always have staff you don't get along with and management you bump heads with."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. Even though it was stressful at times, it was also fun and a good learning experience. Benefits are really good. Free food and beverages while you work is a plus."
good,"Our job is simply to make someone smile. That's it. We make coffee and we make eye contact, and our sole duty is to make sure each customer leaves feeling like they were seen as a human being for the length of their stay. We are policy and culture driven, and following guidelines is easy at Starbucks given the encouraged atmosphere of teamwork. Everyone helps, everyone supports and appreciates each other. If I could support myself and my child on a full time wage there I would never leave."
good,"Un día típico en Starbucks (para mí), fue empezar a las 7 de la mañana, ya sea en la elaboración de bebidas y alimentos o en caja."
good,"I worked at a high volume drive-thru location, with a highschool next door walking distance. The job was a great team building experience. I really enjoyed getting to bond with coworkers, but also having a personal connection with customers! Seeing my regulars every day really brought a smile to my face, especially the fact that they would come to my specific location for the service and connection I provided."
good,This company exemplifies exactly what it means to take care of your employees. Many benefits to help from baby planning to college fund. They work with your schedule. Free coffee.... its just a great place to work
good,Loved the environment to work in and how fast paced it was. Loved working at Starbucks and writing on people’s cups. My favourite was working the morning shift and giving all the orders to the same people who come in the morning. Remembering drinks and orders. They always had good breakfast lol.  I would work 5:30am-10:30am like every morning but I loved it.
good,"I had a great time I worked there for three years, they are a little biased on age and even though I had several raises I never got promoted because I was too young"
good,the workplace is very fun. you learn a lot of things about people and coffee. The things that happen in the coffee shop is very interesting because you get to see what different type of coffee people like.
good,I enjoyed working there because of the friends I had made. Everyone was like a family and helped each other out. We worked together and was fast paced.
good,Starbucks Coffee co. is an amazing company to work for. They really care about their partners. They also make a great work environment for everyone so the staff feel comfortable to be there.
good,The customers were often rude as I worked in a mall that was very close to a few schools and the coworkers had a great positive attitude towards everything and encouraged you to learn.
good,It was a good learning experience. I made a lot of friends there and learned most of my customer service skills there. I worked at 2 different locations. Both were great.
good,"I enjoy working with this company. Meeting new people that walks in the door. Asking customers ""how their day"" or ""what do they have plan for the day"" just made me feel a personal connection to get to know the customers. There was some days that was bad but over i can turn that frown upside down."
good,"- great managers and enjoyable environment, welcoming culture"
good,"As long as you have the confidence , strong communication skills, willingness to learnd and No bad attitude you are qualified in this multi national company that serves the finest coffee around the globe."
good,"Great place to wrok while you're in school. Accomodating schedule. Very faced paced, guests can be picky and difficult but overall still a great place to wrok."
good,"- Flexible hours"
good,"Some of my nearest and best friends (including my now wife) were met at the many Starbucks I worked at. The work is intense and can get overwhelming, but can be therapeutic once you get the hang of it. The Starbucks organization always seems to have the best intentions for their employees; with benefits such as health insurance, 401k options, tuition assistance, and others that have been added since my departure. Probably the hardest part of this job is the painful hours. From opening the store to work at 4:30am, to closing the store at 10pm (depending on location). This takes quite the toll after a while. "
good,"Couldn’t ask for a better environment to be in, I enjoy making the drinks and learning new things as well as being able to meet new people and have fun with the customers that come in"
good,"Humbling experience working here for several years. You develop a close-knit family with your co-workers and regular customers. Although it may be stressful at times, those rare customer connections really do uplift you. My parters and fellow managers have taught me countless skills over the years that will benefit me in future workplaces."
good,"Hi, the Starbucks that I work for is in fact, leased by Aramark on our campus. As a result , our policies are slightly differ from that of an actual Starbucks chain, but we still market the products the same way. There is always opportunity to move up, as long as you show strong leadership and the ability to guide other workers."
good,Working here was amazing I enjoyed the crowd from customers to coworkers the mood was always right now matter how busy it got I was always looking forward to the morning rushes and lunch because I got to interact with all kinds of people.
good,"Me gustó trabajar en la empresa, te cautiva toda la historia del café"
good,Mukemmel arkadaslar takim ruhu dedigimiz yer  gelisimi sevven acik olan  olan bir kurumsal firma maaslari tatmin etmiyor birtek badka hic bir sorun yok
good,"Best job ever! Love my coworkers. Pushed me to be my best. Taught me how to use resources for problem solving, and how to communicate more effectively with customers, management, and coworkers."
good,"More of a job than a career, but a good job. Training is very comprehensive both online and in person. Coworkers are nice and free coffee and food is a great perk."
good,Its a nice place to work since mine was inside of a hyvee it made it easier for lunch breaks because you could eat chinese or like a sandwhich during break.
good,"En commençant à travailler pour cette entreprise, j'ai tout suite apprécier et évoluer au  sein de l'entreprise."
good,"excellent job for a young person or student. great basic skills to learn. learned the basics of cash, drive thru, customer interaction. great teamwork if you've got a good manager and coworkers. we are still friends for life!"
good,"Loved the company, loved having a flexible schedule, Loved that i could take time off when needed, "
good,"Starbucks keeps you on your toes. There is always something to do and since they have such a high standard of operations, there is always something to learn."
good,A cultura dessa empresa é excelente eles te um tratamento diferenciado com os funcionários sempre treinando e se preocupando com o mesmo
good,"I loved it there, i just couldn't see me building a life there. It was a great company to work for. I got an opportunity in health care and i couldn't pass it up"
good,Starbucks is a partner and customer focused company. I have seen Starbucks invest in its own employees by providing  access to education and health care.
good,Starbucks is a comfortable place to work In and with kind colleagues that respect and respect job i recommend anyone to come and work cause he/ she will find the desired reach ..
good,"Ideal for a student job or a second side hustle. Starbucks provides lots of hours and benefits. If you need extra hours you can pick up shifts at other locations."
good,There are both corporate and lease stores.  Corporate stores are better for benefits and regulations to stay within Starbuck standards -- which are sound.
good,"Uno de los mejores lugares para trabajar, tus compañeros siempre te apoyan y te ayudan a crecer."
good,Worked full time while attending college. Loved the people and the free coffee. Was able to adjust my available hours based on my current class schedule.
good,Meu perfil profissional foi forjado graças a empresa
good,I work at a store with a drive-thru which are a bit more chaotic than a store without one. It’s a faced paced environment with everyone working to give our customers the best experience.
good,"Loved working there. A typical work day you never knew who you were going to meet and it was always consistent for rush hours. You can meet business people, high school or college students, and make new friends through your coworkers. you are able to place smiles on peoples faces."
good,Awesome place to work while in college. Great place to make great connections to further your career goals. The management varies per district but overall great experience.
good,It is not only teaches you how to make beverages but it also teaches the management of a multi-national company on a daily basis. The culture is also very good as all the employees there are following the SOP and somehow taught me to be a discipline person.
good,It's a great place to use creativity and meet new people. Having this job allows you to learn about different kinds of coffee. Every quarter we have meetings to talk about how our store is doing and to refresh us on the mission that Starbucks has all while being able to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee and a small snack.
good,It was an awesome job experience wherein I learned so much and the culture is really different. we treat each other fairly and like brothers and sisters.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks as I believe in the company values and mission statement. Starbucks generally looks after it's Partners extremely well, but unfortunately I was the last person to join a team just before a reorganization and I lost my job. I would love to work for Starbucks again."
good,"I've been a Starbucks partner for almost 3 years. I love working here, and don't plan on stopping any time soon. The hours are flexible and the people I work with are fantastic. As a supervisor there is a little less flexibility, but still manageable. Experience does vary from store to store, though, as each location is individually managed. All in all, I've greatly enjoyed my time with this company."
good,You are never bored here! there is constantly a rush of customers. It is a great job that offers great benefits and help paying for child care. I highly enjoy the energy of working there.
good,"We work in a small franchise store, not a local corporate one., so you get to know the locals a lot better. No work drama whatsoever and everyone gets a long."
good,A stabucks é extremamente inclusiva. Recebe os novos trabalhadores de uma forma muito saudavel.
good,I was sad when I had to leave. The people partners and regulars were like family and I would have continued a long career there had my life not pushed me in another direction.
good,I’d work here again if I could I actually miss working here I enjoyed making coffee with good folks and serving good people good coffee. Starbucks is a great place to work.
good,Works great with schedules. Easy job. Free coffee. Nice people. There are a lot of drinks to learn but every is easy to remember and there is always someone to help.
good,"I enjoyed going to work here, as it was a lively workplace, in which I was able to get plenty of things done, my coworkers were kind and they were easy to work with. The job did prove difficult at times, with it's strict policies and large amount of items and things to know. Customers were a mixed batch, with some being awful and some being amazing. I would have stayed here, but the hours and days were overwhelming, and as a student, i began to struggle fitting schoolwork into my hectic schedule."
good,"The majority of my time working at Starbucks, I worked closing shifts with the same people and it was a blast. You get into a groove and are all responsible for little things and everything runs so smooth!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks because I got to meet new people, and engage with customers on a daily basis. The management was very helpful in getting time off and or hours."
good,"This job is good if you are able to interact with customers and handle a high stress, face-paced environment. After the winter months are over, it is more difficult to maintain 20+ hours unless you are a manager."
good,"Creating the drinks was the best part of the job. I loved the hands on aspect and making someone’s day. Starbucks is a Fast paced, high energy environment."
good,Starbucks was my first real job as a young man it shaped me to be the person i am today. Always willing to help people with a smile on my face........
good,Starbucks company is one of the best employer. They have excellent benefits for the fulltime workers. They live with their mission and vision to value every customers.

good,"Starbucks has a very diverse group of people from different backgrounds that work there. Not only that but the customers are very diverse. By working together, we accomplish many goals along with providing excellent customer service. Challenging the status quo as well as holding each other accountable to be the best that we can be was develops us into better people all around."
good,"Great place to work when you are in school.  Flexible hours, high volume, great for learning how to work in stressful situations while creating a wonderful product at the same time.  Teamwork building environment."

good,"the hours were decent, but the pay was not that great. While being there ive noticed that if you're a college student, its a great place to work. But if you're looking for a full time job, you'd have better luck elsewhere."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work with many benefits. Opens include setting up the shop by yourself or with 1 other and as well as serving and crafting beverages, cleaning the cafe and doing deep cleaning jobs. Closing involves cleaning the whole cafe and closing things down and setting up ready for the open in the morning."
good,"Good job, management could improve. It was fun to work in a fast-paced environment. I enjoyed  building a relationship with repeat customers. Doing inventory was fun!"
good,I love working for Starbucks. It has changed a lot about me. I have always been a very quiet person. But working in a friendly work environment has changed that. I love coming to work. I enjoy working with my partners with the company. I love interacting with customers and love getting to know them so they can be part of the Starbucks family.
good,"The great thing about Starbucks is the ability to grow as a partner. The manager, shift leaders, and even other coworkers are encouraging in many ways."
good,"I LOVED working at Starbucks! Not only is the coffee atmosphere a really fun and social one, it's also very fast paced and there's always something new to learn - a new drink, a new fact about a regular customer, it always kept me busy and in great spirits!At the location I was at, there wasn't much room for moving up, but that was just specific to our store. The hardest part of the job was being alone in the kiosk - especially when there was a lineup at peak times. I think my favorite part of the job was just the social aspect of it all."
good,Best employer I’ve worked for thus far. The management is really able to accommodate you as long as you give them adequate time plus after some time there you all begin to feel like family.
good,"I love working at Starbucks it provided so many opportunities to meet new people ,and make some ones day. I was always doing something never had to ask."
good,"If you are young and single, you will find being a barista as a fun and enjoyable job. But if you have dependents or a small family, you might need to tighten your belts to make both ends meet!"
good,Loved working there great atmosphere and customers they always work with ur schedule opportunity’s to advance would definitely work there again its a great company to work for
good,I worked at the Starbucks at the airport.  The environment was fast paced but very comfortable.  Had the opportunity to meet a lot of different people and enjoy working with your coworkers.
good,Great opportunity to know more about the company and the mission that stands behind it. You grow with the partners and the job itself makes you a stronger leader as well as a person.
good,"I learned a lot about my work ethic, patience, working as a team, and multitasking while i was working there. The hardest part of the job was probably waking up early every morning."
good,"Really great place to work, great benefits at only 20 hours a week. Very fast paced, busy work. Never boring goes buy quickly. Great place to learn new skills."
good,Always was busy around 5am and the rushes came and went. Positive work environment just didn't like how the staff didn't know how to either take responsibility over their own actions as well as communication they lacked as well.
good,"Starbucks was an enjoyable job because it was a place where customers come to enjoy themselves and the baristas enjoyed serving and getting to know the costumers. "
good,"Working at Starbucks, along with every other job as well, I've learned a lot about people and customer service in general. I have always enjoyed my time working and/or volunteering with people every day and meeting so many different people with different cultures, and getting to know strangers as if they become a friend.  A typical day at work considering I work in a mall, is very busy. I find busy work days a huge pro because it makes time go by faster, and really helps boost motivation and positivity in the workplace with all the interactions on a daily basis. You really feel like you have gotten a lot more work done at the end of the day when it is busy. When applying for jobs, I am very observant of the workplace beforehand. Working in a positive environment  is crucial for me in order to present myself in the best way possible, and so any customer is happy as well. The best part about working at Starbucks is the environment. Everyone I encounter, whether its customers or co-workers, is always a positive one. The environment is more than welcoming to everyone around, and always tries their best to create best moments for others. The hardest part of my job sometimes, is keeping up with the traffic. Whether it is a Starbucks in the mall, or a Starbucks in the middle of nowhere... Starbucks is always busy no matter where you go, or what time of day it is. Many days it gets very stressful, but everyone does their best to keep the biggest smile on their faces which is the most important thing to keep in mind. Overall, Starbucks is an outstanding company to work for, and prior"
good,It is a great company. They really do look out for every employee. The benefits are amazing and the job advancement training is super easy to learn. It was so fun working there.
good,"I was at a licensed location so things were a bit different than at a corporate tore, my location put its employees beneath everything else and the higher you went up the management ladder the less they cared if that had changed i would still be there"
good,"This company is one of the greatest companies to work for as they truly care about their partners and their growth. From free tuition to free stock options, they set their employees up for success."
good,"I worked early morning, so it was busy, busy! Tons of repeat guests. I excelled in the drive-thru bar. They encourage you to consistently test and keep a diary of coffee tastings. Opportunities for advancement were always available. I love making espresso drinks and making customers happy by remembering their sometimes complicated drink orders."
good,"Starbucks is able to develop and train you in all aspects of becoming excellent in hospitality/customer service industry. An industry that is both Customer & Employee focused!:)"
good,"I really loved working for Starbucks, every store I worked in was like working with family. As a supervisor, Starbucks really gave me a good base training for business school, with skills I can take with me anywhere. This is a first great job."
good,Excellent brand that has provided a collaborative environment with ample opportunity for growth. Connection to broader Starbucks enterprise also provides a variety of ways to transfer skills to new positions.
good,The work is frontline customer service and can be tough and busy at times. The community that gets created from working at Starbucks is forever and rewarding.
good,A fun and productive working environment that allows individuals to find their career path and teaches them responsibility and accountability. This job also helps develop leadership skills.
good,"Great company to work for and great benefits"
good,"Great environment to work in with both customers and partners. Offer great support on many things including: medical benefits, sick leave, vacation time, and more. They are wonderful when it comes to team building making you feel comfortable with all those that you work with."
good,"A typical work day for me would be coming in and making sure the garbage was not full. Make fresh coffee, keep things tidy, and make an impact that day."
good,"Working in Starbucks is a great and fantastic experience. Developing partners is a great achievement.work with passion. and Most especially to inspired and nurture human spirit one cup, one person and one neighborhood at a time."
good,"I enjoyedy time working for Starbucks. Only concern for me personally was it was my second job, and I was exhausted after being on my feet 14 hours per day. You could purchase benefits and stocks, they weren't included. At the time I was employed there, the overall customer experience was held at a higher standard than it is today but still a great company."
good,"I love working for Starbucks. Across each location, you will find partners (coworkers) that share similar interests, mindsets, and personalities - their selection process is very interesting."
good,"- fast paced, always moving"
good,"I think it's a great place to work. I've learned so much in my time there, it's a great place to network and meet people from all walks of life. I would work back at Starbucks in a heartbeat."
good,Starbucks is a good company with a lot of benefits. Enjoyable work environment. Must be extremely fast paced and able to multitask at all times. Ability to move up to many different positions in the company.
good,"Learned how to multitask, and about teamwork. The hardest part of the job was initial training and remembering drinks. Most enjoyable part of the job was the connections made with employees and customers."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced work environment that puts emphasis on customer connection and building relationships through meaningful interaction. It does become challenging to speak to everyone and engaging in conversations when it gets busy, but you learn to multitask and develop great people skills. The team you work with plays a crucial role in defining your day. I personally had an amazing team. Training other baristas was difficult because there is a shortage of training hours and our need to be involved in business operations during these hours."
good,I really enjoy working for Starbucks. I've worked at three different locations and at every location there are cool people I enjoy working with. The environment is great and the coworkers are great. Management is very understanding and encouraging. I would say it's hard to make starbucks a full time job. They really can't ever schedule you more than 25 hours if you're not a shift supervisor.
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work, but it is certainly not for everyone. If you are tolerant and like working in a fast-paced environment. You will have no problem blending in."
good,"I enjoy my job as a Barista. Good store team and atmosphere. A lot of small details go into running a starbucks that I did not consider before working there. Talking with customers getting to know them and their likes and dislikes. Learning about coffee skills and new products and merch coming out. Not every job is an enjoyable one like trash runs or mopping, but the thing I do enjoy about having a team is how everyone works together. Its not only you alone, everyone does everything for the most part. Once you get the hang of it, it gets easier and the flow gets going."
good,"This job has been A great place so far, I enjoy working for this company great benefits etc: I haven't really had any trouble here, Met some great people."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Starbucks! It was a fast paced environment with the opportunity to learn many skills. I learned plenty about handling cash(Cashiering), proper cleaning, multitasking and teamwork. I loved the ability to be creative and forge good customer service relationships. It was hard work and at times very physical work. The benefits and compensations they offer their employees were wonderful. I felt like the company truly cared about me as an employee and a person. I would definitely consider applying to go back as a part-time employee."
good,Es una muy buena empresa para trabajar y las prestaciones son muy buenas comparadas con el numero de horas trabajadas. Es un buen trabajo si eres supervisor pero si eres solo barista es muy baja la paga comparada con todo lo que hay que conocer y dominar para poder hacer este trabajo.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 8 years it was my first job and to this day I look back on it as one of my best jobs. "
good,"If you work in food service, work at Starbucks. They are genuinely nice people and the company benefits are unrivaled anywhere else working part time. You really feel taken care of. Disadvantages include occasional understaffing due to budget cuts."
good,"Hours can fluctuate depending on the needs of the business. "
good,A typical day at work consists of already knowing what to do or say when you start your shift. Most days start off stressful and fast-paced but then leaning into the shift becomes easy and steady.
good,"Great working environment"
good,"Great place to work, especially for students. Very flexible hours and benefits even for part time.  Lots of training and excellent management. 10/10 would recommend."
good,Great place to work if your niche is fast paced environments and enjoy the occasional personal conversations with customers. My Starbucks crew was like a second family for me. That definitely made the experience much more delightful
good,I would highly recommend working for Starbucks. This corporation got me through college and offers great benefits. I would never have left if it was not for my personal store's manager and district manager. If I had the chance to go back and be a district manager or manager at Starbucks I would probably take the opportunity.
good,"Starbucks gives a ton of great benefits, even for part-time employees, that no other company does. The work can get busy at times, but that's the fun of it. There are so many opportunities to impact someone's day and to get to know customers and partners. The lessons you learn can be life-changing. I love the mission and values of this company and how it tries hard to take care of its partners."
good,"The people you work with are the  best part of the job. As stressful as it can get, and it can get crazy, your team makes the job worth it. My store was half drive through so it was extra intense. Be prepared to make drinks, warm up food, multi-task, cashier. Overall stressful, but it can be an amazing experience."
good,Love the place! Wish I could have stayed. Amazing work environment and the staff make you feel extremely welcome. Flexible hours for those who go to school.
good,"buena paga, buenos horarios, buen ambiente de trabajo y café gratis."
good,"Very good company to work for but not much room for people to advance.  Was on a development plan to become an ASM for three years.Basically did most of my managers job, without any better pay.  Just felt it wasn't fair on their part."
good,Work your hardest with the team you're given; they will support you and you will advance if you show interest to. Great management and fair benefits for even part-time. Not great pay.
good,Starbucks is a great conpany and is an excellent first time job for younger people.  They offer excellent benefits and perks.  The work hours are flexible and the environment can be fun.
good,"At Starbucks, it gives opportunities to have a flexible schedule, especially for students. Since the team is smaller, the team is able to work together and get closer together making the culture and the environment of the workplace very welcoming."
good,"I stopped working there a long time ago but it was a very fun job. The crew I worked with was awesome, the job itself was really easy but fast paced. Great environment for your first job!"
good,"Cool place to work, great benefits. Flexible schedule."
good,It’s a good place to work because we can learn about customer service and we can know well our customer and make them feel special and we have a delicious drink and beverage to serve everyday
good,"A typical day at work was always fast paced and hectic, but it was always fun and a happy place to work. The hardest part of the job was not being able to make someone's day with a cup of coffee. The most enjoyable part was the amazing people I got to work with and always meeting new people."
good,"I have worked at several locations over the years, and every one has had a great atmosphere, some more than others. It really depends on management of each store and other partners. It's a great company to work for, offering lots of benefits."
good,"Amazing business and company, the management was excellent , very professional. The job would be something I’d recommend to any barista. I loved my team and always felt welcomed from the whole staff"
good,"Some bad managers.  Learning the drinks is fun, even more fun making them, my team I can still remember, and wouldn't pass up.  That's the best part.  I had to go to school at the same time and going to work early at 4 am here is a little rough but...I did it AND made honors society.  Maybe I'm just a early bird.  I remember thinking I wanted to get out of my position because I needed a new raise but wasn't getting it...just annoying."
good,My typical work day was not as busy as I liked but I had a lot of regulars who came back to my starbucks to see me which made my work day interesting and fulfilling. I have learned to do many things at once and learn a variety of different things all very similar.
good,"To inspire and nurture the human spirit- one person, one cup and one neighbourhood  at a time. for demonstrating a green apron behavior  and worked within the brilliant basic philosophies: keeping it smile providing excellent customer service."
good,as an opener I would start at 4:30 am and I would prepare the pastry shelf by placing the pastries in a pre determined position. once I am finished with that the store is usually open so I help customers and perform other tasks while no customers are in line or drinks need to be made.
good,"The staff we're great, couldn't of been more helpful with training and there was a good relationship between myself and the other staff members. I went into the job a bit blind sighted of what I was getting myself into but it was definitely a fantastic place to work if you can keep up with a very fast pace, enjoy the buzz and don't mind working on a random rota. But you do get 3 free coffees a day which is pretty mint if i'm honest."
good,"Starbucks is a great company, but does have some downfalls. It is very fast paste, and training is very hands on, and honestly you really have to learn on your own. Managment can be pretty rough if you're not careful of what location you work for, and upper management isn't the best, district and regional are pretty rough. But you rarely come across them, and usually store managers are very caring. I strongly recommend talking to baristas and shifts before applying to a store, usually they will be very honest with you and automatically tell you if the regional and district manager are there a lot or not."
good,"There are times when it is stressful, but everyone works together to serve customers with a high degree of excellence."
good,"While it can be busy and stressful, most people who work here share similar values and care about people. You can work here and feel like you belong here too."
good,The employees and most part great customers and the manger ran a tight crew so it made it enjoyable. The hours and great the food and drink were great and well organized company
good,"This job provided me with an excellent work ethic and quality customer service practice. It was an enjoyable work experience that kept me busy and attentive throughout the day, and provided great satisfaction within each customer relationship."
good,"Enjoyed working here. Worked at the Starbucks inside of target and thought it was cool, did not allow for tips, however. Kind of sucked but was cool. I"
good,"great team, good pay, very enjoyable, balanced work / social life, "
good,I believe to this very day that everyone should have a chance to work at Starbucks and go through their training and understand the culture - read Howard's book will give you the best outlook on life and will create a world of respect and dignity for everyone everywhere - the skills and culture you learn here will live with you forever and change your life for the better.
good,"I love the culture Starbucks wants to carry out! I loved the job I think it’s a great company that has helped and is still helping a lot of people! Enjoyed it, love y’all"
good,Starbucks was a great environment to work in and they have a very caring culture. Starbucks has great benefits and they really strive to teach and give the employees the ability to grow. The only downside to working for Starbucks was the salary was not that great.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun and friendly, the atmosphere is always nice, regular customers is what makes the job great. I have learned a lot whilst working at Starbucks and have been given a lot of opportunities"
good,"I learned a lot about myself working for Starbucks. It was definitely not an easy job. Very fast paced and lots to do behind the scenes that many people do not realize. If you are driven and work hard, this is the job for you. My absolute favorite part of the job was getting to know your regulars and creating many life long friends."
good,"Starbucks helped create the manager I am today. I've never loved a company so much down to its core. The integrity the company"
good,"Great company good environment to work, people work as a team, bonus base on your store sales, some time easy to get, some times very hard, depend on your line manager forecast, this will drive you mad, some time just not reality."
good,"Starbucks was my first job, i loved working there but unfortunately had to quit cause i was in my senior year of high school and had a huge work load."
good,"Hay que ser cuidadosos, rápidos y eficientes al momento de tomar las ordenes y preparar ordenes."
good,You will surely fall in love with the culture and the  with enviroment. You will also fall in love with your co partners there very easy to work with.
good,"Starbucks gave me the opportunity to learn team values and hone my interpersonal skills. I enjoyed having daily sales goals, and clear guidelines and procedures. If the job paid a bit better I would happily do it again."
good,"I actually really enjoyed working for Starbucks. I would've liked it more if I didn't work in a mall location (as mall shoppers don't tip and you don't really have the opportunity to make regulars, also it was crazy busy during holidays), but overall I enjoyed working there. The team was great, and when working at other locations via partner sharing, you got to have a change of pace/scenery. I would recommend it as a fair job for people looking for something. "
good,"I enjoyed my 5 years working for the company. Awesome environment, great skills learned. Enjoyed the constant customer interaction, and the oppurtunity to service upon specific customized needs. Customers enjoy having a choice!"
good,"It was great working at Starbucks. I would recomend it to anyone. I need a little more money to cover my expences. The experience and my co-workers were awesome people, I really enjoyed it."
good,"Training programs on computer don’t properly  prepare you for transactions at cash register and bar, that Causes frustration  shin with customers and employees."
good,"Fast paced, energetic, fun job.  Time flew by so fast everyday.  Great place to meet so many different and interesting people and new friends.  I loved making a connection, getting to know and serving the guests that came in.....on a daily basis!  You couldn't help but to get to know your neighbors because everyone came to Starbucks.  The pay/tips were fantastic along with the benefits Starbucks gave at the time of my employment with them.  It might be different now.  Hopefully not.  I was trained by wonderful managers and given the opportunity to grow.  I loved working at Starbucks."
good,if you're a senior in high school or in college this is a place to start working. you get benefits. they pay for school and you get stock. It will set you up for entering the world after college hopefully with no student loans
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. They give discounts, free coffee beans each week, competitive pay, many chances for advancement, great sense of urgency, and great relationships with employees and customers. A great first job or career!"
good,"Great Place to work. Co workers are great and friendly. Manager is funny. You get great vibes working at Starbucks. Everyday is different, you meet new people and even learn new things."
good,"Both the management and the partners create a great work environment. It is a fast paced somewhat high stress work environment, but very rewarding. The benefits the company offers are great."
good,"Working at corporate headquarters is a laid back, collaborative but friendly environment.  The building can be a bit deceiving as there are around 6000 employees in the building and it is a meeting heavy place to work, so getting around is crazy.  Teams are typically pretty good at assisting in career advancement, although there aren't many formal learning tools via their intranet. Benefits are great!"
good,"Love working here, just need more pay! Great beneifiets and great work atmosphere, chance for growth jhdiufhdsfhdsfiudshfdsjfhdsufdshfkjdsfhdsufhdskjfdshfkjdsfdskljfhdskljfdsh"
good,"Fast pace but room for growth and flexible hours. Good place to work, new recipes to learn and provides a positive challenge to initiate customer service growth"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work as a college student that is looking for a flexible schedule to fit with school. Moving up in the company (as a shift supervisor) is not worth the pay raise, but if you are looking to become a manager or district manager with Starbucks, this is the place to work at."
good,Let's say you been working at Starbucks and everyone is pretty chill and fun to interact than suddenly you get slammed by a rush of people. Its a fun place but sometimes it gets too boring that I just don't want to do repetitive things on the job.
good,This is a good company to work for. The health insurance is outrageously amazing and you only have to work 20 hours a week to qualify. I just happened to work in a store with a poor manager. But many others are moving up into management so it won’t always be that way!
good,"This is a company that is fun, fast pace and constantly changing, everyday is different witch makes it a great place to work at, working as a team and trusting your coworkers is very important in making your experience the best."
good,"Working there keeps me busy, as there is always lots to do. The management is very flexible with my hours and helpful in allowing me to work another job at the same time. My time has been overall positive there."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. I had to quit because of difficulties with management. But, It's a great place to grow, lots of room for advancement!"
good,"Fast paced environment with ample opportunity to connect with customers.  Free coffee, food markouts and coffee to take home each week.  Benefits are phenomenal and inclusive"
good,"A typical day on the other side of the counter consiss of perfection. Every drink memory must be memorized and made perfectly, as Starbucks standards require their partners to treat every drink as if it were a new drink to deliver the best customer experience. Throughout the day, although some customers think that there's one partner not doing anything, in reality that partner is acting as the backbone by refilling everything, keeping dishes clean and sanitized, keeping coffee fresh, and making sure that the partners on bar and on till with all the supplies they need in order for every thing to run smoothly. "
good,"I recommend working at Starbucks for people interested in developing a harder work ethic, and for people looking to find a job where they can receive part time benefits."
good,Great benefits for a college student. Flexible work schedules. Good CEO of the company. Attended college through their college achievement program. Good job as part-time.
good,Depending on the day we would either be rushed or very slow. When rushed though managers or whoever isn't on bar/cashier will help with the overflow of orders. Managers and trainers are very patient with new people and extremely helpful when you have a question.
good,Typical day at starbucks is fast paced and many customer interactions in a short amount of time. I have learned to master making that connection with each customer while still keeping up with the fast pace of the work environment.
good,aprendí a valorar el medio ambiente ellos tienen buenas dinámicas en eso poner en funcionamiento al personal que lleguemos a las metas trabajo en equipo el ambiente es bueno lo que no me gustaba era la actividad de limpieza a profundidad eso debería de hacerlo otra empresa externa
good,"Great place to work but not quite my jam because i need to pay rent :) sometimes the work drama gets to be a little too much and the managing operations makes me feel like im being micro managed. Great structure, but its not for me"
good,Starbucks was a great place to work at. The team members was definitely great help and was always around to answer any questions. If I had a chance in going back I definitely would. I love Starbucks
good,"Starbucks, as a Corporation, understands that when employees feel valued and taken care of, they usually are willing to work harder and do better work for their employer."
good,"Like any beginner job, Starbucks has its issues. Unlike any most beginner jobs, however, Starbucks has its benefits. Literally. The health benefits available through Starbucks are stunning, but they are also expensive. Not only that, but Starbucks offers discounts on almost all major brands, including Apple and most work clothing stores! Starbucks like to advertise that they offer classes or reimbursements through some Universities, as well, but that is only if you are taking Management-type classes."
good,"A fun place to work, amazing networking opportunities. Depends on your manager and their abilities to make a schedule and handle their employees as to your experience."
good,"I love starbucks because it has very good caffee,And the people there are very nice to work with.And I also love starbucks because its is a very clean place to be at and to work with.I recomend starbucks to anybody that I know in my life.But if you higher me i'll be the best employed that's you ever had."
good,You can be creative while engaging with customers while also building a connection with them. I enjoy coming to work and I also enjoy performing all of the tasks other than just serving coffee.
good,"Es una buena empresa, con buenos beneficios, un ambiente divertido de trabajo, pero el salario es muy bajo."
good,"-Enjoying working with team."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, I love connecting with the customers and making drinks! I work with great people and I love the fact I can be myself. It’s a great job!"
good,Spent a 2 great years with the Starbucks company. At a Starbucks it does get pretty busy so I would like to recommend that the CEO of Starbucks would take the time and create a video that lets their customers know what the baristas go through to make sure they create the perfect beverage quality.
good,"Starbucks is a great company but when choosing a location, meet with the manager. Ask questions. My first manager wasn't great and was very unorganized. Now that I have moved, and transferred stores, my new manager is the complete opposite of the old one."
good,My favorite thing about working for this company was the relationship I built with my regulars. I could tell that they looked forward to seeing me everyday
good,me sirvio para estudiar. te acomodan los horarios segun tus obligaciones
good,You meet a lot if interesting and great people a long the way. It's a fun and fast paced job where you can learn a lot but still have fun. The customers and employees make the job even more fun!
good,"I had a lot of fun working there, but it 's not a realistic job for supporting yourself. It's a great job for supplementing income. You're not allowed to work 40 hrs, it's designed to be  a part time job unless your looking to be in management."
good,Part time job with full benefits. Hard to find! I think this job is the greatest job for someone to have as it provides the best customer experience training and it teaches a lot in retail and food service industry.
good,"Starbucks was a very fun, upbeat place to work. They have great benefits, free drinks while you work and you get a coffee markout each week. My manager was very understanding and flexible."
good,"Starbucks knows what they want out of their employees and they know how to get it. They want fast pace and high volume service with a smile and consistent quality and accuracy. They get it by training people well, especially the management. They encourage a style of positive encouragement and appreciation along side constructive critiques and teaching moments. Its a fun environment and you can really learn something more than how to make a coffee if you pay attention."
good,"Starbucks is a fun and lively work environment that is extremely accepting, allowing you to be yourself. I've learned many skills through their fast paced work environment which I can apply to future jobs."
good,"A fast-paced environment where my partners (coworkers) encouraged each other to do our best. Had a lot of great, meaningful connections with customers!"
good,"Starbucks was great as far as the people working there, the people you'd see everyday, the way everyone always laughs with each other. I met one of my best friends there. This job is one I would highly recommend for teens and young adults working in school or college. It will teach you time management, consistency, and creativity. The hardest part of the job is closing. There's lists you have to follow throughout the day, but the closing list has the most on it. That's where your consistency and time management come into play. You have to serve customers until 8pm and still be able to have the department cleaned up and spotless by 9pm. They're pretty flexible if you're not done by exactly 9pm, but by the end of the day everyone typically wants to go home."
good,I enjoyed and appreciated my time at Starbucks. I learned excellent communication skills and built the confidence in my self to be able to problem solve.
good,"A typical day is very busy, you get occasional rude people, but the management is great and Starbucks offers a variety of benefits. It is very hard at first and the labor does not stop, but the pay and benefits outweigh the cons."
good,"Everyone was always fun and cheerful, fast environment and fun. I would go into work and know exactly what I was doing for the day. The managers were reasonable. I would definately work here again."
good,I loved it . And I would work there Again and I would also recommend other people to work at Starbucks as well. It was fast paced if busy . But you get used to it .
good,"I used Starbucks as an additional income source/retirement builder. I had a full time job while working at Starbucks which allowed me to put my income from Starbucks into their generously matched 401k and also save the extra cash for spending. "
good,"Great workplace. Get to learn customer skills and develop communication, leadership and time management. The hardest part f the job was to keep serving during the busiest days but that made it fun as well."
good,"Starbucks was a good company to work for, they had amazing benefits including paying for some of my schooling, dental and medical. they also have the opportunity to upgrade to manager in a short time."
good,Starbucks is a very good company to work for. I'd love to work for the company again. The management was great. Everyone was friendly. The hardest part of the job want when yu we're the only person working and shipment arrived and had to put it away and help customers.
good,always busy co workers are friendly management is down to earth but at the same time on top of u to make sure your job is being done hours very flexabile
good,"Very fast paced workplace, coworkers treat you like family, the benefits are great and the pay is well. The work environment is fun and energetic! The training is difficult at first but after about a week you end up getting the hang of it."
good,"Great place to work as a young employee. Pay is good for a starting job. Fast paced work environment, expect fast and quality products. Not a bad place to work for people 16-25"
good,"Es una excelente empresa, sencillamente creo que ya termine mi ciclo ahí."
good,"A typical day deals with taking and making orders, cleaning, and general customer service.  They taught me a lot about coffee, and the managers were very friendly.  The atmosphere was welcoming, and the hardest part of the job would have to be cranky customers who have yet to have their coffee."
good,"Starbucks culture both as a barista and supervisor requires a lot of daily personal interface. I've learned how to open up, become more personable, work continuously with great teams, and make excellent lattes. The hardest part of the job stems from having the right amount of people on the floor at all hours of the day. If there are too few people, or, dare I say it, too many people, the work place flow can become more stressful. However, given the right  team of proactive go-getters as well as fun and positive coworkers  (which I've had so far), the environment becomes so much more enjoyable. Overall, I've loved working at Starbucks so far. It's been stressful and fun, as many workplaces are, but I've always had a great team and always loved that Starbucks promotes growth within the company."
good,I loved it there when I was in College. I only left because even though I got promoted to Supervisor very quickly I felt like the stress and workload wasnt worth the pay. If my manager wouldnt have walked out that day I most likely would have never left Starbucks.
good,"Great place to work with great people and many opportunities for advancement. It definitely isn't for the faint of heart, but if you enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, Starbucks may be a good fit for you!"
good,Mornings were fun because we were always busy. Worked with some great people who really made the place a great experience but sometimes understaffed which made quality customer service a little difficult.
good,"I have been with Starbucks for almost 3 years and would recommend the job. I enjoy working with others, mastering my craft and interacting with customers. I would recommend being experienced in customer service before working at Starbucks because there is a learning curve at first."
good,"Co-workers here were literally the best, it was like working with friends."
good,"Love StarBucks ,"
good,"no slacking involved, but a fun place to work. the market is flooded since it's an entry level job, but if you work hard and show initiative there is a little room for advancement if you stick it our for a while. i was lucky to have been promoted after 4 months, but most people work there much longer before being promoted."
good,"I was hired as a Christmas temp in Manchester with the store being next to the Christmas markets, this was my first experience working for a coffee shop and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The people were lovely to work with, it was always fun and exciting however I feel like I was thrown into the deep end and would have loved the opportunity to continue to work there and develop in my role, instead I was let go when my contract ended and feel that I was not given a fair opportunity to work during a normal business season and prove my ability.This being said I would work at Starbucks again and i am still a loyal customer to the brand."
good,"In a typical day as a shift supervisor at Starbucks I fulfil management tasks of opening the facility, as well as overseeing scheduled employees. Throughout the day I complete various duties, including assisting the store manager in executing store operations, delegating tasks to coworkers and positioning employees appropriately so that the Starbucks Experience is properly created and maintained for our customers. I am also responsible for maintaining a calm demeanor during periods of high volume or unusual events to keep the store operating to standard as well as setting a positive example for the shift team. This position is highly structured with a lot of repetitive tasks, however, it has some built in flexibility rotating work stations. The Starbucks culture encourages making a connection with the customer and during high volume times, this can be the most difficult part of this position. As a shift supervisor at Starbucks, I have learned that efficient systems can make a consistent product and increases productivity. I am supported by the store manager who is an effective leader and role model that encourages independence and open communication. I have discovered that the most enjoyable part of supervising is encouraging success through others and working as part of a team to deliver legendary customer service."
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks! My Manager and Co-Workers were awesome and easy going to to work beside. As well as my regular customers who always came in to make my day even more pleasant!
good,"There was always something to learn about, and always room to improve your performance. I learned almost everything I know about coffee from Starbucks. Management is usually wonderful at this company. I've never seen happier managers (besides at Apple) than I have at Starbucks. The most difficult aspect of this job, is the ability to properly make beverages, and adhere to customers VERY specific requests, in a timely manner, without wasting product. As a coffee master, I was eventually able to run an entire store at times, by myself, in the event that my staff was unable to work. The most enjoyable part of the job, were the smiling faces."
good,"Starbucks was my first job and the longest company I worked for. I stayed for many years because the staff were easy to get along with and made work enjoyable. Management really cares about their employees, understanding and flexible partners. I've learned a lot, it has enriched me with a new perspective and work ethic"
good,the environment is very fast-paced and productuve. i have learned how to manage my time more efficiently and work well under pressure. The management is awesome! the culture is very inclusive. The hardest part of the job is waiting to connect with customers while passing out their drinks and still making drinks in a timely manner. the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers satisfied.
good,"If you enjoy making a difference in people’s morning/day by having a good attitude, and good coffee, Starbucks is for you! Tons of benefits and a fun place to work!"
good,"You can't ask for a better company to work for. It has received such a beating lately, but as a whole, it's a great company. Great work environment, great benefits, it was the most fun I ever had with a team."
good,Starbucks was great. I worked their for 10 years. You definitely learn a kind of people skills that I think helped me grow as a person. It's a good job while you're in college.
good,I have loved working for this company. They have taught me life long skills. You also get to work with a lot of great people. Starbucks also has a wonderful benefit plan that makes working there worth every minute.
good,"Typical day at work was nice . We had a few rushes which were in the mornings, noon, and afternoons. "
good,"Working at Starbucks is everything you''d expect. It's fast paced, fun, challenging, and out in the public. I loved seeing regular customers and the ones developing into regulars. My coworkers were pretty great, especially the ones that wanted to have fun at their jobs. It's definitely worth at least trying out if you're considering it."
good,I was referred to this job by a close friend and multiple close friends worked for the company. It was a nice place to work just not payed very well for my current education level. A great High school or college job.
good,"Every day is different and all depends on who wants coffee that day.  I learned a lot about my self, way more then i did about coffee and they were willing to work with me when i was having a hard day.  they want the well being of their partners to be good.  I loved my manager at this Starbucks she wanted us to be like a family.  The culture is as i explained above, family.  Starbucks is not just about coffee but creating an environment that is inviting for customers and partners alike.  The hardest part of this job was when we were understaffed and we got extremely busy (that was the most stressful) the hardest was when I got to cram our store order in a backroom that was WAY TOO SMALL.   The most enjoyable part was (most of) the partners,  we got along really well and worked together very well.  But more then that we became friends not just co-workers."
good,"One of the most enjoyable experiecnes of my life. Having to supervise a team of 10 people was not always easy as had to also deal with business waves and upgrade my management skills, as well as partecipate at health and safety courses, first aid and supervisoring skills."
good,I would recommend working at Starbucks. I was there a total of thirteen years. As a whole I enjoyed my time there. I appreciate the ethics of the company.
good,I loved working for Starbucks unfortunately i had to leave because I needed a job that paid more and gave me more hours. The training was good and they give you plenty of time to learn all the drinks and the job.
good,"Starbucks is great. Starbucks as  a company offers the best benefits, not only is it good as a person but it is good for the soul, and mind.  It is great for benefits and a place where you can enjoy to be at work."
good,the working time is flexible and balance within other staff. Learn to make a great taste of coffee. the management also good with good environment while working. the hardest job is to memorize the recipe of coffee and the enjoyable moment when the job is covering all area from open store until close the store
good,"Although not for everyone, I personally enjoy the earlier hours of work, but hours are flexible so something will suit your needs. Your mileage will vary among management, some are very good and accommodating and supporting, and others are less so. Good benefits and good enough pay."
good,"Una empresa para disfrutar tu trabajo, se aprende mucho y se hace mucho contacto con las personas"
good,Working at Starbucks was a great opportunity and actually a great place to work. My Store Managers were always very approachable and easy to work with. The benefits were not half bad either when looking at other places.
good,"It's a very fast-paced environment especially being in a city/financial district but I have great coworkers who make the job less stressful. Also, once you get used to the way things work around there, the job is a breeze."
good,Starbucks was a fast-paced but an enjoyable job. I enjoyed my coworkers and the productivity of the job. I was never not doing something at work which made my day go faster. Would recommend this job to people who are good at multitasking and are friendly. Usual customers will make your day if you interact and notice them.
good,"getting duties done"
good,This company genuinely stands behind its principles and mission statement. It provides a great opportunity for people wanting to pursue a college degree with its tuition reimbursement for both full and part time employees. The fact that the college that they pay for has online degrees makes it even easier.
good,I worked there for so long because my team of coworkers was amazing. the atmosphere is what made working at starbucks not too bad. although it is always high stress and fast pace you are never bored....
good,A typical day at starbucks felt like working with family. I learned so much about working in a team as well as not being afraid to be a leader. The hardest part was keeping up with the pace of the environment but after that it wa so much fun!
good,"More suggestions to customers on promo items and new products and up selling of products in the store."
good,Buen trabajo en equipo. Transparencia y coordinación.
good,"Aprendes a elaborar bebidas con y sin café, la convivencia con los partners es genial, siempre hay buen ambiente labora."
good,"Great experience managing a ""neighborhood store"" ( didn't have a drive thru ).  Lots of camaraderie with staff and had good leadership at the district manager level.  Good training and support as well."
good,"I was the 4am Shift i loved my mornings at starbucks i knew mest of my  regulars they became more that just my customers,After also  5 years of not working i still keep in contact with my managers and some customers. Learn a lot of professional skills as well."
good,"I have worked at multiple stores and they all are amazing. Becuase they are not individually owned the company will not hesitate to fix things if they break, or buy supplies that are needed. Starbucks values the experience for both the guests and the partners (employees) more then they value making a sale."
good,Very fast paced. Team effort. Quick on your feet and you have to be knowleadgeable about everything!! Gets kind of stressful but it’s fun to work. They provide really good benefits.
good,"i learned a lot in this company. i learned how to serve international customer service. how to have connection with customers. how to handle employee, with respects of course."
good,"I love this company and what it strives to be. The perfect part-time job that never ceases to work with my schedule. It's a place where you can hone who you are, what kind of person you strive to be."
good,"They will encourage you to connect through interpersonal communication to people around you. You will learn to be humble, to be corrected, and to respond with right decisions."
good,"Have brushed up customer service skills and learnt many of the management methods."
good,"You never know what day you're going to have, it usually stressful and crazy. We almost never have the right amount of people scheduled. But you get a lot of support from your fellow partners."
good,"Fun place to work, very accepting, great company to be a part of. management is very involved. Great benefits and discount. Fast paced and sometimes difficult."
good,"I really don't have anything bad to say about my job. I loved being an executive manager. I'm a leader and I'm good at it. The only thing negative would be my Area Director... A real peice of work. A lier, bad mouths other executive in front on me, not very professional at all, a bully is a good name for this person."
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for as they provided health, dental, and eye insurance. Not to mention, sick leave, paid vacation, and a 401k for their employees."
good,"Some days can be stressful, but with the right staffing, it still goes by in a breeze. "
good,"This has a good environment and holding a good operational procedures, enjoyed working in Starbucks, really gives opportunities for the working students like me"
good,From working with people to washing dishes there weren't any boring days! I enjoyed working at Starbucks because of the shared moments between coworkers and the customers.
good,"Make sure you are early and ready for your shift prepared and set up to do you daily activities, keeping up to date on training, and customer service!"
good,Everyone at Starbucks in very nice and helpful. It is a fast-paced place to work but you never have more than you can handle. The customers there are all very friendly as well.
good,Good company. Loved working for them for many years.Lack of advancement opportunities. Lack of support from area managers. Enjoyed role and responsibility.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks.  I started there after the company I worked for was bought out and closed.  I decided to work at Starbucks while I finished my business degree.  It was hard, hard work but so worth it."
good,"Great company to work for, never a dull moment and management does a lot to make partners feel welcomed. Offers benefits to part time employees also so everyone qualifies."
good,This job provides ample opportunity for benefits and helps to build strong work ethic. Good team environment and welcoming company. Must be able to multi task.
good,"I would reccomend working here to a friend. Everyone's helpful at my store. The guests are what drive me to come in, just knowing I made a good customer connection to make their day or lighten their mood."
good,"The store I work in always challenges us everyday when we work. New goals, new ideas, new leadership, new plays, and always new plans. Starbucks is greatly known, not just by their famous espressos, but also the people who work there. "
good,"My experience at Starbucks has been a wonderful learning experience. I've learned how to multitask, deal with difficult situations, gain helpful customer service skills, and lastly to grow within a workplace."
good,"Working at Starbucks is really fun and easy, but managers tend to play favorites and scheduling depends on your manager. Customers can be rude, demanding, and just annoying sometimes, but for the most part if your store has a huge lobby and is not a commuter store (like mine) you don't run into them that often. Being a borrow partner (working at other stores) is always an option if there are enough stores around and your manager recognizes that they can't always give you the hours you need. I've found that things are pretty universal between stores so that's cool too. Most of my friends are other partners at my store and if you manage to work pretty much the same schedule each week like I get to, then you build a real sense of comaraderie between your partners. Ultimately, if you like making drinks, you enjoy staying busy at work, and you are good at finding ways to have fun and converse with your coworkers then I'd recommend Starbucks 10/10."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for because of it's culture, innovation and opportunity of growth! I advice any student to work at Starbucks to gain skills that will turn out useful for any future job."
good,"Worked here for a number years gave me a great work life balance and i was a full time student and went between being a part time and full time employee. There is a high turn over rate each year i almost has a whole new crew, management was decent there were times when they weren’t understanding of life but for the most part they were. Company is great though especially at showing appreciation."
good,"Truly a great place to work. Staff feel like family. Never a dull day.  Customers can get frustrating to work with at times but the management is always there to soften the blow. Amazing benefits, including adoption benefits which is incredible."
good,"I worked through job training, it was an easy job but it was very slow. I worked on the campus of SCSU at ISELF. I did get some training on how to make drinks"
good,"Starbucks provided me with a solid support system and a strong team, many opportunities to expand knowledge on products, and overall was a fun environment that encouraged getting to know customers in a creative way."
good,great people and great manager. Great Customers. Working my co workers was great and had a good time working with them. Very eay going workplace. Liked it.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work, where you have fun and you will  learn a lot. I have gained lots of knowledge from starbucks, the training platform which given by Starbucks is amazing ..."
good,"A typical day at work could totally vary depending on the time of year since I worked at a Starbucks in the mall. It could be completely relaxed and low key on a summer morning, or it could be non stop drink making during the holiday season. The workplace culture and management were both excellent when I worked there. Partners had few complaints with management or with each other. I definitely got the impression that other partners enjoyed working at Starbucks."
good,"* Lots of cleaning, stocking and serving customers"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to interact with customers and build genuine relationships with your co-workers. You’re able to meet peope of different races, ethnicity, personalities and also grow relationships with customers."
good,"I haven’t worked there in many many years, but I did really enjoy the time I worked there and the management I worked with for the most part. I got to work at other stores also"
good,I absolutely love working for Starbucks once I moved to a secondary location. I have better management and team to support me in the decisions that I make for the company in store.
good,"I had a great time working here! Hiring process was different but fun! Management was very kind and understanding. Pay was good, friendly people constantly around. FREE KNOTTS PASS!"
good,"Very fast pace. Never boring. "
good,"By far my favorite place I've worked so far. You're on your feet all day, but you get to meet some cool people and most of the time even cooler coworkers. The diversity and culture surrounding Starbucks is incredible. It's a relatively easy job as long as you are active in training and pay attention. A lot of changes with drinks/food items, and even policies that you have to keep up with, but as long as you're engaged and care about your job it's not a big deal. Would definitely recommend working for this company."
good,"Great place to work if you're a young teenager or in school. Flexible scedules with a fun, fast work flow. Management is not the best... a Lot of Laziness and immaturityfrom them."
good,Only issue with company was the low rate of pay for management. If your a collage student who wants flexible hours you hit the nail on the head. If your looking for long career in management you would need to aim district manager or higher.
good,"great customer service employees really thrive to provide the best service they can provide at a fast pace. Competitive wages, however depending on the area very limited to advance within in career pursuit."
good,"Absolutely love working at Starbucks! Amazing benefits, loved the people and I got free coffee while doing it.  Some drama, but usually was fine.  It can be crazy sometimes, but overall have loved the experience.  Recommend this for people who are quick on their feet, and good at fast learning."
good,"Being a part of a team taught me a lot about how to work well with others and how to better myself. "
good,"Typical day working, always preassure"
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks, from the creative and unique products the company offers to the amazing employee benefits they have. I highly recommend this company for college or high school students as it allows students to have a work-school balance."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks Unfortunately, the area I was employed in was near impossible to move up into higher levels of management so I had to leave in order to sustain myself financially."
good,"Great place to work at, it's never a dull moment. I've really created connections w/ customers. You challenge yourself constantly, and it's always changing. Job security and you can transfer within 6 months with good intent."
good,"Work environment was supportive and positive, yet professional, which was conducive to learning and working efficiently. I felt included in the work environment right away."
good,"This is a good first job for a young person (18-20). The shifts are typically fun and fast paced. If you have a good trainer and manager, working at Starbucks is great! Also, if you work part time there you receive health, vision and dental insurance. If you work there for a year you have the option to buy Starbucks stocks. The hardest part of the job is the customers that aren't so nice and/or working with a higher-up supervisor or manager that isn't so great (just like any other job)."
good,"Excellent place to work, you learn a pretty cool skill while doing it. You learn so much about coffee!!"
good,"I've worked at two different stores, six years apart. Both of my experiences with Starbucks have been phenomenal. Great management, good support, fast-paced, fun. Salary is par for the service industry, but the benefits are outstanding. Way better insurance than I had as a full time teacher."
good,Provides awesome benefits and is a great place for growth. Starbucks is a great place to establish a foundation in customer service and food service industry.
good,Overall I really enjoy working at Starbucks if you are looking for a fast paced environment with great part-time benefits this is the place for you!!!! I have worked there for two years now and have advanced to supervisor role so there is room for advancement if you are doing the time
good,Excellent Benefits. Great opportunities. Good treatment of employees. Listen to employees. Accommodating. Fun. Exhausting. Hard work. Good payoff. Potentially good managers.
good,"Decent job they have good benifits, they have a good culture, it is also high paced job. there is many hours of time to work, and they are good with working with your schedule."
good,One of the best companies I had the pleasure of working for. I received tons of great training and development during the beginning of my career with them. The company stands by their mission and values and that is one of the best things about them. The fact that they offer a free college education to their partners is amazing !! I believed in Howard's vision. However I experienced a shift when I moved to a different market which eventually led to my decision to leave.
good,~a busy fun filled day with high peak times of business
good,"Starbucks was a great job. I learned a lot about working in a fast paced environment, and how to keep busy at work when things were slow. I often worked early in the morning, at 4:30am, and was taught discipline to get to work that early every day. I worked with fun people who made the job enjoyable, and had regular customers who made it all worth it as well."
good,"I learned a lot, it taught me to multi task in stressful times. everyone that works there has a different sense of style and attitude, you learn about your customers and the people you work with. the most enjoyable part of the job was when your customers feel relaxed and safe being in Starbucks"
good,"when i first come into work i make sure that all the coffee's are brewed and everyone is stocked on milks,etc."
good,"My friend works here and gets very good benefits, for instance she is going to college online through Starbucks and they pay for her tuition and books, which would be very helpful while having a part-time job. Starbucks always has happy faces when I walk in and are always good at taking special orders and do not show if it bugs them or not (always professional).  I've been to many different Starbucks. I definitely recommend Starbuck also because, of how fast and productive their employees are!"
good,"Going from working for a small business for years, I was really surprised at the organization and professionalism of this corporate gig. Management was very kind, fair, and never asked anyone to stay extra hours and they were always making sure we took our scheduled breaks."
good,developed my customer service skills that can translate to future job paths or careers. Was very fortunate for the opportunity provided if i could work there again i would.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Starbucks, but it is a very fast-paced environment and may not be for everyone. They were very understanding and I would definitely suggest working there."
good,"Great training, fun atmosphere, free coffee, free company shares, excellent benefits, plenty of opportunity to move up, good pay, and you don't take your work home with you."
good,Starbucks provides many opportunities for growth and for learning how to operate a store. The environment teaches you to balance priorities and manage stress
good,Muy buena me encanta muy buena empresa me trato excelente y me dio mucho para a perder
good,I've had at least 5 other retail/customer service jobs and this has been my favorite by far. The 401K that is matched up to 5% is probably the best benefit for me.
good,"Aprendi muito no período que passei nessa empresa, trabalho em equipe excelente."
good,You get what you put into the job. As long as you stay efficient and are dutiful to your role and your team  the job will run smoothly. This job is definitely team oriented. You need to know how to work fast and efficiently through the slow business hours and peek times. The managers are easy going and are willing to help you succeed.
good,"Starbucks is a company that cares about their employees, even those at the bottom of the pyramid. Benefits include a 401k, healthcare for those who meet the requirements, the ability to hold stock in the company, and a starting wage of $11.05/hr (as of 2018). It's a great place to acquire experience in food and customer service as well as working together with others."
good,"São muitos atenciosos ,uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar, tem chances de crescer lá dentro"
good,"Management is what makes the job annoying, but overall not that bad. If you are creative the job can be very fun for you but honestly making coffee isn't for everybody."
good,"a typical workday depends on how the day has been whether it has been busy or slow will determine whether how the day would go. I enjoy working at Starbucks because I have had the opportunity to grow and develop my leadership skills,  also having great coworkers helps the experience be more enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed the friendly environment of Starbucks. It was a very fast paced and kept you on your feet. I learned to communicate with customers and coworkers and challenged myself to remember different drink recipes. The hardest part of the job was working in a small place with 3 other people. The most enjoyable part of the job was having regular customers and learning/memorizing their drink orders. Its almost like you develop a relationship with them.
good,Starbucks is a buy always changing job.  Nothing is ever the same.  Customers/working with the public can be hard.  Even though its just coffee customers can be ruthless.
good,Best job I have ever had! They treat their employees like human beings and they do not compromise on their values. Would definitely recommend working for Starbucks.
good,"Over the course of my Starbucks career I shifted gears several times.  At different points I worked at Starbucks because I needed health care, because I wanted to be a manager and later just because I needed any job!  All three were okay."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. I love coffee so the environment had a very welcoming smell. The diverse crowd was very inspiring to see every day. All types of people coming in and out on their way to wherever. It was very entertaining.
good,Its a great job if you can get it. The benefits are awesome and the pay is comp. If you are passionate you can count on a raise every year. If you care your employees will also care. The store manager will determine the culture of the store. 100%
good,"Fun place to work, teamwork environment, fast paced, exciting, friendly people, able to make people’s day by serving them coffee. Good company who noticed your hard work."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is getting prep for the day. Brewing coffee and tea. Making sure the pastries display is set up by the diagram. You learn how to make each drink on the menu. Having a good attitude and positive outlook. Greet customers.
good,"Starbucks is a great company that provides a fun work environment, multiple benefits including; medical, education, stock, retirement and company discounts.  Starbucks creates a diverse environment for both partners and customers and I enjoy working here."
good,"This was a great first job. Fast paced environment but pretty easy to learn and the training was comprehensive and understanding. Excellent staff, made a lot of friends and even friends with regular customers. Hardest part was busy times on the bar with a long line of drinks, making sure communication was happening between the register, bar and food."
good,"get along well with customers and co-workers, having fun communicating with others and helping others"
good,"Very fun job, especially while you're in school. Only reasons I quit were because of low wage and busy with school, otherwise I would have stayed working here."
good,I loved working at Starbucks but I needed to relocate and I needed to make more money. If I needed a part time job in the future I would definitely consider Starbucks again
good,A typical day on the job definitely keeps you busy. Working at Starbucks helps you to understand the importance of anticipation and learning how to multitask. You should always be one step ahead of your tasks for the day so you don't fall behind during the rush. The most difficult thing to master is probably the bar and making drinks but that comes with time. You get to learn a lot about coffee and the free food and drinks are definitely a bonus. One of the most beneficial parts about being a Starbucks employee is the opportunity to obtain health coverage as a part-time worker. This is very useful for employees trying to maintain a work-school balance and do not have the time to put in the required hours for a full time 9-5 job.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks and had a lot of fun during shifts. Management went through many changes at my certain location and became a big issue with many people and affected the whole working environment. It affected not only the baristas as well as many customers have noticed the change in atmosphere.
good,Starbucks was a very fun place to work. Most of my customers became very comfortable with me and preferred only me to make their drink. The other employees were very easy to work with. Management really made my job easier and made me really enjoy coming to work. A typical day coming to work at Starbucks was very fast paced and you never get bored because there is always something to do and a lot to look forward to. The best part about the job was that the customers became like family.
good,"Fast paced with amazing coworkers. Learned how to handle conflict, and also valuable customer service skills I will take with me. Hardest part was memorizing the menu, but after some practice it became familar. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with many different customers throughout my shift and creating and insuring customer loyalty."
good,It was great knowing that I made some ones morning go by smoother by having their coffee ready when they walk through the door and also greeting them by there first name.
good,"My time with Starbucks was great. My second manager was the best boss that I have ever had. He truly cared about each and every one of us and how we were doing in our lives. I loved working for the company, the job was stimulating as well as rewarding. It was also a great way for me to pay my way through college while being able to have flexible hours to make time for class."
good,"This job has a lot of room for growth, the different customers are cut-throat. You must have a lot of customer service experience to survive in this atmosphere. You must also be prepared to be at work at 4am to open the store."
good,"Aprendí demasiadas cosas a lo largo de mi experiencia en starbucks, la primera que siempre tenemos que dar lo mejor de uno para que el cliente se sienta cómodo con el servicio y de esa manera regrese, su psicología era bastante atractiva y muy justa, excelente ambiente de trabajo, todos se ayudan con todos para lograr un fin común y alcanzar las metas que se proponen, desde mi punto de vista no existió parte difícil por que me gustaba laborar ahí, tal vez al principio lógicamente por que no conocía mucho acerca de la cultura del café, lo que me llevo de starbucks es el crecimiento que tuve y las amistades que genere ahí, también te ofrecen prestaciones muy buenas y son accesibles con los horarios, en especial si eres estudiante."
good,"Starbucks was my life for the past year and a half working there. I attribute my life to it pretty much. School, food from the partner bin, etc. Great friends. Only problem is I can't pay the rent."
good,"Fun job, very stressful but customer relationships are what make the job enjoyable.  Store slightly understaffed at all times with high turnover rate."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for nearly 4 years. Prior to that I had been a regular customer for nearly 10 years. Starbucks offers some of the best benefits to part-time and full-time employees of any company out there. Including but not limited to employer sponsored health, vision, dental life, and 401k plans. Additionally they offer Restricted Stock Unit grants through their ""Bean Stock"" program that allows employees (partners) the opportunity to become share holders. They also offer 100% tuition reimbursement through their College Achievement Program which allows Partners to achieve a BA/BS degree. At the store level Starbucks makes lots of strides to manage employees work/life balance by requiring a minimum of 8 hours between scheduled shifts. Meaning employees are rarely forced to close the store and then return to open the following morning. Many stores are understaffed meaning if a partner doesn't report to work the rest of the team suffers with few consequences for the offending partner. Lots of the issues you'll find with Starbucks are localized to Lower-Management (Store and District Managers) and there is often little accountability regarding issues with the management in  these positions. Beyond that Starbucks has an incredibly encouraging and inclusive company culture. The only other complaint I have is that for offering such incredible benefits the pay is fair, but not extremely competitive."
good,"Enjoyed staff, customers came in masses. Stoneridge Mall's hyped up customers mere plenty.  I enjoyed working on the bar because it took much multi-tasking.  It was fun and I got a bunch of coffee to take home to my parents."
good,"This job is fast paced but absolutely rewarding. It's great to be a part of such a passionate company. Making drinks and foods is fun, so is making personal connections with customers. Can be stressful but it is so worth it if you're right for the job."
good,"I was lucky to have an amazing manager, and then I got a bad manager and it really changed the experience that I had at Starbucks. I really enjoy the company and their values, I would highly recommend this job to anyone with a customer service background."
good,"Fast paced, good working atmosphere.  Gets busy during certian times of the day. Good benefits. Easy to talk to manager, and shift supervisor. Not a lot of negative attitudes. Not sure how easy to advance within the company."
good,"I love this company. It has grown to be like a second home and really a lifestyle. "
good,"Pretty good job, but if you are going to be there long term it can suck from a pay perspective. I love working there and knowing that I’ll always have a job if I want to move somewhere, but I’ve had several bad managers that make it difficult to move up."
good,The culture is fun and geared towards success for all. There are many advancement opportunities and everyone is helpful in getting you to meet your goals.
good,"Typically on your feet for long hours, depending on the area the customers can be tough to handle (especially morning shifts) but a rewarding job if you can talk to anyone. Easy dress code and very easy to learn to make the drinks."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced and stressful job. Benefits are great and there are a lot of opportunities to advance in the company. It's very rewarding . My favorite part was getting to know my regulars and their drinks- having their drink ready for them as they come up to check out would always make them smile. Making samples of new drinks or food items for the customers was a lot of fun too or drawing a promotion on the signs really helped show artistic creativity."
good,"I loved working here. Although it was and still can be overwhelming, once you become good at what you do it’s a breeze. It’s a great place to develop people skills."
good,"The Starbucks at which I work is the only Drive Through location in a city of 104,000 with an Air Force base and an NCAA Division II sized university. My store gets hectic at times but is a great place to work."
good,"Starbucks has a great work culture of respect and teamwork. They offer a comparable wage for the industry, but also offer excellent healthcare benefits, free coffee, and other benefits. I would recommend looking into them, if you are considering it."
good,"Make customer connections, take customers' orders, pay attention to allergies, be welcoming and friendly."
good,"Working for Starbucks can be stressful. However, the job stays at work. Preparing coffee for people allows you to connect with many different types of people and interact in a fairly relaxed environment. Every store is made or broken by the people you work with and for. As a part-time, entry level or get you by job, it has to be one of the absolute best."
good,"There's always something to do but that's not all bad. Management is always great, and always room for advancement if you put in the work. The reason for leaving is my work-life balance was not meeting my long-term needs."
good,"Starbucks was great! ... I worked there for 4 years and put myself through my undergrad. Gave me flexible hours and really great benefits. Not many places have healthcare benefits for part-time staff. "
good,"the culture at starbucks was more like a comfortable home setting, people were always nice and my management was great. I got lucky because I turned out having an amazing team and was able to meet many people and grow as a person there."
good,"This is a great company to be apart of. Lots to learn from, it definitely gives you a family feel. Easy to get promoted as well. It is quite the enjoyable place to make a career."
good,"I would recommend working at Starbucks if you need a part time job or are in between jobs. The benefits, culture, and people are usually great to work."
good,"This is the place where i learned so many things in life.even a single smile from a customer brings you happiness and would we also do great things for them like fun chatting and all "
good,"I was part of the night crew at Starbucks, so I typically was involved with a lot of the cleaning and shut down procedures. I enjoyed interacting with our regular customers and getting to know them. The only downfall was that I wish I could have worked more than I did."
good,The hardest part of working at Starbucks is absolutely the high volume traffic moments. I would find myself overwhelmed with no help available but i made it through each shift.
good,"If you find a store with strong management, there is so much you can learn about business operations and professional development. If you find yourself under poor management, don't give up on the company. Look into transferring stores; it is a fairly simple process. The benefits are great and you get a free lb of coffee a week!"
good,"Fun job , loved all the the fun drinks that i got to make . my clientele was fun and tips were good. Management was really nice and helpful.  it was on my campus so going to work was easy"
good,"Empresa con muy buen ambiente, le dan gran importancia a toda la parte humana y es muy tranquilo. Pocas horas de trabajo con muy buen sueldo."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for almost 10 years. Although it was not my intention to work there for so long, I am proud to have had the opportunity. I learned so much about being a leader, how to achieving more than I thought was possible, and helping others achieve more than they thought was possible. I love Starbucks for the coffee, the culture, and the people."
good,I have been working for the company since 2015 and it has truly shaped the person I am today. It truly has opened doors for me and enhances my overall customer service.
good,"Though I was not intending to be in the food service industry for long, I was happy to work at Starbucks. It kept me on my toes and enhanced my customer service skills. Plus the benefits are awesome!"
good,Great atmosphere!  Relaxed but still fast paced. Loved the customers. they were able to work with my schedule. it was a fun job and people loved coming in!
good,"Wonderful job for teenagers that need a summer job, or for anyone who might be in college and needs extra money, it's a nice environment to work in, great management overall."
good,Fun place to work at! My coworkers are amazing and make the shifts fly by. Great benefits! You have options to partake in stocks which is a really nice bonus.
good,"Wonderful working environment. Very team oriented. Fast paced and can be overwhelming at times. Especially great for a first job, you will learn strong work ethic. Your experience may vary with some managers however I find that 90% of them are great at what they do."
good,"Overall it was a fun job and I had a lot of fun doing it. The days go by fast with the influx of customers, and the team was super nice and understanding."
good,"If you're willing to put in some effort to your work, it's an easy job. Lots to lear, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be fine. Managers are hit or miss. I've had some really amazing ones and some less than stellar ones."
good,Starbucks was a great opportunity to come across. I developed more time management skills and learned how to adapt to a different customer and their needs on a daily basis.
good,"Fast paced, exciting, ever changing work environment. You will always be on your toes. Flexible work hours with decent money to be made. You will be acknowledged and rewarded for your hard work. Amazing place to work."
good,"Starbucks, regardless of how little hours I was scheduled, was a great place to work at. The atmosphere was relaxing and welcoming for both the partners and the customers. The hardest part of the job, for me, was having to learn and memorize the drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the human experience-- by this I mean, customer service and getting to interact and build a rapport with the customers."
good,After working at Starbucks for a year I have nothing but positive things to say about the company as a whole and the work environment. A fantastic place to work for students putting themselves through university.
good,"Each day is a combination of making drinks, making connections, and cleaning the store. The job is fast paced which can make it difficult to form customer connections, but it keeps the job fun and with enough practice can be balanced with connection. Starbucks takes good care of their employees and I always feel valued. I love to make our customers feel the same way."
good,"I think Starbucks is a wonderful place to work, Full of fun, Passion and drive. Quality drinks are made everyday and I have met amazing people through my job."
good,Great place to work with others and to interact with others. I enjoyed the culture very much. I learned a lot about different aspect of business. Great management.
good,"this was my first job ever. i had so much fun learning about coffee. the management was a bit unorganized. "
good,great stepping stone for a dedicated career minded individual who wants to take their work experiences and apply them in future endeavors. started out at the bottom and worked my way up to a supervisor. Managers were very helpful with my progression
good,"A typical day at work is usually stressful due to our rushes. Great people work there as well. You learn great customer service. Management is usually good. I learned how to deal with stressful situations, how to work at a fast pace, how to multitask."
good,I loved the whole atmosphere this job provides. They really work well with customers and employees. I think they go above and beyond on all aspects of a work environment.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work! Depending on the store, you can have a really fast paced environment or a slower environment. I am an outgoing person and loved the social aspect of the job. There are constant trainings on customer service and these skills learned can be used in all future jobs. You also receive free stock just for being employed through Starbucks and if you need, health insurance as long as you work a minimum amount of hours. Also if you like coffee, you will enjoy the free drinks and pound of coffee each week. Overall I highly recommend Starbucks as an employer."
good,"Sometimes it would get crazy busy and you do experience your fair share of unruly customers and people who care a little too much about their coffee, but overall, the experience is great. Most everyone I worked with were amazing people and even when days got rough, they made it fun and bearable. Working at Starbucks also gave me a lot of good people skills, from learning to work with other people and work hard as a team to complete talks to connecting with all the people you serve coffee to everyday."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for two years. Going in was a bit overwhelming. Learning the names and times of everything such as shot times and steaming times was tough the first week. However, management is great and you aren't set up to fail everyone works together as a team so you quickly pick up on things. On a typical day you can expect daily tasks such as; cleaning the bar, tables, floor and so on, as well as being on bar making drinks, greeting customers, and answering a multitude of customer questions so you must be knowledgeable of the products. The hardest part of the job I would say is when there is a rush you must work quickly and still put out quality drinks. If not you will have to remake the drink on top of the other ten that are still on bar so focus is a must. Also, staying stocked on milk, whip cream, and heating up food on the oven all while still doing bar and or running register during a rush gets overwhelming. Although this is where multitasking as a skill is a must. The best part of working at Starbucks are the customers your regulars especially, and mostly your co-workers."
good,"i learned to be a happier person "
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy comodo, aprendi a trabajar en equipo bajo presion con personas que tienen liderazgo y que tambien asumes ese puesto que te hace crecer y tambien un entorno muy amigable al tratar con clientes."
good,"Work is harder than you would think.  The pace is crazy a lot of times.  You will get burned, scratched, etc often until you get more experienced.  But when you have the right manager and crew, it is a very rewarding job."
good,"I consider this job to be THE best job for people coming out of high school or just looking for a part time position. The company takes very good care of its employees, they even offer disaster and emergency relief funds. Very focused on customer care as well, good training if you're ultimately seeking a job that requires working with people often."
good,This job is great for a full time student or a permanent position for upper management. As a shift leader I was responsible for my shift as acting manager if he or she was not present. I would handle cash management such as the closing out transaction and accountability to the safe. The culture it self is enough to stay. It may be a fast pace on the bar floor but that drives self accomplishment motivation which effects morale and competition with peers to be better at their craft. Improvement for self worth is the best antidote for younger people within this business typically.
good,I wanna look for a better job. But in general is a good company to grow. My manager is a great boss she work around my schedule and .ale me feel welcome.
good,"Typical day includes making a variety of espresso and tea based beverages. Connecting and recommending merchandise, drinks, and food items to a variety of clientele and individuals."
good,"Starbucks was challenging and fast paced, with the ability to grow and develop relationships in a team based environment. Built and grew company with strong leadership skills"
good,"un trabajo muy integral , con muchos controles, pero con buena cultura laboral"
good,"My hours could be better, but it is worth the job for the amount of benefits you get and the amount of amazing people you get to work with. Working for this company, you get hotel discounts, food and drink discounts, and paid employee events."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an opportunity to form lasting customer/barista relationships, and I truly enjoyed making people's days with a great cup of coffee and a smile. Even at the busiest times, the culture around Starbucks coffee is relaxed and welcoming. The management cares for the employees and the work is reasonable. Difficult customers and rush hours occasionally made the job harder, but overall Starbucks is a desirable place to work."
good,"Starbucks is a GREAT career if you are a fast learner and have great communication skills."
good,"Constantly moving, customer driven and team based job helped me develop not only my barista skills, but also time management, critical thinking, customer relations, and leadership attributes. The hardest part of the job is working at such a fast paced and high level flow. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and customers you meet and build strong relationships with. Additionally, there are great benefits with this company, including free college online at ASU! Go Sun Devils!"
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. It has its ups and downs but overall I love working there. The pay is not the best but you get free drinks while you work and a discount when you are not working
good,"loved working with Starbucks, would definitely go back to work part time if I has the time! I miss making lattes all the time, took a while to get the hang of it though!"
good,"Busy, but very energetic and upbeat place to work."
good,Loved working here it was an amazing job. The pay just made it hard to pay bills. Didn’t get the amount of hours I needed and it impacted my living situation.
good,"The hardest part would be just managing your time. If you are closing. Besides, that I always had a great fun time seeing daily customers and having conversation with my coworkers."
good,"Starbucks overall is a great company to work for. You receive many great benefits while employed such as free coffee markouts every week, discounts on merchandise, as well as stock opportunities and 401k benefits."
good,"Starbucks Company creates drinks for each season."
good,"The one I worked at happened to be on a college campus library so the environment was phenomenal. Lots of buzz, witty conversation, music, jokes. If I could really make a living doing it I would honestly have loved to stay there because the people and preparing their drinks while they were studying was so satisfying. It felt like I was really taking care of them and in turn they would amuse us in their own fashions. They would also ask for new drink types that they custom requested and would actually teach us how to make it. Some things like the knock off Captncrunch which I originally did not know you could make from Starbucks flavorings. Also the constant walking around, fast movements, and I actually started liking coffee O_o resulted in me losing the most weight at one point I ever had."
good,"Really nice people to work with, it’s crazy liberal if you like that sort of thing. The liberal side has its ups and downs. But it overall is a really good job. Supervisors are really nice. Teamwork is big. Take time to get to know ppl. It will get you far."
good,Overall really good. I really like my co-works and my manager was pretty relax. Perfect job for any college student looking to make so decent cash and make some friends.
good,"I worked at Chartwells/Starbucks for five years. If you want to feel like part of a work family that supports you and listens to your needs, this is the place for you. Very fast-paced, but your co-workers and managers are more than willing to help you adjust. The only reason I left was because I was at a time in my life where I needed to be compensated more, and that I will say is one of the only cons of this job. However, if you are a student on campus or just looking for general work this is a great place to go!!"
good,"I was able to grow so quickly with this company. I became a shift supervisor, barista trainer, and coffee master within six months of each other. It is a great place to work that I would recommend to anyone."
good,"Great Company"
good,"I love being a Starbucks partner.  My store baristas are all so nice and caring which makes work fun.  Although fast paced and sometimes stressful, it's very rewarding."
good,"Great company to work for, the benefits were great. The work environment was good for the majority of my experience. I was promoted with the company,  it was a great job to have."
good,"Great place overall but management needs some attention. Customers are great and co-workers make you feel like you're apart of a family, but management will have u feeling empty on false promises."
good,"I worked at Starbucks throughout my education at UIC, seeking my bachelor's degree. It was fast-paced, exciting, and could be very fun at times. Of course as with any job there are the downsides, for instance call offs equaling to a short staffed day. Otherwise, this job as a barista was very convenient especially for someone with a ever changing school schedule!"
good,Love working for this company have a good benefits and hours are good and will work around you life schedule. I am a single mother with a busy schedule with a daughter that plays hockey and lacrosse and I am able to see her games and take time with my family. .
good,"I go to work early to open shop, i love most of the employees i work with."
good,It's enjoyable overall. It all depends on how you get along with you co-workers. The best way to do so is to be as open as possible and keep pace with the more experienced baristas.
good,"Working at the Holiday Inn was a great experience. I got to meet quite a few new, interesting people. I enjoyed my hours and my coworkers, I enjoyed the management and how easily I got along with everyone."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an amazing experience and being my first job I learned so much with the help of everyone there. The job suited me and my extroverted personality, and i really do miss my time working there."
good,"I enjoy most of my years in Starbucks, as they are providing different program and activities engaging the team and the customers and they will teach you how to become the most efficient Customer Service provider. Apart from that Starbucks are passionately in terms of Peoples creativity and development, culture, and environmental issues. Additionally being part of Management team they will ensure that you have the most relevant pieces of training to become more effective and productive."
good,Starbucks is busy! I worked in Las Vegas so maybe that is why my experience was so busy but it is a great company! The management could improve but I only worked under one manager so that could have just been my store.
good,O que me deixa insatisfeita com a empresa é a que nao possui horario fixo de trabalho e trabalhar aos feriados e finais de semana.
good,"Es una gran empresa para trabajar, hay constante capacitación, uno como persona crece aprendiendo de los valores de la marca, así como inyectándose de esa pasión por hacer las cosas bien, se desafía el Status Quo en cada momento."
good,fun place to work and you get to meet and network with so many people. The training is awesome and the relationships you create with customers is also very rewarding. You never really know how much a smile and a cup of coffee can change a persons day
good,"Experiencing growth, being around a diversity group of people, and learning new things everyday. I love becoming more aware everyday of my community and Starbucks is one the best place's to learn the experience of customer service."
good,"For some reason the most unapproachable people are put into management positions.But, the drink and food perks along with great benefits and fun people to work with does make up for that!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was fantastic. It was pretty crazy work place environment, the interview was informal, management was a little difficult because she wasn't as invested in the store as I would have liked, great discounts, benefits were fantastic, didn't take advantage of the schooling online for free but knew who people who did and loved it."
good,great environment and co-worker. I liked working here a lot. I worked at the starbucks located in the lobby. Sometimes it was super busy and frustrating but overall I liked the company. management needs work though
good,"Although the training and job itself are hard, the comradery between coworkers is unmatchable and makes the job insanely worth it. Regular customers become friends as do your coworkers and managers. Cannot say enough about this place of work."
good,Working was very fast paced but was very enjoyable in times when you interacted with customers. People/customers always made my day and seeing regulars everyday was very enjoyable and made the time fly by.
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. The benefits do outweigh the often time low pay they give and the fact that they don't hire full time unless you are a lead or manager.
good,"I've been with Starbucks for just under a year and I have little to no regrets. The company is good to it's partners offering great work/life balance and a multitude of benefits. Also, has a diverse range of people and personalities which makes for a good time"
good,A great company to work for. Your manager and co-workers are very important since the job is so demanding. A great team is what makes it all worth it! Good company benefits although no company pension benefit set up for employees who work at the store level. Very professional environment to work.
good,It has a really fun environment where you learn really fast and do a lot of things at the same time. The people are really nice and you always have help from your superiors/coworkers. It really is a team.
good,I loved working here. It was a great environment and the team was more like family. There were good benefits and flexible hours. I think working at Starbucks can be better or worse depending on who the manager is. I had a great manager and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Fantastic work environment and benefits! Incredibly reliable as long as you do your job and very fulfilling in doing so. Team workplace with lots of opportunities.
good,"I've come to an understanding that Starbucks is probably one of the best companies to work for when you're wanting experience in sales, communication, leadership, achieving goals and much more."
good,"Starbucks has a great culture, but lacked structure in training depending on the department.  Some marketing roles can be very executional and not very general management focused.  Very different from traditional CPG brand management."
good,"The work environment was interesting but fun. I would recommend this job to college students or someone with a second job, starbucks is very flexible."
good,"Good place to work for a young person starting out and going to school, since it offers help to paid for tuition. Retail hours can be a bit wild closing late and opening super early the next day."
good,"Treats employees well, gives ample time for training, encouraging towards employees, good benefits. Work is challenging but fun.  Can be a bit overwhelming at times, but that's typical of amy customer service job, really."
good,Wonderful company to work for during school. Very flexible with work hours. The employees are great and the company is well known and respected by all future employers.
good,"Starbucks is a great job with great benefits. The things you learn will truly help boost your skill level in the area of customer service. providing great service is above all, priority."
good,"The location I was at was very encouraging of being the best you could be and willing to do what was needed to make sure that happened! They were accommodating to my hours, working multiple jobs, and when I informed them I had an opportunity doing what I really wanted to do, they were very accommodating and encouraging to pursue my dreams even if it meant it wasn't with them"
good,"Starbucks is by faar one of the best employers I've ever worked for.  However, like most service industry jobs, the pay can be a little lackluster.  The other benefits that you get are very well thought out and far better than anything I've experienced at any company I've worked for.  "
good,"This was a temporary,  part time job that I could work around my children's school and activities.  Both of my kids now drive and now I am looking for a full time job.  The hours were great and Starbuck gives great benefits.  Unfortunately, I need to be making more money per year."
good,"Day would consist of stocking goods, cleaning, and preparing handcrafted beverages"
good,"The work place is wonderful, you start your day off with a cup of coffee, then head out on the floor where it all begins customers coming in for there coffee, & some customers come more the once a day so you grow to know them. Management was very flexible with everyone's schedules, they tried they best they could"
good,"I love working at Starbucks because I feel like they truly care about their partners and customers. They go above and beyond to ensure that their partners are trained properly and their customers are satisfied. The only con I would list is that the 10 minute breaks are very short, especially if you need time for to eat and use the restroom."
good,"greet customers take their coffee orders"
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience, especially when it came to gaining benefits and working good hours throughout the week. Many benefits including paying college tuition are what make the company great."
good,"They were great at scheduling me when I didn't have school. Almost the entire crew came and went while I was there and with every person hired, the place became more friendly and fun."
good,I worked there for about one yea and still consider it my favorite job. I love everything that comes with being a certified barista and not long after you can transfer to a shift leader just like that. I enjoyed being around all different kind of people from all over the world.  And being able to make someones day was my ideal.
good,The culture is very awesome. The overall management is very people-oriented. The workplace is fun and very comfortable. Free coffee and pastries! Always fun at work.
good,"the day starts with a cup of coffee.."
good,The flexibility that Starbucks offers their partners is like none i have ever seen before-- and their benefits are even better! No other fast food place is going to offer their emplloyees a 401k!
good,In my time at Starbucks I learned a lot about customer service perspective. The balance between workload and customer priority was probably the most difficult aspect of the job however it would become easier to manage.
good,"Honestly had the best experience working here, learning how to make good coffee and developing people skills both with customers and coworkers. The hardest part was always when it got busy, but if you work with the right people, you can divy up the work and keep the bar clean and productive, the drinks tasty, and the customers happy."
good,This is a Great company to grow and make a career out of. You learn as you go. and branches through out the nation are there to help you if needed . over all 5 stars.
good,"Starbucks provide communication skill, management skill and operation skill for shift supervisor."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. its got a diversity of people and atleast where i worked i got treated right. however im ready to leave because im looking forward in doing what i want to do now. i been at the company for  five years.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was in the main lobby of the hospital so it was very very busy, The tips were great! The training is really in depth so when you hit the floor you dont feel anxiety. Everyone that I worked was so helpful."
good,"I loved this job. The employees were all fun to work with and the job was fun to do. As an employee, you can really tell that Starbucks cares for you because they give you 401K, stock, and (based on how many hours you work) health benefits."
good,"I loved working here because of it's fun, fast paced environment. The company is awesome to work for--great training program, excellent benefits for part-time employees. I would have stayed with the company, but really wanted a 9-5/Mon-Fri job."
good,"three nothing wrong with this job, it just doesn't fit what i need anymore, i really not want to have to type some long thing. Every American could know what its like being in starbucks, if not try being a customer first before you work."
good,This company helps you grow. It develops you as a person and be confident with yourself. The work environment is positive for the most part. Great for young adults starting out.
good,"Lieu de travail agréable, directeur a l'écoute.. .."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. You make loads of connections and possibly long term friends. Learn many things about coffee and customer service.
good,A typical day at work would be somewhat stressful with trying to give people exactly what they want. Management was amazing. Hardest part of job: working hard and long hours
good,Love my customers. Starbucks is a busy place so you have to enjoy keeping busy.  Hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time.  Great benefits.
good,"Ik heb hier 2 jaar met veel plezier gewerkt! "
good,A great place to become friends with the customers and a fast pace job were you have to be able to multi task and keep up were you have to learn how to be on your own and be able to manage the register the oven and the bar
good,"With all of their employee incentive programs in place, Starbucks is absolutely one of the best part-time jobs you can get. That said, if a manager has a problem with you personally, seeing as they're non-union, there is pretty much nothing you can do about it."
good,They have a nice culture in this company and you feel taken care of. Great job for college students. If you can put up with people being rude to you (like any food service job these days) then you'll be fine.
good,"At Starbucks, everyone is constantly busy, but generally good-natured and overall a fun environment to work in. "
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work and it has really changed my life. I have developed many great friendships and relationships while working for Starbucks. The benefits are amazing and they really care about their employees. Because of Starbucks, I am getting to go to college, I do not know if I would have if it were not for my job there. They pay for college completely and you get a paycheck as well. Their HR department makes it clear that they care about you when you have a problem and they are willing to work with you to get your situation covered. I love working for this company and I plan to stay as long as I can. Plus, we get free coffee! Who could say no to that! If you just relax and don't take it too seriously, you'll have a great time. It is just coffee after all!"
good,I go into work and see what help is needed and I immediately jump right into the bar and make peoples drinks to perfection.  Everyone is friendly with each other and we listen to music while doing everything we have to do.  Simply a fun job to have.
good,A great job for getting used to fast paced jobs. Also good for communication skills. Overall i learned a lot working there. Meeting new people and co workers was a great way to network my way into other jobs.
good,"Fun enviorment pay is ok, could be better with hours,"
good,"Starbucks for me is a company that made me a better person. This company raised my confidence in all aspects such as customer connection, solving problem at the moment, delivering my very best in every possible way and of course making a great cup of coffee."
good,"If you have a good team, good managment this company is amazing to work for but you are gonna have to work. There is a lot to learn in a short amount of time before you have to apply it and it can be stressful with the pace but still a great place to work for."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for students that need a part time job. They are very flexible in the best way possible. You can choose your own schedule and get all the days off you need.
good,I loved working here and if I ever move back to the area I will definitely go back! It is very fast paced but the connections you make with customers and employees are unforgettable.
good,The store I work at has great management and are always there for me in every aspect of my life. The partners I work with also make everyday exciting and fun no matter how crazy the orders get or how frustrating I get when I encounter certain customers. But I understand that this is my particular store and every store may be different. So I'm a bit biased when I say I love working at my store and don't mind waking up at 3:30 am to be at work. I have been here for 2 years now and must now part ways to better support my growing family.
good,"Never a dull moment when working....Mornings were great, evening were great. High-quality, full-flavored coffee anyway you want. Laughter always in the air. As a shift supervisor, I trained and learned, and served."
good,"Your team becomes your family. My team was always there to help during hard times and celebrate during great times."
good,"Starbucks | Barista | Merritt Island, FL "
good,"Meet different people, lots of room for growth,  very friendly environment. customers were very patient, management wasn't good, pay was horrible, and a lot of miss communication"
good,"todos son necesarios en la empresa, y si tienes la oportunidad te ayudan y esperan que hagas lo mismo, aprendes a tratar con todo tipo de clientes y a entregarles un buen servicio."
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had. It's a shame that I had to take my leave from them, but I don't hold any grudges and I would easily work there again if I was given the chance. All the people there were some of the best I have met and the customers are always grateful for their coffee."
good,I loved working for this company. The only complaint I would have is I was forced to flee the state due to home environment & they were not very supportive nor understanding. I am now looking for another job due to relocation & lack of understanding.
good,My time there was hard a constant flow of orders and customers that required timely and organized attention. The work was worth it because of the atmosphere and company that was kept at work
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and working alongside different people.  I enjoy making the customers feel welcomed and enjoy the experience.
good,"En un día normal de trabajo el ambiente era muy bueno siempre existía el compañerismo, logre aprender a tener un buen trato con el cliente y siempre tenerlo al centro así como dar todo de mi siempre aun fuera un día tranquilo siempre mantener todo al 100, siempre conté con el apoyo de mis superiores y te apoyaban cuando fuera necesario."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks for a total of 4 years, the environment, and customer connections was something that made me strive everyday."
good,"provided excellent customer service while making hand crafted beverages. completed opening, and closing procedures in accordance with company policies. Assist management with on the job training of new associates."
good,"Working at Starbucks is definitely not for the faint of heart. You'll be tested on your ability to move quickly and get things done in a timely manner. You work as a team with your partners and if you or another team member slacks off too much, the store suffers as a whole.  The culture of each store varies depending on how the store manager and shift supervisors guide the baristas. You'll find that one store operates completely in a completely different workplace atmosphere than another. "
good,Fast paced environment with ample opportunities to interact with the community around us. Friendly staff and many other opportunities through the company. Pays for college through ASU.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. I was a cashier and took drink and food orders. I also prepped food and/or made their drinks. It was a very good work environment. The management was fantastic.
good,A day a Starbucks is a very upbeat and exciting experience.  I have enjoyed all my time at Starbucks I love it so much and i can't think of any other way to thank everyone of my partners at Starbucks everyday for being such fun and loving people to working with.
good,"I loved the management, but the other crew members were not only rude to the other co - workers but also the customers coming through drive - thru. Many of the time my other co - workers were blatantly rude to their faces."
good,"Es una empresa generosa y muy accesible con sus trabajadores, con una filosofía y misión bastante agradable."
good,"Really helped me become an individual who is great at multitasking, prioritizing and meeting the needs of the customers. Built great character and passion for helping."
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company to work for and they work very hard for their employees. Starbucks gives their employees so many benefits it is hard to list/think of all of them. The biggest is either free college education or cheap/affordable health insurance! Starbucks starts everyone at two dollars higher than minimum wage, gives free coffee, one free food item a day, 401k, stock options, the list goes on. If you are looking for a place that gives great benefits and is very flexible with schedules and work/life balance then this is the company to work with!"
good,"The job itself was satisfying, but I don't feel the pay was worth the intensity of the labor and management at some stores were great while others were practically unbearable. Great benefits, but promotion through all ranks always was a dragged out process."
good,I had no problem  in Texas at Starbucks  moved hear to north Carolina  not fully staff  can't keep workers I worked  at a store with a lot of problems with the  manger and staff
good,"Fast Pace but still fun.. Friendly people to work with, made a lot of friends there.  Busy during the rushes and cleaning during down time...overall not a bad job"
good,"This was the favorite job I have had learnt so much while keeping in a fun and family-like environment!!!"
good,I loved my time with Starbucks.  I still stay in touch with my former partners.  I would still be working there if they paid more.  Management was most understanding and helpful.
good,It is typically a fast paced day that challenges you to manage your time and get the job done right. It has taught me to learn quickly and do a thorough job each and every time.
good,"At Starbucks i would mainly work in the mornings, so what that would consist of is setting up the store. Starbucks is a good place to interact with costumers to show a friendly side of you. What I've learned is no matter how the costumers treat you, treat them with respect at all times.The management was great and the environment at Starbucks was incredible because you get to meet new people. The hardest part of the job was moving at a fast and consistent paste, so that the business could get a strong review. The most enjoyable part of the job would be serving drinks to the customers and free food."
good,Enjoyed the work I did here. My manager created a place that was fun and enjoyable to work in. Pay was not the best but they do have great employee benefits.
good,"Great culture where customer service is of highest importance. Very affable staff, good rapport between co-workers and with customers as well. Supportive and invested management at the local and district levels."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work with lost of friendly faces that come to visit frequently. Also working for Starbucks offers advancement opportunities in many areas.
good,The work culture is war and inviting. Training is provided along with mentoring. This business is customer service driven. Happy employees are needed to carry out that mission. Starbucks are considerate of their employees. They provide you with all the tools necessary to be successful.
good,"I started as a Barista after having a baby to get benefits and found myself working my way up the ladder to eventually becoming a store manager. However, I didn't want to be in retail anymore so I went back to school."
good,Love the customer connections that Starbucks allows me to have and really enjoy the overall environment. I enjoy that I am encouraged to make a connection with the people that come in because usually a lot of social connection is lost in our society so working for a company that makes that a priority really makes me enjoy my job.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work.  Along with the free coffee, they often give away to each partner, merchandise such as tshirts, cups, candy and anything else available in their stores.  During the busy seasons, such as Christmas, you can find upper management out in the warehouse helping to pick orders or whatever they can do to help.  The hardest part of the job was leaving something undone.  The best part of the job was knowing that when you left at the end of the day, you were appreciated for what you did every day.  The management always told us we did a good job today, even if we felt we didn't get it all done.  That is the kind of thing that makes you want to go back tomorrow!"
good,"Starbucks is a great company that has a multitude of benefits!  In today's job market, this company finds the fairness in all of the work-life, education and training."
good,"Great place to work with fun co-workers and regular customers. Good benefits, and opportunities to further your career either at Starbucks or elsewhere"
good,"Es un grato y entretenido ambiente laboral, cada uno disfruta mucho lo que hace, nos cultirizamos acerca del cafe, nos dan muchos beneficios y se preocupan de nuestro bienestar y estabilidad emocional,"
good,"It was fun but it can get stressful at times, but having a strong team that helps you out and shares the stress is a big help and makes the work day easy"
good,"very great communication "
good,"I called this my ""Fun Job""! I enjoyed working for this company but in Austin at the time there was simply no room for advancement. My day job was in the Mortgage Industry and Starbucks was my 2nd job."
good,Great job for people looking to interact with other people. Recent changes to job standards have taken from job culture but one can still connect with customers and laugh and have fun while working. Management and company standards can be frustrating but does not interfere with the good that is being a barista.
good,"clean, stock, customer service, brew coffee, take temperatures, cashier, breaking down shipment, friendly environment, positive attitudes. Management is very accommodating to schedules"
good,Very easy going. loving partners and fun job. Very organized and always payed tips and wage on time. Very had an issue with any staff. Everyone was very friendly
good,"A regular day at Starbucks is filled with many obstacles. Mostly interacting with different people and different moods each day. Hardest part working with customers is keeping your cool and remaining focused on routine duties while engaging with each individual customer. Most enjoying part of the jib is the tips, the free food and the benefits."
good,Starbucks has always been there for me when I needed it. I'm truly grateful for that and that there's a company that takes such pride in helping its employees.
good,"Typical work day requires you as a Barista to memorize multiple orders while completing tasks in a timely manner. Multitasking and the ability to keep your customers/partners happy is the top priority. Once in the swing of things, the job is rewarding and fun. You never know what the day will bring so being able to adapt and work in different positions is vital for your success. Starbucks as a whole is a fun company to work for. There are many benefits and opportunities to grow. The hardest part of the job would be multitasking however your partners and customers are always understanding and will help you in any way."
good,"Being a Starbucks partner means having the opportunity to be something more than an employee. Gigantic possibilities lie ahead to grow as a person, in your career and in your community. To live the Starbucks mission and to be a leader. It’s the opportunity to become your personal best. To be connected to something bigger. To be meaningful to the world. And to be recognized for all of it. It’s all here for you."
good,Working at Starbucks was a fun experience to have. I learned how to work with other other employees to work in a ever changing environment. I made customers drink and each drink was different from each other. I also had to clean up the facility and stock the supplies of the store.
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun as long as you are at the right store, Benefits are WONDEFUL, pay not so much. The people you meet are great one of my favorite jobs it just didn't pay well enough. ."
good,"cool place to work for a summer job, the pay sucks for running a store with all the things that need to get done. its hard to get the people motivated to since most people are young kids or part timers. tips are cool though."
good,I'm usually a closer at Starbucks so I usually just prepare for closing by cleaning. The hardest part about the job would be around 5pm when it's a little rush and we only have 3 workers on the floor. I enjoy this job because I love interacting with costumers and making drinks.
good,"starbucks is a great company to work for. there are so many different insurance coverage plans and benefits to choose from, 401k, stock, ect. the discounts within the company are great, as well as with other companies"
good,"Make drinks, and clean. That's all that you really do! As a supervisor, it also, just made sure that things go smoothly. "
good,I love working as a barista and enjoy meeting people on a daily basis. Starbucks has been a great opportunity. I really feel like a partner and not just an emplyee.
good,"Una empresa muy humana, seria y profesional, con un excelente ambiente de trabajo, valores arraigados y mejora continua"
good,"always a productive work day being a barista, environment always nice, customers sometimes difficult but that is going to happen. very fun to make drinks"
good,I have worked for Starbucks in the past as a shift supervisor. I came back because Starbucks is a great company with amazing benefits. I have learned so much.
good,I do enjoy Starbucks to a great extent. There is one thing that is major that could be fixed and that is labor. We are short handed a lot. Other then that I love the company.
good,"The staff had great work ethic and everyone worked well together. Everyone was as professional as possible, and fast paced yet organized. Was a good job that taught discipline and patience."
good,"I enjoy working with this company, it is a great place to work where you get to create genuine connections with your customers. They also have a lot of great benefits. I mainly love working for a company that tries to do a lot for the community."
good,I really enjoyed being employed at Starbucks and frequently visit an- outlet because I prefer the coffee there. I  have recommended the beverages from Starbucks to many friends and relatives.
good,"A typical day was fast-pace. I learned how to make a variation of 250+ drinks. I loved working there! The hardest part of the job when I worked, was being the only barista to make drinks at times while the line was extensively long. The best part was the customer support!"
good,Working in the Starbucks company is truly a rewarding experience.I love the environment and the customers who come in everyday. So many friendly faces and great opportunities to grow and feel appreciated.
good,"The company offers health benefits even for those who work part-time (15 hours) which is more than I can say for other food & beverage companies. There is opportunity for advancement, but only to those who work hard and constantly project leadership (if you have a worthy manager). The work culture is out of this world. Being a barista is much more than making caffeinated (or decaffeinated) drinks, it's about the art of coffee and the teamwork that surrounds it. I was fortunate to work with an amazing team for 3+ years, allowing for a family vibe to grow and strengthen over time and work for a wonderful boss who won the lowest turn-over rate in Augusta (two years in a row). But when the management is not strong, then the team suffers (just like other companies). The hardest part of the job were the customers that came each week due to the location of the Starbucks store. This was not a drive-thru store, so this store was faced with a ""certain type"" of customer that came in everyday only to blow off steam from ""their jobs"" unto our team by causing much uproar. I adored the close-knit ties with the team, despite the location of the store and the constant bickering of customers within our location. However, there are drive-thru stores that serve as a regular place for customers that enjoy good service and do not blow off steam because of the location for their jobs, which make coffee-serving, well worth the struggle."
good,"Starbucks offers incredible benefits including tuition reimbursement, stock options and health benefits. That being said, I have worked for the company as a shift supervisor for 5 years and only make  about $1 more per hour than some new shift supervisors and even some baristas. The company always seems to be slightly behind on a comfortable pay for their store-level partners."
good,"Customer service oriented job, great for those in school or those looking to make a career out of it. This job has some great perks, one of my favourite parts of it was getting to know all the regulars in my home store."
good,"Fue una experiencia muy grata, Me gustó mucho el ambiente laboral y como tratan a sus empleados"
good,"Throughout the day your making a ton of different drinks, hot or cold and serving delicious pastries and interacting with customers who eventually you build relationships with these people as they come in and get really creative with these drinks they come up with."
good,You clock in and are given your position for the day. You carry out your tasks and get to interact with customers and other employees. You then clock out and finish your day.
good,"I love working at Starbucks. It has made me more confident in talking to people. It also has taught me to working in a fast pass environment. Overall, it is an amazing job and I would highly recommend it."
good,Starbucks has provided a great opportunity for me to take care of my family. My daughter is growing and the company provides a way for me as a single parent.
good,"Love starbucks. Great people, great company, great benefits. Wish the pay was a bit better, but it isn't minimum wage! Starbucks really cares about their partners."
good,Amazing place to work but u will work being a barista is no joke u do a lot and deal with a lot.. customers can make ur day or reck ur day... there is room to move up barista shift manager assistant manager and manager to district manager put in the hard work and they will notice it
good,I loved working for this company and the benefits allowed me to work part-time while finishing my undergraduate degree. The company takes care of its employees very well and I have no complaints about the 10 years I spent there.
good,"I learned how to put every customer before everything, care for people and their well-being, handle money, and how to multitask in a stressful environment while having a good attitude. The hardest part is learning about all the employees (their strengths and weaknesses) and incorporating that into my shifts. Making connections and relationships with customers is the most enjoyable part."
good,Opportunities to grow not just within the company but within the community. Expected to run shifts properly to ensure costumer satisfaction. I enjoy the customers and the benefits available through the company. Fun environment.
good,"your team is always willing to teach and support their fellow peer."
good,The environment of Starbucks was nice and friendly. It did get busy from time to time but everyone is laid back and you got to meet really interesting people. I would definitely work there again.
good,Its fun working at this company. I learned a lot! I became a coffee master to they encourage me because they seen a lot of potentials in me. Co workers are fun to be with too! You wont feel ur tired.
good,I had a blast in this position.  I enjoyed interacting with the patrons and my fellow employees.  I had a great deal of fun here. This was an awesome job. But I will never work retail for anyone again.
good,"a fun a friendly place to work, all of us partners know most of the regular customers and do what we can to make everyone's day. Being apart of Starbucks is one of the best jobs I can think of."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to be a part of. Everyone around you is striving for the same successful goal for the company. You feel like you're appreciated for the work you do with all the health and life benefits you receive. You also can develop long-standing relationships with your customers, and you're appreciated for that too! Overall fun workplace, and there's never a dull moment."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  They hire people from all walks of life and really care about their employees.  I loved working there.  The job isn't easy its a lot of hard work but the company makes it worth while.
good,"A typical day at work would start off by setting up the bar counter. Even during weekdays, the customers would walk-in early in the morning for a fresh taste of coffee. Greeting customers who eventually became good friends till date were part of the job. Many things I have learnt from the experience here such as adhering to customers need, time management, multi-tasking and also constantly alert about the surroundings. The management and the senior managers have become almost like family and still do keep in touch although it has been a while since i resigned the job. The culture in Starbucks has been amazing where in times of celebration or festivities all would gather to have fellowship. Going to work everyday was the most enjoyable part of the job and even during holidays, I would just head over to Starbucks to meet the customers and the partners."
good,"This is one of those jobs where even though some days can be extremely fast paced, the atmosphere is amazing and the employees are a joy to work with so things never become too stressful, negative or difficult. There's a strong sense of support among everyone and it elevates the overall experience. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with guests during our busiest hours but if everyone is working together and communicating properly, it isn't anything we can't handle. I've grown leaps and bounds as a multi-tasker and coffee maker, as well as learned better memorization, supervisory and teaching skills during my time with the company."
good,Its my first time working as a barista it teaches me so many skills and allows me the opportunity to learn something new daily. Its very fast paced and busy but always uplifting.
good,"It's definitely fast moving and demanding at times. However, you make great friends and meet a lot of new people. It gives you a fresh perspective on not only people, but on coffee as well."
good,"This is a great company to work for. Not only are there flexible hours, you get weekly tips based on how many hours you worked, you get benefits, PTO, and free drinks/food/and free bags of coffee every week. Starbucks truly cares about their employees I just wish they took management a little more seriously. My manager refused to deal with conflict and would never hold anyone accountable for their actions so it made it difficult to enjoy going to work knowing people could get away with not working or doing their job. Overall a really great company though."
good,"When people ask me if I like my job I tell them that I love being a barista. Most mornings for me begin extremely early but the people I work with and the customers I look forward to seeing everyday help me get up in the morning. Although it can get hectic and people can be difficult sometimes, I have enjoyed every moment of working at Starbucks. My management is incredible and I never feel like I am not listened to or involved with store operations. The workplace culture is one created, not given but those I share it with have been amazing enough to make our store a family rather than a workplace."
good,"My time at Starbucks involved a lot of dedication to serving the customer the best way possible, even if it wasn't always convenient for the employee. I had no issues with that, as all the work seemed to fly by day-to-day."
good,Fun and energetic place to work. Friendly staff and customers. Flexible hours. Learning a new and interesting way of making beverages. Room for advancement.
good,"Being a barista is a rewarding and enjoyable job. It also provides great benefits, I would just like a change of scenery in my work environment. Overall, I have loved and will continue to love my time with Starbucks."
good,Very understanding workplace with great benefits! They treat you great even if it is clear that you aren't planning on staying with the company long term.
good,My experience working at Starbucks was very good. I learned great customer service skills and worked with some very nice people. I work at the Canada's Wonderland location  which made it even more fun because it was a fun environment all around me.
good,"Fun company to work for, but no respect for seniority. Everyone gets paid the same no matter if you've been there for 10 years or for 10 weeks. Its something that isnt very liked within the company."
good,"I really enjoy working at the specific Starbucks store I work at. The partners there are amazing and make every day manageable. A typical day for me starts anywhere from 4:00 AM to 3:30 PM, depending on what day part I am working. It gets busy early in the morning with our peak times usually between 7AM to 9AM. As a supervisor, you really have to be organized and have good time management to ensure everything is set and ready for peak. I learned a lot about the business and what it really takes to make a store successful. The company has great values and they transcend down to the baristas. It is challenging, but it is rewarding."
good,"Typically, everyone shares a joint sense of responsibility and a common work ethic. Everyone has their own daily tasks to complete, but we all help each other in completing tasks since there is a sense of shared responsibility. The management is very understanding and helpful with any and all questions that the partners have regarding their own status with the company, and with their work duties. The hardest part is performing daily tasks when understaffed due to unpredictable rushes. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing everyone who I've grown to know; customers and partners alike."
good,"Great work environment, great health benefits. Physically demanding, on your feet, ect, pay is not the best but the health benefits make up for it. Flexible hours to school or other commitments."
good,"No job is perfect and neither is every single day at Starbucks. However, over all, it's a really great place to work. The ability to transfer stores when moving and the general flexibility in shifts and time off, make for a fantastic company to work for."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work at to develop many skills. You learn how to work in a fast paced, and at times high stress environment, you improve your social skills by chatting with friendly customers, and also dealing with unhappy customers. Its a fun work environment, filled with fun people."
good,"Good team, fast-paced, opportunity to progress, in our store we have a lot of regular customers and its nice to have this rapport with customers where they know about your holiday plans and so on."
good,"Starbucks use the brand name to make employees fool."
good,es una gran familia laboral y te capacitan para todo.
good,"I've enjoyed working at Starbucks. there's a strong sense of family and a pleasant work environment. The other partners were always open and willing to help me be better. The clients were generally pleasant, and there were many incentives to work for the company."
good,hard work at times but for the most part good you tend to have to stand all day and work with each other to get things done so if you don't like people I wouldn't recommend it
good,"Working for Starbucks will be one of my most favorite memories. I worked the opening shift, so I would come in, set up everything, and prepare for the morning rush. Since I worked at the one in Daytona, we always got a lot of tourist customers and travelers coming in for races, bike week, and the country 500. When it got extremely busy, I will admit it was a nightmare. But I had an amazing team who was basically my family, and we got through every event together, blood, sweat, and tears. I only wish that the pay was better, because then I would have stayed...but it just wasn't enough to live on unfortunately."
good,"A typical day as a barista at Starbucks includes making drinks, warming pastries, stocking shelves, sweeping floors, serving guests, and all with a smile on your face. With my coworkers and supervisor that really wasn't hard to do. Of course it gets tiring to stand all day, constantly moving and coordinating with your coworkers so that you don't run into each other or spill anything. But in my opinion it only made the shift go by faster. At the end of each shift it felt really good to know that I worked really hard with my team."
good,amazing people and fun environment. Make friends for life. Great benefits. 401k. Stock options. Free tuition. You can get free spotify premium. Management could be better at current location.
good,Great benefits which include vision and health insurance and also stock options after working for a year. You do learn about basic customer service skills and interaction with guests.
good,I wish there were more people working during the same shift. Can be little crazy during the weekend. I find this is a place were you have to work well with other people.
good,"Working at starbucks I prepared drinks for guest, made sure everything was sanitary and clean, and I also worked as a team with my co-workers to make sure guest had a good experience."
good,They are very flexible. Weekends are definitely expected out of you and is is very busy. The management is good and really works with you to help you grow in both personal and professional areas.
good,Learning everything was very fun and easy. The main problem I had was I was taking 16 credits in college doing a full time sport and waking up at the crack of dawn to go to Starbucks and work. The manger that was there was very harsh and did not have any reasoning skills at all.
good,"i have no experience about this ,,,,,,,,,,,, me i will be very punctual.......i'll do any task which u give me anytime it will be very thankfull to you"
good,"Starbucks was an amazing company to work for, I left not too long ago. I just needed a more permanent, career job with more hours. Something that I can really grow into a high management job one day."
good,"love love love starbucks. Would work here again. They help with education, help overseas bean farmers and offer the whole package as far as retail discounts, free drinks on shift, and benefits. They even educate you about coffee tasting before you start!"
good,The job was exciting and great! It was a great place to socialize and build connections. The store I was a part of helped me grow and invested time and money into me.
good,"Definitely a high-volume job, but can be a lot of fun with a dedicated team to work with. A fulfilling opportunity to develop relationships with both co-workers, and clients."
good,"Management depends on which store you are working at. I personally had a great manager, and when she was moved to a higher position out of state, my new manager was less than great. This job was great for me because while it did have structure to it, it was anything but repetitive or boring. You are always moving, creating new drinks, tasting different coffees and analyzing those coffees. It's a job that allows your creativity to shine through immensely. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the morning and lunch rushes, but that was also enjoyable. Once I felt sure of what I was doing, I would get into a zone and be able to complete all of the tasks I needed to do without being stressed or overwhelmed. I learned so much working at Starbucks, including how to taste coffee properly, how to identify the flavor notes, and how that can lead you to where the coffee originated from - almost like tasting wine. I learned how to pair coffees with pastries, so that the flavors in the pastry would enhance the flavor of the coffee. You also build a really strong connection with your guests - especially the regulars. Sometimes there's no better feeling than having your regular's drink ready for them before they even get to the register. It's a rewarding, challenging, and amazing place to work at."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work at.  You feel like you are a family here.  A customer service based company, who cares about their partners.  You get to learn a lot about coffee.  As well as you get to see all that starbucks offers."
good,Very busy from start to finish. i came up through the ranks fairly quickly here as the manager appreciated good workers. I felt very appreciated by SM and ASM here and was taught a lot.
good,"Loved this company and the workers, my location had poor management. Very fast paced but fun. Enjoyed meeting customers and learning drinks. Diverse environment very enjoyable job."
good,"As a full-time student at the University of Minnesota, Starbucks has a philosophy that accommodates to the students needs. They are respectful to my time as I am managing between school and work."
good,"A typical day of work kept me entrenched in gut-busting laughter between other members of the team and customers, divine coffee tastings, valuable conversations and criticisms, as well as a benevolent manager that quite frankly could do no wrong."
good,Amazing job especially if you are going to college full time. Most are flexible and able to work with your school schedule and they even provide health insurance too for part time employees!
good,Its an overall very fun job and it keeps you very busy. I recommend it to anybody that likes to stay busy and can learn at a fast pace and in a fast environment.
good,"Starbucks Coffee est une excellente entreprise, très formatrice"
good,"It was an enjoyable environment to work for. Most of the people I worked with were friendly. But at some of the locations that I worked at the management team was horrible. The Killeen Texas store management team was so horrible that I had to request to work at another store. They overworked me by scheduling my work hours as follows: closing and opening the next day. That time set up was unbearable because I had to close the store at 11 at night and open the store the next day at 5. Which mean that I would only have a few hours of sleep. "
good,"was a really good job for me. taught me how to be Independent and a hard working, also should be how to work with a team and also how to train new works."
good,"A typical day includes tending to customer requests and fulfilling them as they arise.  This includes, cash handling, making beverages and preparing food as needed while maintaining cleanliness standards for regular inspection and customer satisfaction.  Great opportunity for growth and development within Starbucks, however management could use more resources to utilize the full potential of their partners."
good,"its easy to get frustrated but patience is something you should have. "
good,Loved this job started off as a batista and worked my way up to manager fun work environment training is fun and exciting learned a lot about coffee and tea
good,Working for Starbucks has given me many opportunities to connect with a wide range of people. Fellow partners are also caring individuals who know how to work.
good,For students and family persons alike this company is one of the best places to start your career. It is incredibly easy to move up although sometimes hours aren't as available for those in need in the beginning it is definitely worth sticking with to get far.
good,This is company who welcome everyone and follows all the standard al the time. Time to time job with no extra work load. Loved the work culture. This is the company who live their mission statement. Employee forward company.
good,This was a great first job. I learned a lot about patience and how to work and interact with coworkers as well as customers. I also strengthened my leadership and teamwork skills.
good,"Starbucks helped to create a balance between work and school, allowing for a job that helped foster friendships, as well as the work ethic and customer service skills to aid in future endeavours."
good,"If you can handle fast-paced environment, then this is definitely the job for you! It is fun and there is never really down time (aside from lunches and breaks). Depending on location, breaks and lunches can be handled better, but other then that, it is a fun job to have!"
good,Worked as a barista at the first Starbucks store right out of the military. the people i worked with were fantastic and the company definitely helped my transition from military to civilian life.
good,"I really enjoy working here, it's fun and a challenge.  You become a family with your fellow partners. Connections. You connect with our guests and really build a friendship."
good,Great place to work thorough school. Very flexible on hours. You learn a lot about coffee and you make a few friends while doing it! Being a Barista also helps with our memory. After a while you recognize your regular customers and have their drinks ready and waiting.
good,"ideal and good for students - flexible"
good,"A typical workday for me is setting up the store as i usually open, and getting the floor prepared before our peek hours start! Everyone works very well together and we know whose strengths will put them in the best position to not only let them succeed but the store flow smoothly to allow an easy day and great customer service!"
good,"Working in high paste job is challenging. From setting the store up for opening, running registers, making drinks and closing down the shop can be tiring and fulfilling at the same time. Coffee beans flavor lingering on your clothes and loosing oneself ability to sample coffee can be tricky. The people who surround you are motivated toward the sales as well as the employees."
good,"Flexible hours, great benefits and discounts, awesome partners. Learned how to work in a fast paced environment, great customer service skills, and some store management as a shift supervisor (training, orders, inventory, deployment etc.)"
good,"I love the atmosphere always busy worked with nice amaxing people and the customers were usually always so kind."
good,Very fast paced and upbeat place to work. I loved my customers that eventually became friends. Management cares about employees and i always felt supported.
good,I was welcomed with great co workers. it was easy to learn with the patient and calm environment. My boss was great and very understanding. Every day i was learning something new.
good,"A typical day at work would be super fun because you met so many new people everyday and made relationships with the ""regulars."""
good,"First and foremost, this job requires a high amount of energy at most or all times of the day. Everyone has to act as a team player and regardless of position, must take into account all others as well. One of the hardest parts about the job is a type of time micro-management during peak business hours. Just one or two mistakes or lack of optimization can have a lasting impact for hours during any day and this goes for all levels of management within a store."
good,At Starbucks I had one of the best teams I had ever worked with. Every day we worked together with unparalleled efficiency. Rush was always a roller-coaster but it was a fantastic experience to work with such a great company.
good,Constant training. Always encouraging and helping you with your personal improvement in any work environment. Great team building work place.
good,Serve customers food and beverages made to order. Create a welcoming and friendly environment. Provide exceptional customer service while making quality beverages.
good,the hours are good for having two jobs. always early shifts or middle shifts or night shifts. they work with you a lot. if your going to school or have a second job.
good,Μία ευρέως αναγνωρισμένη εταιρεία που με το κύρος της κ την επιμονή της στην τελειότητα καταφέρνει ακόμα να κρατάει ψηλά τον πύχη στην παραγωγή καφέ κ στην εξυπηρέτηση πελάτη όπως τελικά μπορούν μόνο λίγοι.
good,fun place especially when u get the chance to create new and different drinks for guest. making guest happy about their coffee and frapps is the best way to go
good,Lots of new products to learn all the time. Lots of busy work. Which means manager is doing a good job of getting everyone to be productive.
good,"-management does wonders with staff training and encouragement"
good,"i loved my job at starbucks, but as a single parent and a manager it was impossible to juggle life and ensure neither the kids or the store suffered. My team was awesome and had a very encouraging District Manager"
good,I love this company. Great place for a young person to get their first job. My location was poorly managed and didn't provide the positive atmosphere I am used to when visiting a Starbucks.
good,"I look forward going to work everyday.  All of my co-workers work hard and play hard, I enjoy working with every single co-worker at my store.  Through my time at Starbucks I have worked for 2 different managers and met at least 5 others, all of whom are very engaging and makes you feel at ease. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers.  I have made a lot of friends during my time at Starbucks and I continue to do it on a daily basis."
good,"Make friends with co-workers and and customers alike while you learn many skills that will carry you far in life. No two days are the same, yet many of them are shockingly similar."
good,"not much to really talk about i just enjoyed working here everyone was very cool and nice, very easy going and relax, when its not right when they open or during lunch time."
good,"I love working at Starbucks. It's always a very positive work place. My co-workers are wonderful. I love going to work everyday because I know it's going to be a crazy, busy day but that I have my team behind me to make sure it's done well and to make sure that we are all working together."
good,An excellent culture and really good environment to learn in. A strong focus on a can do attitude and the customer experience. Less opportunity to progress than before as a lot of the stores have been franchised.
good,Starbucks has allowed me to grow and develop my customer service and leadership skills immensely over the past four years. I have had the opportunity to work with great people that have all taught me valuable lessons and I have enjoyed all of the experiences that Starbucks has given me. I am excited to see what I am able to do with the development and skills Starbucks has given me.
good,"Overall, this is quite an amazing company. I loved the benefits, the customers, and mostly my co-workers. A typical day at Starbucks, you would go in, wave hello to everyone, clock in go to assigned area and start your day and trying to make the customers feel welcomed and make sure they leave with exactly what they were looking for."
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. The management was not very good which is why I chose to leave. I do believe at a different location I would be willing to stay long term
good,"Working in starbucks is very hard sometimes...is not only to make a coffe...you have to know every single product and its own story.I had been very lucky honestly because i am working close the Liverpool street station and all customer are toustist or employer. The team is amazing is like working in a big family and every time i had a problem the manager and supervisor helped me not only at work but also in my private life."
good,"My experience with Starbucks so far has been wonderful! The staff I work with are super friendly, open minded, understanding. My manager is very flexible and accommodating. We have created such a family oriented type of workplace. It is like a home away from home you know? The benefits are great, and the stuff you learn is amazing! For example, you  learn how to taste the difference in coffees, the history behind every coffee bean as well as where they come from. You learn how to make delicious drinks, and learn great communication skills as well as people skills. Starbucks really helped me come out of my shell. "
good,"Starbucks is an fast-paced, energetic work place full of vibrant characters. The work can be fun and extremely rewarding as you build relationships with fellow baristas and customers. The benefits are worth the work put in including free meals and beverages, healthcare, and discounts to a variety of stores both online and traditional.  Management is dedicated but fair and fun for the most part as all shift managers, store managers, and district managers were once baristas themselves. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, which is saying a lot about both the workload and the type of people you encounter on a day to day basis. Overall, an extremely enjoyable job."
good,"Very nice place to work , great atmosphere, friendly atmosphere , great for anyone who loves coffee.. I really enjoyed working for them great benefits , I mean great great I have not been anywhere that could top there benefits. I don't know if it has changed now or not . But I know back then they were great ...I would recommend this job which I have to anyone."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a very good company to work for. The hours are flexible, and work/life balance is important to management. It's one of the few companies that I have heard of that provides benefits for its part time employees (after working at the company for a certain amount of time). It is a very fast-paced and, at times, stressful job, but there are definitely peaks during the day. So the stress is short lived. Most customers are pleasant, many of them come to Starbucks everyday so they know what to expect."
good,"Lots of great perks, benefits at 20 hr/wk average, 401K matching, etc. Busy and always things to do. Great community feel with the right team."
good,"-Ensure team was delivering legendary customer service"
good,"Working at Starbucks is honestly one of the best decisions you can make, not only do you receive free drinks and food while on the clock, you also become a gold member automatically, the customers you get are typically very understanding with new employees and very patient, the staff is always positive and motivating, barring is one of the best parts of the job because its a very fun challenge when peak hours arrive, you get to make unique drinks and try some of your own, managers are very generous and are there to support you and give good hours as long as you're responsible with your job, definitely would like to work there again."
good,"this was a great location to work. I learned a lot about coffee and love coffee a lot. This position build charchter that I have taking a lot with me,"
good,My experience has varied based on the different locations but Starbucks is a terrific place to work at.  The friendships I've built with my coworkers will last a lifetime and I continue to develop new skills.
good,"As long as the store is set up for success, this can be a great place to work and a place to challenge your team and your self to be the best. It takes some great effort, and time to set up the store for success so you need to be willing to be available during all operating hours (as a store manager) because if something goes wrong and the store needs you, you need to be available."
good,"work days varied, all co-workers worked together  and had good customer service., "
good,"Starbucks promotes a challenging culture.  It can be very enjoyable if you like a dynamic work environment.  They offer a living wage for partners and many opportunities for advancement.  In short, Starbucks is a great job for people seeking work in the distribution field."
good,I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.
good,"You have to be a people person to enjoy working here, because you  will get a lot of customers who just want their coffee and they want it PERFECT, and those customers are so picky and try to take out their madness on you. My workers and my previous manager made it fun working there. I loved my previous manager, but he moved on to a better paying job that was in his home town. The new manager that came in worked in 7 different stores over the past 6 years and she was a two-faced not so great manager. She had her good moments, but mainly those bad moments that made it bad for me to work there. I was still enjoying the face-paced  environment and my co-workers, but she made a decision that affected me personally and I had to leave."
good,"one a week we can get a day off....and we can learn how to work as a team and ...we giving world best customer service ..so we learning how to handle he customer in good way....and all partners are helping each other,sharing our knowledge,chatting with customer."
good,I love the atmosphere and my coworkers. Everyone enjoys their time working there and people are always so positive. Our regular customers all know us by name and are always cheerful when they walk in our doors.
good,Starbucks gives you so much training and makes you feel very comfortable before they put you out on your own. I have learned how to multi task and work as a team.
good,"Great company to work for, full commitment needed to progress - extremely long hours required but worth it in terms of career progression. Varied days, great support from management when needed."
good,This is a wonderful company to work for. They take very good care of their employees. Employees have lots of perks working for them. Health care is  great and affordable. I think the best part about working there is the perks and how much the company care for there employees. That is what makes you really want to work for them.
good,"very fast-paced environment, flexible scheduling, great benefits, amazing co-works, opportunities for advancement"
good,"The job was super enjoyable as a barista and a shift supervisor.  The day goes by fast, the people are always a joy to work with.  I learned so much about myself and grew alot as a person and as a professional.  In the management area though the ability to have a work life balance was strained and I found my district managers difficult to work with."
good,I really love the company we have several benefits and we get drinks for free and we get thirty percent off anything we buy when we're not working. I would love to have something different and interact with other people and have different opportunities.
good,This job is a great milestone and helped me to become more driven and focused on the needs of the store and community. Also helping to learn how to better resolve conflict and to continually help customers to feel welcomed and appreciated.
good,Starbucks began as a job for spare time and evolved into more than a job. It became a passion. Became a top Barista in a year and learned tailor each customer's experience.
good,I learned how to work quickly under time constraints with efficiency and diligence. It was rewarding to have a positive influence on customer's mornings by greeting and serving them prior to the start of their work day.
good,Since Starbucks hires genuine people it was an amazing place to work . The perks of the job can't be beat and they have some really great managers that see your strengths and know where to put you.  A positive attitude wins every day over cranky uncaffinated patrons.
good,"Great benefits, fun work environment. Make coffee and offer pastries making great tips and a decent hourly compensation."
good,"Foi a experiência mais marcante em todas as  passagens pelo  mercado de trabalho, aprendi muito com meus supervisores e gerentes, tive contato com novas experiência e desenvolvi em mim habilidades das quais não conhecia."
good,"good pay and atmosphere. You can start early, but it is worth it because of the connections you make with the customers. You also get great benefits and you don't even have to work full time, so that's always a plus! This is a very good job for students."
good,"A typical day at work, will be when a rude customer comes in & i turn their whole attitude around by being polite & asking them how is their day going."
good,"I loved working at this place, i was responsible for opening and working at the location on the voice. It was a stable job with great benefits."
good,"At my job, I perform well with my coworkers as we succeed in excellent customer service using our profound communication skills and excellent training knowledge in order to get the job done correctly."
good,"Best job ever. Very fast paced, challenging. Easy to promote to next skill level. Good number of breaks between shifts. Good pay at Alaska location"
good,"For being a part time or full time, non degree requiring job you get massive benefits, medical, dental, vision, family optioned insurance, and a secure job that means you can move and still be employed in new location."
good,Coffee and connections helps to create a new relationship with our new customers . By this way we can easily rectify our customers needs and complaints :)
good,"Proactively dealt with customers and team members on a daily basis.was responsible for opening and closing the store including all related tasks of making sure that all tills have got correct amounts required,auditing tills,making sure that staff id correctly trained in delivering the best customer service"
good,"On a day to day basis, working as a barista at Starbucks is very busy! But all the customers are friendly, my co-workers are great. I love this job."
good,"My all time favorite job! Everyone is friendly, management is never over bearing, but still work gets done efficiently. Plus health care at part time, free lunches, free drinks all day, free pound of coffee each week, free Spotify, and free College! Who could beat that?"
good,"Starbucks strives to create a fun and functional work environment. The most difficult part of the job is getting used to the fast paced working environment if it's something you have little experience with. Management will vary and therefore coverage and scheduling will vary. When you are adequately staffed, even the 3 hour rushes become enjoyable. You always stay moving and active and as long as you have hard-working coworkers beside you, working as a barista is a fun and enjoyable."
good,"It is a very fun job and full of learning! Starbucks has various location, mine was at disney springs. I started working there when I was 17, and enjoyed it a lot."
good,Did enjoyed working there for almost three years. It was a nice place to work and the people coming in were very nice and welcoming. It would be busy time to time and always talking and engaging with customers.
good,"I love working for Starbucks, I have been now for well over a year. I love my manager & my coworkers. It's an exciting company with constant changes. New dress code!"
good,"I loved all the people I worked with but the scheduling for hours wasn't good. I never had a set schedule, so my hours were all over the place. My boss was awesome, though. He was a great guy and very easy going and fun to work with."
good,Starbucks is a once in a lifetime opportunity that i would recommend to anyone looking to start out and grow in the Barista industry. This Job will teach you to be outgoing and to be genuine all around.
good,I have a lot of fun working at Starbucks. Here I've met some great friends as well as have met very interesting customers. The work isnt hard and you can have a lot of fun there.
good,"All in all I enjoyed my experience as a Baurista. The customers were sometimes difficult, but what job in customer service isn't. In my opinion the company has amazing benefits. Pay could be a tad better but it's getting better. Overall A from me"
good,Working with the partners at Starbuck's gave me the best feeling in the world. My partners and I had a very good work relationship with each other. The customers made the job even better just servicing them and the compliments they made on my barista skills made me feel like my work was appreciated. The most challenging think about Starbucks would be the rushes we would get. I enjoyed this challenge because the partners and I would finish our work at an appropriate  time.
good,Fast paced work environment with great partners. Management is wonderful and customers are great. hardest part of job is multi-tasking at a fast pace over the course of a long shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy with various drinks.
good,Working at Starbucks can be wonderful and fun once you are comfortable with the job and how everything works. Getting to know customers and building relationships with all different kinds of people is one of the best aspects of the job. I learned how to properly communicate with new people and how to make many different kinds of espresso drinks.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work.  The pay was lower than some other places I've worked, but they worked around my home life.  I can honestly say I never had to miss a baseball game because of work.  The atmosphere of a coffee shop, in general, is great.  I made so many friends.  I loved my co-workers."
good,"Great way to start off a career in coffee and business.  Unfortunately the entire culture of your products is far from genuine.  I read ""Pour Your Heart into it""  and laughed when the description for a latte, cappuccino, and a machiatto are described incorrectly and against what the stores even train you to do... which is also completely wrong."
good,"Its great working for Starbucks, there are loads of company benefits & staff rewards. The company really look after their staff."
good,"Starbucks has an excellently structured work environment, friendly employees and a well established brand. I have made many lasting friendships in this company, the works hours are very flexible especially for college students"
good,what's nice about this company is they also value the employees which helps motivates people to do better at work. The most enjoyable part would be the benefits and we work like as if we consider it as a home. We wanted customers to feel like their third place.
good,"Ouloulou Super entreprise!"
good,"Ik moest deels in de zaal werken en deels in de keuken. Ik had een chrono waarmee ik werkte, zodat ik om de vijf minuten van de zaal naar keuken overschakelde en andersom. In de zaal moest ik de tafels afruimen en kuisen, de vloer keren en dweilen als er gemorst was, de suiker en de servetten bijvullen, de vuilbakken verversen. In de keuken moest ik de afwas doen en de borden en kopjes daarna opruimen. Ik moest ook de koelkast en de glazen toog vooraan bijvullen. En als de grote vuilbakken achteraan vol zaten, moest ik ze naar de containers brengen. Zo zag mijn dag er uit. Mijn collega's waren allemaal erg vriendelijk en dat maakte het leuker om daar te werken."
good,"A typical day consisted of handling cash throughout the day and providing excellent customer service. I learned how to a lot about my customers and how to make them feel like more than just a customer and also i learned how to get along with my team members and management. Management was great. We communicated daily so that we understood what goals we had to meet. Hardest part of the job would be trying to learn all the drinks when you are new but once you have been properly trained then the rest would come easy. Most enjoyable part of the job was delivery great product to customers with a positive attitude, knowing that I did a great job and that they come back."
good,"Your workload of the day depends on the times you are scheduled for; peak is in the morning, is constant through the afternoon, and is slower in the evenings. I have greatly enhanced my customer service skills and cash management. My co-workers are now a second family because our work ethic and standards are high and we strive to be the best every single day. The hardest part of the job has to be being able to move as fast as physically possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with customers and making their day a little better through coffee."
good,"Typical day consist of going to work, enjoying it, being around great people, great customers, the smell of amazing scents, and obviously the weekly lb of coffee. "
good,"Starbucks is honestly one of the best part-time jobs one could have. Starbucks really cherishes their employees for one thing all employees are referred to as partners. Partners are eligible for benefits after averaging 20 hours weekly, weekly mark-outs, free drinks during breaks, and the point system is adjusted for partners. If you're interested in growing with the company there are plenty of opportunities to do so. The job culture is quite relaxed however it can become stressful keeping up with all the modifications one has for their drinks. Starbucks trumps all other part time service jobs I have had in the past."
good,"Working for Starbucks is such a great experience. As a barista you do have a long list of responsibilities that need to be learnt and maintained. Starbucks hire people with the same personality so it is easy to make friends with co-workers and even customers. At times customers can become extremely disrespectful to you and as a barista it is your responsibility to ""make it right"", which is probably the worst part about working at Starbucks. Despite what may happen, top managers and managers will always protect their employees."
good,"Some days are crazy, some are very pleasant. Your manager makes or breaks the whole store and the whole job. Starbucks takes great care of their partners. It makes an excellent college job or high school job for anyone."
good,"I loved waking up early, getting my free partner coffee, and than engaging in new conversations with old customers and co workers. I always got along with my manager. Between her, my coworkers, and the customers, I learned something new everyday. Whether it was how to clean the espresso machine better, or to do quick math in my head, or how to deal with those difficult customers. "
good,"Working at Starbucks has been great in exposing me to diverse challenges and immense changes. Its culture is one that ensures a comfortable, clean working environment and an overall pleasant place for people to be. Wonderful management, incredible partners and an immense supply of tasetful recipes and heart-felt intentions."
good,Back then I liked it to hear about it now is horrible stay away management is horrible now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Co- workers were the bomb back then. Learned a lot about customer service and coffee
good,"Fast paced work environment, friendly coworkers and customers. Expanding and broadening my coffee knowledge everyday."
good,"I promoted coffee consumption by educating customers; selling a variety of caffeinated drinks; along with pastries and cookies. It is an enjoyable work place to make customers happy with a caffeinated drink. I enjoy working with the staff team there, because everyone knows their key roles to make everything run smoothly. I enjoy talking to customers to see what we could do better or what to keep on doing to make things the visit enjoyable."
good,i love the job! i love my coworkers! it has taught me to have alot of patience. ive learned alot about coffee thats for sure.
good,Starbucks is honestly the best company that I have ever and probably will ever work for.  The only thing that will push me away is the need of more income.  I do not blame Starbucks for paying me what they do.  It just isn't a career for me.
good,Really busy at times but fun place to work. Learnt how to make different types of coffees and great connections with customers. Overall I highly recommend working for Starbucks!
good,"Pleasant work with excellent people."
good,Make coffees all day and interact with customers. Its a simple job but not always easy dealing with high maintenance customers.
good,This was by far my favorite job. Each day was challenging in a different way which made it all that much more interesting.
good,Learned all roles of barista play within a month. It can be exhausting on certain days. The everyday usual customers are really nice. Some days are a little hectic due to the equipment breaking down unexpectedly.
good,"This was one of my favorite positions!  It was great to work in an atmosphere where my fellow employees were considered to be my ""partners"".  Great working atmosphere, upbeat and positive attitudes were always welcomed.  I had the best customer service training experience."
good,"My typical day was to come in and go wherever my manager (or shift lead) assigned to me that day). My typical shift was 4 hours, because I was part-time, but I did work multiple 6 and 8 hour shifts. The hardest part of the job, not going to lie, was baring (or making the drinks), and the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a customer smile because of a drink I recommended to them and actually liking what I preferred. It was a really fun job!"
good,"It can be a very busy day filled with multi-tasking, cleaning, organizing, and working as a team. The job requires the ability to stay calm under pressure and able to work smoothly and quick under stress. The best part is learning about coffee and the skills it requires to make all the drinks and making customer's smile. Making a difference, even a small difference in someone's life can be rewarding. Management has always been fair and the benefits are exceptional."
good,"es un lugar muy organizado donde es muy bueno trabajar, todo es muy ordenado , siempre cumplen con los pagos y tienen muchos beneficios estudiantiles."
good,"Very busy at 4:30 am, when people went they coffee before work, filled pastry shelves, make drip pots of coffee, and other items for sale. How it's important to have the coffee ready for customers. Managers where great and would work with my schedule because I worked another job. Co-worker where great a lot of high school and college kids, had no problems. Really no hard part of the job. Starbucks is really in the Earth enviorment of the World."
good,Awesome place to work. Great benefits. Co-workers are mostly good. Hardest part is working under the pressure of getting everything done so quickly.
good,"Great experience, loved the community and customers, learned alot not so good management overall great young staff. In charge of opening store on time, daily inventories and daily deposits"
good,"I enjoy my tasks on a daily basis, primarily because I get to interact with the public while also, solving problems. I am very team-oriented, and always gravitate towards leadership roles. I enjoy taking on a task that poses a challenge because I enjoy solving problems by being proactive, a critical thinker and maintaining a consistent sense of urgency."
good,"At the beginning of every shift at the University of Minnesota Starbucks, I look forward to the whimsical, fast-paced and dynamic work environment waiting for me behind the espresso machines. Between the friendly, weird barista banter and the intriguing interactions with our diverse customer base, it is guaranteed that there will never be a dull moment. It is here, at Starbucks, that I grew into the hard-working, open-minded, strong leader that I am today."
good,"I supervise a staff of thirty plus employees, in a high volume starbucks on the college campus. I schedule and deploy staff where needed. I have other managers that also work along side of me. I place food and beverage orders, daily and control the cash flow. I enjoy giving great customer service with a smile on my face."
good,I was a barista and it was my first job. I loved the people I met and work went by quickly because it was always busy. The compensation was not great but the family that comes from the job is well worth it.
good,"I loved this job! And no it wasn't just because of the free Starbucks Coffee, but because of my daily customers!! A typical day working with Seattle's Best Coffee company would consist of coming in, in the early morning and starting my day out taking customer orders at the cash register, greeting each of my customers that walked through the doors with a warm and welcoming smile, and lastly making those famous Starbucks Coffees, Frappucinos, and of course Teas that we all know and love! What I learned here was about the basics of coffee, expresso, and tea. I learned not only how to make some of the drinks that I had always wondered about since a young child such as a Latte, or a Cappucino, and an Americano but about the history and the start of this coffee company. My management team consisted of three wonderful managers all of whom were astounded with my wonderful expertise and great customer service skills. The hardest part of my job would have to be the very first part: learning all of the cup sizes and how many expresso shots go into each drink. Although it was hard at first by my third week here I was already considered a barista, and by my fourth week I had regular customers asking for me to make their beverages. Like I stated earlier, the most enjoyable part of the job was my customers themselves. Seeing them come in every morning, afternoon, and evening excited to see me and get their favorite drinks brought a smile to my face. Each of them brought their own sort of flare to my day, and would be excited to tell me about their week and would be happy to announce that they'd"
good,"I generally miss being employed by starbucks. From the benefits to the work life balance, to being part of a great team, associating with customers and making their days better. Every moment living and breathing the nectar of life in every beverage. My favorite job ever."
good,"We helped customer start their day right, one cup at a time. I also educate customer on what would be a new drink that they may like so they can change the game once in and awhile too."
good,"- I have learned how to make special coffee drinks"
good,"There is never a boring day in the life of a Barista. Not only are you learning new and exciting things all of the time, Starbucks customers are one of a kind. A typical day on the job, anything could happen. From the espresso machine breaking down, to a customer having a really bad day and taking it out on you. Trust me, that could get really ugly.. But as a barista, you know how to handle those one in a million Starbucks customers."
good,"Exited to work every day because every day is a new challenge of work, And I do all my best to the customer  together  with my co-workers to give all the best for the customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a good experience for anyone looking for a  customer-oriented job.  You really get to know your regulars.  I learned time-management and communication skills as a Shift Supervisor.  The challenge of this job is the early work day.  Many stores open at 5:30AM, which requires being awake at 4AM."
good,"Coming into work, I jump right in helping prep and make drinks, especially if there's a surge of customers. There is no routine day, it depends on the the amount of activity mostly. Otherwise, we're prepping to be ready when customers do come in. I've learned a lot about coffee and drinks."
good,"Typically my work included working with extensively with my project team at Infosys and my client. I have a decent knowledge about Oracle EBS Finance module wherein I have worked on the implementation in AR/AP/GL/PA/FA module and currently a test lead, leading testing team for GL and PA. My work included team management and co-ordination with onsite and offshore team and also stepping in whenever required a technical and functional situation arises."
good,"I always enjoy coming into work and look forward to my shifts. The partners I've worked with are always fun and kind. We have fun doing our job, its a really great work environment! Since working at Starbucks, I have really learned communication skills and patience. I  was never aware at how well baristas connect with customers until i saw that customer relationship grow with each of the partners and myself. I've worked in two stores and have always had great connections with my co-workers. In a genuinely fun work environment, its hard to be in a bad mood. "
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, Mainly because i loved working in Coffee and being in a fast-paced environment. It helped me achieve skills in time-management and customer service. On a typical work day I would set up my work station, make drinks for customers or ring on the cash register, sometimes both. After we slowed down I would stock and clean. The hardest part was dealing with the morning rush if you were understaffed or if it got out of control, but having some really great co-workers made it easier to accomplish."
good,"-Everyone was so welcoming to my start date"
good,I have worked at Starbucks for about 6 months. Starting off I worked afternoons and nights. Now I work only mornings. The team is great. The mornings are always hectic during the week. We all come in and get assigned a position. Anything from drive through to barista to the front cashier. You are always kept busy. It does get crazy but I am fortunate enough to have coworkers that are great at what they do so most days are as smooth as possible. the hardest part of the job is probably the hours I work but thats all my choice. Hours are really flexible. I work openings which is at 430 am and am done with my shift no later than 1pm. The other hard part would also be some rude customers but that comes with any job dealing with people. The most enjoyable part is probably my co workers and most of the regulars we get at our store. Overall its pretty good job if you like fast paced jobs and are a quick learner.
good,"As a shift supervisor, I was accountable for managing a team of 11 employees during a designated shift, while processing an average of 400-600 customer orders per day. Empowered to serve as liaison between customers, store personnel and multiple store departments. Exercised sound judgment in issuing credit and ensuring customer satisfaction. Accountable to conduct new employee training on company polices and service level standards.  Responsible for recommending and assisting customers with selecting merchandise  based on their needs.Informed customers of sales and promotions in a friendly and engaging manner. Responsible for investigating sources of special products and services to meet customers' specific needs. Starbucks taught me the importance of maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and how to utilize proper management skills to maximize your productivity output. The management team prepared the baristas and shift supervisors for customer needs, and possible outcomes throughout the day. Maintained a high moral by anticipating partners needs, giving proper brake times and vacation days as needed. To be honest the most difficult portion of this job was maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, because even if an order is taken perfectly and made to perfection. Customers can still hold their expectations extremely high. At the same time, that is the best part of the job, in my humble opinion. To see the face, on a satisfied customer brings joy to the barista. Building relationships is key to success in any buisness, but building family, was the key to"

I have learned how to also manage others and delegate responsibilities. Other great part of this job is my co-workers who have basically become family, everyone at Starbucks is very close, we all like to be there for each other in our crazy hectic store. The hardest part of my job would probably be the pressure that we have on ourselves to make sure our products are done and out to our customers in a timely matter at the same time the quality of our products are good; however that pressure is also one of the most enjoyable parts as well. Not only does that pressure push myself to work harder it also makes me a better barista."

good,I absolutely love being a barista! Coffee is delicious and I really enjoyed building strong relationships with coworkers and customers. Starbucks is a terrific company to work for on top of that. They give baristas a lot of room to grow in their knowledge of coffee and the processes that are included in the production of coffee beans.
good,"Starbucks was a very fast paced and efficient work environment. It was critical that every team member on the floor knew their respective tasks and executed them quickly and efficiently. I learned valuable communication skills and saw a great deal of work accomplished thanks to a team who was clear on their objectives. We would regularly rotate tasks throughout the day to avoid being ""burnt-out."" This also exposed me to each aspect of the store and how it ran so effectively."
good,"If you love being passionate about what you do, then Starbucks is the company to work for. It offers tons of things to learn and work with on a daily basis."

good,The training was hands on and easy to learn. Employees very welcoming and helpful. It was well managed and they trusted their employees.
good,I feel that working as part-timer with Starbucks when I was a student seriously helped me to realize about time management and also multitasking. Interpersonal skill and communication skill are 2 important skills that must be possessed by each of the workers in order to maintain the business. The working atmosphere also fun where I was having a great colleagues. There were also the most busy time like you will never stop making beverages in a limited time        which I think very challenging. This sort of condition taught me how to increase my speed and delivering the products to the customers with high quality and quantity as well as satisfactory service.

good,"The root of Starbucks like any big business will be cash, but intertwined within this desire for money Starbucks offers a an interest in the human spirit not seen by many companies."
good,"-Fast paced"
good,"You work hard at Starbucks and are rewarded in way not many companies can manage.  Connection.  Connection to both company, coworker and customer.  As with any company, hiccups arise.  Managers and leaders are people and job satisfaction can hinge on that relationship.  Thankfully Starbucks rarely puts the wrong person in position and the companies vision lives through each and every interaction.  And that vision, is by far the greatest strength of Starbucks.  Despite it's size, it aims to do the right thing in all of it's business decisions.  Focusing on the people as much as the bottom line.  Occasionally that focus on people makes for some unclear direction.  Where the balance of customer , employee and business is difficult to maintain.  That's when Starbucks struggles.  Policies are not clear and decisions can be based on the moment, and it usually seems like no matter what decision is made, somebody would have done it differently."

I've learned the importance of team work and being a team player I give 100% of my efforts on taking care of the customers concerns and helping my team mates. The Management was pretty decent on some ares they could of done better but over all they were good. My co workers were the best i enjoy my time working and growing to better Baristas with them. The hardest part of my job was adjusting to the various and frequent changing but the i handle changing very well.

good,"Starbucks has definitely become one of the best companies in my opinion to work for. Great benefits, along with an attention to not only customer satisfaction, but to the overall benefits of all the employees that work for the company. It is a fast-paced and exciting environment that hones skills in multi-tasking and working efficiently. One of the biggest benefits I have gleaned from being a supervisor here, is that the upper management doesn't interfere with play calls and decisions for the store I make on a daily basis. This encourages independence and confidence to be a great leader."
good,"takes about 3 months to learn all of the information (drink recipes, point of sales, partner roles, day to day duties)"
good,Good benefits and a great safety culture. Co-workers and management makes you feel like you're part of the family. Good job security.
good,"I loved serving the customers, many of whom were there every day. they become your friends and even ask about you after you are gone.  I learned about customer service the most from Starbucks.

good,As a barista you have to satisfy the customers need in a proficient timing. Being professional and polite to the customers as well as making them feels like they are part of the Starbucks family. To make the customers feel at home and to be more comfortable we did taste testes. Such as letting them taste a food product with a complimentary coffee or tea to which they would pick. I usually ran the registers or working as a barista.

good,"I started working at Starbucks part time while at school but soon I realized that the company is willing to give you a lot of opportunities of growth. If you like working with people and love coffee the job is great! I used work a lot a closing shifts. Closing the store as a shift supervisor I learnt a lot about different kind of documents, receiving shipments and inventory managing. Delegating tasks and being able to plan steps ahead is very important. Starbucks is all about team work so training and coaching is very important because everyone is working for one result after all. I made a lot of friends at work. The hardest part is to draw a line between your life and job because the job may take over at some point. What I enjoyed the most is people - our guests and my coworkers."

I learned a lot about time management and how to lead under pressure. I was happy to have a bunch of really great co-workers and a manager that I felt was supportive. The team was always encouraging me to be a better manager. The hardest thing was meeting the expectations of the baristas, my fellow shifts, my management, and the customers at the same time. But I really enjoyed working with my team and talking to my customers every day."

good,My typical work day starts with opening. Getting coffee ready and prep for the day. The biggest thing is customer interaction. Making sure the customer is happy.
good,"Working at Starbucks was an invaluable expirience and it's unfotunate that I couldn't have worked there longer. My typical day started at 4:30 am and lasted four hours for the most part. It included taking orers and providing friendly and personal sevice to each customer. My store was managed very well but there were a few policies that I thoroughy disagreed with; for instnace there was a priority sequence that was adhered to devoutly. For instance if there was a spill and I was not at the cleaning step in the sequence it must go ignored. My coworkers were lovely people but like companies when over familiarity comes into play and many of my coworkers began to slack. I think the hardest and simultaneously, the most enjoyable part of the job was memorizing drink receipes and executing them deftly."
good,"I always had the best time and wanted to come to work, you get to know your regulars real quick, you get extras at the holiday season and who can say no to all the free coffee"
good,"I was employed with Starbucks for a few years during university and I loved it. Definitely one of mt favorite jobs.

The Management in my current job have been supportive and they allow me to grow and develop.My co-workers have been an inspiration for me to do better each day and continuously develop them.The hardest part of the job is when I loose my life's balance, between work and family. It is when most of my times are spent at work. The most enjoyable part is when you see your subordinates learning ad growing each day with you and making customers feel satisfied with your service."
good,"A typical day consists of several regulars about the same time of day, expecting the same high quality beverages they've come to love in a fast, friendly way.

good,"Typically as a shift supervisor I would manage the store during my shift, to include managing 6-8 employees, cash handling, banking, inventory control and ordering, as well as working as a barista. this includes interacting with customers, making drinks, serving food, and working a cash register. The store manager was the BEST supervisor I have ever had.

good,"This was a busy DRIVE THRU (which is quite the cash cow for this company) in a densely populated area. I don't believe a drive-thru model is a good idea for a business like Starbucks or Subway, for example. Customers can experience delays while waiting for specially prepared (all drinks) items, but we made it work as efficiently as possible."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for but it is not for those who aren't willing to put forth a significant amount of effort. Partners are expected to constantly improve themselves through beverage handcrafting speed, customer service skills, company knowledge, etc. whether they have been with the company for ten days or ten years. "
good,"i learned how to make plenty of drinks,  my coworkers were amazing i loved them all, the managers seemed very quota hungry and unorganized and a bit heartless, the hardest part about the job had to be making multiple drinks at the same time cause its a fast paced environment but it was enjoyable because the way you get to interact with the customers in general"
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Starbucks. They were flexible with my schedule as I had a new born when I started working there. You meet so many great regular clients. The staff was friendly and young. It was a very low stress job, when you clock out you are truly off work, you don't take anything home with you except a smile! Another great perk was being able to try new mixtures and create our own special drinks! I still go to Starbucks regularly!"
good,this company really has a passion for promoting growth and wellness of their employees. employees truly embrace company values.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"When I first started I was scared of my own shadow because I had never worked in such a fast past high demanding environment but because of the people that work there and all the wonderful employees I have gained a lot of confidence in my job and myself. I am grateful to a lot of people there and I have made many friendships through this company that I am grateful for. A typical day at Starbucks can start from 4:00 am - 10:30  Pm, and they are amazing when you need a flexible schedule. The hardest part of the job was honestly trying to keep up with everything because this job is all about quality beverages and pastries while at the same time getting them out as fast as possible. The only problem I've had with this job is that your not guaranteed a set amount of hours. I plan to keep this job as long as I can."
good,"working here was great, i loved getting to meet new faces everyday! my partners were awesome and still are and there is a lot more to coffee than just hot water and grounds.the hard parts of the job were when people would complain or we would have long wait times and people get mad because we weren't fast enough.the best parts of the job were getting to always make people smile or make sure they got what they wanted and that it was correct before they left. my manager was awesome, he always made sure we were on task but he also liked to have a good time and joke around with us so it wasn't always uptight."
good,the job was fun but the openings for advancement were very slow. I needed a job with more potential
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun and exciting, but also challenging and tiring."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Starbucks Coffee Company for going on six years now. I am grateful for all of the opportunities I have had. A typical day at work is a busy and organized day. Employees must know their positions from the manager or shift supervisor on duty and by staying in the assigned position the shift runs smoothly and everyone, employee and customer benefits. This way every transaction and drink being made is to the highest quality and efficiency. I have worked at six stores over my career with Starbucks. I have noticed that there is an immense amount of teamwork and without that everything falls apart. Employees are trained to work together and respect each other. Each shift should run on respect and dignity. One of the hardest parts of the job is when employees do not have proper communication or effort to work as a team. I have seen this happen at a couple of stores I worked at and without communication many issues occur. "
good,"Come, be a Partner!"
good,"I've worked at various Starbucks locations for almost 4 years. It was amazing. I had a lot of fun and my coworkers and I still maintain a great level of community. I loved getting to see my ""regulars"" everyday and establishing some memorable relationships. The hardest part of the job was trying to be flexible with my schedule. As a college student, I needed irregular days off for group meetings and office hours and my manager wasn't very flexible with me. Otherwise, I loved working at Starbucks."
good,"High volume with drive through, however a fun environment with the staff at most locations. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, however the growth potential beyond Store Manager is difficult - opportunities are few and far between."
good,"It's a lot more than just serving coffee, you're constantly moving and running around, all on a time schedule. everything has to be done as fast as possible and it has to be perfect. it's a lot of work, but the staff always makes it easier. We all usually try and keep a light air about us even though some customers can try and push that out. The hardest part would be the stress level. The location I was at was one of the busiest, seeing about 7,000 people a day, just from 7am-11am. But if you can deal with the stress its great. The Benefits are amazing, even if you're part time you get benefits. just have to have a level head."
good,My managers and co-workers were always pleasant and I thouroughly enjoyed engaging in conversation with customers as often as possible. The tasks given were enjoyable other than the immense amount of cleaning if given a closing shift. Over all I was satisfied with my job.
good,everybody got along had regular customers everyday that would brighten our day up!
good,"Starbucks opens 5 am Monday through Friday; Saturday and Sunday at 5:30 am. In the morning we set up and organize the pastries in the pastry case. We also make and set up our signature iced teas and coffee. After everything else is finished we brew the coffees for the first group of customers that come in once we open. The day gets busy around 7-7:30 am when customers are going to work. "
good,"This job has been at times very stressful, but extremely rewarding. I couldn't ask for a better team to work with."
good,A typical work day at Starbucks would be fast paced and full of interesting conversations. From taking orders and serving customers in a timely fashion one is always moving.
good,"Excellent management, great for advancement opportunities and excellent benefits!"
good,At this job everybody works hard and efficiently. We get vacation time. The manager is nice and understanding she relates.
good,"I love Starbucks and only left because I got my degree and need to have greater opportunities. The pay is light, especially as a new hire, but the benefits are amazing. Each store will be different as the manager sets the atmosphere. I am good friends with most of the people I worked with and still keep in touch regularly with them."
good,Co workers are helpful and efficient. The hardest part of the job is knowing all the drink variations and quickly making drinks. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing familiar faces (regulars) and being able to get them exactly what they need.
good,"I multi-task every single time I work. It has taught me how to be productive while doing numerous tasks at once. I love my manager and the people I work with. Even when it becomes busy, it is easy to stay calm when I have a positive group of people whom I work with. The most difficult thing, above all, would be when those I work with show less productivity than myself. I love interacting with customers and hearing their stories."
good,Very nice boss and pays very well. Lot of hard physical work but never having to deal with very many nasty people. Boss and co-workers all very friendly. Sometimes lot of driving needed and long hours before a break but long breaks come when driving.
good,"I loved the incredible connections I made with both customers and co-workers. I really feel like I gained a new family and life-long friends! Day to day tasks can sometimes get dull as its repeating the same things, but the people I encountered made it well worth it."
good,"Supply Chain team supports all company owned branches with any question, difficulty and issues they might come across since we monitor their operations, systems, and cycles. "
good,I enjoy working for Starbucks but it can get very challenging at times. Our store is probably the busiest in the city and so it is easy to get burned out at times. But I enjoy all the staff I work along side day in and day out. Some of the hardest parts of the job is just all the physical strain of  running around all the time and the odd hours I have to work. The most important thing i have learned from my time at Starbucks would be the importance of teamwork and Strength placement. Everyone I work with is good at something and placing them where they are best has helped us to be one of the top performing stores in the midwest.
good,"Starbucks itself is an experience of its own. Working there is another. I happened to work at Starbucks when we were allowed to wear company shirts on the weekedds. The drinks are awsome and I enjoyed learning for SB veterans of 10 plus years on how to improve my beverage making skills. 30 percent off drinks is kinda qwerky but its a discount so hey. Tips are awsome, as well as raises and company benefits that come along with working either part time or full everyone gets equal opportunity."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks because it was a fun experience and I met some of the nicest people working for this company but, the hardest part was advancing in a higher position and separating those friendships. Most of my co-workers were all down to earth and they were good at their job because they enjoyed it. My first manager while employed with Starbucks became one of the best managers I've ever gotten to work with. She was very bright, big hearted, hard working and inspiring. Starbucks was a big part of my life because it help me transform from a worker to a hard worker, who excelled and advanced. The responsibilities that come with the business are easy especially if you understand them and actually care. Starbucks can be the first face someone see's after they wake up so the employee's attitude should be right as well as the customers drink. Most days are at high volume. Constantly on your feet until the second you clock out of work. From setting up the outside furniture, the café, and the work stations, the whole business is set up to meet the customers standards so you can get them in and out."
good,"Learning to be a barista can be hard, to be honest. However, most Starbucks cafe's that I have been to have the most eager staff when it comes to learning something new. It generally takes about 3 months to be fully trained on bar, but the experience is worth it. Besides learning what is what about coffee, what you also learn is about the team members, the history of coffee, and ultimately, your customers. Being able to see them and anticipate their order brings a certain smile on their face, I've found out, and is well received by many. Often times, they come to the store just to see you (and of course get their drink). Sure, the shifts can be long, especially when there is a line out the door and around the block, but at the end of the day when you're cooling off with a free beverage, it's worth it to know you've done a good job."
good,"ell us about:"
good,"having great customer services, making connections with all customers"
good,I've enjoyed making/serving coffee and learning the drinks of regular customers.  It was a fun environment to work at.  People are nice and had good work ethics.
good,"A typical day at the Starbucks I worked at was very fun and energetic, the thrill of how busy everything got around you but it wasn't stressful just made things more fun.  Everyone I worked with is family to me till this day.  My boss was the best women I ever know unfortunately she stepped down from the company and I knew my time had ended at starbucks.  It was the hardest decision I had to make but I knew that making coffee was not what I wanted to do forever."
good,This was a fun exciting job and i loved the people i worked for as well as all the wonderful coffee and treats!!
good,"Could not ask for a better Company.  There is a point that one can reach that there is no more room for advancement.  Great Culture, Caring Employees and Customers alike.  Decent Compensation along with amazing benefits."
good,"The most exciting and enjoyable part about working for Starbucks is the people I work with. I view my partners as family members and my work place as a second home, making it not seem like work at all. These positive relationships led an enjoyable learning experience. I gained invaluable interpersonal and customer service skills. The management is very flexible and understanding. The most difficult part of the job is the extreme pressure you are exposed to in a rush, however with the right team support and proper personnel distribution these difficulties are easily overcome and can even be fun. The only reason I would leave this position is because I desire a more stimulating and mentally demanding job. Which is why I am pursuing a career in chemical engineering."
good,I loved working for this company. Great co-workers. Fantastic work environment. Really enjoyed the customer relationships.
good,"A typical day at work included serving customers, making beverages and cleaning. I learned to use the Point Of Sales system, met many wonderful people and also learned the importance of organization and standard. Management was excellent to work with and always tried to accommodate everyone. I did not find this job difficult, just fun. Everything about it was fun!"
good,"Great place to work at!! Always busy and always something to do either helping customers or cleaning. This is where I really learned how to make customers feel at home in such a quick time span. Co-workers are just like any other job but Starbucks usually hires really cheery people which is great! The hardest thing to do is sometimes just keeping up with the busy pace or knowing when to slow down to not wear yourself out. The best part is making it that third place for people, the home away from home."
good,"Starbucks was one of my favorite jobs, due to the customers. No matter what type of day it was, the customers' that knew me would always cheer me up."
good,"I was able to look forward to each day of work at Starbucks, because of the great environment and culture that the company takes care to cultivate and foster for partners.  I felt that I was challenged and rewarded for my efforts on a daily basis.  The company's mission is to provide more than an excellent cup of coffee, but to create relationships with customers and help the community; I felt that I was able to accomplish just this."
good,"meeting varieties of people, with different attitude and background, having a laugh and interacting with them."
good,"Preparing a variety of customer beverage orders such as espresso drinks and Coffee of the Day to Starbucks standards.  Presenting oneself professionally and demonstrating clear communication.  "
good,"The workplace was nice and great for meeting new people."
good,"Starbucks Coffee Corporation is a very fun place to work. At times it can be stressful, but it is made more rewarding when all the busy events lead up to a great sales day."
good,"My current position is absolutely great! It is a fast paced work experience where you are required to complete task correctly and quick. Co-workers are great, great team work. As well the management is excellent working with my availability and requests."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, great team work, most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer and meeting their expectations."
good,awesome company to work at! Culturally an amazing company with Eminence growth potential
good,"The work load as a barista and supervisor is not unreasonable. You need to be constantly motivated, always be ready give the customer your absolute best service, and follow the supervisors instructions."
good,"As far as Starbucks goes, simply do as requested and expected of you and all shall be well. Step outside the lines and rules, and expect the obvious. As for the team and work, it is all very manageable. You will have some rough days but those are made up for by the team. Hopefully you will have some rather awesome partners working alongside you."
good,"For having worked at Starbucks for many years, and different stores, I have become very fond of the family-like atmosphere-both behind the counter and across it. Customers are friendly-having worked in the Big City, as well as in a small, North Carolina city, you can never expect one ""type"" of shopper. Also, many of the company values reflect my personal values which make going to work enjoyable."
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a Barista for over a year. The job is a bit demanding in that we are expected to be working non-stop, except for on breaks of course. What I mean is, even when everything has been stocked and cleaned and there is literally nothing else to do...you should always find something to do. (cleaning out floor drains is fun!) "
good,"This position was extremely challenging and rewarding, it was easy to approach this job with enthusiasm and excitement. The primary challenge of this position was remaining calm, focused, and attentive during the early morning rush. This challenge was rewarded by the opportunity to greet people, who were just waking up, with a smile, hopefully setting the tone for their entire day. "
good,One of my favorite jobs I have had. I always enjoyed talking to my daily customers and inventing new drinks for customers.
good,"typical day at work is fast pace greeting customers taking orders. stocking and cleaning in between rushes. Opening in the morning we set up the pastry bar make coffee and open shop. On closing nights, shut down and clean equipment and clean store and lobby in cluding the bathrooms emptying garbage and setting up product for the next day. "
good,"Starbucks was a great job, working there was my first experience in a managerial position. The work days flew by because we were usually very busy. My manager became my good friend and we still keep in touch to this day. My co-workers were also extremely good people and 3 of them are still my close friends. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job was working on the bar and making drinks for the customers. The hardest part of the job was learning everything about coffee, and learning to distinguish between the different subtle flavors. "
good,"Typically, I would show up early mornings to help open the store. Duties included setting up coffee, setting up the pastry case, and completing AM cleaning tasks. It was our job to greet early morning customers with friendliness and make genuine connections daily. "
good,"I enjoy being able to talk to customers, and build a relationship with them because, that is what is going to make them come back! I love working in the fast paced environment."
good,"It was a great work experience in France working in a French work culture it helps to explore a lot of things such as work culture,Direct interaction with french customers and the most important thing is practice business French "
good,Provided a flexible schedule as well as decent hours. Co-workers were friendly. Provides learning in a fast pace setting.
good,"working at Starbucks allowed me to make many new friends, great for networking. From being at the bar creating beverages to just pouring a drip coffee to taking and order and being on the register. it was all round a great experience. management was good, hardest part of the job is to not become a coffee drinker. "
good,"Starbucks has a very unique atmosphere that makes people feel like they are at home. We have regulars that know us all by name, and its a very fun working environment. Although it can be busy at times and work does catch up on you, overall I would say this is definitely a company worth working for. "
good,"I loved working at Starbucks as a barista and would work for them again. You develop a solid skill-set of customer service, multi-tasking, and the art of coffee. "
good,Starbucks was a great environment to work in. They support a diverse staff and are an open-minded company to work for.
good,"In my several years of working for this company, I have gained nothing but knowledge and many benefits. Within this company, partners receive personal, as well as company advancements. Raises are given every six months prior to a performance review; stock options are granted after a certain time, too. The relationships and networking opportunities that can be built with customers is a great incentive, as well. "
good,"A typical day at work i will make it least 1,000 drinks for customers. On a normal basis i am constantly moving. I've learned at my job that people believe coffee is one of the most important things in the world. My manager is amazing, she is always willing to work with me on my schedule. My coworkers are really easy to get along with and it creates a fun environment for the workplace. The hardest part of my job is dealing with an angry customer; I was always taught to be over friendly and it has never failed me. What i enjoy most about my job is that after each customer leaves i feel as if i have made their day a little bit better by always making sure their starbucks beverage is exactly how they want it to be."
good,"There isn't really a normal day. The job functions are relatively easy, it's fast paced and there's always something to do. The main focus is the customers and doing everything in your power to ensure consistent high quality products while keeping up with the rush without taking any shortcuts. You have to be quick on your feet and open communication is essential for a fluid team. Multitasking skills a must! Trust from your team is really important as well. If the team doesn't feel they can trust their manager, mistakes happen more often than anyone wishes and you can suffer high turnover and lost sales. "
good,"Career advancement is challenging, yet rewarding. I enjoy this job because of my co-workers. My store manager hires great candidates that will fit in with our quirky group based on personality and capability. I have learned how to not only provide excellent customer service, but to participate in a team effort. In addition, I have learned how to be the best supervisor I can be, with constant improvements along the way. The hardest part of the job is handling everything at a fast pace; through this, I have learned how to maintain a calm environment for myself and my co-workers during busy times and getting the job done without becoming overwhelmed. "
good,"If you love meeting new people, drinking tons of Starbucks, and you have a positive attitude, Starbucks is for you. It's extremely flexible with school and parenthood, and they want you to build a future for yourself with them."
good,"- Working for a licensed, independently owned Starbucks in a hotel."
good,"I worked split shifts alot, but loved it. I learned the origin of coffee and different things about flavors and such. The management was great and we all got along very well together. Hardest part of the job was learning the espresso machine. The most enjoyable part was learning all the different beverages."
good,Wonderful work environment with friendly managers and kind customers. Definitely a work place to thrive in with flexible hours.
good,"Fun work environment, and all the coffee you could drink. Team driven and positive atmosphere, loved the customer interactions and how the company made you feel valued and part of something bigger than you are. Great company to be a part of with great benefits."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time as a barista while during my undergrad, because the job was flexible and everyday was a new day with new stories. The people who worked with me were more like an extended family, we worked well as a team and knew when to step up when someone was down. Even our regulars were a member of the Starbucks crew, being able to connect with them on a personal level and giving them a positive start to the day, was always one of my favourite parts of the job."
good,Taken care of the customers was a must. No matter what it time it was energy was a must. Loved the smiles that were on my customers faces.
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for over a year now, and I have been greatly enjoying it. Within seven months I was promoted to a shift supervisor. I believe I bring superior customer service, leadership, and even goofiness to each of my shifts. I love working for a company that strives to promote making a normal purchase decision and actual part of someone's daily routine. We have some frequenters, the regulars, and the super regulars (sometimes two or three visits a day!), and all of us have created a sort of family. The biggest positive from any leadership position I hold, including this job, I get to help foster the leader in others, allowing them to see their potential as well. This is by far the most rewarding."
good,"fazia abertura da loja, abertura de caixa e atendimento ao cliente, gerente sempre a disposição para nos ajudar, amigos de trabalho sempre tornando o dia mais agradável, a parte mais difícil do trabalho, quando o cliente saia insatisfeito por algum motivo q não conseguimos solucionar, e a parte mais agradável era se divertir ao invés de ser uma coisa e só mais um dia de trabalho e sim fazer a diferença."
good,"I love this job so much. They really cater to their employees needs, if you need more hours, got it, if you can't work with a certain person, got it, if you need to be transferred to a different store, done. The team really loves what they do and they are amazing people. This job builds so much skill and teaches you what a job should be like and what you need to be looking for out of customer service jobs. It is very high-pressure and high-volume so if you do not handle stress well, it is not a good place to be, but if you are someone who needs to be kept busy at all times, this is the job for you!"
good,Great environment with great people!! Couldn't ask for anything else when it comes to co-workers and environment.
good,"ótima perspectiva futura, aprendi sobre gerenciamento de equipe e gerenciamento de loja, o local mais agradavel que já frequentei, uma segunda casa"
good,Starbucks is an amazing company to work for all around.
good,Days at Starbucks are about connecting with customers. Many are usuals that come if not once but sometimes twice everyday so workers and customers become very close.
good,"Early hours in ,early hours out. Meet new people everyday, and develop customer relationships constantly. Ensure proper staff is hired to sustain these relationships. Follow up and timely employee appraisals are essential. No, ""Hard Parts"" to the job, just challenges of everyday operations and Human Resource connections."
good,"A typical day starts very early, where we serve customers heading to work. When the line slows down we get busy cleaning equipment, and I (the supervisor) am responsible for sending people on their morning breaks."
good,"I worked as a busboy at this fast paste very busy starbucks, I would restock items for both my co-workers and customers, clean the coffee shop, taking out the garbage. I loved this job but the hardest part was managing work and school, which is why I had to leave."
good,"Yes, Starbucks is a great and even an awesome company. They do offer a lot of benefits from health to finical help. A typical day is to get up really early and set up for the day. Sometimes when your bored, you come up with new beverages out of no where. And there are days or seasons with the company introduces a new or familiar drink back again. Managers are willing to help you with scheduling and hours , if you need any. We call our co-workers, partners. Yes, their fun to work with. They hardest thing is to have a nice face when a customers are been ugly and mean to you. Out of all the good, the bad, and ugly. I still like working because there are good and awesome customers that actually make your day. That can make you smile and brighten up your day. And true partners that would actually help out and actually work."
good,Es una maravillosa empereza pero como toda tiene sus altas y bajas.
good,Offers great benefits in a hard working atmosphere! I learned a lot about customer value and what it takes to effectively lead a very responsive crew
good,"The nature of most Starbucks store is usually a busy environment. That coupled with the chance you may have a bad manager or DM may cause some unsettling thoughts. But I must say during my years with the company you genuinely find people who love their job, and they are the ones who make it a great environment to work in. be expected to work hard in a fun and pretty laid back atmosphere. Remember have fun it's only coffee."
good,"While working for Starbucks, I have grown to learn as a Barista, you hold the power to service a stranger with a warm and delight smile while giving them the feel of comfortbility. I have enjoyed help making the world feel good. Thanks Starbucks."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Starbucks, I founf it to be a challenge face paced enviroment that allowed for me to meet our regular customers who totally apprecaite the feeling of Starbucks being their 2nd place to come, enjoy, relax, and talk with others, etc."
good,Its great to work for when your starting out in the workfield and they are flexable.
good,I can not say enough wonderful things about my time spent with Starbucks. Every part of what they do includes care for the people they work with. They are an amazing company and I was lucky to spend time working for them. Unfortunately I joined the company at a time when cut backs were necessary and ultimately left due to lack of growth opportnity.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. You get to meet great people and interact with others on a daily basis. Working hard is definitely rewarded. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be the hours which are all over the place. However, this allows for flexibility, which some people need and want. Howard Schultz is a genius and an impassioned man who is going to continue to take Starbucks to new levels."
good,- delivering excellence customer service to our customers
good,High paced work environment. Can be high stress. Difficult to balance customer needs with store needs. Wonderful co-workers who are professional and dedicated.
good,"From having worked within this company I have been highlighted to consistency and accuracy amongst colleauges. I felt the confidence to learn new skills,adapt and progress within the roleI do. I saw the persistence with starbucks to always strive for excellence, which is most empowering. From the time that I have spent with the organization, I got an immediate feel for positive encouragement, training development and incentives to enjoy working for Starbucks Coffee Company."
good,Management is wonderful and there is great room for advancement
good,"A typical day at work for me was either an opening or closing. I worked at two different stores over the 4 years I was with the company. When my manager moved from my original store he took me with him. But an open shift started about 5:00 AM which meant I had to leave my house around 4:30 AM or 4:20 AM. Which was hard but working at a coffee shop you get free drinks... At Starbucks as a barista you receive a coffee education. Not just drink preparation but also the history and origins or different coffee blends as well as what pastries to pair different coffees with. The manager I had at Starbucks was by far one of the finest I have had the privilege of working with. As far as my co-workers go I always felt that I was part of a family and that family was an unstoppable team. The hardest part of my job was really just waking up and being functional, but it was a small price to pay for the joy of going to work. I loved every second of everyday I worked even if I had rude customers or a hard day at the end of the day I felt like I had served my customers well and even made their day a little more enjoyable."
good,"Even though our day starts super early, I have not held a more rewarding job than at Starbucks. We were often saying to each other, that it should be illegal to have this much fun at work. Now don get me wrong, we worked, but the people I worked with and our customers all had a great time doing it.. The management staff was very flexible with the schedules for those that were in school or those like me, that had a family. I would totally recommend this place to anyone that is looking for work."
good,Never a dull moment working at Starbucks. You meet all kinds of people with all kinds of personalities.
good,"My availability as an Assistant Manager had to be open so that means that I am required to arrive at the store at 4:45am anytime. I would set up the cash tills and safe for business. I would have to deploy my partner so they know what position they are assigned to. For example on the bar to make drinks or ringing up customers just to name a few positions. As an ASM I had to oversee the store make sure all customers are satisfied with their purchase. At down time I would count the funds from yesterday transactions and deposited it in the bank. Ordering is a major duty at starbucks because of perishable items, always making sure we have fresh food."
good,Starbucks is a great company with lots of room for growth. They provide their partners with amazing benefits.
good,-Providing great customer service and serving.
good,"A typical day at work I would open the store at 4:45 am. Prepare the fridge for opening, and the display case. I learned how to memorize hundreds of personal drinks for the customers. I would take orders as well as do the creative layouts for the store. My co-workers were from all over the would and it helped me to learn greetings in a few differrent languages. The hardest part was dealing with someone who was having a bad day and me remembering not to take it personal. The most enjoyabe part was the unforgettable customers."
good,A typical day for me would be setting up the cafe for the day. I would count the cash drawers and get them balanced. I would also count the daily deposit and bring it to the bank. Some of the co-workers there have turned out to be life long friends. The hardest part of my job was deligating tasks to my fellow employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting all sorts of interesting people as customers or employees.
good,"My experience while working at Starbucks was inspiring, I've learned the true meaning of ""Team Work"" and responsibilities of having a job. My manager was very involved in each employee work life, she helped me understand the business and all aspects of it. My co-workers was very friendly and helpful! The hardest part of my job was at first making the coffee, and the most enjoyable were that my co-workers and I was like a family, and seeing the customers face with excitement and satisfaction."
good,"Working within the SCAT team, creating and delivering training packages to businesses.

Seeing customers leave with a smile and their special drink made the job that much more enjoyable.  At times it was trying to help a customer, who may not have had the best day, find a drink but I remained with a smile on my face.  As a team we were flexible and everyone was willing to work around each others schedules if something may have arisen such as a sickness, emergency, school, or other circumstances."

I liked the frontline work, and continued evolving as a barista until I earned a Black Apron."
good,"It is a fun job and every day is different, but unfortunately it can be more than most people can handle. What with customers who can be difficult at times and dealing with the transient population, some of whom have serious mental instabilities, in a way that is both respectful and inclusive. I have made some great connections with people on an almost hourly basis that give the job a great since of reward. If you are a people person who wants to be busy for most of your day then this is the job for you. If you are a person who can't put on a smile and interact with even the most difficult people than maybe this isn't for you."

good,"A typical day at work involved a warm welcome as soon as you walked in the door which immediately made your day. The first store that I worked at was a drive-thru store and it was super busy all the time so connecting with customers was difficult at times, but I made it work. I learned how to manage my time better and when you remember a customer's name it makes their day. I learned that having a manager on the floor more often allows for a more comfortable workplace no matter how busy it is. I'd say the hardest part of the job would be connecting with every customer while it is busy and keeping up with customer support when there's a shortage of staff. What I loved most about the job was how personal some of the connections with partners and customers were and how welcoming everyone was. I loved suggesting new options to people and making it their new usual drink. Overall I absolutely loved the job."

Overall I would still say it was a great experience though.

good,"If you like a constant change from. the day to day, I would recommend this job, has a lot of good perks and the people working there are usually very friendly."
good,I really love the work that Starbucks does.  At times it may feel tedious but in the end the company really does take good care of the partners.  You get plenty of benefits and it is good for having a big resume booster as well because this company has a very high rep for the functionality of their operations.
good,Loved working at Starbucks. The overall culture is consistent and healthy. Starbucks makes you feel more like a partner than an employee and the benefits prove that.
good,"I would recommend Starbucks to any young adult. They provide a flexible schedule, excellent training, vacation pay, great benefit packages, a comfortable work environment, and complimentary food/drinks per working shift. I have no ill comments towards the company, but left because I wanted to excel in my management career after college."

good,"Benefits, fast pace , multicultutal Environment , trendy , and fun. Great schedule, pick up shifts ,coffee training, coffee master training . Coffee tasting and pairings."
good,"Being a shift supervisor at Starbucks was busy, we’d have to be up as early as 4am or as late as 12am.   Busy mornings, keeping all baristas in deployment, dealing with money and store cleanliness.   Part of being a shift supervisor is being a better barista, having to model the way you want your coworkers to work for you."

good,Starbucks is a very beautiful culture/company to work for. You will be thrilled about the about of foreign customers you will meet. Also you will be able to differ your favorite coffee flavor !
good,"Obviously you learn a lot about coffee while you're there. Starbucks is a very popular coffee company, so expect to always be busy taking orders or making drinks. The hardest part of the job is learning how to multi-task by making a few different drinks at a time, but once you've got that down it's not that difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to make delicious drinks and meeting loads of new and interesting people every day."
good,depending on location this can be a very fast-paced job but everyone there is amazing and they provide a lot of opportunities. I wish the base pay for baristas was higher.
good,enjoyed most of my time a work. Starbucks really enforced making your job your second home and honestly at times it was. a real fast pace environment to work in.
good,I was at Starbucks for almost five years. I loved it there. Everyone's experience is different but I was lucky enough to be placed at a great store with a wonderful team. We were very supportive and after a while it really was like a little family. Wonderful work environment and this will obviously differ from store to store depending on management.
good,Great company and many great co-worker. You can learn many things and they give many chance to improve and move up. Starbucks has many perks when working there and also lots of cons.
good,"We started on time, ready to open to the public we kept really busy and focused during rush time. Whenever things calmed down we were able to learn more about the menu and how to interact with the clients."
good,"The benefits are great at starbucks. Eye, dental coverages are higher than expected. If you are looking to advance there are lot of opportunities you just have to be willing to relocate."
good,"Working at Starbucks was always an adrenaline rush. There were barely any slow days because the products and service always kept the store busy.  I learned how to multitask efficiently. I would be on the register, oven and on drinks at the same time. Management was very flexible and professional. The store always kept me in high spirits. Everyone was so optimistic that there were no bad days."
good,"Everybody was friendly and I was really happy to go there every day and do my job."
good,"I love it so much, the work was fair, I lived the management. I love the costumers and coffee. I would 100% work for this company again if given the chance."
good,For the many years I have been there it has been good to me very flexible with schedule. They invest in you in many different ways just have to ask questions.
good,"Starbucks is great, and there is so much opportunity for advancement as long as you work for it. The best part of the job is our customers. They make it fun and exciting!"
good,"super amazing enviroment  the way he/she treat the customer is super professional, the ambience of the shop is quiet ai if you want to take a review there"
good,"There are regulars and then there are new comers, but at the end of the day it’s the crew and then there’s the fun of the craft. The craft is simply the growing experience in making latte art and other art related beverages."
good,Loved working there. Coworkers are friendly. Great college program. Easy job but you are expected to clean a lot. Must enjoy customer interaction. Fun job.
good,"A busy spot but the team worked together very well. Training was good, they made sure you understood what you were doing. Support was there from district manager. It was a good place to work."

good,Working for Starbucks was the most fun job I've ever had! I loved working in an environment that always smelled amazing. Of course some customers were hard to deal with but they eventually took their order and left and they were the hardest part of the day.

good,Being a Starbucks barista is a fast paced and team oriented job while cultivating a fun and social environment.  The company provides excellent benefits at just 20 hours a week for an easier work life balance.
good,"Brand is also a good advantage, good company and benefits, recommend for high standard quality of coffee, learning while enjoying, highly recommended for 1st timer,"
good,"My average day was to come in, prep for closing, and manning the kiosk until closing time. Once closed, I had the same routine of bringing in outside material and cleaned the inside. inventory was taken once a week"
good,"I've worked at four separate Starbucks corporate stores during my tenure and your day all depends upon whether you're in a ""high-volume"" store or not. If you are in a high-volume store such as myself then you will learn to be quick on your feet and multi-task like no tomorrow. Time management is key as a barista and especially as a supervisor since you have time deadlines to finish cleaning or inventory tasks. Every Starbucks is usually filled with a great team that you need to learn to depend on and help. The hardest part is learning all the regular customer's names. But once you do you will develop great relationships with them."
good,I like it here the culture is killer and the biggest thing that makes me excited for the future is how many waves good people can make and how hard it is for bad employees to affect the work.
good,"Always be on time."
good,Working at Starbucks was fun and always full of challenges. There was new training and constant new products. I learned how to work better as a team and how to manage time effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers as they came in to the lobby and drove through the drive through.
good,Starbucks is a very open company that takes good care of they're employees. You get annual raises and several benefits that arent typically offered with other companies such as discounts with samsung and free spotify.
good,"The management was excellent, and the company was very flexible about my schedule. Starbuck does have some attractive perks, and they helped me to accommodate my religion upon my request. "
good,It was a really relaxed laid back place! It felt like home. I had a great management staff as well as partners! They were always so kind and had A lot of patience with me when I had a million and one questions.
good,"It's a good first job for youngster's."
good,Being a barista was definitely one of the most rewarding jobs I ever had because I have a love for good quality coffee as well as putting a smile on my customers' faces!
good,With Starbucks I learned customer service and communication skills. I built lots of customer relationships. I would compare the workplace culture with a home environment. The most important thing I learned was how to work under pressure.
good,"uno de los mejores lugares para trabajar y desarrollarte, starbucks me ha enseñado mucho en lo laboral, pero se multiplica mas el aprendizaje personal."
good,"Starbucks culture and overall business values are some of the best I've ever work with. To see the history and overall development of what Starbucks stand for is second to none. To give the community where all is welcome (even though some partners don't practice that or believe that) is one of the many reasons Starbucks is so successful. Not to mention their benefits, educational opportunities and discounts you get a good deal for the work. Advancement is there so you can grow there as well."
good,"Current shift manager for a company operated location; former license store manager. "
good,"Great place to work no matter what phase of life your in. Opportunities for  you to have a career as well. Fun, fast paced and innovative environment."

good,"Starbucks was my first job after having my kids! I was absolutely thrilled with with company! I was hired in Santa Maria California, I had amazing co workers and loved the environment! Work was usually upbeat and busy, but once you get the gist of how things run you can’t complain! Dress code is fairly lacks just black or khaki pants with a plain blue,black, white or light patterns, hair can be multi color d no issues there, girls if you like nails done it’s not allowed, also gotta wear proper shoes, but it was a blast! I loved working nights. If we hadn’t moved I’d still be working Starbucks"
good,This job helped me become more familiar with customer service and comfortable as a barista. It allowed me to explore the role as shift lead and helped better managing skills.
good,"Working at Starbucks has been the greatest experience. There are skills that I learned at Starbucks that I know I would not have learned anywhere else. The company is devoted to their partners and their customers, which is always a great experience. There are some great managers that work for Starbucks, but there are some pretty bad ones too. I was very lucky to work under great leaders and have had mostly great experiences with my managers. I have received a lot of support from my partners which helps the job. I am also an ASU graduate through their SCAP Program, which I am so grateful for. "
good,Working for Starbucks was really fun. I would still be there if I didn't have personal issues going on. The environment was wonderful. It felt like a family from the beginning.
good,"Management was kind and I enjoyed how they would give me time to go away and do auditions for music jobs or school. "
good,I loved this job. One of my favorites. It was a faced pace place of employment but that is what made it so much fun. I also enjoyed the people I worked with. So far the only place of employment that allows you to become like a family.

good,Each day was fast paced. Learned how to communicate well with costumers and how to work well with others. Management encouraged learning and growth. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with costumers and making their day.
good,"All in all I love my job at Starbucks. I love the team of wonderful, hardworking people I work with who are just as dedicated as me to learn everyone’s drink and name and perfect their beverage the first time. I love watching my customers face light up when I greet them with their name and already have their regular beverage ready before they have even ordered and paid for it."
good,Fun place to work. Great life/work balance. Management is easy to work with. Relaxed dress code and you're provided with an apron. Your partners are always there to help out.
good,I would love to work in this filled for starbuks i have expirience around calonary arts and love to work with a team i am reposible and hard worker and really good with comuniction
good,"Within the 10 months I spent at Starbucks, I experienced an amazing work environment with impeccable employees and a lovely manager. It was a fast-paced, amusing, and productive store. Although rush hours were stress inducing, you never could feel unprepared, due to the amazing training and trainers.Close quarters called for employees turning into friends, making shifts feel almost hanging out while making coffee (and money, of course). Altogether, Starbucks was the best job I've ever had, and any young adult looking for a place of work that will guarantee amazing benefits, wonderful employees, and tons of work experience (believe me, you'll get every situation and more thrown at you) should apply."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Starbucks and what the company is about as a whole. It's a perfect first job that teaches you great skills. Very beneficial. You really learn about yourself and how to communicate with others as well as work in a face past environment. You also learn how to work with other personalities as well as serve customers with different personalities. I would highly highly recommend Starbucks as your first job. They are extremely flexible with hours (school, other jobs, ect.) "

Scheduling is flexible,and you don't work crazy hours."
good,"A wonderful, collaborative, quick-paced place to work in a friendly but disciplined environment with a nice hourly rate. A fair manager, lots to do, nice discounts and benefits."
good,"I love working here. I get to talk to people and learn about them while making them a great coffee and starting their day off on a good note. The hardest part is balancing the customers that want to talk and those in a hurry while maintaining the Starbucks standards. I've learned how to keep calm when confronted with irate customers and how to best resolve situations that are difficult. I've learned how to take and place inventory, money handling and ordering, how to lead a team, time management, how to coach on behaviors that fall short of expectations, and how to be flexible with short notice."
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks and had great coworkers and customers. The hardest part of this job was the demand from the higher ups to do the work of four employees and only get paid for doing the work of one.
good,Starbucks is a safe environment for anyone to work in. Overall great company who treat people the right way. If in hospitality I would recommend Starbucks for a change of life.
good,"Great place to work! Very high paced but the environment keeps you focused and included. If you enjoy making people happy, this is the right job for you."
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work! If you're a friendly person, Talking to people through customer service via cashier is a great way to learn new things and make new friends. If you are creative then producing menu items, editing ,and Making new recipes is amazing for creative types ESPECIALLY with the existence of the secret menu!"
good,"Sadly, they have the best benefits packets especially for families, so it makes it hard to leave lol. If you chose to work here, keep this is the back of your head, you’re only there to do what your paid for, customer service and do the best you can to get thru your shift, DONT TAKE WORK HOME. Other than that, most shifts are a breeze and you don’t notice you’ve worked a full shift."
good,The most flexible job to work for being a mom and balancing life. The benefits and discounts are worth it for the lower compensation. It’s also job security. I love working for a diverse company who care about their partners.

You build close relationships with customers which is the most fulfilling part of the job. Job is relatively easy. Starbucks treats employees with respect and offers great benefits.
good,"I've been here since I was in High School and I'm still here, I love the environment and the people I work with. The benefits are amazing and the free drinks are always a plus. With a recent change in management it just isnt the same anymore,management is lazy and doesn't listen to what her workers need or say. Regardless, that's one manager, majority of other managers are hard working and listen. I've covered and multiple stores and even still the environment is fun and hardworking."
good,"Starbucks is a solid company and offers many  benefits for young people, including a school reimbursement program, stocks, health insurance, as well as dental, vision, life insurance, and paid time off."
good,Starbucks had a welcoming environment. I felt like part of the family from the moment I walked through ths door. I learned a lot and grew more than I expected to.

good,"For a first job, it was great. The location where I worked was lovely and the employees were great at training and answering my questions. Everyone was always in great moods to help and teach me anything I needed help with. The store manager was a doll, and very easy to work with. Shifts were manageable and easy to fix if hours needed to be changed."
good,I will always be apart of the Starbucks family. Though much of the workplace changes overtime. I will forever carry the Starbucks values with me as I move through the workforce.
good,"The days were always chaotic and wild but I sincerely loved working at starbucks more than any other place. The people are amazing, the work is fulfilling, and the benefits are more than I've ever received from any other job."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been great, there are great benefits and once you're trained it is a really easy job. It fast passed most of the time so the days go by fast. My typical day consists of ringing up customers, making drinks, cleaning up and other small tasks. The culture is nice, you get close with coworkers and it becomes like a family. The hardest part of the job is the customers. The best part is getting to make fun new drinks and create connections with people."
good,"Great management and everyone really tries to make sure you are comfortable and happy. It is fast paced but once you get into a rhythm, the time goes by quickly and it's nice to meet different types of people."

good,"J'ai vraiment aimé mon expérience chez Starbucks. Les gens qui viennent prendre un bon café sont bien souvent heureux, donc cela fait en sorte que l'ambiance dans la place est très positive. C'est un emploi où tu peux grandir, et passer de Barista à Chef de quart, et gérer un plancher en décidant les positions de tes membres pour la durée de leur quart de travail. C'est très stimulant."
good,"Tuve la grata experiencia de tener como jefe a un excelente Líder, pro activo, amable, exigente, responsable, el cual inspiraba a todos los baristas a dar lo mejor de sí para que toda la jornada laboral fuera amena y los clientes se fueran muy contentos. Lejos de los mejores trabajos hasta ahora."

good,working for starbucks was an absolute treat untilthe company decided to start catering to pat time employees and reduced hours exponentially for full time employees
good,Great company to work for that provides amazing benefits.  This is customer service so one must be prepared for such. I am thankful for the many lessons Starbucks has taught me concerning working well with others and having empathy.
good,Friendly and fast paced atmosphere. Great friends were made there. Easy to learn new recipes and follow steps. Great connections made with customers and fellow baristas
good,Working there was fun and I enjoyed it very much. Serving beverages to the community is a great way to really see what type of people neighbor you. It is a quick pace job great for someone who is willing to serve the community and get to know people. Certainly not for everyone especially if you are short tempered and impatient.

good,Generally Starbucks was a good place to work. I appreciated the culture of the store I worked at. My coworkers and managers were always very kind and understanding as well as being able to get the job done. I was happy to be able to advance to a shift supervisor position quickly while receiving training where I felt prepared to handle the job ahead of me. I would recommend working here if you're looking for a fun customer service experience. Plus all the free coffee you could ever want!
good,"Its a good Place to work with."
good,The culture at Starbucks is what keeps me coming back every day. The environment I work in and the support that I receive from senior leadership is not something that I could get at just any job.
good,"I typically love the fast pace work environment. I believe it makes my day go by faster and I work faster and more proficiently when it is a busy day. I believe this job is best for those with the ability to work fast. Everyone is very friendly and I often enjoyed being able to be a good customer service representative. Customers knew me by name and I knew them and I loved the community connections at starbucks. Sometimes customers also can be not so pleasant, and may have a bad experience with them. I think thats a hard part of working though in general is that you need to remember to please customers even if they aren't pleasant to you."
good,"As an avid coffee drinker, working at Starbucks allowed me to know the insides and outs of what it means to make the perfect drink for the consumer and serve it with a smile."
good,"There's always a lot that needs to get done, but the project managers are reasonable in their expectations, and the work is doled out fairly.  Management can expect you to change gears suddenly, but this doesn't happen often and only with good reason.  Everyone works pretty hard during regular hours, but there's not many folks that come in super early or stay super late.  The office looks a pretty empty before 8am and after 5pm."
good,Come in ready to go. We stay busy depending on what store you are located at.  Great teamwork and managers.  Ability to work at different locations if there are more than one starbucks in your area. You can fill in at multiple locations.
good,"Starbucks offered a competitive salary with amazing benefits (like free Spotify +insurance). It's also a great job for anyone, I started in the middle of high school and it worked out perfectly for me as well as for some of my coworkers who were in college, had another part -time job, or were parents!"
good,This was a good Job to have during school as it helped juggle hours. It also was a great learning experience in terms of customer service and speed in terms of making drinks etc.
good,it was okay and a very good first job! I would recommend working here for anyone who’s also going into college. The only cons i say we’re customers because people can be harsh and it will cause a problem but most of the time everyone is very friendly.
good,"busy, fast paced, cleaning and laughing with customers, management was amazing and i couldn't have ask for a better manager. the hardest part of the job was being short staffed and having big rushes come through"
good,It was a great job and one I would do again. I had to leave because I was relocating for college. I struggled to get a transfer approved but that hasn't stopped me from wanting to start working at my local store.
good,"I loved being a barista and manager for Starbucks. The team of people I worked with were like family. It was a fun environment to work in, and I would highly recommend the company."

good,"Starbucks offers an excellent benefits package to full and part time employees, including college education. Employees are given autonomy to make decisions that are right for the customer. Starbucks follows it's mission. Every store and manager is different, and there are bad apples, but overall my experience has been great."

good,"I love the people that I worked for, and the benefits are amazing. I like that Starbucks will pay for me to finish college and I like the fact that management is able to work with me on my schedule."
good,Throughout my time at Starbucks I was taught and learned a plethora of skills. I learned very quickly that when dealing with an unruly customer it’s best to satisfy that customers needs to the best of your abilities while keeping a positive attitude because at the end of the day you are the face that the customer will attach to the company. In addition to this I had the ability to work alongside of a variety of different people which helped me build my social skills and taught me more efficient ways to deal with issues whenever they would arise.
good,"It was definitely a great place to work, I enjoyed the staff and even some of the customers that Starbucks attracts, great benefits, made me feel like the company actual cares about its partners"
good,"Starbucks was my first job after high school. Taught me valuable lessons with patience with customers, stocking and rotating products, cash register and drive-thru duties and sanitation regulations. Very great place to work at long-term. I wish I would've transferred stores when I moved to college instead of just quitting."
good,"A typical day involves working at a very fast paced whether be it preparing drinks, cleaning up or taking in orders from customers. while doing this job you will learn many people skills like starting conversations with people. the management is pretty understanding and will create a schedule that fits best for you. the workplace culture is really fun and entertaining. the hardest part of the job is doing the same thing everyday which might cause you to burn out of sometimes rude customers."
good,"The typical day of work goes by fast because of the bustling environment the work place always has. You start the moment you clock in, so I can always look forward to being productive when going to work. The hardest part of the job was juggling orders, but with the help from my co-workers, the job was not really difficult."
good,"There are moments at this job where it can be stressful and fast-paced, so if you are looking for a job to just slack off at, this isn't the place for you. On the other hand, it is very team oriented, you make good friends; and the slower moments help offset the stressful times. So if you have a good work ethic, are willing to work as part of a team, and can get things done as they need to be, this is a job I would recommend."
good,Working at Starbucks help learn many skill from providing great customer service and learning how to handle many situation at same time. It is very fun job where one can meet many people.
good,"Wonderful place to work, would recommend to family and friends. Provides great customer service to customers! Treats employees fairly, great benefits for employees!"

good,"With the management good work life balance"
good,"La empresa es muy buena para estudiantes, te permite estudiar y trabar muy fácilmente."
good,"Greet every customer coming in and out in the shop with energy and smile,"
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 4 years after working back to back jobs I was unhappy at. Flexible hours helped me finish school but the work isn't easy and you don't really get paid enough for all that you have to do, in my opinion. Still, it's a decent job and there are pretty great benefits included."
good,"I work part-time at Starbucks and have been for 2 years. By far the best job I have ever had. Amazing atmosphere, great benefits, and very lenient when you are a student. Perfect job to have throughout high school and university/college."
good,Es una empresa que cada periodo busca algo nuevo y la oprotunidad de crecer laboralmente siempre esta presente
good,"During my experience at Starbucks, I had an enjoyable work environment and worked well with my team. I learned to be more patient in fast past situations to be more productive. The hardest aspect of the job was having competitive hours. A typical day at work was busy with two lines at the cash register and multi-tasking drinks, orders, and clean-up."
good,"A typical day at work involved communicating with and welcoming customers, working well in a team setting, taking orders, making drinks and food and cleaning. Management was understanding and the culture was positive and the most enjoyable part of my job was having good conversations with co workers and customers."
good,"a typical day at starbucks mainly consists of making peoples drinks, conversing, drive thru orders, heating up food in the ovens, doing dishes. It can be very busy at times, but the environment is really relaxed sometimes."
good,"its hard work, you need to know everything and have an amazing work  ethic but if you ca . handle that its an amazing company to work for! truly kind enviorment, everyone is welcome as long as you can do your job."
good,I love that Starbucks pays for my college and affordable health benefits at only 20 hours a week. The company cares about their employees and understands the struggles of working in customer service.
good,I am happy to work here but the problem is I am not getting enough hours. Everyone is nice especially my manager she is always there to help. While working I learned time management. we all are like a family
good,"It was a typical day at work, some days it would get crowded but it wasnt nothing most people could handle. I learned a lot working there.If somebody ask me to work there againI would"
good,"I personally loved my job as a barista. Starbucks is a wonderful company and when you get the hang of things you love your job so much. I woke up excited to go to work and while tiresome, it was great."
good,I believe this company is great to work for. As a student I was given great respect and understanding with my schedule. I had benefits and availability to advance in this company. I Would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Extremely customer oriented/fun working environment .  There was never a dull moment, or lack of purpose.  Consistent emphasis on the mission/purpose of the company."
good,it feels great to work in starbucks..clean enviroment..im just miss em..being one of the management team is the best...and u can travel to the nearest store near your home..
good,"-Crew I worked with was friendly and helpful"
good,"Highly recommend it , considering going back . Many benefits including paid school if you go to asu online. Flexible hours and a faced paced environment"
good,"Working at starbucks is the best. I would never leave if i could afford my lifestyle with a job like this in Hawaii. It is a fast paced environment with lots of customer interaction so you never really have a boring day. The work culture is also amazing, the partners at my store are life one big family and we have tons of regular customers that feel like family. Starbucks also has amazing benefits and you only need to work 20 hours a week to qualify (including going to ASU online for free). If you are looking for a cheap way to put yourself through school and make some great friends along the way this is the job for you!"
good,"Typical day at work requires multitasking and endless connecting with customers. If you have a great team, it does not feel like a job but rather a family."
good,"Opportunities to meet new people every day & create meaningful relationships."
good,"Es una buena empresa para empezar a laborar, ambiente juvenil, facilidad de negociación en el tema de horarios, fomenta el servicio al cliente & eso te permite adquirir buena practica para futuros empleos"
good,I have a lot of good memories working at Starbucks. We all worked hard but had a lot of fun doing it. I still have a lot of friendships years after working there. It kept you busy all the time but time went by rather quickly.
good,Starbucks was great to get me through a long growth period in my life. Wages and benefits are great for entry level service work. College is a great Pro if that is the path for you.
good,Worked at a very busy drive thru so always doing something. if you work at a cafe then its usually pretty relaxed. Free drinks the whole time you are working and free pound of coffee every week
good,"Starbucks provides full benefits for 20 hours, I am very happy with their choices of health options. while working, you get free drinks 1/2 hour before work to 1/2 hour after work. You can mark out lunch and a free bag of coffee a week or box of tea. "
good,"Wonderful place of employment.  Fantastic partners and even more fantastic customers.  I look forward to work every single day."
good,"Starbucks was/is my first job. I've been there over 3 years now ans I loved it. I've learned so much and I appreciate each one of my partners. However, I would like to widen my horizon and look for more opportunities as I would like to learn ans experience more/new/different things."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great experience for me. I enjoyed the fast paced drive-thru location I was at. We had great store managers that looked out for all of us. We were able to take part in store meetings and learn about new products that were releasing. We took a lot of time to ensure we had a great store environment by greeting all customers like family. My fellow partners were like family to me. We worked as a team to break records in the drive thru and were very quick in getting customers what they wanted and getting to the next one.
good,"I had the opportunity to work as a Starbucks Barista during 2016, when I was completing my final classes of my undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia. "
good,I’ve found so many people that I consider some of my closest friends from working at Starbucks. Everyone is very open minded and encouraging. It was a great part time job for me
good,"This job is pretty fast-paced and can be highly demanding when you dont have enough people working. However, after a couple months, once you have the recipes down and know what you're doing, it gets pretty easy and fun to work with your co-workers. Theres always ways to get more hours. The benefits are fantastic. You also get the opportunity to really learn about the products and go against with other partners in competitions. Depending on who you're working with and your manager, this job can be miserable or fun!"
good,"I’ve been working for the company for about 6 ongoing to 7 years, and it’s a great place to work if you need any development skills, i feel like the company works with you to fulfill your needs as a worker and as a customer. They really prioritize making the workplace feel like home and not work, it can be challenging when they make changes but always assure every employee is on track."
good,The hardest part is keeping up with all of the customers and time management. The best part is connecting with customers and working with your team. The management is great and you get cross trained in everything. Can just be stressful at times.
good,"Starbucks is truly transparent, they do invest in their employees, and provide resources for those looking to get and stay on their feet with reasonable pay, hours, a collaborative team, and benefits."
good,"The training and work ethics in Starbucks is really awesome you'll learn so many things. How to get along with the customers and your co-baristas, it feels like you're in your home not in work."
good,Wonderful job to start and work your way up into management. Inconsistent hours for those who do work in management but overall absolutely wonderful people and you are never bored! Worth the customer service!(:
good,"I enjoyed my year at Starbucks as a Barista. I loved the partners and especially our customers. It was fun to make drinks and interact with our customers. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, order and the systems in place at Starbucks."
good,great place work if you have good management. My store didn't have great management one of the reasons I left Starbucks. I worked at Starbucks for 2 years i loved it i made friends learned alot of things. if you like a fast pace job you'll love it.
good,"I love working at Starbucks ,some ppl that work there don’t take the job serious . They like to sit there on the drive thru head set and y’all about others or ppl that aren’t even there , that’s why I had to resign it was very childish"
good,You’ll be Set For Life Working for Starbucks . I feel like for the scale and high demands that Starbucks standards set baristas should get paid more. Other than that it’s a fun environment. Most people’s reasons for quitting is to find something that pays higher
good,"Great work environment. Always fast-paced. However, the customers have the sole ability to make or break your day. If you enjoy multi-tasking ans constant work, then you'll love Starbucks!"
good,"A typical day at work was like going to six flags lol. The culture was amazing. Everyone was friendly. I had a family there. We'd make sure that every customer would enter with a smile and most importantly, leave with one. All drinks were made with love. The hardest part is probably the rush. Its crazy yet fun at the same time. I loved crafting all sorts of drinks and mostly, loved making my customers feel welcomed."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks during the year and a half I was there. Management is a very large component on how you feel. Hours were good, and it always seems like there were enough hours to go around. Very fast paced, and can be stressful, but you meet lots of people and have a collaborative feeling while on the floor."
good,"I have never felt more supported, completely, by a company and my peers. A typical day was relaxed and organized, with plenty of time for conversation with both partners and customers. There is plenty to learn about coffee, leadership, communication, and community. I intend to return to the company at some point because it was a heartwarming experience through and through."
good,"This job, although kind of “sink or swim” was very good to their employees and customers with the benefits and policies they instill. I loved the understanding and in-depth teaching of the product. Training for the job itself was speedy but once you get the hang of the technique, everything becomes easier. Customer connection is very important so friendliness and patience are a must."
good,"The only reason I left was the new manager that came in, she didn't understand my kids school calling and me needing to leave is an emergency. Otherwise starbucks is amazing."
good,"The best part of the job is the closeness of the staff. Every Starbucks I worked at made me feel like I was part of a giant family which made working there quite a bit more fun. When you work you receive 1 free food item per shift and unlimited beverages during days that you work (disclaimer: you will gain weight if you take advantage of this). Starbucks really prefers to promote staff to management positions rather than new hires. This effectively means that starting as a Barista, you would have a great chance of working your way up the ladder."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. We got to engage and interact with customers and employees every second we were working! We got to learn how a corporate system is set up! In addition, we got to learn how to promote a brand! One things that I always thought was neat was that employees when they were not working were still coming to Starbucks on their days off. I asked each of the employees why they would do that, because typically employees want to get away from their workplace. Each of their responses were that of ""we love coming here""!"
good,Starbucks is a great entry level job for anyone who loves the customer service industry. They focus on each employee and offer many ways for you to advance and gain more experience in different roles.
good,Loved working here. My last manager made me feel belittle so I left and never came back to work. I loved meeting new people making different drinks. Loved the challenges of the new drinks that where presented in the seasons
good,If you're quick on your feet and pick up on things fast you'll fall into a comfortable pattern quickly. The good thing about Starbuck's is that day to day you have to adapt to any changes or any issues that arise.
good,a really great company that cares about providing for it's employees. I really needed a job and Starbucks surprised me by being much more than just a paycheck.
good,"Good for a college student or someone who needs flexibility. Friendly work environment. Dress code is not strict. You are able to have tattoos, colored hair and other accessories."
good,"Love working for Starbucks. My Original location on Alma School and Elliot was family. Enjoyed being able to pick up extra hours at other locations and seeing how they run their location. Made great connections with customers. Taught me how to multitask in making beverages while connecting with the customers. Fast past environment, full of fun and laughter. The company provides top benefits and they truly look out for their employees. Loved working for Starbucks and I recommend it to everyone."
good,"Great job for students, or anyone in a transition period! Awesome for developing customer service experience and patience! It was so awesome getting to meet new people and learn about different backgrounds! It is a highly fast pace job, so you need to be quick on your feet and you definitely cannot be afraid of moving quickly and messily. "
good,Loved the culture at Starbucks.  My work-life balance was the best it's ever been. The morning schedule and benefits were definitely great. Down side was the starting wage was not great.
good,"I learned how to collaborate with co-workers to achieve commons goals, such as low drive through time, and making sure the customer's drinks are crafted to their own liking. "
good,"For a first job out of college, it was fun with a lot of benefits. Fast pace. Breaks every shift. Tip share. Free drinks, and a free pound of coffee beans every week."
good,"I really loved the job, I also loved my wonderful co-workers, I loved our great customers and I absolutely loved the management. I would and have recommended Starbucks to friends and family looking for a great place to work!"
good,"Peak hours can be a bit stressful, but everyone works together to be as efficient as possible. Learned how to multi-task under high volume pressure. The employees made it enjoyable."
good,"Amazing company to work for. They are all about development and they also help you with applying and finishing your education at Arizona State university online. Free education, Great benefits and stock options after a year!"
good,"There is no excuse not to become a better person at Starbucks. They provide all the tools to become great at talking with people, learning great work ethic, and to learn some quality information on a sophisticated drink--thus increasing your social status. All you need is an attitude that is willing to take new information and apply it, not becoming offended at things which should not be taken personally (for example, being angry that people order frappacinnos)."
good,"Starbucks is a great way to start out a career. you get to learn the fundamentals of working and they will teach you the best customer service skills. starbucks is known, not only for their coffee, but for their customer service."
good,Starbucks offers many great benefits to its partners. They are very flexible in hours and days that you aren't able to work. Your co-workers are also almost always willing to cover your shifts for you or trade if needed. Starbucks offers promotions if you want to move up in the company. It is a really fun and fast-paced work environment if that is what you are searching for.
good,"management is not usually permanent, employees come and go often. great job if you can get along with your coworkers, keep a positive influence and spread the energy."
good,"although my time here was not long, I had such an amazing time with my manager. He was really amazing in choosing his team. He managed us well, and definitely showed when it came to cliental."
good,"I have learned how to make starbucks beverages which is nice for making friends. Good employee discount could save a lot on coffee for me as a college students. All the colleagues are at the similar age with me, so there is no stress or gap between our relationship.  I had to leave because I need more money for my living cost. More important, I need a job that is more related with my current major."
good,"Working at starbucks is very stressful because you are constantly bombarded with orders, multiple requests from customers, and daily tasks from management. However, the company offers great discounts, a 401k plan, a possibility of free college classes, and has high expectations for every worker. This maintains a great work place and keeps most everybody responsible."
good,"Work is always fun and I am always excited to go in. The management is fantastic, and my coworkers are amazing.Each day is relaxed, but also fast paced with the perfect balance of work and fun."
good,"We are usually very busy Mondays-Fridays from 7am-9am and Saturdays it is nonstop. We must always come in with the proper dress code, and the hardest part of this job is mainly being on bar alone which means making drinks for cafe, drive thru, uber and mobile orders. We have to make drinks quickly and efficiently."
good,"This is an awesome company to work for! It is such a fun environment and everyday is different. My coworkers were the best and I wish I could afford to work here my whole life. Advancement is hard though and the pay is pretty low for the amount of work required, so a lot of people I know worked two jobs to afford rent. But its such a fun job, I loved it here and wish I could work at starbucks forever."
good,great workplace with fun and nice people and very fast paces environment and I loved going into work all the time because it was a great place to work
good,"Worked here for 7 years. it was one of the best jobs I've had. I loved being a barista, I loved the environment, and the customers. I took advantage of all the benefits like stock and 401k."
good,"Starbucks has so much to offer its employees.  They are dedicated to excellence.  There is definite room to advance, as long as you know the company and work hard."
good,"I love working at Starbucks! Honestly, I might go back. I've worked both morning and evening shifts and they're both good in their own ways. Morning shifts are definitely busier and fast-paced, but it goes by so fast you can barely notice it. Evening shifts are good for the more relaxed crowd; more cleaning duties, but it helps the time go by."
good,"I believe this company to serve its customers, new and loyal ones as the same and provide them with proper hand crafted beverages each time they visit a store."
good,"Working at Starbucks depends majorly on what store you work at-- my typical day at work was fast-paced and stressful, but also fun thanks to the family of coworkers we had. A good manager and coworkers who mesh well can make the store and allows a collaborative success to all of us. "
good,"Amazing partners, amazing supervisors, amazing shop manager!! I fell without stress, and I enjoy my job. They are flexible, breaks are paid and you have 3 free drink during your shift and food 50% off. It's not the job of my life but for now it's perfect. I'm learning english and  new things everyday."
good,the manager at our store is amazing. people you work with can usually make or break the work experience but im thankful that most are nice and very welcoming.
good,Starbucks culture is the best I have seen in corporate companies. They have an amazing corporate office with kitchens that are always filled with coffee.
good,"Starbucks is a company that takes care of you, while you take care of it. The workplace culture is nice, compared to usually retail culture. However, the politics when moving up can be tricky. However, the partners and the benefits are the best parts."
good,My typical day at work was very operation oriented and was easy to grasp. The day provided ample time for relaxed movements in between split duties due to great management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the allocated time to enjoy free drinks and consistent work life balance.
good,"It was a very good experience at Starbucks, I loved working there it was a very positive work environment and the drinks were fun to make! My manager was such a joy to be around and taught me how to perform all the tasks very well. I am hoping that I will have the opportunity to work at Starbucks again and advance in my Barista skills."
good,Starbucks was a really amazing company to work for. The partners were always willing to help and step up. The scheduling could have been handled better but that is manager dependent. Another downside was that turnover rates are huge in this line of work but you get to meet a lot of really amazing people. The skills learned during this job will help me with jobs in the future.
good,"A high intensity job that is flexible and fun enough to make up for it. Also, three free beverages and one food per shift. The dress code is available online via PDF and Starbucks provides hats and aprons."
good,Working under pressure and coordinating the various orders and answering to personalised requests of the customers really was a challenge and I feel I have learnt a lot about customer hospitality. the most enjoyable part would be seeing the satisfaction on the faces of the customers once they received their order right.
good,"I always had a great time at starbucks, I loved most of my co workers and I loved making coffee. It was great to learn about all the different coffee and parings."
good,"Being a part of the team at Starbucks, you'll find a sense of community. The company culture along with usual customers, due to the cafe environment, make it easy to get accustomed to."
good,"Just have fun, get to make noteable and iconic drinks.  Work with great people, meet people from all over the world.  It is a fast paced environment that has a joy of accomplishment when working."
good,When you start working In Starbucks you get to learn de basics like how to make coffee and other thing but is great and fun to work in a team and at the same time know how to manage your self in the company but I recommend it to other people
good,Great opportunity for anyone looking to grow in customer service. A place where you really have to be dependent of each other. Team building is part of the day to day.
good,"I worked at Starbucks over ten years ago.  It was a great job to get introduced to customer service in."
good,I love working for Starbucks. The culture that has been created within the company is second to none. Inspiring and nurturing the human spirit continues to drive the results we see in our stores.
good,It was overall a fun place to work. Location can come with customers that aren’t the best and can make it hard to handle st times but the employees make it worth it.
good,"i love working at Starbucks, it makes you feel welcomed and appreciated. I am glad i had the opportunity to be apart of the wonderful company, don't get me wrong its not all perfect, at time it can get a little stressful but with the support of your coworkers it makes the job worth it."
good,"Management is what makes this company a splendid employer. Two of the store managers that I have worked under have been the kindest, fairest, most hard working people that I have ever had the pleasure of working under. They took great care to be thoroughly invested in their employees. A move across country unfortunately ended my time with one of these managers."
good,Working at Starbucks was stressful but worth it to be able to work with the amazing men and women at my store and to be able to help so many people and brighten up their day.
good,Very fast paced at Hawaiian airlines terminal in the morning. It was great. The tourist can be horrible. They get to the airport late and are mad the line is long. So they give alot of attitude. But we did get really good tips.
good,"I was fortunate enough to have a strong team in a fast paced environment. I know that not everyone has that experience but I believe that the people I worked with worked hard, dealt with demanding customers professionally, and enjoyed coffee or tea."
good,"I loved my job here. I worked with Starbucks for 3 years. Uniforms great, training is fully detailed and they won’t leave you with less than full knowledge. Good progression and uniforms comfy."
good,"I spent my last summer working at Starbucks in Barrie, Ontario. I learned various drink recipes and made some great friendships with fellow co-workers. Serving customers daily and building a rapport with them allowed me to learn how to interact with repeat customers. I really enjoyed my time working at Starbucks."
good,"Working for Starbucks was great--my store was my second family. The customers were mostly fantastic and and the workload was reasonable. The hardest part of the job was managing the floor with not enough labor, but it was doable. I leaned how to be a strong leader and a hard worker, and benefitted tremendously from the several manager I got the pleasure of working under."
good,The culture of this company is great and everyone I worked with was amazing. The strength of the being a barista in Rustans Starbucks Coffee is directly dependent on its employees.
good,"a work day is easy and fast-paced, I just increased the skills I already had. The management was very reasonable and easy to talk with about issues. The hardest part was making sure every drink at once when u have a lot of customers. the most enjoyable part was the ppl you work with and the environment."
good,"As a starting platform in Starbucks, it was a great experience overall and also a learning curve being able to step up the career ladder to become a supervisor. "
good,Overall Starbucks is a great place to work. The owner of the company truly cares about the people who work for the company. They offer great pay and benefits. I would recommend this company to anybody. Hours can be long at times but the job requirements are not difficult.
good,"Excelentes prestaciones"
good,"I really like Starbucks and miss my colleges. My colleges are very nice and helpful. And work environment is easy and safe. If possible, I will go back as a part-time position."
good,Loved the company and working with a mix of people from teens to adult. Great benefits. this company cares for their employees and their work to family time
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks.  They have great benefits and pay.  It was easy to make friends at work.   Everyone was so nice to me and it was easy to make work fun.  I unfortunately quit,  because this sort of job was just not for me."
good,"Working at starbucks, was a very fast paced job. There was always something to be done and your expected to do all needed tasks without being asked or told too. Overall, you had to deal with quite a few rude people which I believe was the most unenjoyable part of the job. However, the people you work with at Starbucks are usually very nice people."
good,I enjoy working with all of my partners. All my partners know what it means to act as a team especially during peak in the mornings. I could not say anything but good things about being a Starbucks Barista and I couldn't be happier to be a partner.
good,Fast paced and fun work environment. You meet plenty of new people which give you a chance to network. The benefits definitely make it worth it. I wold highly recommend working here.
good,"This job is not for everyone, but if you like fast paced and a challenge then this is the job for you. I personally like it but it's an hour drive (30 minutes there and 30 back) and with the hours I'm scheduled it doesn't work for me as far as how much money I make versus what I pay in gas."
good,"Fun job, working in a kiosk in a store is a little different than a standalone though so keep that in mind. You usually are held more to the stores rules/code. I know that in the kiosk I worked in followed Safeway dress code, and on paper we were considered Safeway employees. That all being said it's a fun job, you meet a lot of different people and hear a lot of stories. It can also be stressful just for that exact reason"
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I had fun working at Starbucks and it was a good learning experience. I felt like a could use many of my skills on a daily basis.
good,I loved that the company and my manager worked really well around my changing school schedule every semester. It was really helpful knowing that I didn't have to stress about making my work schedule work around the classes I needed.
good,"I worked for a Starbucks under management of Aramark at a University, so my experience was different from a normal corporate Starbucks. Starbuck, overall, as a company is fantastic. Great benefits, pay, flexible hours, free coffee every so often and more. Aramark cut out all benefits and cut pay, but Starbucks alone is fantastic. Working at a University Starbucks is especially easy because college students are so casual."
good,"typical days are fast paced with little time to back off, but your team of baristas are there to help make it smooth. I completely recommend this job to any high school or college student!"
good,"hardest part of the job is the early morning or the late hours. "
good,"Starbucks can be a chaotic and busy environment. What makes it worth it are the benefits and leaders. There will be times management screws up major things, but the great ones will always bounce back and make the store a healthy environment. If you have a bad experience working at starbucks, it usually goes back to the store or district manager."
good,You need to be good at multitasking in this work place. You can move up in the ranks pretty quickly at starbucks. Customers are friendly and emploees were very nice.
good,I love the company. This job provides good quality experience. The only thing I could complain was the difficulty to advance to higher positions. I loved the coworkers and the customer were amazing.
good,Great as a starter job. Company had great behind the scenes care of employees. Discounts are provided and they also over a paid college tuition up to a bachelors!
good,"Working at Starbucks was enjoyable. I met great people, both other fellow partners and customers. Starbucks offers great benefits to their partners. It is definitely a great job, especially if you like the morning rush and seeing the everyday familiar faces."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. Starbucks has a wonderful benefits package available to all of its partners. Starbucks lives it’s mussion and values daily though every partner.
good,"Working at Starbucks was overall a very positive experience. The company cares about what it is/does starting from the top down. There is a clear mission and the culture is supportive and positive. The pay could be higher, but the benefits are good and there is room for advancement if you are willing to put in the time and effort."
good,"I love starbucks, with my whole heart. Benefits are amazing, and everyone is so uplifting. I would recommend this job to anyone. This would be the job to make into a career."
good,Be careful of management at certain locations and negative work environments! Teamwork is a necessity to keep things flowing smoothly throughout your shifts.
good,"I always had to start early because my store was understaffed. But overall the people were very friendly and willing to help you learn. They always are very welcoming, and they will be there to always ask questions."
good,Love morning shifts makes the day go by faster  we get swamped during peak from 6-10am but everyone there is such a big help and fast paced. Biggest family you’ll know
good,"I love working at Starbucks, that’s why I’ve been there for four years. I’ve tried to quit three separate times and every time I pull out last minute because I can’t go through with it. I wish I made enough money there to have it as my full time job."
good,Good place to work. Shifts are usually about 4-6 hrs sometimes 8 which are painful. You'll have customers you love and hate but treat them all the same as you are in customer service. I had great store managers and most will work with your schedule if you go to school or have another job.
good,The people make the environment worth it but the company holds values that I align myself with. Great place when the management is being properly held accountable.
good,"Although this was my 1st job, I was able to receive a life long worth of experience And benefits.   They are very good with working around school schedules."
good,"The baristas at 380 and 75 have made it their goal to make customers feel at-home at our store. A typical day at work would start off slow and eventually pick up until we reach peak; the busiest time of day. Usually, you'll find us all running around so it is necessary that any newcomer can quickly adapt and learn to work in a fast-paced environment. We recently had a change in management and now have a new store manager. Other than a couple of new rules everything has been the same. The great management, amazing baristas, and our beloved customers are only a few of many reasons I'm still with the company but sadly, I feel it is time for me to part ways as I want to find a job where there is a possibly for career growth."
good,"Starbucks is highly recommended for developing team members from within. The education in hospital and business management is legendary. "
good,"I enjoy working in Starbucks and dealing with a lot of people who come to the store. Starbucks has an excellent training for all employees in order to give excellent customer service. Co-workers are like an extended family. Hardest part is just in the beginning when you have to learn the different products and coffee flavours, but once you get used to it, it's really so easy to suggest these items to your customers, which I find the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It can be fast paced, but relaxing at the same time. It may have been the coffee aroma but it very calming at times. I worked at the airport, so calm times were rare. The team I worked with were great at training me and teaching me the do's and don't."
good,"Entreprise stimulante avec un grand nombre d'opportunités d'évolution au sein d'un même salon voir même à l'international.  Starbucks nous apprends des notions comme l'esprit d'équipe et la solidarité entre partenaires, qui sont selon moi très importantes dans n'importes quelles entreprises."
good,"Most days were fantastic with the team I worked with. The managers were all very hard workers and treated everyone fairly."
good,"Amazing health benefits, store perks, like free drinks and coffee every week. Store is busy usually and work is hard but fun, learning about coffee, doing tastings and lots of cleaning can be expected but the environment is great, scheduling is flexible and stores are well run."
good,"Starbucks thrives on on the culture of coffee and it’s origins, there are various company employee sponsored charity programs for the community, as a form to give back."
good,It was a great experience. You recieve hands on training and many benefits with a flexible schedule. You there competitions and programs you can join.
good,"•	Created the Starbucks Experience for my customers by providing legendary customer service with prompt service, quality beverages and products, and maintained a clean and comfortable store environment."
good,"The people that you come across on a day to day basis are amazing and treat you wonderful. No discrimination vibe is amazing. Everyone is happy all the time, a very high energy place to work and you work as a team and become a high functioning family."
good,"I started out as a barista. This is my first real job. All the others were part -time and seasonal. I believe I have grown with this store. It's very well organized and the manager supported my growth.The expectations were clearly defined from the very beginning. We knew what was required of us if we wanted to be promoted and the manager was always ready and excited to help us be better at our jobs. He was also receptive to suggestions on how to make Starbucks even more efficient."
good,"Honesty, Starbucks was my first job and I loved it. You meet the most interesting people, constant interaction is nice, and you are able to learn the experience coffee in new ways."
good,It's a great place to work at and I will still be working at Starbucks. I got school and bills to pay so I just looking for a second job. Want to build up a savings.
good,"Miss it loved it, great environment over all, would go back if I could with out a doubt. Tip Tuesday, fun people, just a family over all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,It is a chill place to work at. The people are fun to talk to and learning about how to make coffee is always very interesting. The management could do better with working with your schedule but that is dependent on the store manager. Or maybe HR to hire the adequate staff to ensure leniency with workers schedules.
good,"Amazing environment, with wonderful people. The job is hard, but also really rewarding, and makes the time fly. There is a lot expected of you, so if you don't want to work hard, DO NOT apply here. I learned a lot about the customer service industry and a lot about the coffee culture. The people at Starbucks are super accepting and nice.The hardest part of the job is working in stressful situations, and trying to accomplish what you need to at the same time. It is a super fun job, and you are treated very well as a partner."
good,Starbucks es una empresa que te da la posibilidad de demostrar lo que queres crecer y te da muchas posibilidades de ascensos
good,"Overall I loved Starbucks I love the in and out shifts. The day always went by fast because we were always busy, I wouldn't mind working there again I just needed more hours. I can say one thing about Starbucks you have to be a fast learning overall."
good,"Amazing place to work while in school, it was very flexible. I was able to take time off as needed when I had to. Seasonal was a learning experience that I wont forget. I would recommend Starbucks to others."
good,Starbucks was one of the best companies anyone can work for. The treat their employees good with all the benefits that come with working for the bucks
good,Very fun and unique job with many opportunities for advancement and a very rewarding working environment. Would recommend roasting for Starbucks to anyone looking for a great career.
good,Great place to work grow your knowledge in business and sales career advancement opportunities great culture and customer service expand in coffee culture
good,Truly loved working at Starbucks! I’ve if my favorite jobs I’ve ever had! Recommend it to many of my friend who were looking for a very flexible and beneficial schedule.
good,"It is a fast paced job but it is tons of fun to work at! You get to learn a lot about coffee and where they get it from, how it’s harvested and how to make it in a bunch of different ways!"
good,"I love the people I work with so much, they so easily become family and I love it. I wish my hours weren't getting cut so harsh because working here has been so amazing."
good,The job is more than coffee. It focuses on creating an experience and building a community that is centered by coffee. Each store invites anyone to sit down and join the community.
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks involved working at the cash register, taking customer orders, assisting customers needs, fulfilling cleanliness guidelines and procedures. Although my manager is no longer at my previous store, he was one of the most supportive managers I have ever had! The most enjoyable part of the job was the team of partners I worked with."
good,"Muy gran empresa , excelente campo laboral una de las mejores experiencias"
good,"It was one of the nicest place to work. With all the staff perks (free drinks, free coffee bag every week and the help for tuition) and the acceptance in the team."
good,"Starbucks benefits, communications, career advancement are all great. The job comes with very clear expectations and flexible opportunities. All said, a great place to work if you're down with the corporate work place. To some, those same structures that can feel supportive can feel like restrictive and dehumanizing top-down micro-management."
good,"I always felt connected with my customers and partners, it was a fun place to work and what job that has free coffee do you not look forward to going into in the morning?"
good,I love working at starbucks. It was always something I looked forward to everyday before going to work. It was a fun environment and I hope others enjoy it as much as I do.
good,"While the management talent at Starbucks was always an issue, the work and the culture of the company are both very good.  It will be interesting to see what the Nestle merger does to the brand."
good,the role its self required a lot of  understanding and patients with working in such close proximity of your team mates it can be hard if you are not used to a busy work life its enjoyable and i met some amazing people from this job
good,Ive always loved Starbucks and working there was a great experience as well i live the oringinal daily customers they're spirit lifters!!! I've never had a problem working there.
good,"I love working for Starbucks, there are times I want to go back. The main reason I won't return is the pay is very low. I was working two jobs and school and I was still not able to make some payments due to low income."
good,"Starbucks is usually a busy place to work at. There is always something to do, and it is important to provide good customer service and ensure patrons are pleased with the product they receive. Barista's requests are heard by upper management and often policy is altered to create a more comfortable and functional work environment for everyone. Hard work is rewarded, and it is fairly easy to move up in the company if you apply yourself and show interest in improvement."
good,"-Fast paced, Fun"
good,"The atmosphere and people are great, though fast paced and crazy at times, it is hard to go the day without having some fun. "
good,"Su ambiente laboral es muy acogedor, con ello nos genera sentido de pertenencia hacia la empresa, continuamente da seguimiento al crecimiento de los partnes."
good,It's great for someone that enjoys a fast paced work environment. Hardest part of the job is moving as fast as you need to to serve people in a timely manner or multi-tasking. Easiest part of the job is serving others in a friendly way because most guests are nice.
good,"Great company, harsh treatment of Store Managers from employees and District Managers and higher-ups. Business itself is a very challenging work, but the finial part make sup for it."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. For all coffee lovers coming in every single day ready to get their morning started with some conversation and coffee is truly one of the greatest working environments.
good,fun workplace.it was a great experiences.you will learn a lot from this company and one thing that i love everyday u will meet different persons and become friends
good,"Super flexible hours, Spotify included and great discounts. I had a superb manager and coworkers. Was actually really sad to leave, but it just doesn't pay enough."
good,Loved my time at Starbucks. I was a senior in High School and it was my first taste of corporate structure and SOP (aka repeatable routine in Starbucks).
good,"Starbucks provides and all-inclusive work environment, priding itself on customer relationships and building community. I've learned many valuable marketable skills through this company."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work and especially if you like to connect & talk with customers then this is the right place to apply to, Starbucks has quite a few benefits for full-time & part-time people, you get a 30% discount, get free ""Partner Beverages"" before, during break & after work. Sometimes you may not get as many hours as you want just because it's only really when the business needs people. The great thing is though if you ever need more hours you can pick up shifts at other Starbucks store. So like an other job, every employer/company has it's pros & cons working for them"
good,Working for Starbucks was the best experience I've ever had. I miss it all the time.i was involved in the community and enjoyed that very much. I enjoyed my customers and the people I worked with. It was professional and informative  you always know what products are being released and when.
good,Aside from the many rules that take a while to learn it is a super easy job to get used to. Amazing benefits! They offer amazing deals on everything and cover a lot of costs! Great for young adults trying to go through college.
good,Very comfortable and friendly workplace with lots of growth opportunities as well as benefits. Made many connections with partners at work as well as customers
good,Was an overall decent company despite the hiccups. The company takes very good care of it's employees. I truthfully have nothing negative to say about the company as a whole.
good,very friendly people nice environment 10/10 recommend. very fast paced but the workers make it easy to learn! great management . pay could be higher but then again it is kind of “fast food”
good,We had a close team who worked well together to accomplish the daily tasks.  We would challenge other stores in daily transactions. we'd often win. Employees seamed happy.
good,"I’ve been working at Starbucks for a few months and I’ve been very satisfied with it. Even though the pay is not the best, I enjoy working there. It’s a temporary job that gives me a boost of experience."
good,"la empresa buscar un perfil en particular de personas que buscan sentirse comodas con su trabajo, permite identificarse consigo mismo, facilita la libertad de expresion."
good,"The work/coworkers are enjoyable, fast paced stores are fun to work at and make the time fly by, however, reviews are heavily dependent on management. I've worked at some locations which are run impeccably while others have had a negative work environment due to poor management, but this is the case with every chain. Overall, it's the best corporate company I've worked for and I would definitely work there again. The only thing that wore me out and made me leave is being too heavily relied on but not fairly compensated. I was told by management multiple times that they were intentionally scheduling me as ""the fast/competent one"" so instead of training their other workers adequately to a higher standard, I had to do all of the hard work (taking drive through orders while making drinks and fixing other peoples mistakes and ringing customers up) while other employees would sit around. If I had been fairly compensated for the extra work, I would have stayed. But it's very very demoralizing being told you're doing the work of 3 people but getting paid for the work of 1... while those are 3 people are getting paid the same amount to sit. Other than that, I really liked the job, and the benefits are fantastic."
good,"I love working at Starbucks. I have been a long time partner who has worked in several stores. I can honestly say that Starbucks can do a better job when it comes to selecting Store Managers (SM) and at times some of their District Managers (DM). There is a good amount of good DM, but there is handful who cannot maintain a proffesional relationship with partners and do not live by the company values. Likewise with some SM in the company some do not live up to the companies standards and values they believe in. However, the SM and DM that do, make work enjoyable. They do create in their stores an environment that is contagious and makes work enjoyable to the point that you look forward going to work."
good,"I worked for the company for over 10 years and had 5 store managers, only my last one was poor, otherwise I highly recommend diving in. You don't have to be a coffee drinker, but it helps."
good,aprendi grandes cosas ya que era untrabajo divertido y conoses a mucha jente buena
good,San Francisco Starbucks are everything that the company stands for . Managers can get away with not handling tips for a while and keeping them to themselves. Overall greedy management and stuck up baristas buy a nice job
good,"Passionate people and culture"
good,"My time with this company was amazing. I only left because the courses of Life change and with that being said, careers do too. "
good,It is fast paced and enthralling not for the faint of heart.  It is easy to fall in love with or easy to be annoyed with. You have to love it which isn't hard as the company and most of the customers give you a plethora of reasons to love it
good,Enjoyed working for the company just no room for advancement in the area I moved to. Also my store manager refuses any help when help could be useful. I need a job where I feel I’m growing in!
good,working for Starbucks gives you so many opportunists in the work place and out of work they are a friendly family run company. The management are firm but fair.
good,I love my job and everything i do the hardest part of the day is peak but the most enjoyable is cobbecting with customers through coffee. Starbucks is a great place of connecting.
good,Great benefits! Great flexibility and opportunity to move up in the company. I could have retired from Starbucks and the pay scale over the years was not terrible.
good,Just about everything i did at the job was easy enough to do and ended up having plenty of experience in customer service as well as learning how to work in a group environment with people and make sure that the best experience is had overall not by just the customers but also by the partners that work there.
good,Very good  but bad thing keep on shuffling staff from different branch to another in a very short interval months. Company is good fair enough. Improve career level.
good,loved working for Starbucks it made me into a better manager and gave me the drive to always look to advance in any company I may work for in the future.
good,"Overall a great environment to work in. Fun people, fast paced. The one thing I didn't like was as the years went on it became less about the customers and more about the speed of service."
good,"The employees are kind and easy to get along with, provides knowledge For all of the employees, they follow u.s rule that's why they wear appropriate civilian and apron provided by their company"
good,"working for starbucks has had its ups and downs, however, ive met so many people within my time dedicated to starbucks. The team ive worked with for years has been the best part of working their. secondly the people you meet on a day t o day basis are all worth it. Ive met plenty of regulars id be happy to call my friends, ive even created greater bonds with a few outside of work."
good,everyone is very out going and loving i as just too sick to be able to work . if i could go back i would.i washed dishes made drinks and used the oven to cook customers food
good,"Getting to mix and mingle with different guests from an array of different cultures and backgrounds was amazing and fun. My manager was such a sweetheart, she cared about her employees we were ger family. Our manager was just as hardworking as us she did not just hide under paper work she assisted us in times when lines would be out the door. My coworkers were fun and funny."
good,"Working in Starbucks was such fun and the time goes so fast. You can learn all kind of customer service as you are serving thousand to people every day. One thing is very important to clean you as you go."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to get good hours in when needed but was also flexible when I needed time off. A typical day at work had waves of fast-paced work, but it also had some relaxing time when business was lower."
good,I've learn so much about being a Barista and have learned many skills that will help me on my future career. The experience with customer is one of a kind.
good,"Overall a very fun, caring company to work for. You learn a lot of skills and there are tons of opportunities for advancement and tons of benefits available to full-time and part-time employees."
good,I worked at Starbucks during college and it was a great experience! I learned a lot that can be useful in other positions. Co-workers were great and management stood by employees when needed.
good,"I loved my time at Starbucks, my fellow baristas were so much fun and the schedules we flexible enough for me to work hours that best fit my life. The environment is fast paced but not too overwhelming!"
good,"Everyone that I work with is friendly and considerate. The customers are regulars and I enjoy getting to know each and everyone of them. For as long as I've been here, it's always properly staffed and everyone helps each other out. We are like one big family and I love it!"
good,"Wonderful first job "
good,"I think starbucks is a wonderful place to work, they just do not have many hours to give. They are very friendly, very fast pace. They are wonderful with people. They keep all their employees happy."
good,The company is wonderful! They have good training and the management is very understanding of their employees needs. Hours are nice weather you want part time or full time.
good,The atmosphere was fun and friendly. My manager was very helpful and supportive of promotions within the store. Other staff was easy to get along with.
good,Loved this Job felt like i was working with my family and all though I left i am still great friends with many of my fellow baristas. The tips were great and the schedule was flexible.
good,"Great company to work, friendly, room to grow Greet customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs."
good,"This job has supported me so much. My manager has had patience and grace with me even after multiple not so awesome incidents that I've caused there just out of immaturity. But through this job, I have grown immensely as a person and just in patience with others, I've learned how to work with difficult customers (which life is full of), and I've made good friends with my coworkers, because at Starbucks, the bar is set to a certain standard, not too high, but to a point where you know your coworkers for the most part have your best interests in mind."
good,"During my time with Starbucks I have learned a lot about responsibility and how to work with others as well as working with customers to meet their needs and make Starbucks a special place for them."
good,"Depending on the time of day, but I love my co workers and having the chance to know about people's lives. Our job is to interact with the customers.  More than likely there were some trouble times when it came to who was supervising, but it all depends on who is the supervisor and if they can do their job right. More than likely the day would go by fast."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company overall, treats it employees with amazing respect and giving great quality traits for all employees to learn, they allow you to grow very fast within the company as well."
good,Fast paced work environment that included many tasks that needed to be done in a timely manner. Despite the work load it was an enjoyable experience getting to meet friendly customers with awesome coworkers.
good,"Always busy, but fun environment. Have to be willing to work hard and fast especially if you have a busy store. Good discounts and opportunities to move up if desired."
good,"I had a good time working at Starbucks. It was a busy environment where I got to meet lots of nice people, work colleagues, and costumers. We often had to work as a team to make the day to run smoothly in busy hours. "
good,"A day at work started out with opening up the store, overseeing foodsafe requirements, ordering supplies, on the floor managing shift breaks, handling customer complaints. I learned how to manage a team of staff, be a good manager staff can look up too. I learned how to effectively take on responsibility of a superior and all the tasks and ups and downs that came with being a good manager. "
good,Managers were very personable and were easy to discuss things with. Co-workers were friendly and if an individual was unsure how to make something they would assist. There was no drama as we all discussed everything outwardly.
good,"Starbucks is never boring and always giving opportunities to learn new things. It is a retail/food service business so hours can vary, but committed hard-working employees get the hours the need, tips weekly, and discounts well worth the hard work."
good,"Amazing Company and fun to be with workmates. We have health benefits including our families. Bonuses were given in monthly basis, salary is always on time. (Day before the said date)."

good,"The job is very fast-paced, but everyone I worked with was nice. They were very good about request offs and worked well with my availability. Discounts and markouts."

good,Would always be willing to come back and join the Starbucks team anywhere!! I love that’s evryday I get to get up and learn new things as well as get out and meet new people!!!
good,I would definitely work at Starbucks again. I would want a higher pay now that I have worked in a commission based job. Which is very competitive. I loved how secure I felt in my job at Starbucks. I also loved how I had the choice to relocate wherever was available for me.
good,"Los valores Starbucks que te influye la empresa te hacen sentir apreciado y querido por la empresa."

good,"A typical day at Starbucks usually involves fast-paced, high-stress environments where I led a team of 6-8 people to provide high quality service and tasty food and beverages in a timely manner. Starbucks focuses on partner development and has helped me develop better relations with partners and gusts. My favorite part of the job is the diversity that the team and store has and bringing all kinds of backgrounds and experiences to the table."
good,"Being a barista in Manhattan is a tough thing to do. You have to be able to handle adversity and handling 100+ people in a span of 30 minutes. The help of my coworkers eased the tasks for me, however learning how to manage your time was key to getting through a shift."
good,"It was so fun, so relaxed. Beyond awesome management! Very family like! The hours are a little hard to get used to on first shift. I started at 4:45a."
good,Starbucks is a great company. I was homeless when I started working. The pay wasn't great but your advancement potential is great. It all up to you and your  work ethic.
good,Expectation of what you are capable of doing is very high. Has a good structure but if anything goes wrong and one person is late it makes labor very tight
good,"The environment is really positive and I am very lucky to have had such a great team. Making connections with customers the best part of my day, simply making someone smile helps me to get through my shift and make more people smile. The benefits are great, the hours are flexible and reliable. Highly recommend as a first job, helps you develop critical work ethic, customer service, and multitasking skills."
good,"I enjoyed working there through high school, very good first job and would continue working. The environment was fun and fast paced and the coworkers were a joy to work with."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Benefits are offered to even part time employees. I truly enjoy the work. The hardest part of the job would be managing a team with a turnover rate of almost 100%. With a turnover rate so high, it was difficult to accomplish our goals every single day and keep my sanity. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the employees who stayed and getting to know them and build lasting relationships. The second most enjoyable part was making customers happy and building relationships with them as well."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work! I love the atmosphere, the people, and the team work attitude. It has been by far my favorite place to work so far."

good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for.  I love being able to connect with our customers on a daily basis. My day begins at 4am where I get the store ready for the day. I need to count the cash drawers and prepare the daily roster. I help everything run smoothly. I also put the daily order away along with ordering for the next day."
good,"Great place for any first time job, college student scheduling, advancement in career growth. For the most part, this company really does care about their employees. ""Love What You Do, Share It With Others"" is such a great company motto to have and live by. Generally speaking, most stores staff some pretty great partners."
good,I loved working for Starbucks because they made you feel like part of the team. Partners were all delegated into positions that all helped the store run like a smooth machine. The discounts and perks were amazing as well.
good,Great place to work. Good company and culture you become very close to everyone you work with; your coworkers become family. Management was very easy going and supportive.
good,"At the location I worked at was almost very hectic almost everyday, which was a challenge for me when I barley started working there. Working at a hectic location really challenged my potential and it has really helped me become an effective and hard working individual."
good,"Working on the floor with your partners for about 6 hours each day.  Last two hours spent completing ""actual"" managerial functions such as writing schedules, interviewing, analyzing your business, planning, preparing, coaching and developing your team, etc.  "
good,"My workdays started early in the morning. It was great to open the Store by myself. They trusted me. I learned a lot about hygiene and communication. My Management was great. We do a lot of Team Stuff and Coffee tastings. If we got a Problem, we always can count on our Boss. The hardest part of the Job, were the long line from people or sometimes the unfriendly people in the morning. But at least the Job makes a lot of Fun and the Coffee tasting every Month were the best part of it."
good,the job is a good job and is worth going to you get busy and need to pick up the pace but other then that management is really well and its relaxed and its a really good job you can advanced in the company.
good,"Starbucks was my favorite company to work for. The since of community and feeling like the company actually cared about your well-being, was refreshing. I recommend to anyone to work for Starbucks, you will learn a lot about the benefits of working as a team, and also learn the true meaning of customer service."
good,"During my time at starbucks I acquired and put to use many important skills, including proper customer service, proper barista techniques, and the developement of an overall well-rounded people oriented personality."
good,i absolutely loved working here. It is very fast paced and at times can be very overwhelming if not trained properly. I went in not loving coffee at all and now I am absolutely obsessed. I can thank Starbucks for that!
good,I love all of my partners with Starbucks and my manager is thoughtful and extremely hard working towards making sure all of the customers and other partners are happy! I love working for Starbucks as a company!
good,"It was my first job. I loved it, my manager made me feel comfortable and it was not very difficult to get the hang of. Although it is a fast-paced, high-stress environment, I've found that in these situations I work the best."
good,"A typical day in the life of a barista; drinks, cash, all smiles a little cleaning here, great bonding there, a healthy happy work environment even on bad days."
good,"Super fast paced. You need to get used to seeing a lot of people a day. Team work is a must, you can not get through a shift without team work, so you need to get along with your partners. Feels like a big family. Your customers become like your best friends. "
good,Very fun and fast pace also can work your way up to managing others and become a coffee master also have fun winning contest against other stores by up selling
good,"Besides the low pay, everything else about working at Starbucks is wonderful. If I had the time, I would work there part time still."

good,"Good mission statement, that the company actually seems to uphold. Great training. Great for advancement, get management training/experience on your resume!"
good,They offer great opportunities and you will love working here. it makes it way more better if you have great co workers and people willing to teach you. Starbucks is a company where they work with your school schedule and have great opportunities.
good,"Mi experiencia en Starbucks fue de puro aprendizaje, tanto laboral como personal. Mis supervisores y jefes hacían más de lo esperado, alentando siempre la participación de todo el equipo no solo en actividades y promociones durante la jornada. La empresa ofrece foramción continua a sus empleados, opcional, y dirigido a quienes desean escalar a puestos ejecutivos."
good,Great place to work as a part time job but at the end of the day its a job in the food industry which means ok pay and more work for which you get paid.
good,This job is flexible and is willing to work with your schedule. The salary is definitely not enough to live on your own. I was a opener which means I will start at 4am and prepare the store with fresh coffee and stock items as needed. Every day you will be required to place pastries in the front. I mostly worked drive thru which will get hectic around 6am every day.
good,"Starbucks was great while I was in school. They have really flexible hours and my manager was very understanding.  While the work day is very busy, your coworkers collaborate to make sure that it is not too taxing."
good,"My experience with Starbucks was nothing but positive. If it paid better, I would work there forever. I was surrounded by a lot of positive individuals who worked hard and knew how to have fun. I would highly recommend working for Starbucks to anyone."
good,Flexible working hours and great benefits really helped me during my time in college. It was a great opportunity to network as well as having access to coffee for studying.
good,"I highly enjoyed my time with Starbucks and would be happy to return. The store I was hired at had gone through a number of managers in my short time there, most were extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. The management was willing to help you take the steps needed in helping you grow with-in the company, such as becoming a coffee master."
good,Same as above. Very good company to work for. Great learning experience and allowed you to be Uber creative. Any thing you thought you wanted to make you can and allow it to be samples give others ideas or expand their orders. Very good environment.
good,I would come in change the registers and I would make the back ups for the day then I would get on the line and help co workers . I processed invoices and placed food orders and helped with inventory.
good,"At Starbucks we had to have great customer service skills. It was a great work environment. The hardest part of the job was when the rushes came through, we had to keep up with the time goals. Management was great."
good,fast paced always busy co-workers are great usually sometimes the customers can be a pain but that comes with any customer service job. I loved making the drinks
good,"Responsible for all ordering and inventory log entry via"
good,"Una gran empresa, con valores humanos y rica en cultura empresarial , es un gusto trabajar para Starbucks."
good,Starbucks is constantly trying to better itself and create a atmosphere that feels like home to people. I learned the value of teamwork and also how to view customers as more than a transaction and really connect with the person in front of me.
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The Partners actually become like one big family that lean on each other to get the job done and have fun while doing it.
good,Great work environment! loooooved working for starbucks! I only left because the pay wasnt enough! I would highly recommend working here to anyone i know!
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I loved the atmosphere and getting to greet customers, especially regulars. And getting to know them over time. I found they were very flexible with shifts., and were able to meet most of my needs!"
good,Friendly atmosphere with great benefits. It is a fast pace work environment which for me was a good thing because I always had a task to do. Being a Barista was so much fun and I loved experimenting with different drink combinations.
good,Its very fast paste and love that the tourist always appreciates the Aloha. Not just a cup of coffee theres more to it. Great connections as always...
good,The connection with the customers are great and the partners do well with the connections. They work around your schedule and are very opened about it.
good,You will love it or hate it but it doesn't hurt to try! It has its tough times. Overall you meet a lot of people and have a chance to advance your self as well as your education
good,"Working at Starbucks has been great. You make friends and have fun but have to get used to the face paced nature. Management is hit or miss at each location, but the benefits make it worth it. I gaunt that in Texas the pay was competitive for the area, but here in California most stores are paying near minimum wage which did not suffice and led to me leaving the company."
good,"Kinda of stressful at times, but with good and strong team support for a typical obstacles to overcome. Hard work has to be a given at times to have cleanest in the store, maintain proper maintenance for equipment for a fully function store with a manager with a good mindset on making the store work efficiently. But benefits are good especially if ones going to school full or part time. Customer connection and team work connection are both have a good outcome in the future."
good,"Tata Starbucks believes in giving equal opportunity to all individual. The work culture is pretty much soothing which makes you feel a part of it immediately. The standard of operation is high as the company believes in giving the best to its customers. It was a great learning with this company as it helped me develop my customer management skills, team work enhancement and other managerial aspects. Truly I can say that Tata Starbucks  was like a second home."
good,"its pay is decent and has benefits; online college classes, dental, 401k and stock plus flexible hours and cool co workers most the time. management is also pretty chill, overall I enjoyed working at starbucks and would work there again being a student."
good,"Working at Starbucks as a Barista is a very enjoyable job. It is a place where people do not only come for the coffee, but also for the exceptional service that the baristas deliver to each and every customer. A typical day at work looks like a team working together to achieve daily goals and expectations, some days are busier than others. Managment is very understanding, kind, and continue to deliver a comfortable work setting for employees and customers. Starbucks workplace culture is very focused on making the best experience for everyone, it is a place where everyone should feel like they fit, even when they do not frequent at Starbucks. The hardest part of the job is usually only an issue on busy days when we have tasks that need to be done while we still try to achieve customer connections. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who share the same love for coffee and are able to deliver that to all coffee lovers. Making customer connections and meeting new people is what I love about my job."
good,"You are allowed to be yourself and expressive. They offer great benefits and it's generally a great fun place to work! Never a dull moment, fast paced and enjoyable"
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, my shifts sups were awesome. I learned so much and became a coffee master. You have to prove yourself but it was worth it. Best job I ever had."
good,"For a major corporation, Starbucks does a great job of taking care of its employees. While I do wish the pay was higher, the benefits- including free education through ASU- are great, the people are caring, and the company actually cares. 10/10."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks and wished I could have stayed longer, though I would not suggest it for anyone who does not handle stress well. It can be very fast pace but not unmanageable."
good,"It’s a good company to work for especially if you’re a student  or a person in a situation where you need to have a flexible work schedule, like if you’re a single parent"
good,Amazing environment to pickup new social skills and conversation farmers. Had the amazing opportunity to work with a fantastic team of individuals all so inspired to work hard and be honest.
good,"I was able to be part of the leading design team that foresees the future of Starbucks."
good,"Overall great place to work. Has the usual cons of the service industry but with more benefits! They will pay for school, and you get all the coffee you need to make it through."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the company culture and fellow co workers. It definitely improved my ability to work under pressure because of the large amount of customers that frequent Starbucks. It also improved my customer service skills.
good,Fun place to work! Easy advancement. Fast pace. You will need to learn a lot of drinks. Cook times on certain foods. It is a very fun place to work! Highly recommend
good,"Starbucks hands down has some of the best benefits for any corporation.  Free college tuition through Arizona State University online. Medical, dental, vision, life, and accident insurance that is heavily subsidized by the company. For the most part, the work-life balance is amazing. Be prepared for long days, not enough people on the floor, and ridiculous request from customers if you plan on being a barista."
good,"The job provides the most benefits of any job of its type. Great discounts, good healthcare, and open scheduling. Compared to other retail jobs I worked at, Starbucks genuinely shows compassion for all their employees no matter what pay level they're at."
good,"A day at work is a day where you and your team create genuine moments to remember while working together to create a welcoming environment. Another key component is how Starbucks drives you to be the best you that you can be. They emphasize the importance of individuality in the workplace, where you can be comfortable to be yourself."
good,"It is nice working with others and having that teamwork aspect of the job. Things do; however, get stressful. You need to be able to manage multiple tasks at once while being efficient as well. I will say that working at Starbucks creates great work ethic."
good,"Great flexible work with competitive pay and amazing benefits for ALL employees.  The work environment is fast-pasec and demanding of skills like multitasking, technical and social skills as well as many customer service opportunities.  The benefits keep employees loyal to this company."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a challenge when you first begin on the floor due to the high pressure of having to prepare high-quality drinks for your customers. Ensuring that any customizations are met with their standards and if there is dissatisfaction, you ensure to make the moment right and recreate their drink until they're satisfied. The job is more about the people than it is about the drinks. You always want to welcome customers and ensure they feel as though the place they are stepping into, is another safe place like their own home. From start to finish, baristas engage with their customers to ensure they know you care more about them than the job you are given. Management is always different but they always care for what you have to say and how you feel about the job. It's like having another family while working as well. You become very close to the partners at your store so they become like another family. The hardest part of the job is ensuring every customer feels welcome during rush hours and the most enjoyable is working with the people you care about and seeing the smiles that people have after you've made their drink with care."
good,"Starbucks cultivates a wonderful atmosphere for both customers and employees that allows coming to work to be enjoyable. The food and beverage perks are endless, and almost all your needs are able to be accommodated.  Its only downside is the ridiculously early morning hours, but a great team and even better customers make you forget about that 4 a.m. alarm setting!"
good,Friendly people and never a dull moment. Fast paced in the summer. Team are strong and reliable. Managers are friendly and control the teams well. Overall a great place to work
good,"If you’re looking to advance your skills in a fast paced invironment, Starbucks is your best bet. No other company offers the environment this company does, including stock shares with all employees, retirement plans, flexible school schedules. This company feels really like a family, very accepting of everybody."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for and who offer great incentives for being employed with the company. My management experience working for Starbucks was applicable towards future positions that require that same drive, intelligence, and assertiveness. The work-place culture is very fun and team building."
good,"i love working here!"
good,"I love working at Starbucks but if you like more fast paced, work at a drive through. If you like a more chill workplace, work at a cafe store. But I recommend both!"
good,"The manager usually found out each person's strengths and placed you where you can shine. The location I worked at was very diverse, and friendly. Great place to meet people and network, both with coworkers and customers."
good,"Learned how to make drinks and beverages, set up for morning rush, cash register, cleaned. Fast pace position. Slow times were the hardest; thank goodness there wasn't many slow periods during the day. Visiting with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job. You got to know them, their family, their likes and dislikes, etc."
good,"Typically busy as to be expected. Everyone was fun to work with, was supposed to be full time, but had to work on finding some of my own hours calling the surrounding stores to see about more hours. Can definitely get a full 40, but sometimes you have to search yourself for those hours. Only reason I left is because cost of living was going up and I couldn't afford my bills."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for. It's a positive and supportive work environment, great benefits for part and full time, and they genuinely care about their customers."
good,Starbucks has been an absolute pleasure to work for. I truly cannot complain about anything except a minor unfairness with base pay rate spread across certain areas.
good,"At Starbucks it was where I acquired the knowledge and I like to work with different types of coffees, incredible environment through which I passed with possibilities of professional growth"
good,"My opinion about a typical day at work would be either being put up at the cash register in the lobby to take customers orders up there, being put on “bar” (making customers drinks), or being put in the drive through to take customers orders through with a headset and then greeting them at the window."
good,"i enjoyed the responsibility i was handed. coworkers were amazing and i met so many new faces who brightened up my morning! it was a sincere great place to work, and i would recommend working at Starbucks in Fort McMurray any day."
good,"Fun, steady-paced environment.  Starbucks lives by its mission to provide excellent customer service.  The friendships you make along the way (customers & coworkers)  cannot be replaced."
good,"my coworkers and management make it a very warm welcoming environment to work in, even on stressful days I am glad to be apart of the Starbucks family. I have gained useful soft skills such as time-management, multitasking, and more customer service experience."
good,I’ll never forget working there the environment is something you wish for in every work environment you’ve ever encountered as long as management keeps it together that train will flow
good,"Very flexible with your school schedule and the benefits and pay are worth it. I love the experience, they make you feel at home and you don't have to worry about it. Theres some days that you may be stressed but overall you'll have a fun experience."
good,This job prepared me for fast paced environments where team work is highly emphasized and helped me to develop my customer service skills. This job requires you to be on top of things and be able to get along with everyone to ensure the Starbucks goals are met.
good,"i worked my up in the company from a barista to a manager.  the benefits were great and the stock plan and 401k were AWESOME.  i know that each store is different, but i was lucky to work at stores that embodied the mission.  we focused on fun, beverage quality and coffee (of course)."
good,Starbucks paid for my college education. The health benefits are impressive as well. Not to mention you get 1 free food item and 1 free drink per shift.
good,Very good job with great training and promotion opportunities.I loved everyone I worked with and the benefits were good. Schedules are really flexible and great for college kids.
good,Great Job for nursing students to teach customer service skills. Also teaches time management when working in this quick paced environment. should definitely look into this.
good,I loved working here. By far my favorite job held. Only thing was pay isn’t great. If I made more or was promoted like promised i would go back in a heartbeat.
good,The management is very supportive and there is opportunity to grow within the company quickly. It was nice getting to personally know customers and establishing relationships with them- it made the work more meaningful.
good,"Customer service is hard but if you can make it at Starbucks, then you can make it in any high paced, demanding job. It was the foundation for my career."
good,Great pay and benefits. I really enjoyed working for this company. I do say the management is not exactly great. Managers take advantage of their position.
good,"I would work for about 5 to 7 hours, and take orders from people, and give them drinks. The hardest part of the job was working alone, but the regulars were nice"
good,"An overall great company to work for. You are taken care of as an employee, and are consistently shown by the company that they want you to be happy. Happy employees = lower turnover rate. The benefits are great, although I did not graduate through  ASU I did take advantage of their college reimbursement program for a year. They also offer dental, and health insurance plans, 401k, stocks, aside from your weekly mark out of a pound of coffee or tea, daily free drinks during your shifts and a free food item. I have worked at 3 different stores in 2 different states and have loved every single one so far. The managers are really there to work with you and around your schedule and the baristas make working in a fast paced environment enjoyable and fun."
good,"Overall, it's a pretty nice job. I was tasked with making drinks and stocking items. The manager is relativly nice, but getting good hours is pretty difficult there. You have to have a goofy side to fit in with the other workers."
good,"Stores will be different each one, but once you find the one that suits you amazing. The manager will also be different but they usually treat you with respect. Great company."
good,Starbucks is one of the best jobs I ever had the coworkers where great you got to know the customers by name and the drink they brought the music was wonderful star bucks Tought me good customer serves.I felt like as we where one big Family
good,"This is a booming business. No matter which Starbucks you go to, it has turned from the quick go-to sit-in coffeehouse, to a major player in the fast-food industry. Everything and anything can happen at a Starbucks. Businessmen and woman having meetings, students studying, and quick ""get-togethers"" with friends. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. The schedule was very flexible in terms of picking up or switching shifts. "
good,But the job itself is stressful. It’s pretty easy and basic common sense. You have to be fast in order to perform your best in a high paced environment. Customers can be some of the best people you’ve ever met or some of the worst
good,"A typical day at work includes working as part of a fast-paced, high energy, team. Building the perfect beverage is only 1 aspect of this job. You are able to develop your professional skills, interpersonal skills, as well as communication skills. You always have the opportunity to develop further and advance your career if you have the ambition to do so. The company cares about their employees and provides great benefits and fair wages. The hardest part of the job as a store manager is balancing your work and life. The job is demanding as well as rewarding. You'll be more successful the more work you put in, so the more hours you work, the better your store does, which means the more money you make. Learning to balance this with a personal life is sometimes difficult."
good,I loved working there and everything about it. Unfortunately the salary was not the greatest. But the staff and environment were amazing. I loved working there.
good,"A lot of fun to work, was part of a high population store so the time went by quickly. Loved everyone I worked with.Would go back if I ever had a chance."
good,"Great Company to work for, very flexible, multitasking skills and management skills is what was learned. Workplace culture is excellent. No hard part about job"
good,"felt working with Starbucks was a fantastic work experience to help develop my customer service skills and understanding of how many changes a company can constantly go through. My adaptability has increased and my patience with others, and myself has also grown. The most difficult situation of the job was management and getting shifts covered."
good,"When it comes to first jobs, Starbucks gives you everything you need to transition to the workplace. How much you want to stay there is up to you. You can stay for promotion, or leave as a barista."
good,typical day at work is a fast paced friendly work place. I learned how to be fast and organized and management would have new drinks daily for us to experiment making before actually advertising them. workplace is a friendly energetic work place. hardest part of the job was actually nothing at all everything is hands on and easy work for me. The most enjoyable part was my customers.
good,"This was my first job, it was stressful and demanding at times but it was a great into to the workforce. Taught me a variety of skills and customer service."
good,"It was a great company to work for but they ask a lot for the pay. You are constantly busy, always being asked to do more tasks, deal with surprise events and sales, make their new crazy 13 step beverage and no added support."
good,Starbucks is the PERFECT job for part time and full time employees! Sincerely one of the most fun and exciting jobs I have personally ever had! The management is great and once hired you can pick up shifts at any store!
good,The work environment was face paced and the people you work with are even better.  There is opportunity to grow and it seemed like companies respected my time at Starbucks
good,"This was a very fun job to work at. The work itself was very fast pace but, it was also very satisfying. The day went by a lot faster when working here."
good,work can be sometimes over whelming but when I see my regulars customers come in a daily basis sometimes 2 to 3 times a day it always makes my day. My co workers are also great.
good,"I love making new drinks and teaching.I love making my customers happy seeing the smile on their faces is what makes my day. We are a family at star bucks and i hate to leave, but i really would love to do work in my field of training."
good,I started out with Starbucks in the pacific north west. I was fortunate to live the Starbucks culture. I also learned a lot from a management perspective working in a company that was very structured.
good,"I enjoyed the job here, although it was mildly stressful.  The pay was nice, the management was phenomenal, and the work environment was fun to be a part of.  A great place to work overall."
good,"Loved my customers, we created a great envirement for everyone. Starbucks offers health, dental, vision insurance not only that but 401k and stock options."
good,"A typical day at work involves providing excellent customer service while maintaining speed and store cleanliness. I have learned a great work ethic while working at Starbucks through great leadership. While the fast paced environment can become stressful, growing connections with customers and coworkers is rewarding."
good,Starbucks was a fun company to work for. The pay rate could've been more for the work that we did but overall  I would work there again part-time. My management team was excellent until we switched over and got a new manager which was horrible. I learned a lot of new things about coffee and coffee machines. I also learned a lot about working with different people and  customers. This was my first real job so it taught me a lot.The most enjoyable part about this job was coming up with your own personal drinks and letting others try it. Another part that I enjoyed were some of my customers who would come in  and keep me entertained and keep me company. You get to know people and what they like and they become your favorites and vice  versa.
good,We work hard but there isn’t too much stress. Shifts can go either way; I’ve had bad and good. Benefits are great! Free drinks while you work and one free food item.
good,This is a great company to work for they offer partners so many great benefits and it is just such a welcoming environment to be apart of and working in. I love how close you become with your fellow partners its such a great experience for both the customers and partners to be apart of.
good,"At work, you typically make drinks, attend to customers, work on the till, and clean/sanitize - a lot. Starbucks has a really good work environment and you can meet a lot of great customers and coworkers. I really enjoy working for starbucks!"
good,"A very fast paced work place. Great work skills , fun people to work around. Heart-filled co workers. Always busy and never non-stop. Skilled and level headed workers."
good,I love my job and what I do.  I am just ready to advance in my career and life.  The most rewarding part of my job is when my employees and my customers are happy.
good,I loved working for this company. During each shift you can free drinks and a free food item. As well as a free bag of coffee each week. As long as you are working an average of 20 hours per week you qualify for health insurance.
good,"Overall Starbucks was an enjoyable place to work. However peak hours are very hectic so you have to be very alert. Multitasking is a must, as is attention to detail."
good,"Customers come in rapidly and you must always be ready to serve, ring up, or mix a drink. The motto is providing legendary service and pleasing customers which is pretty easy. Unlike some places your duty is not to watch the customers, but watch the counter. Occasionally go out on the floor to wipe tables and floors, and the bathroom, but if it gets too bad it goes out of order. Pay is really good and management is so nice. I could always be honest about anything I had going on in my personal life because they were so welcoming when accommodating my schedule."
good,Positive environment while upholding company standards. Many benefits and room to grow within the company. Training was very good and provided confidence within position.
good,Loved my team. The management was fair but understanding. Mornings are busy but everyone worked together and time flew by. Love coffee. Love making drinks and multitasking.
good,"Fast-paced work, flexible hours. I enjoyed getting to know regular customers and working as a team. Benefits are great and good opportunities for promotion."
good,I had a great time working at Starbucks. Its extremely fast paced but you'll get used to it after a couple of weeks. Benefits are awesome they are there to target people who at in school and to excel. The atmosphere was extremely welcoming it couldn't have been better.
good,I was able to advance during my time at Starbucks. I learned management skills which has prepared me for task now in my current position as well as any future position I may hold as a medical billing and coding specialist.
good,"The first time I work here I was so afraid because I really don't k ow how to make coffees. But after 10 days I got certified as barista already."
good,Its a really great place to work! The customers are not always nice so it is important to have patience and be kind. A Starbucks employee must be dedicated and willing to work hard!
good,"Not sure why I am being asked about Starbucks as if I still work there. I left 5 years ago. However, my belief is that Starbucks, by and large, is one of the best places anyone could work."
good,"While it can be stressful at times, it's a great place to work. You get to meet many interesting people. The management team that I was apart of was really great at being a team and working together. We all worked together to create great experiences not only for ourselves but also for the customers we served."
good,"For a temporary job it was a good experience. I got hired inbetween managers, so that was chaotic, but my shift managers kept things running smoothly."
good,"While in school, Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. Like any job, it can get dramatic, but there is a small work area so you have to learn quickly to work together."
good,Every team is different but the individuals I work with are absolutely amazing!!!! they have all gone above and beyond to help me in my personal time of need as well as go above and beyond every day to help each other and make work fun !!!! I would recommend this place of business to anyone and everyone!
good,"Mi evaluación para esta empresa es de 8.5, tiene muy buenos valores para el crecimiento laboral, excelentes prestaciones y sueldos competititivos."
good,"My experience at Starbucks was pleasant I encourage working at Starbucks as it helps you grow as a person and improve customer service skills. Mornings were busy but after 12 it would slow down to a steady pace. Management was good, the store manager cared about employees and took in ideas in how to improve up selling food/drinks. From my previous experience I've noticed Starbucks is very diverse and that is something to appreciate from such a big company.The most enjoyable memories I have from Starbucks would be getting the opportunity to meet new people on a daily basis."
good,"I usually close at my store and we are open late, but due to the fact that we sell coffee, business is usually slow at night. However, when I am working in the morning, it is fast pace and stressful. It is critical that the customers receive their drinks in a timely manner and sometimes it is out of your control to do so. However, Starbucks is a great company with great benefits and they hire great employees which makes a really fun working environment."
good,"Starbucks is a great organization to work for. They work to establish a great team first culture and are very understanding of student partners who need to balance both work and school. "
good,Excellent place to work. The training provided to me was adequate and came easy after a while. The management took interest in making sure I was comfortable with my working environment at all times.
good,you have to be on your feet a lot. it is extremely fast paced. I met some really nice people there. A lot to memorize but you get it after a week. cool for part time
good,"Great place as a starting job for me. Learned a lot of social skills and about myself. Great employee benefits. It has become more corporate with more rules, robotic-like. I recommend it for the younger generation."
good,"Great company with benefits and raises. Very competitive starting salary. 401K, stocks, and paid vacation days and sick days. Very fast paced but everyone is very supportive."
good,Starbucks is by far the best company to work for. It's very organized and the workplace is fast and very friendly. I would recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,"everyone i work with is so positive and it makes work, fun. there are amazing benefits and the whole company is just so empowering and positive, it seriously does not feel like work."
good,"Set up for day, clean, take orders, process orders, run cash registers. I learned to make a mean cup of coffee. The hardest part was standing in a small area on my feet for extended periods of time. There really weren't any hard part...maybe learning to make all of the different types of drinks. The most enjoyable part was greeting and visiting with customers."
good,The only problem I had was that we got a new manager and she felt intimidated by a lot of us because of our knowledge of the job and she told me to shut up in front of customers. She had a habit of not wanting to perform her assigned duties on the floor because she was the manager but held everyone else to a different standard. I resigned I could no longer work under those conditions.
good,"When I first started at Starbucks I was worried because there were a lot of things to learn. Over time you figure it all out by making the drinks over and over. Eventually it becomes easier, but there will be times when you mess up in a big way and it's embarrassing. It ends up being okay and when you finally start to get it down you feel awesome!"
good,The work place was wonderful. I loved working there it was very fast paced and the day went by quickly. there was no drama and the company really had the employees interest at heart.
good,The company overall is great to  work at but the district manager of Baton Rouge is very difficult to work for.  I had almost five years of experience at Starbucks and this district was the first district that made work harder.
good,"Fast paced, supportive working culture that really helps expand your coffee, tea, and food pairing knowledge with pastries and beverages. It's a great starting point for learning how to effective be a part of a team as well as have a supportive environment for turning weaknesses into strengths on and off the floor."
good,It was one of my biggest regrets that I was unable to continue to work at Starbucks.  The company takes care of its partners and genuinely cares about their overall success and well-being.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a company called HMS at O'Hare Airport, (Chicago Illinois). A typical day would be me coming to work short staffed as usual, nothing ready for me and my team for the shifts to switch, ( nothing was ever stocked, liked milks , coffee, berries, etc.) and the store would be messy ( where the customers ate, and in the back where we worked) because the manager would let the team leader leave without making sure the team had did their duties. Managers had favorites and acted like they were scared to speak to the team leaders, and sometimes managers even went to team leaders for advice on how to run situations that happened during the work schedule. The hardest part of the job for me at least was constantly keeping a positive vibe during the most dreadful situations we had to encounter which was almost everyday for example, ( I worked at in actual store in the airport instead of a stand, which in that case already brings more customer attention/attraction and we were in a really busy terminal/concourse) and every other day someone would call off so it would be me and my manager and one other team member because one would be on break, and the line would be so long each customer ordering numerous drinks, pastries, and sandwiches I would have to retrieve everything the customers asked for besides drinks because their would be only one barista making 4+ drinks at a time to keep up with the fast paced environment, but those were the circumstances we delt with on a regular basis. This not only happened at my store, but all across HMS Starbucks throughout the airport,"
good,i really enjoyed working in Starbucks because it fit my fast paste lifestyle especially in NYC.  they are flexible with your schedule if your in school or other job.
good,It was a great opportunity for me that I worked for Starbucks  because I learned a lot of things that helps my personal growth. Starbucks is a happy place to work with.
good,Good management great workplace strong teams and coworkers great customers fast-paced exciting all the tools and resources you need in order to learn a great deal about the products and the company as a whole and provide that knowledge the customers and other partners
good,"Typically Starbucks is a very busy business and during peak times, it's very fast paced and our goal is to get drinks and food out fast to our customers."
good,"Starbucks in a great quick paced environment to work in. However, I feel as though Baristas could be paid more hourly due to the growth within the company."
good,My team members and I got along really well and I viewed my shifts there as an opportunity to take a break from everything happening in my own life and to just focus on work and relax.
good,I like working here. It is a good job. It teaches great customer service skills. It's fun and has great benefits for all employees. I recommend this job for students.
good,"Great atmosphere for work. The customers become friends as well as your co workers. Truly is a ""third place"" (explained in training there). If you do not mind working different shifts/hours this place should be your top application spot."
good,"Loved the job, great benefits ,friendly environment great hours . I was able to learn and benefit from working for the company taught me to strive for success."
good,I really enjoyed working at starbucks and would go back in a heartbeat. I only had a problem when i moved to new york and the manager there refused to work with my class schedule
good,A typical working day at Starbucks involves fast-paced rush hours that can be very stressful.  But the collaborative attitude and environment that is taught throughout the training process makes it bearable.

good,"Good place to work for a short time for benefits and good people to work for. Manager is nice, flexible, and cares about employees needs and cultivating a positive environment for them and customers."
good,"A typical day at work can be seen as the partners sharing friendly banter, and making plans to hang out outside of the work environment. Partners are friendly to any customer that walks through the door. Starbucks has taught me about patience with difficult situations, as well as the need for speed during busy and hectic peak hours. Management is excellent but has shown to lack communication once or twice. The hardest part of the job is pleasing every customer. Though they may not always be pleased, we compensate with a customer recovery card. Making connections with customers is the most enjoyable part about the job. 'Regulars' who come back to finish conversations, or let us in on the little things in their life is why I continue to work at Starbucks."
good,Great place to work while in school. Very Fast paced and wonderful place to work at. The most enjoyable part about working at starbucks are your regulars who come in just for their cup of coffee.
good,"I have worked for Starbucks on and off since 2006 and i love it! It's a fast-paced, competitive environment that offers a lot of medical benefits and discounts. I would highly recommend this job as a Barista to others."

good,"A great place to work at as a student. Starting pay is great for people who need some money while going to school. Management is great and coworkers are amazing. While there are some rude customers, there are great opportunities to connect with regular customers."
good,"I know the store I work at can't represent every Starbucks, but my boss is dedicated to keeping a team that strives to keep customers happy and works to support one another. It's a high-stress job in which one is constantly moving, but having that support system makes it run smoothly"
good,"Starbucks crews are super sweet, usually sarcastic, and super accepting of everyone. Even if you do happen to come across a store you don't mesh with, there are always options and transferring is an easy, super straight forward process."
good,"This is a great company and it does its best to live up to the company goals of achieving ""results through the lens of humanity"". Lots of amazing partners throughout the company."

good,Starbucks was a really fun place to work. Not only that but I just really loved the coworkers. They really care and they supported me in every way possible.
good,"Over 4 years of experience in Customer Service during different fields, front desk, drive thru and recently as certified in EMR- Emergency Medical Responder. Seeking to learn and grow in getting new experience at your company"
good,"Other than how management transition was handled, I enjoyed my time. The DM was not great, but my team and regulars were wonderful. And also free coffee."
good,So many benefits to working at Starbucks & such great people at my store! I’ve learned so much just from the 1/2 year I’ve been working there and have met some amazing people.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I worked there for a summer and since the interview, I felt welcomed. The training was nice. You go through their online training program and sample the different coffees as well. A typical day includes tendering cash, making drinks, heating food, and managing the work area."
good,I enjoy my job. I started as a Barista then Barista Trainer & I am now a shift supervisor... The environment is busy in the mornings of course but that's the best part for me (:
good,por cada 2hr trabajada tenis derecho a una bebida en general starbuck es muy buena empresa
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a great experience. I’ve grew and learn so much as an employee and have met so many great people. Personalizing our customers drink cup and engaging with everyone is my most favorite part of the job. Starbucks pride themselves in customer connection and i love that! Although, we are just making beverages, work can get a little stressful at time, especially when we aren’t ready for a specific holiday or even our day plan. Regardless of what our day looks like we as baristas have great support from our peers and as well as our customers! As I transition into becoming a leader I’ve learn more about myself and work ethic and what I have to offer. Starbucks has done that for me."
good,"Staff is very friendly, organized, and very good at being team players. There is lack of communication from management however, it will get better. My experience overall is great."
good,I think the title sells it all. Starbucks is one of the few corporations that serves its employees and farmers first before itself. Look where their money goes and it'll prove my point. The stores are generally a fun and exciting place to work. If you take the coffee knowledge seriously you can go places. I recommend working here greatly.
good,I enjoyed the cultural and team environment at starbucks. The management was well balanced. I have a degree in psychology and I am looking for something more challenging.
good,"Totally loved working at Starbucks as a barista. I was constantly busy, challenged, and learning new things. I quit because after being promoted to supervisor I was eventually too stressed out, especially for the meager wage I was making. A great company though, overall I loved it."
good,This place was incredibly enjoyable to work at! I learned a lot and met wonderful friends. I felt taken care of by management and never felt taken advantage of.

good,"Great place to work enjoyed making coffee all day and talking with all the regular customers Would recommend working here, it's fast pace and your days go by fast."
good,"I didn't realize just how bad my previous cashier job was until I started working at Starbucks. My previous job was not well-organized, everyone slacked off, and the managers could be straight up unfriendly depending on their mood of the day. Here at Starbucks, you have a great work structure. Everyone knows what their assigned roles are. The managers are well-organized, the environment is friendly and supportive. You get scheduled breaks with your shift. There's really not too much I can complain about. The one thing people might have problems with is the opening shift. My store opens at 4:30am on weekdays, so I'm at work at 4am! Certainly not your typical 9-5 job."
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, com ótimas pessoas."
good,"By far one of the best companies I have ever worked for! The customers become friends and if you're lucky the employees become family. Training tough but if I could do it, you can!"
good,"The environment at Starbucks was really fast pace, but exciting. The management did not expect you to be perfect, but they encouraged us to provide a quality product and quality customer service. This job really taught me how to manage my time and duties."
good,I learned a lot in terms if food and beverage service especially how to make coffee perfectly and familiarized by the terms they used. Its a good job to work if youre a fresh graduate student
good,"Everything is fairly simple to learn. You always get support of your coworkers, team leader, and supervisors regarding pretty much anything from looking someone to cover your shift or just talking about workplace improvements."
good,The most enjoyable part on my job was interacting with the customers. Putting a smile on their faces. Enjoyed all of the products Starbucks offered. Excellent place to work!
good,"The best job I have ever held. Well-run like an oiled machine. Consistent, no matter which corporate store you work in. The best benefits ever. Great networking with customers. Amazing opportunities to advance. It is possible to become a supervisor within one year. And it is possible to become a Store Manager in less than five years. Make sure to find a star employee that made Store Manager and have them guide you. It is possible to make $60,000 or more at some high demanding stores, like a drive-thru."
good,getting to serve customers and making there day was an accomplishment for me each and everyday. this job definitely had its pros and cons but overall Starbucks coffee was an great experience
good,I would say that if you DO NOT LIKE CLEANING and rearranging  things and messy and going back and forth than you should reconsider but we all work as a team to get the work done.
good,"busy, but working to strive for legendary service for our customers, i learned a lot about myself and how to lead a team.  enjoyable part of the job was growing as a human being and learning about the coffee culture and sharing my knowledge while expanded my own and others around me"
good,Fast paced manufacturing environment. Great culture and work environment. Sometimes can be very physical work. Plenty of time to drink coffee and connect with coworkers.
good,"Fast paced work environment with lots of friendly faces! Fellow baristas are quick to help you learn and grow, and management is quick to lend a helping hand anytime. The best part of the job are the customers and the sense of community in the store. Regulars are one of the best parts of the day. The relationships you build with your coworkers and the customers is the best part of the job!"
good,"Typical day required lots of cleaning, smiling and customer interactions. The hardest part of the job would be remembering all the drink recipes, but with time they were grained in your memory."
good,"My time working for Starbucks was fun while also encouraging personal and professional growth in my work. My Shift Leads were incredible, and coming into work was truly an enjoyable experience."
good,it was a great environment to have the opportunity to work in. it was very fast paced and challenging but taught me how to become a better employer. i learned how to connect with customers in a direct manner and expanded my knowledge on crafting beverages. the hardest part is working morning shifts because customers are always in a rush and grumpy so it taught me how to handle difficult altercations at work. the best part of the job is being able to taste each coffee.
good,"I loved working here. It was a fun job that was fast paced and interesting. I am sure things change location to location, but I enjoyed working with my team and would recommend it to anyone."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. It was very fun and exciting to be learning new things everyday. The atmosphere was very relaxed and steady-paced. I would definitely recommend a position at this company to anyone looking for something different, fun and challenging"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work as a contractor.  The teams are extremely open to new contractors, and everyone truly wants every contractor to feel like they are part of the team."
good,I honestly really enjoyed it. I love Starbucks and making the drinks was extreme fun to do. Its really easy to learn how to make drinks and pretty chill.
good,"This was a fun place to work. Great team members. I learn a lot about the food industry. Such as proper food handling, temperature  control, etc. The pace was fast but not overwhelming."
good,"I enjoy working here at Starbucks. Every store is different, that is my favorite part. I do try and get others in the routine of the routine. This is a job I can get paid for."
good,"I would definitely recommend Starbucks for anyone looking for a part time job out of high school or looking for a career that actually lets you move up the ladder. Very fast paced environment, and never a dull day at work."

good,They’re a great company to work that actually care about you as a person it feel like a family more then a Work place . Great benefits flexible work schedules.
good,"El ambiente laboral en Starbucks es excelente, los supervisores y gerentes motivan constantemente a los empleados"
good,"It’s a great company to work for, amazing staff, benefits, and college program. My only issue is my manager was scheduling me 20 or less hours a week and I needed something full time."
good,Taught me everything I needed to know about working with customers. Perfect for a first job or career. The company seems to be doing great 5 years later
good,"I enjoyed my job as a Barista and loved meeting new people. Around holidays it does get very busy as usual and can be mentally and physically exhausting. Overall, I loved working at Starbucks. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"They expect a lot out of us, and they don't meet partners needs when it comes to providing payment. They do give free spotify premium, stock options, and various other benefits but still, $9 an hour for what they ask is absurd."
good,"I was employed at Starbucks just a few weeks after leaving high school, a very strange time of my life and the beginning of my gap year. I was welcomed with open arms into the Starbucks family from day one. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Starbucks and was devastated to leave when the time came to moving away. I was treated with complete and utter respect during my time by all members of staff there was never a day I had wished I didn't have to attend work. Long shifts always went by a breeze in this place so full of fun and laughter."
good,"I typically worked as a night shift supervisor so it was less chaotic but it was still a fun, upbeat place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the manager. It was always a fun day at work regardless of how busy it gets. The hardest part, however, was when it was chaotic and it was short staffed that day, it can be very stressful, but you just have to remember to do your best and don't let the customers have a bad experience."
good,I learned quickly how to make all the drinks with the help of my manager and other team members. There were lots of young people working there so I made friends and had fun on shift. The typical day at work was quite busy but that was great for me to learn. The hardest part of the job was the cleaning but my favourite part of the job was making drinks and the customer service side of it.
good,Starbucks was and still is a great place to work at. They are very helpful on students as well as far as having a program to help you pay for your 4 year of college.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for especially when you get to know the people. Its a great place to learn how to adapt and overcome and become a better worker. You have to be a quick learner because there are no breaks when it comes to making drinks sometimes its an on going thing. Unfortunately the pay was not cutting it for me, kind of seemed no matter how much I worked it was just not enough, not to mention overtime is not offered if anything your hours get cut if they have to just to meet the labor quota"
good,"I really had a great time working in Starbucks. It is actually my very first job in when I first came to London to study. The Manager and the crew are very helpful to me though I really have a huge adjustment in the beginning. Though there are lost of things to learn and different codes to remember, they never give up on me to learn what I have to learn and succeed in the different task that they appointed on me. Starbucks has a very conducive environment and such a great place to learn especially from a neo fight like myself. I will never forget my experience in Starbucks and very proud that I am used to be a part of there company."
good,"a fun place to work, not much for advancing. you can become a shift easily. There are limited spots for management, you can not manage the  store you worked in. You have to go to another store. So you may have to relocate if you want to go higher in the company. however, free stocks, free coffee, free lunches, tips and a pretty good wage for a standard job."
good,"Guides around store help you with everything from cleaning schedules, making products, or procedures. If you have a great team that cooperates effectively then it will go smoothly."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. They care a lot about their employees and about customer service. The team I worked with were a great group of people and I found that was mirrored in many other Starbucks locations in my area. I would recommend anyone and everyone to apply as it is a great position to have.
good,I loved working at Starbucks and would love the opportunity to work for them again. Loved gaining friendships with each and every one of my customers to better serve their needs. It was a great experience and I love that I still til this day see many of my regulars that still remember me.
good,Best place hands down to work. The energy of the corporation is just pleasant and well rounded. Each partner strives to do their best and meet goals set by the store manager. The number one place where I felt my personal growth as a leader in the company.
good,Get yourself started with a free drink before work. Discount on drinks and food. Free education online now. Customers can be particular. Tips. Drive thru places are busier  and more stressful.
good,"fast paced environment, great benefits, fellow partners and managers are all very nice and care about one another. Corporate often visits to ensure quality performance is being enforced, and always encourage partners to strive for greatness/"
good,Working here was really fun but you have to keep up with how fast paced the work place is. You must be able to multitask and work under pressure. The weekends are always the busiest and can be really stressful and hectic but weekdays are more relaxed where you have time to have a few conversations with guests. Management was caring and always helpful. The hardest park of the job was keeping up with how long the lines get. Sometimes the lines are never ending for a few hours before it calms down. I still enjoyed the job regardless.
good,Its very important to know time management in a fast pace place like Starbucks. its a great company to work for benefits are great. I learned to be able to work with many types of people. we also meet such great customer that we also start to build a relationship with them. I feel like the hardest part of working at starbucks might just be that as being a shift supervisor we may not get paid for all that we may do. but I do love this job I just need a little but more of an income.
good,Amazing place to work. Its usually extremely busy but with an amazing team it made working so easy. the hardest part is not getting overwhelmed with what's going on.
good,"The best part about this job is the relationships you build with the people around you. I appreciated the structure of Starbucks, and what it is built on."
good,it was fast paced but i liked it alot. there was alot of people who would come in and out and i liked being able to make people happy early in the morning with their cup of coffee.
good,It was a quick paced environment but the work place culture was great. During peak times mostly everyone kept their composure and gave great customer service. They also gave sufficient breaks
good,"One thing about Starbucks always Giving a great atmosphere. giving  people great drinks, this is a great customer first business  . Ioved this company"
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks and had a chance to excel as a leader. I loved working with everyone and connecting with customers and management. I had a chance to really focus on standards and constant R&D within the market. Thinking Lean and focusing on managing my time on every task given. Starbucks is focused on reducing the amount of waste. Always tracking how to be efficient and multitasking.
good,The manager was flexible with my schedule and helped me out when I needed time off. Working at Starbucks gave me the opportunity to work on my people skills as well as giving customers the best service possible. I enjoyed working in a fast-paced environment. It was fun to learn all the seasonal drinks.
good,Great place to work for a college student or for an extra job. I can't make this my career. The salary doesn't help me and my family. Pay check to pay check isn't good for a father to provide for his family.
good,Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. They offer a myriad of benefits and opportunities to work in other places. They treat their employees fair and they are a customer oriented job.
good,Very great company to work for.I love working at Starbucks because I feel like they truly care about their partners and customers. They go above and beyond to ensure that their partners are trained properly and their customers are satisfied.
good,Working for Starbucks was amazing. I recieved so much development from my managers and really had the opportunity to learn and grow and a leader. I would be a barista for life if it paid enough!
good,Starbucks is the best place to work part time. They provided me health as well as school benefit. Work can be fast based but never too stressful. People are nice and I happened to have a great understanding manager. I have enjoyed my part time job so far.
good,Great environment. Fast paced. Fun. Great relationships. Great benefits and discounts. Advancement opportunities. Paid college degree. Great finanicial options.
good,"If you are interested in working for a fun, fast place to work that connects you with a large variety of people then Starbucks is the place to be.  There are great benefits not just in the ""perks"" but in the culture and environment.  If you need a flexible work place that works well with school, college or military then Starbucks is the place to be.  The hardest part of the job is not gaining weight from all the different products you have the opportunity to sample.  The workplace culture is young, fresh and fun.  You have mostly unlimited opportunities to advance and promote from within if that is what you want.  The best part for me was all the variety of people, even from different countries that I was able to make connections with while I was with Starbucks."
good,"Loved the job, didn't get along with the management as well as I would have liked to. But overall the job was fun and I enjoyed working there because of free coffee."
good,"Great place to work. Definitely can be stressful when there is 30 drinks in line, but you learn to multitask and keep up. Also, you learn how to work in a group since there is many roles you can partake through out your shift."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Starbucks. The job was fun, fast paced, there was always something to do there. The team always worked together as a team and supported one another in their pursuits. Any time I wanted to advance and learn a new skill my management team was supportive and did everything they could to help. If I hadn't had to relocate to a location where there was no Starbucks I would still be there."
good,"Trabalhando e estudando fora do Brasil, adquiri algumas habilidades e conhecimentos importantes, aprendi a me comunicar bastante e ser proativo. No meu emprego anterior na Fontoveter, aprendi a lidar com publico, organização dos sistemas, resoluções de problemas da empresa e a me comunicar por telefone com grandes doutores, clientes da empresa. "
good,"The benefits of working at Starbucks are great and that's why I stick around.  Although the pay could be higher - as with any other job, Starbucks is unique against the rest.  We are offered full health-care benefits at a part-time level.  We get FULL tuition reimbursement at ASU online.  I completed the first year of my undergraduate degree in Psychology and I would continue if life weren't so demanding.  I can't pay my rent on $9/hr."
good,"Must be trained properly to do well within first weeks, but as you work there everything get easier and less flustered.  Discounts are great. Easy job, very routine, just very busy and sometimes short staffed."
good,Overall a very cool and easy job. Great coworkers and managers who are very flexible when you need an emergency day off. The culinary operation and people skills you earn here are great for next jobs.
good,"I've worked at 2 different locations, and each time have bonded with my coworkers and customers in a way that creates a ""second family"". Great benefits."
good,the job waas GREAT. the customers were the ones who made the day fast paced. i as a barista started off as a cashier and gradually transfered over to creating drinks.
good,"Once you're at work time flies. Keeping busy is not difficult. Customers and employers are always a pleasure. Very satisfied with the pace, a great environment to meet people from around the world."
good,Starbucks looks forward to connecting with customers and providing speciality drinks that are made for a person to enjoy. It is a welcoming environment.
good,overall great company to work with and co-workers are great.. there are always a few who are not team players. discounts are great! just wish it had more hours.
good,"Very encouraging supervisors willing to give their all to make their team a magnificent one.  Very diversified duties with lots of new things to learn weekly,  like making different drinks and training others that come on the team.  Very business oriented environment with great people who become very familiar since we direct all by their name upon ordering.   Truly a genuine place to work and learn."
good,"fue un trabajo muy agradable y adecuado a la vida universitaria, se respetaban los tiempos de cada uno y se lograba trabajar en equipo."
good,"Great place for gaining experience in customer service, while developing friendships with people within your community and expanding on teambuilding skills. Everyone does every job on a rotation within the crew. The company has great benefits, and compensates fairly, especially for current students seeking a higher education."
good,"You get to meet new people, get to know the regular customers it’s extremely enjoyable. As long as you actually do your job it’s a great place! Just make it right for the customers."
good,"I have learnt the importance of pushing oneself to the limit.That nothing is hard and we should be open for change and embrace it and its uniqueness. In a day at work i get to keep good time and work without any supervision and doing my my work effeciently and effectively. The most difficult part of the job is when i am alone at the counter and the line is long, i have to be fast and at the same time deliver excellently to the guests.However i am glad for i have been able to overcome it. I enjoy when i see a happy guest  and doing the right thing at the given time."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. It teaches you how to work well with others as well of getting expereince with many different aspects. Great people for all different backgrounds.
good,"I worked in a wonderful store, we were a close knit team that worked together under fair and cohesive management"

good,"Starting the day with preparing the store setup and coffee brewing, getting reading to help the customers to start their days with a nice cup of coffee."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 11 years and enjoyed most of it. It is a fast-paced job with high expectation. However, it challenges you to improve yourself on the daily. Easy to move up in the company and something that you can make into a career if you want."
good,Starbuck is an amazing company with an awesome job culture. They are sure that employees are compensated and benefits are great. Regular customers are always nice and happy to see you when you have their drink already waiting for them. It is a great place to be if you like to be in a quick paced and process oriented environment.
good,"Working at starbucks has  helped me gain excellent customer service because we prioritize on making a connection with our customer so they always feel welcomed and leave with a smile on their face. We also have to ensure that we get our tasks done as well as make drinks or help customers so we always have to be multitasking throughout a shift. A long as you have a good team, the shifts run easily. The toughest part would have to be picking up the slack of a team member that puts no effort with their tasks."
good,"I wish I didn't have to consider leaving this company. It is fun, upbeat, has amazing core values. You get to connect with customers, and make long lasting relationships with partners and customers. If willing to work hard you can grow a career with Starbucks. If you love coffee and people this is definitely an awesome place to work."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. Management has always been great and supports their employees. The typical day is very fast-paced, but balanced and enjoyable. The speed of the average store definitely teaches you multitasking, sequencing, and how to make the most of your shift. Workplace culture is very upbeat and friendly, and management really leads the team in keeping a very positive vibe. The hardest part is getting accustomed to the sometimes hectic pace, but there is always support from store management and fellow coworkers. The most enjoyable part is the connections you get to build with customers. All in all, I would recommend Starbucks to anyone."
good,Can be stressful but it keeps you moving. great company. I don't get a lot of hours which is my reason for wanting to leave but it is a lot of fun and overall a great job
good,Great company to work for. Once I find the time I'm going to get a part time job again. Personally my manager started out awesome but became an bad manager for personal reason with his family.
good,Often times working for a large corporation can be stressful because of management and compensation issues. With Starbucks this was not the case. There was almost always enough staff available and the culture of the company leads to awesome coworkers.
good,It is a fantastic place to work. Management is very supportive when it comes to scheduling. They have tremendous benefits. The main reason I went to work there was for the benefits. They pay for you to go to college. It is a lot of cleaning but if you just follow directions and listen you shouldn't have any problems.
good,At starbucks the atmosphere can be crazy once you are learning and adjusting to the requirements of making drinks and ensuring a customer's satisfaction. On the flip side it can be tons of fun working with the same people all the time.
good,"Free coffee, fun coworkers, it makes the day go by fast! I genuinely felt that the team cared about each other and everyone was willing to teach you what you don't know. The encouragement to learn how to taste the differences in coffee and learn what you like was one of my favorite things."
good,"Ramada hotel is the one of the best platform for me where i could learn many more skills and well experience as well.about starbucks company non other then one an only one best brand.it can prepare good quality,product all the desire of the customers of hot and cold baverages."

good,Over the past 4 years I was very fortunate to have worked with such an amazing company. Starbucks was a great work force opportunity and has taught me any advanced assets I value in my work ethic.
good,Early morning rush use to be crazy at times but fun and fast pace at times. But all in all the job is great in many aspects such as free food and beverages for your hole shift
good,I enjoyed working for the company and what I liked tho most was the family environment that we had. The proper training is a bonus also. Good management
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. I loved my mananger and who I worked with. I would reccomend Starbucks to anyone looking for a job that has benefits while attending school.
good,"Very calm in the afternoon, but very intense in the mornings. The hardest part of the job is the beginning, learning all the rules and structure. The management is excellent; they genuinely care about you as a person."
good,"Un gran ambiente de trabajo, con una gran firmacion"
good,"I was hired as a stock employee, but when they saw my resume and talked with me more they decided to make a position for me. The only reason for leaving was because I had to move. I would have tried to relocate, but nearest location was an hour away."
good,Love how flexible the hours are and how managers are always willing to work around your availability.  Very fast paced job with many opportunities for advancement!
good,We make and serve drinks to our customer while touching them with their daily lives. I learned about Legendary customer service. Management is great. Workplace is fun. The hardest part of the job is when customers go in to the store at the same time.Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Every Customers.
good,"On a typical day, I do the following"
good,"It gets pretty busy, especially during the holidays, but when properly staffed, everything is great. A lot of times, managers are tight on hours, resulting in a massively understaffed store. This results in lack of good customer service, bottleneck stress in all areas and an overall rushed and anxious experience. My coworkers are what kept a smile on my face, as well as regulars. We get free coffee every shift, as well as free product once a week, for our mark-out. The benefits are incredible, my manger was very flexible with me, when it came to hours. I commute from over 30 miles away, so there was always room for making sure I was comfortable with my work schedule. I learned a lot, being a Starbucks barista, and I wouldn't  say a single bad thing about the company even if I could."
good,It can be fast paced at time but the team behind you is so supportive that you should be fine you get free drinks while you work you get a free food you get one coffee pound of coffee or a box of tea a week and you meet great people its awesome management down
good,"Loved the customer service model that Starbucks has for the customers. I enjoyed working in the environment knowing that as a customer this was truly the desire of the company - to make my experience there special, personalized and enjoyable."
good,"Working in the heart of the Financial District, my SBucks is extremely busy. If you like fast-paced environments and have an easy time talking and connecting to people, This is a great job. Hours can suck though (ex. extremely early morning shifts).  Great benefits and pay and can be very rewarding when you connect with customers. They become your best friends. Has good job advancements too."
good,"You meet the best people: coworkers, regular customers and the occasional wildcard. I had an awesome experience at Starbucks. I worked for three different stores and each was so much fun."
good,"You might be doing similar things each day, but it's never repetitive! Really fun and social vibe, working hours are pretty flexible and there is so much opportunity to move up the ladder."
good,"Starbucks while it doesn't have much room to grow, offers great benefits. The culture and atmosphere are great and welcoming. Some of my best friends I have met working with the company."
good,"A typical day at work can be slightly frustrating but overall I can come into work expecting a fun day with like-minded individuals. I have learned how to be a better team player, because without the team you will drown in this environment. Generally management wants what is best for the team and for each individual. I recommend this job to everyone I can. It's not a big money-maker but my quality of life has increased since being hired somewhere I enjoy to be at."
good,"Its a pleasant place to work at, and partners are very friendly to work with too. "
good,Starbuck goes out of there way to train there new hire exceedingly well. From the beginning I was treated as I was pairing coffee's with wines. They described every coffee thoroughly and educated on such a level that we knew way more than just having a mediocre understanding of coffee and the process of getting it from plant to cup.
good,"Great corporate culture that promotes collaboration, innovation, and challenges the industry norms. Provides a fun and energizing work environment and supports a healthy work/life balance."
good,"Was a good job ."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, especially with the team i was placed with. The position is all about initiative and teamwork which was executed very well! customer interactions helped increase my customer service and communication skills."
good,"I love working for starbucks. My team is so amazing. I have a great manager and I have nothing but positive experiences working here. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old, to apply."
good,"Good times, love coffee, meet people, learn good customer service skills, sales, and be fast at the bar or you won't have much bar time. Have fun, gets stressful but relax."
good,"Great place to make friends. This is the best food service job you will find."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. You get to listen to cool music while working and meeting new people. The environment  was very soothing and relaxed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to dress comfortably;
good,"A great, but fast paced, high volume environment that provides an learning opportunity for multiple recipes and to develop several skills while getting face to face interactions with customers and co-workers.It will take some barista trainees a bit to get the hang of it but ultimately it is an enjoyable experience and the staff typically becomes like family! It makes one proud to wear the green apron."
good,"Starbucks really helped pave the way for me in customer service, and retail. It is one of the best companies to work for, and the culture is great. When I worked for Starbucks I loved the community aspect of the stores. Everyone knew everyone, and it was like a big family."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is running around refilling and stocking the front case. Cleaning the cafe and helping customers. It was a  job with lots of cleaning and customer service. They were also big on educating employees about coffee and tea so we could be a resource to the customer.
good,"I guess take all employer reviews with a grain of salt, because I was asked to submit this survey after applying to other jobs- it’s not uncommon to apply for other jobs when you’re dissatisfied with your employer. I think it’s time for me to try my hand at something new is all, Starbucks truly lives up to it’s amazing reputation for full and part time employees, but it’s MUCH better for full time employees."
good,Great culture would be a great first job for many. Very diverse environment. I learned a lot about time management and how to deal with people. Great place to pick up soft skills for your next opportunity.
good,"At Starbucks you have to be able to multitask well and communicate to your partners and customers adequately. A lot of my friends disclose to me about how much they hate their job but for me I loved every second working at Starbucks. The atmosphere in the store was just as amazing as the customers. The most difficult part of the job was learning, memorizing all the different types of drink as well as recommending a drink to a customer. If I had to describe Starbucks in one word it would be selfless because they want the customer's experience to be memorable and positive."
good,When i worked at Starbucks i would either work the cash register or mainly make numerous different types of coffee drinks. the management was very good. I learned how to communicate and satisfy customers.
good,"Ótimo plano de carreira, ótimos funcionários, treinamento excelentes."
good,"It was good working in Starbucks at wright state university,The staff here is friendly and they will give everything to make newly hired confident.The manager is best"
good,Starbucks is the pecfect job when it comes concil school and part time job. Great work ethic and great coworkers.
good,"mostly enjoyable during the summers when there isn't school in the way. I basically would recommend my Starbucks store to anyone and everyone that needed a job. Clinton, my manager/ store owner, is the best person to be around. HE is very kind and sweet and there is no one like him. Co-workers are okay and fun. I'd definitely work here again after gaining a little more job experience."
good,"Durante o período foi ótimo trabalhar na StarBucks Coffe, peguei uma paixão pelo grão <3"
good,"Great place to practice time management"
good,Starbuck has a very friendly environment to where it feels like you are right at home. You look forward to seeing your usual customers and hearing about their day. Starbucks treats their employees very well.
good,"Starbucks is by far one of the best companies I have experienced when it comes to how they treat employees. Not only do you receive decent wages, but you actually enjoy being a part of the community you work with"
good,Es un trabajo de ambiente divertido y dinámico. Compañeros excelentes. Aprendes a trabajar en equipo.
good,"The company itself takes wonderful care of their employees. Lots of options for career advancement and growth. Current manager is very dedicated and staff is lovely, hardworking, and supportive. no complaints!"
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a wonderful experience and I would recommend them as an employer to anyone.  Though salary isn't very high, the benefits are well worth it."
good,"The team was excellent, management was amazing, customers make your days and even at the early hour of 5 am you still look forward to coming to work each day!"
good,"My time a working for Starbucks corporation was pretty spectacular. I have had the experience of working for Starbucks in California, Oregon, and the state of Hawaii. I can honestly say that in all three locations the atmosphere was the same. I was surrounded by a great team of coworkers, my managers were always supportive and willing to help and answer questions whenever need and the customers truly became family. Overall my experience working with Starbucks was very enjoyable."
good,i loved working at starbucks! everyone was friendly and if there was an issue then it was worked out and they helped me with my family problems and were very supportive when i needed it.
good,"Very fun place to work, very informative, understanding and training is well taught. Great customer service experience. Benefits are a plus, overall enjoyable"
good,"I was a shift manger, who really enjoyed the everyday customer service interaction. Meeting new faces and networking along the way."
good,"It's very exciting place to work. Your working with a team of people who have very different and amusing personalities who also share the same interests as you. Starbucks allows you to bring out a positive side of you that you probably didn't think you had. A typical day at my location is semi-busy. It keeps you on your feet, you don't get bored. This company is the best job I've ever worked for. Working in a diverse community is a bonus, your meeting people from all over the world. It's a great experience."
good,"Working at Starbucks is very fast paced and busy. I love the stability, all of the people i work with and for. Benefits are great. Just ready to move to a career where i can help people reach their health goals and feel better. I want to be the hope in someones life the same way my Community Health Worker has been for me."
good,Enjoyed my role as a shift supervisor there enormously. If it wasn't for me relocating for personal reasons I would have stayed on there longer as there were wonderful carrier prospects there.
good,"Working in a fun, fast-paced environment was awesome. The customers alone made you want to go to work. I absolutely love this job and highly recomend it to everyone."
good,Starbucks is a very fun but busy workplace. Like most jobs it has its busy days and slow days. The manager and workers are great. Hardest part about starbucks is the customers
good,Ótima cafeteria os clientes são maravilhos só precisa melhorar a diretoria da empresa.
good,"Working at Starbucks was life changing. It was my first experience working in such a diverse and accepting environment. I was paid very reasonably and received great benefits. My store location was in a booming and constantly changing state, which made work stress seem unbearable at times, but we always had strong and helpful partners supporting us through."
good,The personnel and clientele were friendly and enjoyable. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. Advancement was available if I had not had to relocate.
good,"Typically a fast paced job, but a laid back and very fun environment to work in. Very upbeat and uplifting work atmosphere. The job provides great training and opportunity for one to enhance their customer service skills."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks it was a great work environment with great pay and benefits as a student. I would recommend working here for all students because its a great work environment and a great way to earn extra cash.
good,"Although Starbucks does not pay very high, and old employees often have similar pay as the new employees, Starbucks offers amazing benefits, as well as many coffee perks. They treat both their staff and their ,customers with outstanding respect. They focus on providing a warm and welcoming place, and throughout the training you're very often reminded of how to be treated, and treat others. It's a very busy and fast paced job, so you must be prepared to work well with  a team. Doing your part of the job is very important. The company wants all partners to befriend one another, which makes the atmosphere very warm. The hardest part of the job is the amount of stress during particular days, which harms others moods, making the workplace a little bit toxic. It's important to leave home problems at the door, and keep a positive vibe about you during the work day."
good,"Great place to work, and very flexible with amazing benefits for someone who is starting out there work life, or going to school. Offers amazing benefits such as medical, dental, vision, stock, 401k, and school through ASU for FREE while working there. GET YOUR DEGREE FOR FREE. Also provided free drinks and lunch during your shifts. Highly recommend to anyone."
good,"Starbucks is not only fun to work at, but it also has a lot of benefits. Between stock, health insurance, and discounts it's worth it to work there. Plus you get a lot of extra experience in sales, customer service, and coffee."
good,"Un dia en el trabajo era para mi, como un dia en familia, en la cual todos nos apoyabamos y nos dabamos la mano; hasta el momento ha sido mi mejor experiencia laboral."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks in Indianapolis I wouldn't of left there but I also worked at a school and couldn't do both.  I worked with a great crew of people. I enjoyed working the drive-thru.
good,"Great people, Great management, Great customers. A very relaxing and rewarding job. Love the environment but its a really good job to get you prepared for more career oriented jobs. Great focus on customer service."
good,"Great company to work for.  The benefits are available, but the cost has just gone up and up, but the salaries have not gone up to match.  More competitive pay is going to be required to maintain the level of talent here."
good,"Customers of Starbucks are nicer, and my coworkers doesn't treat me as coworkers but as a teammate. And my manager is able to accommodate my availability."
good,"Usually fast paced since its located next to a train station. Great customers, some days I'm unable to take breaks just so I can be on the floor. The staff was amazing. I wish they would pay the managers more for all the labor and other managerial tasks that need to be done."
good,"It has given me a great start to my employment career. From the ground up they take care of all of their partners."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for with many benefits that can accommodate a college schedule and promotes growth from within the company but you can also get hired into management.
good,Great place to work with awesome benefits. Room for advancement if you work hard at it. Great people and managers. Can be somewhat stressful but fellow Partners make it the day go by smoother.
good,Great place for fast paced working people. If you're a fast learner then this is the perfect place for you to work at. They have awesome benifits as well.
good,"Top tier retail quick service atmosphere, good training and more skill and practice through time. You will be taught to have a strong work ethic and the same time acquire 'above and beyond' customer service."
good,"I stayed at Starbucks for 10 years because I love the company and I love the work. Employees are well taken care of. Customers are difficult, so it takes a special kind of person to be able to do this job well."
good,"Starbucks is the type of job that will truly test your customer service patience. We get people at their worst and their best before they have their caffeine and you learn to be very patient. I love all of the partners I work with because we are always a team with the same life goals. I have learned patience, how to stay busy during slow times and become efficient during rushes. If anyone ever asks me if they should apply I never hesitate to say yes!"
good,Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno y con compañeros de trabajo muy cordiales.
good,Starbucks is known for many things and being consistent in how it is ran is one of those things. Whether I worked at my typical location or picked up shifts elsewhere I knew what to expect to do and what was expected of me. There is a structure that is followed and overall making coffee is easy and fun to do. The hardest part is the pay if you really need good money. But it is a job I would recommend for any college student.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. There are many benefits offered to all employees and lots of room for advancement. The hours can be really early, but it's honestly a good place to work as long as you have a good manager. The only problem I've ever encountered was a manager who should NOT have been one due to the way she treated employees AND guests, but no one seemed to be able to get rid of her. Other than that this is an extremely welcoming company who strives to care for everyone that comes through their doors."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes, making beverages, heating pastries and communicating with customers from all around the world."
good,"a typical day as a Starbucks barista in nyc, is clocking in and getting straight to work.the manager will either assign you to bar or register. both are non stop. customers continue to come in they must be rung up and their drinks must be made. i learned to move extremely fast because the environment was so fast pace.i learned so many different type of coffee recipes. the environment was nice and friendly , the hardest part of the job was waking up at 3:30 am because our store opened at 5am. The most enjoyable part was getting the opportunity to make hundreds of different types of drinks. its always so exciting."
good,"It's fun and simple, just tiresome and the scheduling can get complicated if you don't let magagment know your schuleding needs right away. Either way it's a good college job."
good,"Working in a large company, with locations around the world, has unique opportunities. Persons from different religions, beliefs, genders, ages, and more all work together to make a customers day much better with a smile and a perfect cup of coffee."
good,This is a very fun place to work. We are all partners and get our job done while making positive interactions with our customers. Fast pace and plenty of opportunity to move up in the company!
good,"Starbucks coffee company is an exceptional company to work for. They offer a work environment that is flexible and rewarding. As partners, you make connections with the customers and they become more than a transaction, they become a part of your morning. A typical day includes a fast paced atmosphere where you provide excellent customer service and work hard to deliver quality beverages. The hardest part of the job is the demanding physical labor by working on your feet all day and lifting heavy boxes. The most rewarding part of working at Starbucks in being more than just a coffee shop. Developing relationships with customers is part of the core values of Starbucks and I am proud to work for them."
good,"Everyday i go in and greet new people, and make a lot of drinks. are manager is loving and caring to her employees. i learned how to make variety of drinks. the hardest part is when you get the mean customers but you just have to keep a smile on. the most enjoyable part is i get to do what i love."
good,"If you are soft hearted or sensitive, this is not the place for you. The Starbucks team is incredible. Always happy and high off life kind of way. Management is incredible and always celebrating your wins. The customers are intense and demanding. But hey you're dealing with people before they have had their coffee."
good,"Starbucks was such a place of individuality and creativity, I absolutely loved it. Learning to make the drinks and learning to run multiple stations was so much fun! They also sit you down to inspect and study different coffees, without the sugar and creamers. t's all a fun experience. Working drive-thru is so much fun, talking through headsets and doing your own little thing is wonderful. Management is usually amazing and do whatever they possibly can to make everything wonderful for the shift leaders and baristas. The hardest part of the job is yes, the customers, but it's usually the hardest part in any customer service job. And yes, the drink making becomes the easiest part! You get real good training and they go at your pace, if you need time with something they give you the time you need. Coworkers are great, some customers are absolutely amazing, this is definitely a wonderful first job."
good,"Management has always been great through my 2 years at Starbucks I have had 2 managers who were both caring and great leaders. Supervisors as well were great always there to guide and get you your breaks at reasonable times. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with angry or mean customers but in the end would always lead to a good learning experience. My stores saying was ""it's just coffee"" in other words or how I took it was you can't please everyone you can try but in the end that's all it is. The most enjoyable parts for me were making customers happy and hearing about it. Just the other day I made a flat white in a for here mug for a customer. His reaction was that my flat white looked perfect, it made my day!"
good,"Es la mejor oportunidad para los chicos que como yo estudian, el ambiente es de verdad emocionante y es como se dice ahí, no es una taza de café lo que entregas si no, una experiencia."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, gran cultura organizacional, abiertos a la innovación."
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company, very partner oriented. Only reason I'm leaving is to have more stable hours, a more flexible dress code and a stress-free environment."
good,"Empresa increíble, hay desarrollo en la parte profesional, buen ambiente laboral y se preocupa por el medio ambiente"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, and I wish I still worked there, my only issue was the location where I worked due to a lot bad managers who didn't stay."
good,"Starbucks is an awesome place to work for because of the great opportunity to move forward in the company. Advancement is key and the benefits while working for the company, like coffee and insurance are amazing. Insurance is offered for people who work part-time. I went to the dentist while I worked at Starbucks. Since, I have not worked for a company who offers the kind of insurance coverage for part-time workers.The Atmosphere at starbucks is light and fun, and at times very busy!!! But that is the Starbucks way of life."
good,It is a fast paced job that requires lots of focus and the learning curve is quite steep when you start. You need to learn lots of drinks and be able to do every job behind the bar efficiently and effectively. You will make lots of mistakes while starting out but after months of working there you will develop the skill set to excel at the job if you put an effort forward.
good,"This was one of my first jobs. It started very early 5am and work nonstop between breaks and end of shift. Everyone was very positive and I enjoyed the level of organization,co workers and management were great. I loved the regulars too!"
good,"Starbucks was by far one of my favorite companies to work for. The company has relatively good salaries and benefits, in comparison to other retail and hospitality companies. But the best parts of the job were the emphasis placed on appreciating the employees and the commitment to improving the global community!"
good,"At starbucks we're always study and made coffee tasting to share our knowledge and passion about coffee, I learned how to make a latte art, to interact to others and it really enhanced myself confidence and also I learned that one of my best asset is my attitude. I've became a partner of the quarter and awarded as a be welcoming for 3 consecutive quarters. I really enjoyed most part of my job."
good,Starbucks overall is a wonderful company to work for. They really care about their employees. It's a great place to work when you want to build customer connections. And a good way to put your memory to the test by having complete product knowledge.
good,Since I've worked at Starbucks I've had an exceptional time. Everyone was very helpful and understanding. The people I've met have been some of the best coworkers I've had and the management of my store has been amazing. Top notch.
good,Very flexible in regards with scheduling and classes. Fun environment to work in. Coworkers are nice to each other and there is a nice work environment
good,"I loved working with Starbucks, I just didn't agree with my managers decisions he made. I feel as if some people look at the pay and not the responsibilities of their role."
good,"Your experience with Starbucks can be great or not so great. All depends on your store. The management team can be supportive and you learn a lot about business practices including cash management, inventory, scheduling and marketing."
good,"Working for Starbucks was an education in itself. Each day you experienced a different clientele. However, having variety in your job makes it exciting."
good,"Having a conversation with customers is the best part, for me anyway. You get to learn some pretty cool things about them. Especially regulars, seeing them come in every day or is like having a friend always coming to say ""Hi""."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would start at 6am where you get the regular customers so its a bit busy in that time as everyone wants their coffee before they go to work. I learned a lot at Starbucks as I stayed there for about a year and 6 months. I learned how to treat difficult customers, I learned to work in a fast paced environment, I gained confidence, I learned how to make new drinks quickly as in every season, new drinks get released etc. The hardest part of the job is probably the amount of cleaning we have to do after we close the shop. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably making the drinks."
good,"This is a great company to work for.  Flexible hours, benefits, hourly  rate plus tips, supportive staff. "
good,Starbucks is a very fast pace job. It has been amazing working for Starbucks as the benefits and the people that you are surrounded with make everything great. My Starbucks family will always be family.
good,The company as a whole is amazing. they really push speed of service over quality a lot of the time and stress some lesser important tasks. The pay could be higher for the amount of work that truly goes on behind the scenes
good,"Working here is a learning experience which one can dream off. The food and beverage portfolio is so diverse, which makes the job even more interesting. The work culture is probably the best about Starbucks."
good,I absolutely love working here. The atmosphere is great. Everyone gets the job done and works as a team despite personal differences. My only issue with working here is that I was lead to believe I'd have full time hours once hired. I'm not even close to full time.
good,On a typical work day you clock in at 6am and you set the entire store up while a line forms at the front door. People will be knocking for you to let them in even though you have plenty to do and you wont even be open yet. After you open the doors prepare youself for the longest 8 hours of your life with only two 10 minute breaks and if you take those 10 minute breaks your fellow employees sort of haze you because there is simply no time for breaks because ususally you are understaffed. Everyone has some specialty drink that you have never heard of but you figure it out and it is almost never correct. The refunds are what set you behind so usually the manager will just basically give everything for free by using drink coupons during rush. Rush never ends by the way. The most enjoyable part are the benefits and free coffee. They also paid 75% of my college tuition!
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was not willing to work around my school hours, therefore I had to resign but I loved the company, the benefits, it was a friendly workplace and the employees were great! Such a good company to work for"
good,It's fun to learn the drinks and learn the regular customers. I got free drinks all day. Manager and shift manager and I became good friends so I didn't hate going to work everyday.
good,"Starbucks is a phenomenal organization to work for. They are supportive, encouraging, and provide a myriad of incredible opportunities for partners. From corporate all the way down to store level, it is clear that everyone cares for one another and wants to see growth, both in individuals and the company as a whole."
good,They have great benefits and a great job culture if you take advantage of it. Great work life balance and lots of advancement options too. Many locations so its easy to fins one where you live. Entry level pay is low but gets better if you work your way up.
good,"I have only been with the company for one month, and I have been working with some of the best management that I have ever encountered. The partners that I work along side of have been so helpful and knowledgeable. This has been a very good change of atmosphere for me and I look forward to making this my career."
good,"Starting as a barista, there were many things to learn, but every partner would be willing to teach if you ask. Working in an office location, the peak can be incredibly overwhelming, but satisfying and well-maintained to ensure that customer service is still met. Self-leadership can be developed working here due as it allows each partner to understand the number of tasks that needs to be performed around the store. The culture can be very enjoyable depending on the people you work with, but most of the time, you will have friendly partners willing to communicate. The most difficult part of the job is having to deal with an overwhelming number of order while maintaining the pace that ensures our quality of service. This also makes it the most enjoyable because it can be incredibly challenging to perfect every move, but very satisfying."
good,Starbucks is all about growth and seeing the development of their partners. I've never loved going into work as much as i have working here... even on the bad days its great. the relationships you build here are like creating a family.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, it does make a difference on which location you work at though. I have worked at two locations and the second one was by far the best. Starbucks is very customer service focused so if that is not something you are looking for then I don't recommend this job for you. This job does have great benefits and you have the chance to work with some great people as well."
good,I was young i don't remember much but i never remember complaining. they do ave good pay people say good benefits too. a lot of merchandise given away at night too which is nice
good,"Working for this company was eye opening and taught me a lot of lessons that attributed to my personal growth"
good,"Working for Starbucks has been an overall great experience. When I started working here, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have come to really enjoy what I do. My favorite part of the job is being able to meet and interact with so many different customers everyday. Customers make or break the day for me personally because if I can't do something to brighten that customers mood, I feel like I haven't done my best. I always try to do the best I can, no matter what it is that I may be doing."
good,"great job for young people who want to work in a fun environment. great benifets,  decent pay. company really works with employees' schedule. I enjoyed my time there"
good,"For some may see that the work of a barista will start by doing coffee and will end doing the same. Wherein being a partner(employee) see things far beyond that. we are trained not just how to make a delightful cup of coffee but instead we are trained to be a part of each and every coffee drinkers day. We were trained how to see things not just good for partners, customers, business but what's good for the environment as well. Aside from those coffee recipes, coffee agriculture and any other technical matter that my recent job requires, it taught me one significant thing. That despite the differences in your workplace, nothing that communication cannot be resolve. My current work as a barista doesn't just end their. Management team always helps us how can we strive higher in our field. Maybe not in management side but as a coffee master and a barista trainer. They also entrust us some operational task where we can expand our learning and be more observant on how business things go. Hard things and situations can be light, light as a espresso grounds for as long as your team is working as one. "
good,Starbucks is the definition of providing a very rich culture. They do a tremendous job of connecting with the guest and providing that essential 3rd place.
good,"empresa especial, trabalha super bem endomarketing, trademarketing e logística. Aprendi muito com eles."
good,Starbucks has a lot of great benefits for its employees. It's a fast-paced environment that makes the time go by pretty quickly. My one complaint is the hourly rate. It's just not possible to survive on your own working there full-time. I had to get a second job.
good,I loved everything about Starbucks except the pay. Getting to talk with customers and develop lasting relationships was a huge part for me. They worked with my school schedule very well.
good,This company is a great place to work. The training they provide sets the partners upper success and the team atmosphere and how they treat everyone is fair.
good,Great culture.  partners are encouraged to engage with customers on a regular basis allowing partners to develop some level of social skills that would ultimately assist in networking.
good,"If you are looking for a job to get you started , this is the job! The people here are fun,and work well as a team. They help me with my school schedule and personal life"
good,It would get very busy and backed up because the management was not organized when i worked there. shipments were always late because orders were never put in on time.
good,Starbucks teaches you many helpful job skills. It helps you become a quick learner and a great multi tasker. I enjoy the diversity between the workers which makes it more interesting.
good,Fast-paced but friendly work environment. Starbucks knows that the attitude of its employees has a lot to do with the attitude of its customers. One of the best things is building relationships with the regulars.
good,"It's a very fast-paced environment and can be stressful, but the partners are amazing and it's a fantastic place to learn management skills. It is a very team-based job, so communication is a key factor to be successful here."
good,"Working at the YouthBuild Starbucks Cafe is different. It provides a learning environment within a working area that is primarily run and operated by the students of YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School. A typical day at the cafe starts at 7:15a.m. with the daily set up and preparations. Then, from 7:30a.m. to 9:15a.m. the cafe is run by myself and my fellow YouthBuild students as we serve other students and the staff at YouthBuild. I myself alongside my fellow cafe working students have learned the importance of food and drink safety as well as the proper way to prepare drinks and simultaneously providing superb customer service. Each shift at the cafe has a different Shift Manager which rotates among the students working the cafe. The culture of the cafe is fast-paced and constantly entertaining. This is because as we interact with the customers, we build certain relationships and tend to engage in lively conversations that make the day seem to go by faster. The hardest part of the job is most likely keeping a steady flow of drinks due to the everyday mishaps of mechanical issues. The most enjoyable part is definitely interacting with the customers and seeing them walk away with a smile on their face as they enjoy their drink."
good,"They want to see you succeed in the work you do, they are always there to help you when needed and when you make a mistake they help you learn from it to help you in future shifts."

good,"I really loved working for Starbucks. The hours were a little grueling, however, it was a great side job while going to school. Once you become a partner, you are given stocks in the company. Performance reviews are every 6 months and you are usually given a raise after the review. I worked the opening shift, so I started at 4 am and usually ended at 10 or at 12. The rushes were demanding, but were manageable."

I found that the people I work with are usually super fun and become good friends. The hardest part of this job is just learning all the recipes, which are taught to you during training, and just remembering that it is a customer service job, so the pay won't be very high, and you will have your share of good and bad customers."
good,"It was great working in this position, you get to know regular customers and gain a relationship with them which is really nice, other employees are usually all very nice and friendly people as was management. pay was alright, tips were a nice benefit."

good,Working at Starbucks has really taught me a lot about what it means to work really hard. Starbucks as a company provides great benefits and room to advance.
good,Starbucks was such a fast paced job. Your days would go so by fast. I enjoyed creating my own drinks and making drinks that customers created themselves.

good,It was the most fun working place for me. It was a fast paced and the environment was a lot of fun. The hardest part of this job was sometimes managing people as i was the shift manager.
good,"Excellent in terms of training,customer service."
good,"It is a fast-paced, fun workplace. If you're a people-person, this is the job for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the friends you make, whether it is customers or your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure all of the cleaning gets done. There is TONS of cleaning. I guess if you're not a morning person, it can be difficult to get up at 3:30-4:30 for a shift."
good,"Starbucks is an exciting place to work particularly if you're a dynamic, active person who is committed to providing excellent customer service."
good,Everything  was easy and fun to do and be at.  Coming into work was just a joy.  But when it comes to leaving the store.  There is a lot of complaints.
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks not only because I love to make drinks but also because I love the partners at my previous and current location. They make work enjoyable.
good,"Starbucks is an extremely efficient company and their main focus is customer satisfaction. Also, they are also very conscious about drive thru times and sale records."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for over 9 years.  They will work with your schedule.  They have excellent benefits.  The work is not hard.  Most of the customers are great, you will build a relationship with them."
good,"I worked in the back where I cleaned cups and plates and cleared the tables, bathrooms and the floor, one time the had to ask me to work the front desk taking orders and making sandwiches and serving people"
good,"A typical day at work involves assisting customers, cleaning work stations, preparing the store for the next mornings open, making several different kinds of beverages, and working alongside very unique people.  My manager is very understanding, caring, and wants to help you the best she can while still keeping the store and all its employees in check.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changing food and beverage items, and how to prepare them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people I work with.  I have met several lifelong friends at this job, and I was also lucky enough to work with my older brother.  I learned a lot about how to handle customers that were not always satisfied.  My time management skills also improved with this job due to the numerous tasks that need to be completed in a timely manner to ensure close went smoothly."
good,"Love working for Starbucks. Good people, fun, benefits. Customers are mostly good. Baristas know alot about coffee I only wish more customers would ask questions before they order."
good,"The easiest part is connecting with the customers and making them feel welcome."
good,it a good atmosphere and have well balance culture. The hardest part of working in starbucks is the customer who dont now want to drink and making there own drink.
good,"great benefits"
good,"Starbucks, is a fun high energy work environment that teaches each barista how to nurture their community through a single cup of coffee. Each day is the same with a slightly different variation depending on the foot traffic."
good,I work at a new location so it is a little slow sometimes. The management is very good at giving you schedules that work for you. You also get to apply for a 401K program.
good,"I enjoy working for this company. They take pride in their employees and really try to make it a great experience working for them. The hardest part is remembering all the drinks, but once you get past that its actually really enjoyable."
good,"It is a good company to work for, I believe in the morals of the company, they treat their employees well and offer a good package of benefits. It is a hard job, a lot is asked of baristas, it is a busy place and people want their coffee, but it is also a rewarding place, it's great to make a great espresso beverage and see the delight on a customers face, it makes it all worth it."
good,short experience but great job. friendly people and great customers. nothing wrong to say about this company. one of my favorite jobs that i have held

good,"Empresa accesible en horarios, buen ambiente entre compañeros, aprendizaje en diferentes áreas teniendo como resultado ser multifuncional y proactivo. Ayuda a tener contacto directo con los cliente y ofrecer un gran servicio."
good,"My job duties was the general day to day running of the store, Making sure the quality of the products was to company standards, Deploying the team to enable a smooth running shift so the customer gained the highest service. My passion in this job was helping to train members of the team to drive the business forward. I took great pride in seeing people I had trained and molded grow into strong members of the team. Starbucks is a company which prided itself on visual standards, and delivering a consistent product throughout its stores, I used my management skills, and ability to follow up to ensure this happened consistently and efficiently. My strong time management skills and understanding of the business helped me in this role, as I was responsible for the deployment of staff, responding to head office questions and achieving our KPI’s. As a Shift Supervisor, I was responsible for effective and controlled ordering, maintaining and accurate stock figure and cash handling integrity"
good,Starbucks is probably my favorite job I have ever had. That being said even as a shift supervisor and a trainer I was making under $500 a check. Good for high school/college kids or bored housewives. Culture and management are fantastic and most customers especially regulars are so amazing.
good,"I've worked at a license store, and an actual Starbucks. In both places, the customers are great, you really get a chance to connect with people that visit regularly. The other baristas are also friendly. Their online training is thorough, it really helped."
good,"This is a brilliant company to work for, everybody works together as a team! "
good,Starbucks is a wonderful experience for both employees and customers. Flexible scheduling for both full-time and part-time. Free drinks from beginning of shift to end of shift. Great people to work with including employees and management. Decent pay and great benefits

good,Partners are given many benefits including a free college education an stock. The company is great to work for and the environment is very forward thinking.
good,"Essentially, a typical day at work consist of me coming in and making sure everything is in its right place. Furthermore, I check in with the previous supervisor to find out any additional information they may have for me before he/she departs. For example, they let me know who needs breaks and who has already had them. Transitioning from a barista to a supervisor really helped put my leadership skills into play. I enjoy putting people in the right positions to be successful, because essentially when they perform well it means that we as upper management are performing well. I would say the hardest part of the job is feeling like you are setting your team up for success. Its sometimes hard to see if your are because you may be use to doing something one way but in reality change might be needed. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is undoubtedly the different connections I have built with the customers. I love the people."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, they are flexible with hours.  The work environment is fast-paced and there is never a time when you are not doing something.  Company cares about the partners and there are many benefits."
good,"Se aprende a trabajar en equipo por que todos son muy solidarios y colaboradores, aprendí muchos valores como el respeto, la responsabilidad, etc. Buenos jefes. El ambiente laboral es muy bello gracias a los compañeros de trabajo. Algunas partes pesadas del trabajo es trabajar bajo presión, pero todo se logra siendo paciente y siempre tener buena actitud. Me gustó mucho que fueran muy conscientes y solidarios con los horarios de estudio de todos los compañeros y que uno se siente como en un segundo hogar laborando ahí."
good,"Having an ever so motivating passion for coffee, working at Starbucks was an amazing experince for me. I always looked foward to going into work and serving people with happiness in their cups."

I always recommend college students to become a partner. Not only is it a good job, it's a great way to network and make good friends. I made positive connections that lasted in the years since I've left the company and even the state!"
good,I would like to work a starbucks at any place again. I like being surrounded by a positive energy at mu working places. I hope to work at starbucks singapore
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for if you need flexibility and a great work-life balance. They provide excellent benefits and flexible work hours.
good,"Starbucks offers amazing benefits, but a low base pay. The culture is great and the people are amazing. It is a high stress and sometimes physically challenging work environment. The day flies by quickly though."

good,Starbucks was my very first job and i couldn't think of a better place to start with. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction by working at Starbucks. I have absolutely no complaints.
good,"I worked here through college and even after as I seek my career. It's the best company to work for part-time because you get excellent health benefits, stocks, and I think the pay is reasonable. They really work with your schedule and you're able to work a lot of hours in the morning before other commitments or later at night."
good,"you can enjoy working with god management and nice clients ,always dealing with good and professional people it because of the location (jumeirah dubai )and the sbx management is so good we enjoyed working with god management ."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Starbucks over the past 3 years because I love interacting with the people wether its the customer or fellow employees. "
good,Working in high volume stores could keep you on your feet constantly with sometimes little to no break. As a new hire I often found it confusing or difficult to remember beverage components and steps to making them . I quickly learned to keep up and mastered the menu in as little as a month. I most enjoyed remembering customers faces and names and the look they give you knowing they were assured they would leave happy.  The benefit i found a liking to most was the college achievement plan they offered through Arizona SU.
good,Loved there customers and my employees.  It was a challenging job in the sense that I had a drive thru store and we always tried to exceed customers expectations.
good,"The only thing I don't enjoy about Starbucks is the pay. Working for them has been excellent. I would recommend it to those who are first starting out in the work field. The regular customers are sweet and caring. There are always a few unpleasant customers, but overall - it is a really pleasing and enjoyable job for customer service."
good,"Love working at Starbucks, great opportunities, and meet lots of new customers. Love seeing the satisfactory from customers after them having there drinks."
good,"Every day was a whirlwind of new products, fun people, and great drinks. This was an incredible atmosphere to be a part of."
good,I have worked here for over 6 years and have grown so much with the company. I believe in their values and have been supported by them throughout my journey. I would recommend this job to others who are in college or who also see themselves moving forward with the company. You can develop here because they make it very reachable as long as you show your dedication.
good,Cool people to work with. fast paced gets the day by faster. All types of options for drinks. Management very lenient and understanding.
good,"Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register."
good,This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me. My co-workers were nice and understanding though.
good,"Starbucks is a rewarding company to work for in general. The specific one I worked at was inside a grocery store so it had some draw backs. We didn't get some of the benefits such as making tips and getting free drinks on our shift but I always loved the environment. My co-workers were my friends and management was so helpful and understanding. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to mix and match all different sorts of things together to find my perfect drink and also doing the same for customers until they found something they loved."
good,Starbucks is always a Second home to people so if you are able to help create the feeling that the guest are always welcomed then you will enjoy a group of fun group of guest and co-workers.
good,It's a good job and pays a little over 9 an hour plus tips but it requires a lot of patience and will test your memory. You WILL get some pretty bad customers but most are okay. You get free drinks and are allowed one free food item per shift. A 30 percent discount isn't bad either.
good,"Starbucks is the most amazing place to work. The customers are great, the team I work with is amazing and the entire atmosphere is just so warm and inviting. Also very laid back. I am happy to be a Barisra for Starbucks"
good,"If you enjoy working with and getting to know customers then this is a great job. You get to meet a lot of great people and the benefits of being a partner alongside Starbucks is amazing as well. This isn't an easy job either, a barista does a great deal of work for the Starbucks company but our hustle at such a great company doesn't go unnoticed, unless of course management within specific stores alters any of these great perks that Starbucks is truly known for. P.S. a new barista is allowed to move stores with at least 6 months of working at their original store and must be at good standing with their manager."
good,"I love who I work with, and I love that partners can talk to customers like friends and get to know the everyone and act like family."
good,"Long hours yet manageable."
good,"By far, my favorite job - if you could call it that. Waking up and going in daily was NOT a chore. It's the most fun I've had at work in 15 years. Truly a PLEASURE to work for Starbucks Coffee Company. I recommend it for anyone at any age. Benefits are amazing, too."
good,I enjoyed interacting with people from all backgrounds there was something new at work each day. It was always busy at the store i worked at but with teamwork we were able to work well under pressure.
good,"I loved working for this company! I learned so much about working with different kinds of people. I also gained knowledge about store operations, and sales techniques! I now know how to read people based off their body language and facial expressions. The management is good depending on what manager you have, but most of them do their best to make their baristas happy. The hardest part was when coworkers didn't show up for their shift, and the entire store suffered because we always need help in order for the day to run smoothly. My favorite part was making customers happy and having fun making their drinks just the way they like it."
good,"I love working at Starbucks! Between meeting new people and the amazing benefits, it would be hard to think of Starbucks in a negative way! I love coming into work and getting to see all my awesome co-workers and throughout the day, customers that I have gotten to know over the time that I have worked at my location, come in and talk to me. Most of the time I am having so much fun that I am forgetting that I am working. I love that Starbucks is constantly trying to change their menus to keep everything new and exciting their and I love how I am constantly on my feet working there. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job is just standing on your feet for 8-9 hours a day but I try to keep myself moving as much as possible in order to make the time go by quicker. Management at my store is awesome! I've grown very close to my management that they are almost like family to me. Getting the chance to come into this place everyday and get the things that I do, really makes me love this place."
good,I loved being continuously busy! This job offered great benefits and very flexible work hours.  My coworkers were some fantastic people who knew how to do their job and they loved doing it.  This was a great learning environment.  The constant flow of customers meant that there was always something to do.
good,"Usually get regular customers in the morning so you can get to know them a little more than just their coffee. Great coworkers, great pay"
good,"Flexible hours, great training, fast paced.  I love forming relationships with the regular customers and the random fun conversation from the ones who just stop by."
good,great company to work for. Great standards and customer service expectations. This may be a job avenue i look to going down again.
good,"It is great for maybe a college student, looking to get great work experience, and to have fun and drink coffee while doing it. There is not too much room for advancement, unless your with the company for a long time."
good,walking in to work is awesome when all your team members welcome you with a smile. Ensuring everyone knows there job tasks is critical and essential in mainting efficiency and peace in the work atmosphere.
good,"The benefits outweighed the low pay. "
good,I started working at Starbucks in 2015 it took me 4 months to promote to a Shift Supervisor. I also need to transfer twice because of personal reasons and they helped me move easily.
good,Although being a Barista is fun it is better as a part-time job to receive extra money monthly. Most managers will work with your schedule for you to have a great balance of life outside of work as well.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a little over a year. The pay isn't great, but the benefits and the atmosphere are awesome! "
good,"I love the work i do and the fact that the company is so employee focused, They really do go above and beyond for their employees. Now on the Management side, there is a huge communication gap between corporate and stores. It is often very long before the support that is needed to make daily task more manageable is implemented at the store level.Sometimes by the time the tools that are needed at store level are implemented by corporate a better solution has been figured out and implemented district wide by the actual stores. Technology is also a big challenge for the company as they seem to be way behind on that. i have worked for far smaller and less wealthy companies that are far more in tune with the technology needs of a growing company. If you are willing to work with these challenges and can work well under extreme amounts of pressure this will be the best company you will work for."
good,The environment is high energy and fast paced. The quality of  management depended on location. The most enjoyable part of the job was making memorable connections with customers.
good,"getting to know all the regular customers that come in"
good,"My hours are flexible. Whenever I have a change in schedule whether with school or personal issues, my manager is always helpful with finding someone to cover my shift. My coworkers are always friendly and we often hang out outside of work. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with difficult and unsatisfied customers. When customers are unwilling to be placated we usually give them the number for the corporate office for them to satisfy them."

The company has taught me a lot, from work-related basis up to personal matters. The company have played a very important role in my career for it stands as my training ground. I have no problem regarding my workmates and my work place for the company serves a friendly and world class working environment. The employees were called partners and not as employees.I have enjoyed working in this company and I don't have any negative realizations working here."

My personal favorite is you get a discount with 24hr Fitness if you prove your employment with Starbucks."

good,"I loved working at Starbucks! The hours, pay, benefits, and people I worked with made it one of the best jobs I've had. The hardest part of the job was the quantity of the work required, especially in the morning. I learned to work well and efficiently in environments such as this."

good,"Delivering a great customer service with our customers."
good,"I love working for Starbucks. I think that they are a good company. The hardest part about working for them was staffing, but that was mostly due to the fact that we were in a Target, so Target supplied the staff for the Starbucks. This meant that if Target had to cut hours sometimes we would have to cut them from our little corner, leaving us understaffed. I loved the manager directly in charge of me. She was fantastic, everything you could want in a manager, fair, respectful, she actually cared. I loved connecting with our customers, especially the regulars."
good,If you enjoy being around people in a fast paced environment this is the job for you. Co- workers were respectful and everyone worked together as a team.
good,"It's hard to believe I'd want to leave a company with so many benefits. The moment I clock into work, it's already assumed I know what I have to do. I have already assessed the strengths that my coworkers possess and the manager that's on duty, and incorporate my skills almost immediately which tasks I have to perform so we can work efficiently as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a product and presenting it to our customers. I take pride in my work. I have good relationships with my manager and coworkers, we bowl every week for ""team building""."
good,Loved the company they have a lot of opportunity growth. The hours are very flexible and it is a fast paced environment so the days fly by.

We were always so busy with a faced paced volume of customers due to the building we work in and all the people who have enjoyed the service that they keep coming back.

good,When management is right work life balance is great. Very organized and busy workday. Starbucks appreciates its employees and truly cares about the lives of them.
good,"There is always a routine for this job. Workers start work with a ready-to-go mentality which very often helps everyone work smoothly and in a teamwork. Customer service is the main service provided to customers as well as maintaining the workplace in a cleaned state at all times. Work is knowing how to multitask and prioritizing between customers and cleaning. The environment is usually friendly and straightforward, yet there are times where it can become stressful with cleaning the store, interacting with customers and delegating tasks to workers."
good,"Very fast paced and energetic workplace, great for networking and advancement if looking to stay with the company long term. The benefits are incredible, such as full medical, dental and vision insurance for only working 20 hours a week, paid vacation time, 100% matched 401k, tuition reimbursement, and 3 months of maternity leave (partially paid)."
good,Very fair company and gives you a lot of opportunity to advance. A typical day at work is delivering great customer service.

good,I enjoy making customers happy and introducing them to new drinks and pastries. THe working environment is great at Starbucks we are a team and we help one another.
good,"Management is very important, but very young. Will hire external for management postitions. Manager to barista is very close. Life at starbucks varies per store."
good,Starbucks is a great company if you want to learn to how to balance customer service as well as providing efficient services. They're training is reliable and professional. Probably the best part about working for them.
good,"Always a fun day at Starbucks, being a Barista is one of my dream jobs. The only hard part of the job was during rush hours and people couldn't communicate as well as needed to keep the turnover smooth. Management is usually pretty good at working with you if you have issues outside of work you need to work on or if you need to switch your schedule around, but favoritism was displayed often."
good,"flexibilidad en cuanto a horarios, buen trato general, horarios felxibles, salvo los fines de semana que se trabajan todos."

Meeting new people and giving a customer satisfaction and positive outlook of life"
good,"Mi actividades, era estar al pendiente de un equipo de trabajo de 9 a 5 personas dependiendo el turno, realizaba en días específicos pedidos y cada domingo hacia el inventario; realizaba entrevistas y auditorias de calidad y servicio, para crear planes de acciones para atacar las áreas de oportunidad."
good,"A typical day at work is spent with motivating and enhancing the skills of the partners by continuously training them and ensuring that all customers' needs are met and expenses are controlled while maximizing sales. I have learned from this work experience on how to motivate a team to achieve a common goal. The Management is supportive to my plans for the store and my co-workers are well oriented on how to deliver the company expectations. The hardest part of the job is to implement newly introduced systems of the company and consistently checking on its development. However, the most enjoyable part of it is when the team achieves the goal. All the hardships fade off and the feeling is rewarding."
good,"working at Starbucks was a great experience. First few weeks there is a pretty steep learning curve, but your manager and co workers are very supportive and guide you through it."

good,"The daily pace at Starbucks is quick, but the teams make it work.  I would still be there, but it was difficult to get only 20 hours per week, as I only wanted to be par time.  The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was being a partner and serving excellent coffee to the customers."
good,"Working with other people in Starbucks was a great experience. For the day to follow well everyone must work as a team and there were no problems in doing that. Everyone got along great and people rolls of the day were established and followed easily. I learned great team work and communication. Communication was such an important skill in working with the starbucks company and I was able to build up relationships with a lot of the customers at the store. Unfortunately I was only working in Whistler for the summer, otherwise I would still be working there. The hardest part of the job was learning the 86,000 combinations of drinks they had on the menu. The easy part of the job was feeling like I was a part of the team"
good,This is a great first job its completely your choice to grow within the company .its a great place to network because all different types of people come in for their cofee.
good,"Though at times morning rush could be stressful and fast pace, it was always filled with positive attitudes. As a manager I learned that there was no problem that couldn't be solved. Management was always helpful with anything I needed to know. And every team that I have worked with have been outstanding co-workers and friends. The hardest part about working a shift at Starbucks is; regardless of how long you have been working there, you always felt as though you could be helping customers faster and more efficient. The best part above all else is the people you get to meet, weather it is a regular customer that you come to know and become friends, or the partners that even though you only worked with them for months it feels as though you've known them for years."

I preformed several job duties and provide key excellent customer service. The job duties included taking and make the orders of customers (teas, coffees, and other drinks to customers specification), while maintaining good customer relations and speedy delivery of the beverages as well as completing assigned tasks from management everyday.

good,A typical day at work was to prepare and purchase for fresh espresso coffee. I learned communication and customer service skills. We worked in a family type of group of coworkers. The hard part was the rush hours and the most enjoyable to watch people's satisfied faces.

I have always learned a lot as long as you are willing to ask questions and look for answers they create a system that makes info easy to find. if you want to know how to mop a store to the Starbucks standards there is a book for that as well..

good,"Great work experience. This job teaches one constant customer service, multi-tasking, and speed. Also, you usually end up great friends with your co-workers!"
good,"I'm always welcomed by my coworkers every time I go into work. I love the atmosphere in our work environment. Everyone works well with each other and help out one another. We're each assigned at a station to operate to avoid confusion on what we're doing. All of our customers leave happy and content, and if they have any issue, we're there to help them resolve it. We don't just make drinks, but we clean the facility and behind the counter daily. Sometimes, it's a struggle being able to clean everything because of you have to find down time to get tasks done. Other than that, I enjoy with what I do. What I most enjoy doing at my job is making a customer's drink while engaging in a conversation with them at the same time. It makes me feel happy and that we made some sort of connection hoping for them to return next time they want coffee or drink."
good,"A fun job with typically bright co-workers. Starbucks does it's best to train employees to go as far as they are willing to go up the corporate ladder. In other words, ""The squeaky wheel gets the oil."" While being fast-paced, demanding and at times stressful, the job is fun for those who appreciate that kind of work. You will also find a lot of support in the large community of ""partners"" that the company does it's best to foster."
good,"Starbucks is very busy throughout the week, there is lots to do and it's not a place you can just stand and talk. i learned a lot of things such as the stock check and serving coffee. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the timing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know everyone and how the shop runs. Everyone was really nice and welcoming and i didn't feel pressured by anyone and felt quite comfortable talking to others."

good,"Everyday is different from the different diverse crowd of people, once you get the hang of it, it becomes routine. I have grown as a person and became more out spoken to communicate with customers. When it comes to management it depends on who is your manager, my manager is the best overall, he is very considerate, stern, laid-back, strict, and family oriented, can't find anyone else like him. As i said before it all depends on the person, my co-workers are like family. the hardest part of the job is the beginning, learning drinks, timing everything, learning the order to make the drinks, learning the abbreviations to write on cups, the history of the coffee beans, the differences between roasts, and understanding the difference of coffee processes. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and having the chance to become close with co-workers"

I learned what having legendary customer service means and i also learned how to work in an environment that's fast paced. We have to be able to multitask and work as a team so that things can run smoothly.
good,"Every day it is important to remember who is on your team and how to work with them. A tight nit group is how to get through the day. I've also learn that keeping a positive and friendly demeanor will help you with almost any situation. The store I currently work at is the busiest and fastest store in our district. So there is a lot of pressure on the employs to keep fast and consistent, and with practice, it was a breeze to flow with the group."

good,"For being my first job this was an overall amazing experience. My first day off training and on the floor as a barista proved to be very challenging because of the amount of customers constantly in the store and all the drinks I had to remember. During my first week I spilled hot coffee on my hand and got very frustrated. The manager was off duty but saw me and stepped in for a few minutes so I could compose myself and come back to work. After about a week I was basically a pro and realized that every experience is a learning experience and sometimes I need to just pause, take a breath, then keep going."

I have worked at two locations, My first location was located in new York and I got along with all my co- workers. My second store which is my current location is in Georgia and I also get along with all my co-works they are very pleasant. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is making drinks and interacting with the customers. the hardest part of my job would dealing with an unhappy customer. I pay close attention to my manager and supervisors. I have learned alot from them like how to efficiently train people."
good,Very collaborative and supportive.  Great training and support for development.   Innovative culture.   Lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"It is an easy job. I love the managers and co-workers. They were very flexible when it came to balancing work, school, and clinicals. I have been grateful for my team.  They do a lot of volunteer activities you can do that usually counts toward anything if you have to have volunteer hours and we hung out a lot at company events."
good,"Starbucks truly cares about their employees. The work and social environments are wonderful. I loved this job, if I didn't have to move I would have never quit."
good,"Working at Starbucks encourages high energy and a positive outlook on working. Customers tend to be very peculiar about how they want their coffee depending on where you work. Instead of having an impatient environment, Starbucks has done an excellent job on teaching you how to be understanding towards needs of the public. Sometimes it does become difficult especially when you are working really fast and you feel the pressure of the customers watching you make their beverage. If you keep calm and remind yourself all you can do is the best you can it forces you to relax. I love the atmosphere during work hours and I have never left work upset. My favorite part about work is when its busy and I am under pressure. After its all done with and everyone leaves, I definitely feel a huge sense of accomplishment."
good,I love working at Starbucks. They pay good and have a good benefits. They teach you many skills of multitasking and how to handle difficult people. Its a great place to meet people and learn about the world of coffee.

good,"Learning the Starbucks coffee process of making drinks, managing supplies, handling customers and staying busy was rather easy and quick to pick up on. They were very lenient when it came to learning the trade."
good,"A typical day at work would start at 4:30 in the morning, opening shift."
good,"Se cumplen con reglas y procedimientos estaablecidos con respecto a la operacion y calidad de todos los productos que se ofrecen en la empresa, aprendi a liderar con valentia a mi equipo, a trabajar por objetivos y bajo la presion operacional, el ambiente que vivimos es inigualable e inmejorable, todos los miembros del equipo son Partners tanto dentro como fuera de la empresa, lo mas dificil es de pronto no contar con la plantilla suficiente para poder mejorar la velocidad del servicio."

good,"I would typically arrive at the shop around 5:30 in the morning and get right to work. For the most part, I worked either the front register or the drive thru window. Both of these positions dealt heavily with customers and interaction with them. I learned how to handle dissatisfied customers and how to make their experience with Starbucks more enjoyable. I also learned how to balance making a customer feel welcome while also keeping busy and attending to other customers who needed to be served. My supervisors and managers were incredibly professional. Customer service was (is) a huge deal to them as well as taking care of their employees. When I or one of my coworkers needed correction, they would not make a scene but pull us aside and address the issue with kindness but also enforced the rules. The hardest part of the job was most definitely dealing with the customers. Many were incredibly rude and ungrateful for the services that we provided for them and often times took out their frustrations on us. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was building relationships with my coworkers and the regulars. It was always encouraging to see a regular's face light up when they realized I was working the window and getting to briefly talk about life and such."
good,I loved working here. The benefits were great. I loved my schedule and the ability to travel to any store. This place was very flexible
good,A typical day at Starbucks includes routinely making and serving coffee and specialized drinks. In addition to making coffee every fifteen minutes we tend to walk in customers and fill their drink orders. I have learned how to effectively manage time and manage staying in order while filling drink orders.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent place to meet new work colleagues and create new friends and I did exactly that. It's a very fast-paced environment and you need to constantly be on the ball- especially when its a busy day. It can get stressful when you have a huge variety of drinks waiting to be made, but there is a system in place which you learn whilst you train. I enjoyed meeting new customers and serving the regulars and I learned to have patience when the store got busy. The management was as good as it could be- since we were a new store in the town the management could be a bit shaky but it was still good. The hardest part of the job was to keep smiling and serving when faced with difficult situations and customers. The break times were okay- but it completely depended on your shift for example; up to 4 hours you had no breaks, 6 and above you received 30 mins and for anything longer (like 9 hours+) you got 30 mins and 10 mins. The breaks could be better especially when you have been on your feet all day."
good,Generally worked the drive-thru which could be a difficult position but the team oriented environment took any pressure away because there is always a colleague to come to the rescue if need be.
good,"La empresa tiene un amplio sentido de compañerismo con los trabajadores dando prestaciones muy buenas."
good,Working at Starbucks is a high and energized environment. All partners are always happy and smiling. With different personalities that are easily mixed together to make it a productive day.
good,"No wonder why every customers keep on coming back to Starbucks aside from coffee. The baristas or partners at Starbucks are the most kind and very welcoming employees. Despite the long lines and 10 hours of standing, they still manage to smile and make every customer feel welcome."
good,"Sometimes our location would see up to 600 customers in a 2 hour time frame and i had to remain calm and work fast and precise and get the customers out satisfied in a timely fashion. There could be up to 11 employees crammed in our small behind counter space, doing various jobs and we all had to collaborate to satisfy our customers."
good,dealing with customers & taking drink orders. Management was excellent & advancement was quick. co workers were excellent in the training process & very resourceful when I needed help.
good,"Needed a job as soon as possible and the manager was understanding and helped me out. Was a bit rough at first, but it was an overall great experience."
good,"A typical day at work would include customer interactions, food and drink preparation, cleaning taskings, beverage and food knowledge, product placement, and reaching sales goals."
good,"This is a job i wished i still could be employed with. the people interaction, the fast paced work environment, the smell of freshly brewed coffee made is the definition of an amazing job for me. this job really did help me develop socially and independently over the years. I was aspiring to move up in the company to the point where i could work with farmers globally to make the coffee industry a must more just place. my unfortunate demise with this job left me in a deep state of depression. my only wish is that i could know the real reason why i was let go ( i wasn't even handed discharge papers of anything!) this job was everything to me and to have it taken away suddenly like it was really does leave a scar on my view of the companies way to handle disputes."
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of creating quality beverages and delivering legendary customer service to all guests who walked in.  On the job, some skills I developed were how to read body language and build relationships with any and all customers who came in and continued to come back.  The management was strong and  very communicative when it came to passing along shifts.  Certain things needed to be voiced as to ensure the smoothness was maintained."
good,I enjoy being able to have flexible hours and a good team to work with. I enjoy the fast paced environment and being able to work with a lot of customers during the day.
good,"working for starbucks is never ending exitment. hard work with a fun enviroment."
good,"Starbucks was my longest employment and this is where I learned most of my skills today. "
good,"Starbucks is a great way to learn a sense of communication and multitasking. it is a very fast pace job and if you cant do two to more things at a time, this is not the job for you. this coffee shop deals with individuals themselves and gets to know their customers to make working a lot easier especially since we have regulars."
good,"A typical day at work was constantly helping customers.The most enjoyable part of my job was the  fact that I started to learn customers names so quickly, being able to make that connection with them. I loved that I got to know what they ordered, being able to get their coffee or bagel even before they ordered it! That kind of service made the customers feel special, welcome and always start their day off in a positive mood. I learned so much from working at Starbucks. My store manager worked hand and hand with me to teach me how to properly order inventory, make sure we have exactly what the customers want to buy and order. I was a shift supervisor, and on a typical day I managed around 5 people on my shift. I encouraged them to learn, ask questions, feel free to talk to me about anything, and most importantly encouraged them to feel good about the job they were doing! I think the only hard part about my job was that my current shifts were the opening shifts, which i had to be there by 5:00 AM. It affected my outside life."
good,"I have always wanted to work for Starbucks, and now that I do I can't think of a better company to work for. The founder is adamant about his employees, so much so he has offered to pay for their higher education and provides one of the best health insurances there is. The regular customers are amazing and can't be replaced. Yes, you still have those hard to deal with people, but they're in and out in five minutes or less. And, your co-workers are like family. They're there for you in good times and bad. Sure you pick on each other, but that's sibling bonding right? I can't think of a better place to be."
good,"Fun and fast paced.  Great, diverse group working as a team and providing good quality product, while learning with an opportunity to grow."
good,"great place to have new experiences and challenge yourself. learnt how to manage time, people, and money as well as have a fun and organized atmosphere while on shift as a shift supervisor. As a barista, we learn how to create delicious beverages as well as develop a greater knowledge about our coffee and tea world, and we are able to make great connections with our customers to ensure they feel as though starbucks is their second home. As a barista trainer, I was able to encourage new employees to feel excited about the job they were doing as they developed their coffee knowledge and learnt how to work in a fast-paced environment. its a great place to make new friends inside the staff and with our customers, and you learn something new every day."
good,"I have stayed with this company for a long time because it takes good care of all of its partners. Its the only part time job I have had that offers health benefits. We are not employees, we are partners in the company. The people I work with are happy, kind, and supportive. I am set up for success by everyone I work with on a daily basis. I leave work knowing I set my fellow partners up for success."
good,"Although my job at Starbucks was a little stressful at times I found it very exciting. Typically, I would clock into work and immediately be assigned a position (Bar, Drive Thru, Register, etc.). Each position was unique and each taught me valuable lessons I can now use to benefit a future employer. Barring, or making drinks, taught me how to control my actions during high-stress situations; staying calm was very valuable when there were lines out the door. Drive-thru taught me how to multitask. That position required me to take orders through a headset, talk to the customer at the window, cash them out, hand off my drinks, and retrieve pastries at the same time. Front register was definitely my favorite position, because I got to learn how to build relationships with my customers. I was able to meet people from every continent, and connect with the regulars."
good,"I learned how to make beverages, I had a very good connection with my co-workers in a funny workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was the connection with people and the hardest part was that we had to work many hours in a very quick mode."
good,I have loved working for Starbucks.  I have been here for many years and with each year I am prouder of the company I work for.
good,Love the work environment. The company extends full-time benefits even to part time employees. The pay rates could be a little higher at least in the state where I was working. The culture was awesome as were my co-workers.
good,"I consistently worked the busy  morning shifts. I would walk in and immediately look at our schedule breakdown for the day. I would then have to consider the most optimal deployment for employees for the day, and plan lunches and breaks accordingly."
good,Starbucks is always growing and they look for oppurtunites for their employees to grow with them. Customer service is the number one focus and its lots of fun!
good,"Everyday the management was very accommodating if you had a request or issue. Serving pastries, working the espresso when it was busy was the best part. Multi-tasking six, seven drinks at a time."
good,"Working at Starbucks is, in my experience, the absolute apex of the fast-food service industry. The benefits are staggering, the pay is competitive, and the environment is very positive. The hardest part of the job is definitely getting cleaning tasks done while there are a lot of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and throwing back the odd espresso shot here and there."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company overall with great opportunities, and many benefits. A day at work for me always depends on the people whom I'm working with because at times when you have a rude supervisor at work it affects everyone else at the workplace for that day. The hardest part at my job is trying to cheer everyone up as much as I can because I was given the responsibility of being the barista trainer, so everyone at the workplace comes to me for advice. the most enjoyable part of my job would be working with my great co-workers, and looking at the face of satisfied costumers that come by my job daily."
good,Fun and high energy Starbucks can be a very exciting place to work. Friendly co-workers and good management do their part to make you feel part of a larger team. The benefits are great and get even better if you take full advantage of them. The work can be menial at times but cleaning will always be a top priority in the food industry so it comes with the territory. The hardest part of the job is learning all the recipes and creating each of them in a timely manner with as few mistakes as possible. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with and meet everyday.
good,"I work with great, fun partners! It is a bit of a learning environment. Knowing how to talk and connect with customers is a must here!"
good,"Good job, good people, good company. Great place to work. I couldn't have asked for a better place to work. When I was injured, the company and people I worked with provided great support during my hardships."
good,"wonderful experiences, people ask question so i can help them out in it makes me fell happy to make them satisfy and me also to accomplish my skills and ability to work with people."
good,A place to explore the coffee around the world.  Deliver a world class service to every customers.  A perfect place to connect to everyone.
good,"The company was great to work for.  They provide excellent benefits and work well around personal schedules.  Within the past year, benefits changed slightly, but most of my time was spent working for the company from 2008 - 2013."
good,On a typical day at work we would prep the case and prepare awesome hand crafted beverages! Then clean house for the next day.
good,"Starbucks is such a great place to work, especially if you are a student. I made the best of friends and always enjoyed going to work each day. I had the best managers who were always so helpful and accommodating."
good,"This company strives to make every customer feel unique, if not unique, at the very least welcomed. Every customer is to have the ""Starbucks Experience"", which is to be greeted, spoken with, educate, learn about them as a customer and make their stop with us an event. Hard to imagine doing this when there are 40 customers in the store at a time some days, but it made it all the more fun and interesting. The company showed it's gratitude through its benefit system towards their employees. Their care towards us never made us feel like we were just working a job, but a career."
good,"Most of the day working at Starbucks is very busy, but there is downtime as well to complete daily activities such as any cleaning that needs done, stocking and restocking that needs done, any prep for pulling food, and making sure we have everything we need for the day or the rest of the day. The management and employees all work together to complete tasks such as grinding beans, making drinks, taking orders, making food, and making sure customers are happy. My favorite part about working as a barista is making coffee and the rushes, which I love because I love staying busy and there is never a dull moment here."
good,"When my last Store Manager transferred"
good,"o Managed store operations by delegating tasks to co-workers for stores located in "
good,"This job works with your avalability and gives you free coffee. if you are a student this is the perfect job for you! they offer good hours. the only issue with this job is the managent is not so great,"
good,"Ce travail ma permis de rencontrer des gens formidables et une équipe forte avec de bonnes valeurs. Ainsi, cela à amélioré  mon travaille d'équipe. Les horaires étaient très flexibles et il y avait une ambiance très saines et respectueuse au sain du magasin. Le gérant était a l'écoute de ses employeurs si ont avaient un problème nous savions que aller y parler était sans gène. Malheureusement il on ouvert un autre succursale sur la même rue ce qui a fais baisser la clientèle donc à la fin il ne pouvait combler ma demande de 40 heures puisqu'il n'y avait plus assez de travaille a combler."
good,"Can sometimes get difficult but with a staff that cares and stellar management it gets alot easier and becomes less like hard work, and becomes more fun. The job is difficult at the start of your employment but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a really fun job. All in all, I would love to work for this company again."
good,"The Starbucks I work at is located at the Little Rock Airport. There are about 15 employees and work at two separate stores within the airport. "
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is a rare statement. Everyday throws us different difficult curve balls and we learn to deal with it. We all learn how to stay positive and in control when customers become unruly. We learn superior customer service and different skills to being an effective barista. "
good,"Learning curve for a barista is about 6 months.  Depending on the volume of the store and management, work can be incredible rewarding.  The flexibility in the transfer of employees makes them accommodating for a large market of hard workers."
good,Working for cooperate starbucks is the greatest especially with the flexiable hours.
good,From clock in to clock out non stop fun and friendly environment while maintaining Starbucks service standards. Standards which i will carry out through out my career.
good,"Was fortunate to work with a wonderful crew of people and made some life long friends while working there. The pay wasn't bad for what the job requires and the hours were flexible which is great for students. Would recommend this job, 100%."
good,"I have been able to learn how to manage confrontation from guests as well as coworkers, improved greatly with time management, and have been given the opportunity to grow as a partner and as an individual."
good,"a typical day at work for me would simply be connecting each customer with their drink making sure they have a clean and litter free environment to enjoy their coffee , making sure the customer gets their coffee and pastries at a reasonable time frame."
good,I made drinks and I also cleaned. I helped prepare the food and pastries.
good,Very fast paced environment. I've gained excellent customer service skills. I've learned to react well under pressure. This job has also improved my time management skills. Hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy. Resolving any disputes in a calm and understanding manner so that the customers will be happy and want to come back. Everyone I work with is always pushing us to do better. Whether it be with sales targets or current goals we have outside of work.
good,"Able to make and create different drinks for yourself and for the customer to try. My boss was really chill, but not to chill where people would/could take advantage of him. My favorite part of the job was getting to know my customers on a name and drink basis."
good,"Everyday is different but you can expect to know what is expected of you. I've learned so much in the past 7years with this company. How to mange my time, to learning how to deal with difficult customers while trying to reach their needs. Making it right any way I can. Learning to build up a team while being an example of what is expected. Building my customer base and knowing them by name and drink. Having them know that they can rely on consistency with my service and beverage making while sharing these skills with new partners. Management is always looking to help you improve on your skills and help you move to the next level. Partner development is always a big part of you Starbucks experience. My partners, as we call each other, are stand up people who live up to the values of the company. They are reliable and dependable. I can look to them for help at any point. I have found that no matter what Starbucks you work at their like family with lasting relationships. The hardest part of my job sometimes is the lack of a consistent schedule. Every week the hours are different along with no guarantee of 40 hrs. The best part of my job is the interaction I have with people on a daily bases. I enjoy working around people and it brings me great satisfaction to be able to bring them a small piece of happiness. Everyone loves coffee, well most do. Being able to watch my partners grow in this field and develop customer relation skills that will pass into so many different areas of our lives. Just love it."
good,"As a college student, this was an ideal work environment. Management always worked around my class schedule and co-workers were always supportive and fun."
good,"Managing the team, helping customers had a great feeling to it every time, got better at managing, but the most difficult part would be the busyness of the store."
good,I was responsible for the supervision of staff and training of new hires and really loved my job.  The benefits were unmatched and leaving was a huge risk.  I decided to leave the company for the potential opportunity of opening my own coffee business.
good,"I enjoy coming to work every day, not only because I am good at what I do, but I am also great with connecting with my customers. "
good,I worked with them for four years and it was a great experience.
good,it was excellent learning journey for me really enjoyed the work culture.
good,Great place to learn and grow. Enjoyed employees as well as customers. Great brand
good,"Learning new and interesting drinks each day, enjoy the great drinks and pastries and being able to teach others new things aswell."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this job.  The atmosphere is great and the fact you get full time benefits as long as you work at least 20 hours is great.  Most importantly, the free drinks during you shift are the icing on the cake.  The company does a great job trying to cater to employee need and this really helps to drive your team to do well."
good,Great place to work. FUN! Would love to go back. Fast paced.  Management is very supportive.
good,"Accurately prepare drinks according to company standards, Efficiently perform end of the night duties. Perform cash handling, and customer service duties."
good,"A typical work day would include checking in with the previous supervisor (see which Barista is assigned to what till, whose had their breaks/lunches, how many till drops they did, making sure they count out the change before you count in for security purposes, and then receive the store key). Throughout the shift I would be in charge of overseeing co workers, sending them to lunch/breaks on time, providing change from the time safe when needed, and constantly looking for opportunities to praise Baristas for good work behaviors or coaching them with positive reinforcement when needed. Working for this company has taught me many valuable life skills from customer service, accurately handling and recording monetary transactions, how to enthusiastically mentor coworkers so they could move up in the company, and being able to multitask in a high paced environment without get flustered. My coworkers were amazing and with the incentive Starbucks offers everyone loved coming into work. The hardest part of the job would have to be delegating tasks, its very hard for me to want to let others handle my responsibilities but my mentor taught me how to let duties go because it creates accountability for our employees and gives them a sense of pride when they complete them. Store level management are very professional, they have to complete months of training and relocating to other stores to achieve their positions. Upper level management such as district managers know the business inside and out, the only issue i had was the lack of labor they expected us to use when we worked at such a"
good,"быстрые возможности роста, высокая корпоративная культура, низкая зарплата"
good,"Very fast pace environment, need to recognize guest preferences and think quick on your feet."
good,"I had a great time, i met a lot of great people. I enjoyed learning how to make the drinks, i also enjoyed working the drive thur."
good,"This is not a back room management position or run of the mill store manager job. It’s being on the front line, connecting with customers and partners. It’s the opportunity to develop your own team, hiring and welcoming new partners and future leaders for your store."
good,"I love my job because of the employees that I am surrounded by.  I have an amazing and personable staff that encourages me to work hard everyday.  I get great feedback and in an environment where each of us is in pursuit of getting their degree, I am motivated to work hard for a living as well as for the sake of my education."
good,The staff there is amazing to work with and always provided great customer service. I never went a day without having great conversations with employees as well as customers.
good,"this job was always very busy and very fast paced. I you couldn't keep up, then the whole team would fall behind, so we all had to work together to get things done."
good,"a typical day at work starts with greeting my employees and customers. I have learned to have patience since i have been employed with Starbucks, especially being the busiest Starbucks around. Management was understanding and worked with employees to do better each and everyday. employees are very enjoyable to be around. the hardest part of the job was standing for long hours of the day. the most enjoyable part of this job was working with customers and making them laugh."
good,i am very happy to be part of this company that gives me a lot of experienced
good,taught me how to grow and provide great customer service in a fun way.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a pleasure. The biggest mistake I ever made was leaving this company. Starbucks provides you with stock, 41k, health insurance and benefit enrollment. The customers are super generous and loving. The company teaches you principals in customer service that you could never obtain elsewhere. BEST JOB EVER!!!!"
good,I would go into work and usually start on the drive through orders since i was quick at multitasking. It was my favorite part of the job because I'm pretty quick and starbucks it self is an extremely fast paced work place. Hardest part of my job was dealing with  morning grumpy coffee drinkers that were just un happy for no reason but i would usually put a smile on their face before walking out by cracking a joke or giving them awesome customer service
good,"the best job for those who's are starting to get their self together. Nice to work, you meet people, learn something new everyday. is worthy to be a partner."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks requires me to be an early riser, my typical day typically begins at 6:00am. Arriving at work we prepare for our peak hours to provide all our customers with their morning rush of coffee to get them through their day! Peak requires speed and efficiency, time management and muli-tasking is key. As the morning hours begin to wind down typically restocking and side work behinds, preparing the store for mid-day and evening workers and getting cleaning tasks done. I've gained immense amounts of customer service experience and understanding from Starbucks, from the happy and pleased customer to the not to content and bitter ones. I've learned how to defuse situations that otherwise could have escalated and been left unresolved as well as handle not-so-pleasent  situations and incidents with customers. I think that my favorite thing about Starbucks would have to be the employees, they become more like family than just people you work with. Each day(regardless of how stressful its been) always seems to end well with the amazing partners I've come to love over the last 1.5 years."
good,"Excellent benefits, great customer based environment. Very flexible schedule."
good,Have fun whilst working hard. A great job to develop your communication skills
good,"My overall experience with Starbucks was great."
good,"Starbucks is all about the third place environment that you create for the customer. First being home, second being work and third being Starbucks. "
good,I loved my job at Camilles.  Only reason I left is because I moved.
good,El ambiente es muy bueno. Aprendí a tener mejor trato con las personas y poder facilitar el habla. La parte mas difícil eran los cierres. Todo en si me gustaba del trabajo mi gerente y mis compañeros.
good,"Starbucks gives their employees every chance possible to advance but will not restrict any benefits if you do not. You get full medical, dental,vision,tuition reinbursment, paid time off, sick time, personal time and stock options as long as you average 20 hours a week. Also, free coffee. You will always meet new and interesting people and make lots of friends. It is, however a job for quick thinkers and people who can work in a fast paced environment. It is always fast paced."
good,What I liked about this company was being able to work someplace else when you either wanted to work more hours or you needed to go away for a little while. Most of the coworkers are easy to get along with.
good,"Dias digno de trabalho agradaveis, novas culturas ideias e desenvolvimentos, a Gerencia sempre ajudando a desenvolver, colegags de trabalho reunidos interagindo sempre e bem participantes, a parte mas agradavel era ir trabalhar todos os dias fazia bem esta no local de trabalho."
good,"I was with Starbucks for a few years. It was by far the best job I have had to date. I would come in and be greeted by other partners that enjoy working with you for that shift. "
good,"It'll be alot to learn but once learned its fun, easy, chill and an amazing place to work. Great pay, you WILL make good friends with management, partners & most of all...customers."
good,"Start is to open the store. Then brewing coffee, making drinks. The important part is to connect with people and serve the beverage as how they wanted. Each person differ on their taste. We share coffees or frap with friends by taking sip at Starbucks."
good,"This is a pretty great place to work, considering health care, and the fact that the company actually tries to make customer service/retail not as hard on the employees as it could be. This company cares about its employees and thats great!"
good,"Loved working at this place. The pay was decent for part-time work, the customers were pleasant and the management was on point. Always something to do there. I learned a great deal about teamwork and customer service working for Starbucks. Hardest part of the job was probably getting there at 4 AM to open the store. Most enjoyable was working at the drive-thru window and talking to the customers in the car."
good,It gave me a chance to better my communication skills with people. I alson enjoy the team work with my co worker
good,"Working with a great team to ensure great customer feedback"
good,"Starbucks provides a valuable work experience through customers and coworkers. Interaction with customers helps develop communication skills and positive interactions. In a hectic work environment such as Starbucks, you learn to develop problem solving skills and multitasking. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is providing quality beverages to customers and developing relationships with them to help make their experience at Starbucks memorable and significant."
good,this was one of my most favorite places of work the advancement in the company was wonderful they care about you and not only what you can do for the company

good,Very fast paced I learned how to make sure orders were correct I had a lot of fun. I really liked working with all my co-workers and managers.
good,"Assembled daily, weekly and quarterly reports, including sales and P&L; handled inventory control. Directed employee development and performance reviews; managed labor costs through scheduling."
good,Love the environment working in Starbucks! Encouraging place to work and other co-workers are called partners.
good,"The thing about Starbucks is..."
good,Fun place to work with great benefits (aside from pay). You have to deal with snobby customers but that's part of the job requirement.
good,"Starbucks was always a fun place to work at. You create and make connections with the customer. Learning to make the drinks was exciting and interesting. It was fun operating the drive-thru and we had busy days, which I love. I love having tons of customers and working in a fast-paced environment. I worked with a team of co-workers that knew how to get things done; everything was done efficiently and effectively."
good,Always busy and full of things to do however you always work as a team so your work load is split amongst you and the rest of the partners.
good,Starbucks was a lot of work but it taught me a lot about customer service and I met a lot of great people
good,all around great environment and company culture.  Great benefits ideal schedule plenty of room for advancement
good,Company cares about the partners. Taking care of the customers and giving them the Starbucks experience

good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for, from the amazing benefits to the uncompromising mission statement. This company has really taken care of their employees over the years. I truly value and appreciate the way they run business as a whole."
good,"Its fun communicating lot of difference nationalities at work"
good,"Amazing corporation to work for."
good,The general feeling and aura of Starbucks is very warm and is only accented by the brilliant customer service. I didn't feel pressured at all to finish my training and was helped every step along the way to becoming a fantastic Barista.
good,The only downside I can possibly think of in working for Starbucks is some of the High-maintenance customers that come in now and then. Other than that the job experience and atmosphere was great.
good,I became addicted to coffee while working at Starbucks.  Starbucks was the most fun job I've ever had.
good,"Starbucks will not just prepare you to perform in a coffee shop, it will also train you to develop a keen eye on detail, care for the quality of your product and craft, and build a more than friendly relationship with the people your work with and for. "
good,Great place to work extremely difficult to move up in the companies. Almost always hire management out side company.
good,"Cash handling, Customer service, delegating tasks, carrying the team."
good,it was amazing to work in Starbucks company. it was a new experience and challenging.
good,"Great job especially for college students. It gives you the flexibility needed. The work environment is fun, but can sometimes be overwhelming. The right team and management can get you through those moments!"
good,Cool workplace. Easy place to work as a student. Not a bad place to look for advancement.
good,"I enjoy the Starbucks Atmosphere. The customers are great! I have learned that there are many different people out there, and they are all different. Some are always happy and others are not, and can be difficult. Working in this public atmosphere I have learned to work with any personality type of a customer with a smile on my face. My co-workers are amazing and make the day much better. We work well together no matter how busy, or stressed out we are. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the difficult and impatient customers when we are extremely busy."
good,"Everyone works as a team and we have a great time work, when it comes to high pressure periods we all bulk down and get through the stressful period. I have worked for many different stores and seen varying types of management, but what I know is that the close net team of baristas and supervisors are the ones running the show and making it worth coming to work everyday."
good,Los horarios son perfectos para un estudiante puedes convinar tus estudios con el trabajo y tienes tienpo de hacer tareas es un ambiente muy agradable y juveinil convives con mucha gente clientes parners etc...Solo que ya no pasaba tiempo con mi hija por eso se me complico pero aprendi mucho
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. A typical day at work consists of providing excellent customer service and quality coffee beverages, as well as cleaning tasks to keep the overall integrity of the establishment. I've had good luck with nice, hard-working co-workers and store managers. The volume of customers can be overwhelming at times, but I have learned to focus and multi-task through this job and have learned to really enjoy it."
good,"I absolutely love my job! I get paid to make friends with my customers and be creative with coffee. A typical day includes laughter, lots of spills, learning fun facts from my customers, cleaning, and making lots of coffees. I have learned a ton about coffee, but also what it's like to have a manager who really cares about you. The management has the same quirks that all stores have when you people a group of people with different education and backgrounds together. The difference is that you know they all care about the end product...the store and our guests. The hardest part of my job is remembering all of the special ways that we do things to make peoples' visit that much better. We go above and beyond to the point where I can't always remember it all! The most enjoyable part is definitely the fact that it's a cafe store where I get to talk to my customers. They know me, so if I make their drink wrong, they're not afraid to let me know and help me learn."
good,"Those of us who have worked at Starbucks know it's a pretty unique experience. I highly recommend this job for someone struggling to pursue art or a freelance field as they are very flexible and have plenty of opportunity for advancement if you so choose. Also, the free coffee isn't something you usually see."
good,"A Typical day at work is not very stressful because all of the employees are hard workers. What I have learned is about all business aspects of a corporation, even including about stock. A new manager is place at this location and is proving to be a major asset to this store and the district. The people that work at this location are all extremely friendly and helpful, they will quickly make anyone feel like a part of a family. "
good,"A typical day at work depends on the shift (open/mid/close) but there is never a shortage of things to do. I have learned a lot over the years about different ways to run a business, ways to deal with customers, ways to deal with co-workers and obviously, different ways to prepare beverages. The store management has always been relatively fair and hard working, while the the district management is always goal orientated (sales, profit etc.). The hardest part of the job is the same as any customer service industry and that is dealing with difficult customers. On the flip side, the most enjoyable part of the job is the great customers and great staff."
good,"Uma empresa extremamente agradável de se trabalhar, com diversas oportunidades de crescimento. Foca muito o atendimento ao cliente, fazendo com que se sintam em um lugar único onde sempre podem se refugiar num dia difícil. Os funcionários sempre são ouvidos e bem informados a respeito de procedimentos, benefícios e novidades em geral. Uma empresa com responsabilidades social, trabalha em parceria com instituições em prol de comunidades carentes e foco no desenvolvimento de crianças sem condições de estudo. A equipe é super receptiva e agradável. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era mantes assiduidades dos funcionários nos fins de semana e feriados, o fluxo de clientes era muito grande para a quantidade de funcionários que a loja comportava. A parte mais agradável era atender um cliente e poder passar toda a experiencia de atendimento produtos e ambiente que tinha a oferecer, fazer uma degustação para ele e ser presenteado com elogios e um sorriso de satisfação no rosto de cada cliente atendido."
good,i liked working at starbucks because it was a fun-loving enviorment. i did on the other hand have a little problem with the management because of my school schedule.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  Their benefits package is beyond great.  I just wish they paid a bit more.
good,"Corporate treats the employees very well. I learned SO much about coffee and teas. The hardest part of the job is probably the first week when everything seems so overwhelming. It feels like you'd NEVER be able to learn all the beverages on the menu. Once you get the hang of it though, it's pretty easy. You end up meeting some great people, co workers and customers."
good,"i enjoyed the whole environment,and knowledge of the coffee industry and i learned how to run a register from them"
good,"The particular Starbucks that I am employed at is always busy and there is not much time for slacking. I have dealt with some ""hard customers"" that are very impatient when we are busy. My co-workers are great, and we all work well together. The hardest part of my job would be keeping every customer satisfied, no matter how busy we are. Customer service is very important to our company, and it is a challenge to keep every customer that walks through that door happy. We try our hardest and are very understanding and accommodating. I love the environment that I work in it is always a great shift."
good,Everyone was easy to work with and I enjoyed my time photographing their conference.
good,Great place to work! They give you full benefits for only working part time.
good,"Greeted each customer with a smile and provided exceptional customer service"
good,Working at Starbucks is probably the most fun place I have worked...I enjoy getting to know customers on a personal level and preparing drinks to the customers liking. Working as a team is not even a question at starbucks we are all family there. its like as soon as we open I feel like we are on an assembly line....on slow points of the day we try to make new drink combinations and sample them...there was not really any hard points.
good,"Perfect job for a mom with little kids in need of a flexible schedule. Love the job, love the partners I worked with. Great benefits, free coffee, 401K match, free stock..."
good,"El tiempo de tu jornada laboral no se siente mucho ya que tiene una gran afluencia de clientes, a cualquier hora del dia."
good,"Very fun, inspiring work place. Minimum wage but incredible benefits"
good,"Favorite job I have ever had. Stayed there for a long time and had a great time every single day. Great co-workers and supervisors. I got to know a lot about coffee. The best company i have ever worked for as far as values,love, and overall passion for the company. The only con was the actual manger of the store could never get in contact with, spent most of her time in New York and never really cared for her position which eventually lead to her downfall."
good,"You usually have to bounce around between either making the drinks or ringing people in. Otherdays could consist of store support which is basically running a marathon all day long to make sure everything is cleaned and stocked. You certainly learn how to deal with less than polite people, and how to stand for 8 hours a day. My manager was super nice and cared about everyone, she did a fantastic job and was like a second mother to everyone. Coworkers were typically nice and not the bottom of the barrel when it came to who was chosen. Hardest part of the job is getting screamed at over coffee, even if you made it right. Most enjoyable part would definitely be the partners and some of the stories they have to tell."
good,I love making things happen because so I enjoy seeing things through because of good working relationships. The tribal knowledge allows for any kinks to be easily resolved and the people here are great about connecting you with others to help you head in the right direction.
good,I have extremely loved working for Starbucks. I enjoy the team that I work with and the beautiful people who come into our store everyday. Since having a Starbucks in Mountain Village Telluride is such a big deal and change....the people who come in are always very excited and happy!
good,"A typical day at starbucks was ful of fast pace and laughter, it was fun and easy to get along with everybody working and employees. i absolutly loved working there. The manager Mark Czena was the best manager in the entire world. He would help with schedualing and was very understanding to any problems in work or outside of work. He was stricts but also easy to handle. The customers were fun and enjoy the fact that you talk to them."
good,"What is great about Starbucks is that its one of a few company that offers flexible scheduling to it's employee.  Besides giving good health insurance to its worker, it also offers stock/401K, and recognize domestic partnership in the LGBTIQ community."
good,"I found Starbucks to be an excellent place to work, full of opportunity and well valued employees. I personally had an open schedule, so I would often times close around 10pm just to open at 4:30am. It took a bit of the toll, but the work I put in definitely showed and was appreciated."
good,"I worked at this job for 6 years. I loved my co-workers, customers, every 6 months raises and benefits, as well as the job itself being enjoyable. I would say the only downside would be how hard it is to be promoted from within and some of the managers they decide to hire. Most of the management team (at least at my store) were outside hires and, although had previous experience in management, knew nothing about Starbucks. Having a manager that knows less than you can be at times upsetting, but all the positives of the job more than outweigh the negatives."
good,"Starbucks was by far the most phenomenal job you can have. So what if you have to be at work by 4:15 am, you get free coffee to perk you up. Opening was a breeze. From counting cash drawers, setting up the pastry case and setting out caraffes, you are setting your day up for success. I learned that there are a ton of different people out there. My partners are prime examples of how people can vary. And I loved everyone of them, from their different hairstyles to style of dress, forms of religion and opinions."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is busy. My co-workers are mostly females, but are all very fun to work with. They are outgoing and hard workers. I have a wonderful manager who works very hard and is supportive of our decisions as a team. The hardest part of the job is how stressful it can be. It gets very busy and we have deadlines for each car or person that we have to meet. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to drink coffee as much as you want and my co-workers. I always have a good time with them. I learned how to be a good multi-tasker and how to deal with stressful situations. This job entails that you are responsible and always on time."
good,"Starbucks in Summit is a fantastic environment to work in."
good,"Working at a coffee shop is never boring, there are always something happening that you will never understand or you just have to laugh about. Lots of hard work, sweat, laughter and friendly interactions is what it took to make every customers walk out of the store happy."
good,"Loved it one of my favorite jobs. "
good,Great place to work! Very horrible hours from July-September! Other then that the hours are 35+. Its a fast paste working environment and everyone is like a family
good,"I worked for Starbucks Coffee Company as a Barista Trainer. I've been working for Starbucks as soon as I started my college career in 2005. I started off as a regular Barista handcrafting high quality coffee and tea beverages and got promoted to Barista Trainer training new employees of the company. That allowed me to go to other locations and do the same thing. A typical day at work required me to open a lot so I woke up at 4:30 in the morning and head to work at 5:30 and prep the machines and other inner workings of the store. My store was a drive-thru location so not only did I work with customers in-house but I also took care of my customers through drive-thru. If there were new any hires I would go through with them the in's and out's of the company and get them prepped on the basics of being a Starbucks Barista, and what makes us different from other coffee shop establishments. What I learned from Starbucks is that it's not like any other coffee shop out there, we really take the time out to make a unique beverage for every person. The company does believe in uniting the person with a cup of coffee and if we were able to do that every single time we hand a cup off, we've done our job. My management and co-workers were the best to work with, my managers hired people who were completely different from one another but somehow we can work together in unison. I've seen so many people in my career who are so passionate about coffee and that's what I loved about my job as a Barista Trainer. The hardest part my job was waking up so early, I wake up earlier than most people in"
good,I don't drink coffee and this was supposed to be a temporary job. The culture was so amazing though I ended up working there 5 years. The customers can be a little much at times but you also get customers that are above and beyond some of your regular friends.
good,Close knit team members. I have learned a lot management tools to help me excel in my supervisor position. My manager is very personable and approachable with any conflicts that I encounter. The hardest part of the job is not having the opportunity to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to connect with customers on a personal level.
good,"overall Starbucks is a great company to work for, great partners, great management, great benefits, etc. Super satisfied with the learning process or ""starbucks culture"", I've learned so far the difference qualities of the coffee we make on the daily basis."
good,The job was awesome and so were the people. To bad everything moved overseas.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks because there would always be something to do.
good,"I started with Starbucks when I was 17 and was able to move to management within the first six months. I continued as a manager for the next five years and my responsibilities involved planning, directing, organizing, and controlling my team. Along with extensive cash handling and banking I was in charge of all the Inventory orders. I take great pride in making quality beverages and was one of the first baristas to make it through the “Coffee Master “ program in our region."
good,Starbucks was an amazing experience for me. While going to college full time I worked here full time. I was able to being work at 4:30 am and finish by 1 pm. This way I still had time to study and dedicate time to school while receiving a work experience. I was fortunate enough to be promoted and have the opportunity to receive a management experience.
good,I loved working for starbucks but did not care for management at the store i worked at.
good,I've grown up here and the only reason I'm looking for a different job is because I'm not crazy about living in Seattle. Most of the jobs I am interested in to continue working for Starbucks are located in Seattle.
good,"-As a supercisor a typical day consists of making sure all open/close procedures are followed as well as keeping track of customer and partner needs. "
good,My experience was largely positive. As a supervisor I had an amazing experience. The job is physically and mentally challenging but the company rewards its employees with competitive pay and excellent benefits. 
good,Starbucks has alot of good qualities that work for the company. I have learned how the customer comes first. Management has really shown insight on how customer and employee relations help the company. The hardest part about this job was learning the different kinds of drinks to make. The most enjoyable part is The opportunity to work for a great company.
good,I am a recent college graduate and Starbucks was a great job for me to have during my college career. They worked with my schedule and challenged me to adapt in a dynamic environment. 
good,"I am mostly a closer at Starbucks and it is my favorite shift to work. My customers are all very friendly and enjoyable. I am very thankful to have been able to start at a licensed store and move up to a corporate store. I learned to move fast paced but still making genuine connections with each customer and making their day. My manager is amazing and goes out of her way for us and makes sure we are happy. The hardest part is making sure all of the taskinbg gets done by the end of the night, but the closing team we have are all very hard workers. The most enjoyable part is working with your friends and meeting new people each day. There is never a dull moment at Starbucks"
good,"As a License store District Manager, I spent my days visiting Licensed stores.  It was my responsibility to build a trusting relationship with the Manager's of these locations through training , quality checks, making sure that all operations were up to the highest Starbucks standards and reviewing of mystery customer shopping reports.   "
good,"It's my company, and I'm The Only One, so of course I like where I work and what I get to do!"
good,Amazing company; very well run and extremely efficient. Great environment within the staff. 
good,"Everything about this job was exciting. The mission statement was a positive one, the management and staff at each location I worked were great. We provided outstanding service. Even when I'd visit as just a regular customer the staff was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed coming to work each and everyday! I'm very proud and often brag about being a former Starbucks Barista.This is by far my all-time favorite job I've ever had. "
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for, they provide a very good training, they show you how to do your job and at the same time the give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. "
good,Working at Starbucks allowed me to work on a part time basis when I needed to also be at home.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, I learned a lot about customer service and how to assist customers with their needs. My co-works have been pretty awesome, most pull their weight and are considerate of each other. The hardest part of my job were the customers that you just can't please, you try the best you can to make their experience a good one but maybe they are just having a bad and no matter what you do its not going to change that, but on the other hand when you are able to cheer someone up and put that smile on their face thats the best part!"
good,"This is a very rewarding career company or part time job, whichever you choose.  Starting pay is low, but performance reviews and opportunities for advancement are abundant.  Health insurance and stock benefits are available for part-time employees."
good,Hard work in a fun environment were I as an employee feel valued by  the company. The CEO supports core company values and leads by example. High quality products and high quality partners for the most. 
good,"working at starbucks allowed me to furthur my career and be able to do what i wanted to do. i really enjoyed working hand in hand with customers, i could also appreciate the fact that Starbucks acknowledged my work ethic. They saw that i was capable and i recieved a shift supervisors position within a year of being there, I had to quit my job because of a serious car wreck, i was unable to get to work and be an asset to my company,"
good,"A typical work day starts at 4am performing all the opening tasks and getting the store ready for the day. I learned what goes into running and maintaining a coffee shop through the morning rush. The Store Manager works with you to help you learn and grow professionally, giving  you opportunities to move up with the company. All of the co-workers are friends and often hang out outside of work. They are always welcoming to new people and are a big part of what contributes to the comfortable work environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all that needs to get done during the rushes, and maintaining a steady work flow while monitoring the store from the customer's perspective. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and sharing my knowledge of coffee. It is always a pleasure to see and greet the regular customers who return every morning."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at this company from day 1. I was not only concerned about getting a job to pay off my tuition loans but I was enthusiastic about working in an environment where support and positive reinforcement were readily available, where management stands by one principle and that is satisfaction of its employees which is passed on to its customers. A typical day would start off at 5:30 am, where we would prepare ourselves by setting up the espresso machines, sanitizing, putting together our patio, and planning ahead for the unfolding of the days events. The hardest part of the job is probably the physical aspect from lifting heavy cartons of milk to pulling out a bag of coffee grinds from a bin. The most enjoyable part are getting to meet new people by the minute and being able to share an experience with them, also known as 'The Starbucks experience'. This is more of a personal incentive and satisfaction that i get from being able to create this experience into one that makes them to want to come back and re-live that experience."
good,"Starbucks is more than a company. Working with your fellow partners through long rush lines early in the morning creates a family bond. Starbucks has taught me to communicate better, speak up, multi-task more efficiently, and adjust to different job tasks and scenarios quickly."
good,"Starbucks is an awesome place to work. Your co-workers become family, always there to help each other out. Our manager always had our back no matter what. Couldn't of asked for a better team. The hardest part of the job was when you start out stressing if you're making the drink correctly for the customer. The most enjoyable part is when you get the drinks down and feel you could make them with your eyes closed."
good,This job teaches you a great deal about aligning your personal values and business values! It is much easier to have a life where you can wear the same hat all the time. Management was good although Upper Management was really out of balance with Starbucks core values in our area. Customers rock! Place rocks! Company rocks!
good,"An excellent company to work for, great people, fast paced."
good,"I worked here during my diagnostic sonography schooling. It was a part time job with medical benefits. I would recommend this job to anyone. Starbucks worked around my school schedule. It was fast, hard work, but fun."
good,"Working at Starbucks as my first real job was perfect! I could not have chosen a better job to start out with. I had the privledge to learn how to work based on ""fast, efficient, and quality"". Communication was really clear and easy. It was only a matter of time, based around the individuals desires, before you could advance into a shift leader position!"
good,The workload here is very high as well as high stress. There is so much to do and clean within a shift but the banter between coworkers and customers is priceless.
good,"great company to work for, tips are average. def. room for growth"
good,They are very flexible with work hours and personal life complications. I would definitely work here again.
good,"Cada minuto de tu jornada estaba totalmente planeado, no habia tiempo de no hacer nada, y eso hacia mas corto mi dia, las horas se te pasan volando. Aprendi mucho sobre empresas socialmente responsables, ya que esta es una que contamina mucho, por su tipo de limpieza e higiene tan estricta. Pero al mismo tiempo tenian muchas campañas de reciclaje y apoyo al medio ambiente y tambien social."
good,"I arrive for my shift and ask my shift supervisor where I would be assigned. From the assignment (coffee bar or register or float) I would start my duties: stocking, cleaning, and greeting customers in assigned area. I would usually close which meant cleaning everything and making sure everything is ready to go in the morning. I learned how to make drinks, work as part of a team, and quite a bit about the customers who frequented the shop. I also was educated on the background of coffee as well as all new products. Management was wonderful very flexible and attentive to the needs of employees. Co-workers at this location were the best I could have asked for: hard working, intelligent, and genuinely cooperative. The hardest part of the job was being extremely busy with no end to the line of customers. The most enjoyable part was definitely the people."
good,They have the highest level of standards for their product and employees.
good,"I began my career with Starbucks Coffee Co., opening the Oklahoma market, store by store. As a member of the Star Team, I led very dedicated, passionate and driven individuals to reach their highest potential both personally and professionally. We believed in more than just great coffee! I enjoyed the ten years I spent with Starbucks and believe that it was a great professional foundation."
good,"Starbucks es un gran empresa para trabajar y estudiar, ofrece salarios justos, muchas prestaciones por encima de la ley, aprendes una cultura de trabajo muy buena y el ambiente de trabajo es muy agradable."
good,"Starbucks is a very easy going, friendly enviroment. However; working at Starbucks in the airport is 10 times harder and more stressful then any other Starbucks. The hours are very early or very late, which can consume your life if you let it, but on the bright side I work with an amazing crew that will brighten anybodys day, and our group of managers are phenomoinal hard working individuals. That makes it their business to provide their employees with a fun, loving and safe enviroment."
good,"i love this job, its not something id do forever but i love the ppl i love the partners. its a great job that comes with all kinds of benefits you can think of, even college credit for your job training, c'mon. amazing ! i mean the management isn't always the best at stores but the workers make up for it all (:"
good,I learned that customers are very particular about the perfect cup of coffee and to have them leaving with a smile and gratitude for it being to their personal taste was always a job well done. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for 8 hrs but having happy customers was worth it. We functioned well as each co-worker had their positions and our mission to meet customers need was all the same.
good,"my typical day at work was very fast pace, everything always on time. i learned to work with different personalities, team work every day all day, to resolve and handle problematic costumers and always try to make them feel everything could be done just so the can leave happy and satisfied."
good,I've learned a lot of communication skills and customer service skills. Managers are very accurate on break times and making sure you get off when you're scheduled to get off. Free drinks during your shift and you get 30% off all the time. The customers are sometimes difficult but the regulars make up for it.
good,-learned to make several beverages
good,"This was my first job where I dealt with the mass public. At first it was a struggle but after a few months it was amazing. This was the first time where I needed to provide customer service face to face. But that was not a problem at all, I had great customers and great team of co-workers."
good,"typical day greeting customers and making coffee, i learned how to make fantastic lattes and how to close the store. my co-workers are hilarious and nice. the hardest part of the job was not to drink the coffee! The best part was that i had a fun time while working there."
good,"If getting to work very early in the morning, interacting with hundreds of amazing customers (and a few tough ones!) while relentlessly coaching and teaching your partners sounds like fun, then Starbucks is definitely the job for you! Don't fool yourself, long hours, tough conversations and lots of sweat. BUT the environment and culture is second to none. The pay may initially seem low, but if you hit your metrics your bonuses more than make up for an initially low salary."
good,I made coffee very fast and as professional as possible for rude people who could afford $5 lattes.
good,Busy day with lots of smiles. Fun place to work and network. Management prepares you for what may come as well as build leadership skills.
good,A typical day on the job was too push sales of new products to keep up with sales expected for the day and implemented alot of suggestive selling. Management and co-workers were outstanding people to work with.
good,- 5 days a week / 10hrs a day
good,A typical day at work is pretty full. There is always something to do at Starbucks. Through Starbucks I've learned the importance of good communication skills. My co-workers next to the customers are the best part of the job. I don't know what I'd do without them. The hardest part of of the job is the rushes but they're over before you know it.
good,"Typical day at work would be, making coffee variety of diiferent drinks made to the customers expertice, fun, enjoyable as well, while making there drinks i interact with each customer and some are regulars so its fun to keep your regulars relationships going. Cashier go back and forth from making drinks and doing the cashier duties which there both my favorite i enjoy both just as much as the other. Heating up pastries or doing inventory for the manager to help them out with we get busy or have to many things that need to get done within a certain time period. Stocking refilling emptying out syrup bottles or organizing them in the back. Helping customers decide what drinks they should try, letting them know about some of our secret drinks weve learned to create over the years and passed on to other co-workers and customers such as captain crunch frap thats my favorite most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customer and creating suprising delicous un-thought of drinks for them to enjoy and want again. The hardest part , i have to say i dont think there is any, i didnt hate anything or thought anything was hard. My co-workers i always got along with just fine, we had fun and loved working and helping eachother. Management was always good, manager was fun and consistant with all they did. I would learn new ways to make different drinks every day but messing around with the different syrups and creams etc there is to make a starbucks drink. Overall my day at work working for starbucks i have to say was and is so far the best job ive ever had and was my very first"
good,"Love the coffee Fridays, and the free coffee. My area had too many treats; so be prepared to walk-it off. Laid back environment, but people work hard with no complaining, and are happy to be there.. I had flexible hours,though I was a contractor. Management was great. The hardest part of the job is the parking. Complaint: Parking is off site, and the shuttle rides can add another 15 - 30 minutes to the commute. But that would be my only complaint. It is a great place to work!!!"
good,"I like this company because of how much they care about their employee. When I asked for more hours, They could not give them to me. So, My manager asked around to other locations and helped me maintain a full paycheck. That was a plus. I think one has to like coffee to like this job but that may simply be one opinion. Id work there again if given the chance. actually, I trying to find a location currently."
good,"It is always a busy, high-pace environment. The best part of the job is getting to work with your partners (we don't say coworker because there is that relationship and connection you build with others you wouldn't get at another employment) and get to joke but also complete our tasks by maintaining our stores. In the community we work in Bayside, our customers are regulars. So there is that friendliness and great service they get they wouldn't receive at another Starbucks."
good,Needed better benefits and more money. But overall this was a fun place to work.
good,A typical day at Starbucks is demanding and requires constant work. It's just not about serving customers but also Baristas have to maintain Company's brand name and great reputation.
good,"I enjoy going in to work. My duties are specifically outlines, but customers break any possible boring moments. It is a fast-paced environment with supportive coworkers and managers."
good,"I truly enjoy working for Starbucks, being self employed, I had initially secured a part time Barista position in pursuit of health insurance and employee benefits that are not available to a small business. I love the fast pace and interacting with the customers, it is a company that you feel proud to work for and be a part of."
good,"Starbucks Coffee is an environment that not only is welcoming but it strives to fit the workers needs. I worked there for more than five months. All in all Starbucks will always be there for you and your million and one combinations of coffee. They suit all needs of caffeine and are as festive as ever when it comes to halloween and christmas. My manager always kept you in the right with a confident smile and always made sure you were 'okay' and that each customer was treated the same way- with a happy 'hello, hows your day been'. i personally like there touch with the names on the cups, it invites both the co-worker and customer to have more interaction- which is what Starbucks strives for. Anyone that is part of the team will always feel like there part of a working family. If you have the right attitude Starbucks is a great place to work."
good,Typical day of work usually goes one of 3 ways:
good,"benefits for part time employees, schedules are flexible and easy to live with, and the customers are like family usually!"
good,Its a fun and relaxing environment to work. You work hard but you never have a dull moment.
good,"A typical day would be assigning tasks to fellow employees during a each shift, as well as taking care of customers and connecting with them on a personal level."
good,I loved the bustle and energy of being a barista! Starbucks treats their employees very well - no complaints
good,"A typical day includes making coffee, and everything that goes into making coffee, talking about coffee, and tasting new coffee. Making conversation with customers and developing genuine connections. There is light cleaning duties and monetary accountability also involved. Management is very supportive and they have worked in all positions within the store so they know how everything works and can jump in when needed. Co-workers are friendly and very diverse. The hardest part of the job is staying away from the pastry case. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connection with customers."
good,*make beverages
good,"Starbucks was the best company to work for, I loved my job up until the end. :)"
good,A typical day at work for me was full of smiles and laughter and a fast paced style of working.
good,a typical day at work for me was full of smiles and laughter and a fast paced style of working.
good,Marketing Research for Starbucks was one of the best experiences of my working life.
good,"A great place to work. Loved every second of it. Although management is always up and down, but other then that is was great!"
good,"Very early hours, but great hours, prepare the store for the day, and then prepare the store for the next shift. Always an opportunity to train in variouis different areas, plenty of classes to take for advancement. I have learned all there is to learn about the process of coffee. The most enjoyable was learning to make new drinks. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all the drink recipes."
good,"Working at Starbucks is exhausting mentally and physically because the job description is basically ""extroverted."" I have learned so much here though and it really is such an uplifting environment. The only reason why I sound a little bitter is because I have been told I will be promoted for the past 9 months and someone else keeps getting the job. If I am not guaranteed to get the job, why tell me I will!"
good,"A typical work day is making coffee, deploying partners, cash management, and day to day sales and labor forecasts. I have learned how to teach people in many ways and that everyone reponds to differently to every siduation. I have learned to take cues from employees and customers alike to prevent siduations or try to assist them in any way. I have been in management for a few years now, I think management could be more consistant, not through out every store, but on a I told you no so there are consicquences now kinda way. My co-workers are a hugde part of my life outside of work, we help each other move, with socail and finacial problems. The hardest part of my job is when the store manager says one thing to me and something else to employees. I love new products and sampling. I also love the contests!"

good,starbuck has wonderful employees and customers on a daily basis.
good,"Great place to work and have a flexible schedule. Full benefits for 20 hours or more. Teaches you how to take care of people with great customer service. With it being retail, hard to take time off or work life balance, especially as a manager. Focus on goals and hitting sales."
good,"A typical day included having fun crafting all sorts of beverages. Learning the menu the first day may seem daunting, but as time went by it became second nature. I learned a lot about coffee textures, colors, and where they were grown. The co-workers were always great people who became friends even after leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was the beverage crafting. Artistically fun!!"

Followed health, safety, and sanitations guidelines for all products."
good,I love the gig.
good,"Never have I worked for a company that cares s much for its employees, Not just at your store location, but company wide. The first thing that impressed me was after the initial interview with the store manager, the district manager traveled 2.5 hours to meet me and welcome me to the company with a one on one coffee tasting, as he does with all new employees. I was welcomed in from the first day as a long lost family member by all team members. Training was fantastic. Everyone is extreamly helpful during the learning process. The company itself has an outstanding moral standing and obligation to not only store partners, but the people that grow the coffee, the people that roast the coffee. The company has partner assistance programs in the case of a personal emergancy to assist in the payment of bills that associates can donate to. There is an adoption assistance program. I have not one complaint about working for Starbucks. Its a dream job. It is a fast paced job and you do have to LOVE people and being social with customers, but it was always very uplifting for myself to have the freedom to become close friends, (something very encouraged at starbucks) with the customers."
good,Always busy. I was fun to taste test and make new drinks for new promotions. I learned how to make a lot of drinks. Customers have a lot of different ways to customer drinks. This was a fun environment.
good,"I stayed with Starbucks for about 3 years and 8 months. I was on a partner development plan to take on my own store. I know near everything there is to know about daily operations, ordering, policies, P.O.S. troubleshooting, recipes, training, cleaning, audits, cash-handling, etc. I had 2 home stores, and was able to pick up hours from 11 different locations during my employment as a partner. The benefits are outstanding, and I developed close relationships with my customers and co-workers in various locations. I was a shift manager in both locations, the second being a much more fast-paced environment. Cross-selling and up-selling was daily. I trained and guided partners to adhere to all policies, procedures, recipes, deployment, customer care, cash-handling, etc. I participated and excelled in various district competitions from up-selling to drink creations. I had become a trusted and accountable partner to both store teams, and worked in all different hours from morning, to night."
good,"Starbucks is not your typical coffee house, But much more than that. A typical day a starbucks would have to consist of, Making beverages in a timely manner, Cashiering duties, Taking customer orders, interacting with customers making them feel welcomed at our location, Answering customers concerns, complaints, And questions. At Starbucks I learned how to better my Customer Service skills, I love interacting with customers and making sure to receive repeat business. Much so that I was promoted to Learning Coach, Training new hires was one of my favorites, but one of the hardest things about this job would have to be, there really wasn’t. Overall the employee’s, The customers, and management made this job a blast and very memorable."
good,"Starbucks has great employees and hours are very flexible, great managers and great benefits."
good,I loved working here. It felt like a second home to me. The customers were so friendly. I loved the environment and seeing different faces everyday. Just seeing a customer leave with a smile after serving them their beverage made my day a whole lot better then it already was.

good,"The job itself was very enjoyable, fast paced, and easy to learn. The team I worked with was a family inside the work."
good,"Starbucks was amazing. I loved the work. The employees were great and the customers were awesome. I started working there because a friend of mines enjoyed her job there so much! The advancement opportunities at Starbucks are incredible. The first week I worked there they were already talking about wanting to promote me to supervisor, but because of policy I had to wait at least 3 months. After a month and a half of being promoted, they wanted to promote me again to assistant manager with the hopes of becoming a manager and then finally a district manager. I declined because at the time I was still in school and my availability would have needed to be completely open in order to take any further management positions. Ultimately my school schedule caused me to change employment but I would work for Starbucks again in a heart beat! They are a company that really appreciates and values their employees. I give this company a personal GPA of 4.0 Perfect!"
good,There are parties during summer where they pass out free drinks and play music. The people are great to get along with. I really enjoyed the management. They liked working with you and they didn't look down at you because they made more money or because they have a better position then you do. Very Diversed!!
good,"Over the past 6 years, Starbucks definitely helped me grow and become more understanding of everyone around me. I believe in myself no matter the scenario I’m thrown into.

good,"If you can't be on your feet for the entire shift this might not be for you, but it will be one of the most fun and fast-paced jobs ever. The culture is amazing and very inclusive."
good,Good culture and management. Good Benefits. Flexible schedule for me as a working student. You will grow in this company as a person and individual. Team player is indeed a one of the traits you need to have.
good,"Working for Starbucks has been a great experience. Not only do they have great benefits, but the atmosphere and the people are wonderful. My coworkers are great, along with the customers and managers. While working for Starbucks, one of the most challenging things was working at a fast pace, while also trying to keep the customer connection; multitasking."
good,Starbucks had taught me so many great aspects that I can use in any situation and position. It was a great place to learn and grow in all experiences and opened so many doors for growth and knowledge.

good,"Starbucks was an amazing first job. I had other jobs that were camp counselor related, so this was my first ""real"" job. Starbucks has great benefits, and it was an extremely fun workplace. It was professional enough to teach me important skills like time management, but still fun enough to keep a high schooler entertained while working there."

good,"Loved working here, miss it lots!! Lots of opportunities to grow. Mostly everyone I worked with was awesome they did have a lot of in and out employees but I think that’s because of high stress"
good,Una experiencia formativa lo recomiendo mucho como primer o segundo empleo
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had Starbucks was my favourite. Not only was it a healthy and supportive place to work, but it was comparative in a way that didn't make you feel inferior. The management in my district was intuitive to each store's needs, and an excellent representation of Starbucks's values. There is always something to do and it switched up every shift so you never got bored. I would not recommend this as a first job, though it is entry level, the fast paced environment is not for anxious or typically lazy people, or people with bad attitudes - and the connections you make with customers, especially regulars, will stay with you long after you move on or move up the chain."
good,"I have only been with the company for a little over 6 months now, and I could not be happier. Starbucks offers many amazing employee benefits, and I work with the most welcoming and hardworking crew of partners."

good,"It was amazing working for this company. They have so many benefits and I really loved making coffee and connecting with the customers. We had a lot of people who often came back. It was a great feeling not only for myself, but for the customer when you already knew their order and their name."
good,Overall an incredibly Positive work environment to be around and grow from. Demanding a lot of skills and strong work ethic of all its team members. Would recommend
good,"Worked here during college, great environment for students. Everyday it is important to stick to the schedule. Learned plenty about cash management and you almost always have the support of the managers around you."
good,I was a shift supervisor and this is the best job to have if you are going to do customer service because the pay is above average and hours are the most flexible.
good,Great place to work. Highly recommend for either a first job but also for students or someone who is looking for a second job. The schedule is very flexible for these common reasons.
good,"I worked at the Starbucks in Medford and I absolutely loved it. Waking up in the morning was the hardest part but that was only until I got use to it. The management was very helpful and didn't make me feel bad, when I would make mistakes."
good,I absolutely loved working there and would work at Starbucks again. The starbucks i worked at had an amazing work culture and everyone was close and friendly.

Great experience I would go back and do it again"

good,"The workplace setting is fun however, in the busy periods it can be quite stressful. During the holiday season, hours are extremely easy to come by. In the summer however, hours are slim."
good,"We get to create handcrafted beverages, serve awesome customers, try new things, empower one another to thrive, etc. The hardest part is keeping up with the volume of customers. It can be a stressful place to work but fun if you don't burn out easily. Management is for the most part flexible and understanding; they are trained to assume the best in others. The work culture here is to keep everything in accordance to 'standards'."

good,"I've worked many places in my life, and Starbucks has by far been the best place. There's drama in every work place, but for the most part, my store does a great job of keeping things drama free. The customers, for the most part, are good tippers, and a lot of them are usuals who genuinely seem interested in getting to know you as a person, and not just thinking of you as the person who hands them their coffee every day. There are opportunities to grow with the company if you stay long enough, and work hard enough. While the job can be hard, busy, and stressful at times, most of your fellow baristas and your shift leaders will always do their best to help you out. You also have the opportunity to sign up for a  bunch of great benefits, such as health insurance, stocks, and you're even entered into the Starbucks Cup Fund, which is money donated from fellow baristas that helps aid other baristas in need. I'd definitely suggest this job to anyone who thinks they could handle the pressures of barista life."

good,Starbucks is a company that cares about it's partners. Training prepares new partners very well to perform well. My manager at encouraged tastings so we could make better recommendations. My coworkers are true team players and delights to work with. I look forward to every shift. The hardest part of the job is learning the menu and learning how to make the drinks and handle food items. It was fun to learn about coffee and coffee culture. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and employees. Starbucks has great vibes that leads to a good day.

However, if you can get in when you can afford to live off of the wage and take advantage of the amazing benefits, like education assistance you cannot beat it."

Starbucks expects employees to greet every customer, ask for their name, and ensure their satisfaction before they leave. This helps maintain regular relationships with customers you see every day."
good,J'ai passé un agréable moment à apprendre avec les autres membres de l'équipe qui était toujours présent et toujours à l'écoute. Une très belle expérience

I always felt like I was free to truly be myself there and I loved being able to connect so much with the customers. The fast paced environment made the day go by quick and having fun was encouraged. Highly recommend this company!"

good,"This job includes learning how to perform every role within the team, being a self starter on tasks and working together as a unified team. The skills gained from this position help with moving forward as a valuable team member in future en devours."
good,"As soon as you punch in, work depends on what your coworkers are currently doing. If someone is stocking up, then you go help at the register and making drinks. If it is busy, then you go restock any and all supplies that are needed. Teamwork is essential for everything to be run smoothly. Throughout the shift, you are expected to maintain a clean environment, meaning that if there is a spill in the dining area or behind the counter, we need to work as a team to effectively clean the area. The manager is always present, either helping out in the work area or helping out customers."

It os fast pacedso if your looking for a kick back easy job this isnt the place. If you like a challenge and like to serve others then this is the place for you!
good,"Lots of hard work goes into being a barista but if you have a supportive team at your back- it's a ton of fun! I feel that sense of community and support from Starbucks both with my location, as well as the company as a whole. There are so many benefits and I felt that people really cared about me overall.

good,"From the Store Manager to the Baristas, all of us have a fun time no matter if we are busy or slow. We all support each other and make sure we get the job done."
good,"Starbucks, overall, is a wonderful place to work. If you can handle a fast-paced environment and working through different tasks, it's great. It helps you learn so much about different types of coffees and how coffee is grown, what different roasts taste like, how to work efficiently on a team, and help customers who are upset by resolving their problems quickly. The culture is great and it's usually pretty diverse. The hardest part of the job is when it is busy and the lines are long - you can't afford to make mistakes and slow it down having to correct them. But the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know regulars and their orders and building those relationships with them over the one thing most everyone has in common - a love of coffee."
good,You won't regret the experience. Every day is interesting and it's so fun to see cusomters faces light up when they see their drink. Go in ready to work hard and have fun and you'll never have a bad day!

good,"I was happy working in Starbucks as Barista. Staff is so good there way of treating an employee is excellent : )"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great place to meet new people, learn about great customer service, learn about great coffee, and just plain work. The job taught me so much that carried over to my future jobs, and allowed me to meet friends that I have stayed in touch with for years. I highly recommend this job for those in university and school as it really is a flexible place to work, and the tuition reimbursement benefit is icing on top."
good,"After almost two years I still thoroughly enjoy working here. There are obviously some rough days, but with an excellent store manager and a solid team I get through. Benefits are amazing, pay is decent and I feel it's equivalent to the amount of work I put in, and they reward the proper attitude with plenty of opportunities to move up to shift lead and eventually store manager. Past that is more corporate which I can't speak to personally. I will however say that if you want an easy job this isn't for you. You need to come ready to work and earn your keep and if you don't then you probably won't last long. If you like people and don't mind hard work, Starbucks is a pretty rewarding place to be."
good,"Bei Starbucks hatte ich bisher am meisten Spaß, alles hat gepasst. Die Kollegen waren super, ich würde toll Empfangen und eingelernt und mir wurde sehr viel beigebracht, Vorallem über das Motto."
good,"I've been a Partner for 3 years in Starbucks, and I can say without a doubt Starbucks was one of the best jobs I've had. The customers are amazing and they are great people to network with. My fellow partners made my shifts  enjoyable and I had great shift who help me sharpe my Leadership skills."
good,"Really enjoyed my time. Awesome managers, great people. Always busy, great customer base. If you're looking for a relaxing job, this is not it. If you're looking for a rewarding job, look no further."

good,"My co-workers and manager were fantastic people to work with and I had the chance to be promoted. As a shy and timid person at the beginning, I was really able to flourish here and my manager saw my potential. And I learned how to make dang good coffee. I loved this job during college and would recommend it."
good,"Company provides so much more than an income. Coworkers become family, resources are copious; the benefits are overwhelming. Starbucks has a number of programs available to all partners, including medical benefits, 401k, the Cup Fund, etc."
good,"Starbucks (at least the store I’m working for) is a group of great people who continue to surprise me with how much they are willing to help each other out! Management is top notch and really cares about the employees.  The pace is fast and you must be a team player, but at the end of the day you feel good about a job well done."
good,"As a teen in high school, I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. They had flexible shifts where I was able to work & go to school, as well as really understanding and helpful management, whom created a lot of opportunity for growth within the company. There are also scholarship opportunities offered, which is really great. Also, not only do you get paid hourly, but if your customer service skill are great , then so will that TIP money be! Starbucks is great, I’d recommend working there to anyone."
good,It was a great place to work at for the weekend very great but the customers are stressful. I enjoyed making my own drinks and experimenting with different flavors.
good,"For the amount of things we do a day, Starbucks employees are not getting paid enough. It is a great first job and they off great benefits but you grow out of the job."
good,"When I interacted with regular customers, because I knew them a little bit, which made possible for us to have a nice conversation and create a better and more enjoyable work place."
good,"Un lugar donde puedes convinar tus metas personales como las laborales a traves del aprendizaje de colaborar en equipo y aprender a tener un buen y calido trato con los demas sabiendo escucgar para cumplir las necesiddes de los clientes con ayuda de los demas, aprendiendo la gran importancia de la buena comunicacion para lograr los objetivos laborales con actitud y disposicion"
good,just a generally great place to work. a good starting job not too stressful but still can get busy great environment very fun and enjoyable also good for later with good life insurance.
good,"Starbucks gave me not only a paycheck but friends for life, we work so hard to make the store work it's insane! There is so much going on behind the cup of coffee we make and sell that people have no idea, my store was one of the busiest and if you don't like working hard you are not going to last here, I love my manager and partners so much!!!!!"

good,"Fun workplace with friendly and caring staff and management. "
good,good scheduling fun employees to work with they would schedule me the days i asked but there weren't really was for promoting and moving up in the company because the management was biased

good,Working for starbucks store was a great entry level job. I learned how to proficiently multitask in a face-paced environment while maintaining quality.
good,Respected and treated with dignity.  Room for advancement and freedom to learn new tasks.  Worked there 14 years and you are rewarded  for accomplishments and achieving goals. Lots of recognition.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, good benefits, weekly tips, opportunities for promotions, quarterly raises. The most common conflict is issues with co workers, it’s important to address the issue with managers or employee help line to avoid any further issues."
good,"very nice workplace with a warm friends and partners, i've learn so much knowledge about coffee and the most important is how to caring the customer and how to serve coffee to customer, and also with a good management and also teach us how to be a honest people, the hardest part is i should split up with my partners when i decide to resign,"
good,I  enjoyed working for this company. The company strives to take care of all its employees and has  great benefits. My partners were all amazing and the job allowed me to continue being a full time student in college. It was one of my favorite jobs.
good,"Liberdade em dar suas opiniões, boas remunerações, ambiente agradável alegre."
good,"there is always something to be doing while working. there will be moments where you have a constant rush of people coming to get drinks or food. Its always a rush ti make sure the customers are leaving happy and satisfied with their order. Hardest part of the job is during happy hour when its a buy one get one free, we always get backed up and people end up waiting for a while. management is amazing, the boss is very understanding and always willing to help."
good,"The amount to learn can seem overwhelming at first, but learning to effectively communicate and plenty of practice helps make the job enjoyable and even exciting at times. I was very happy working with the team I had and working under my employer."
good,Starbucks was my first job out of high school. Starbucks has helped me in so many ways and I would like to get back to my natural habitat. Working with Starbucks has given me many opportunities.
good,"While the company truly cares about its employees, the pay was less than I thought was fair, especially as you promoted.  After Store Manager, the next steps were not a significant pay increase, but the hours necessary to complete the job were much higher - 60+ per week."
good,"Existe un interés por tu bienestar personal , es una empresa muy humana."
good,"Keep up with the orders and everything will be okay, just remember to always put the customer first. There is something new every day. whether its the customers, the beverages or even new employees. I can't say that there is a boring day at work."
good,"Responsible,efficient,Detail oriented,computer and internet skills,written and verbal communication ,organizational skills,multi tasting,communication,creativity,self motivation,ability to work under pressure,teamwork,quick learner,loyal and descreet(maintain confndentiallity)flexible."
good,"Starbucks is a healthy balance of a fast paced, goal oriented work environment and appreciation for their employees, with an understanding of their needs. Once you show your potential, they will push you to be the best you can be; which is sometimes hard to find in an employer. Management has a vibrant passion for coffee, as well as the company itself. You can tell Starbucks loves their employees by meeting the people who run the stores, districts and regions, for their true happiness and excitement shines through. "
good,"Def one of my top favorite old jobs. Co-workers were nice and fun to work with, there was always something to do, and it really was/is a perfect place to work when in school."
good,I had a great time working with others and learning all the new drinks. Great place to start out and advance in. Learning drink combinations was easy and fun to do.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks whether I was opening at 4:30 in the morning or closing until 1AM.  It was always pretty busy which made time go by faster, and I really enjoyed doing multiple tasks at once.  It is usually very fast paced and once all the workers get into their groove it is awesome.  A very great company to be a part of, the benefits are almost too good to pass up.  I would love to work for Starbucks at a higher level in the future."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great experience for me. I worked right in the middle of time square so I had a chance to meet different ethnicities from all over the world. I also worked with a great team.
good,Starbucks was my first job at 16 years old. I loved gaining the customer service aspect and working with the people around me. It gave me understanding of what it means to work day to day with people.
good,"Fast paced place to work, good entry level job to learn to advance and for good customer experience. You learn to very accustomed to your regulars and enjoy the atmosphere"
good,"The company not only cares for their customers, but also their employees. Very fast paced and constantly meeting new people. Everything is always upbeat. Hardest part is managing speedy service when it gets busy, but not impossible."
good,"There was nothing like my Starbucks family. We all even hung out outside of work. The people you work with are truly who make it great. The company overall was awesome too though. With everything from the discounts to the free products or just knowing you have somewhere to go if you have a bad day, Starbucks was great. The tasks they require from baristas isn’t ridiculous. There is a lot of work at times, but it’s never truly hard."
good,It was overall a great experience just the management team had no idea in what they were doing. I want to work back at Starbucks because It did help me grow and I learned more about myself and what I’m capable of doing  working there
good,"I typically open the store we open at 5am, but 1 Barista and 1 Shift Supervisor have to be there at 4:30am to prepare for the day. I've learned that Starbucks is a very fast paced environment."
good,"Depending on what time the shift is, it can be very busy or it can be more relaxed and casual. The busiest part is the morning when plenty of people come in and it is constantly busy for 2-3 hours typically. The afternoon and evenings are used to prep everything for the next day's rush."
good,Starbucks was one of the more challenging jobs I have had and I loved every minute of it. It constantly challenged me as well as helped me to grow. I couldn't have asked for a better place to learn how to interact with all different types of people!
good,"I definitely recommend this job to anyone fresh out of highschool and living with their parents, or living in a dorm. If you have to pay rent, it unfortunately doesn't pay enough to live on but they give you a free meal every day, a free bag of coffee or box of tea every week, and unlimited free drinks from 30 minutes before your shift starts to 30 minutes after."
good,"As a closing Shift Supervisor I would handle all tasks that pertained to the safe and daily counts when it came to the registers, our daily deposits and product waste and availability. Would also clean and prepare the store for the following mornings openers."
good,"Starbucks was so far the best job I have ever had, it included creating and achieving goals, making customers and employees happy while making yourself happy seeing them smile with the cup of coffee you made. I learned lots of new things like, how to prepare certain drinks, prepare food for customers and would learn more as the months go on."
good,I am currently employed to this company and I can't say enough of how fun it is to work here because everyday is a new day. It's fun because of your fellow partners and because you get to see everybody first before they get their coffee fix and help them throughout their busy day.
good,"A good work place, it had a friendly environment, was cleaned well. A lot of people came in to the store to drink coffee and relax, very family friendly"
good,"This is one of the best companies to work for for corporate retail/food service jobs. The atmosphere is relaxed, the attitude towards employees is compassionate and respectful, and you wont find better benefeits in the field."
good,I had the best experience with Starbucks. The teams were all about a positive culture and ensuring partners were truly taken care of. The teamwork from all levels was phenomenal.
good,"It was enjoyable to work at. Stressful with how fast paced it was, but fun. Learning how to make all those creative drinks that customers wanted was challenging, but it made the day more thrilling."
good,"The management is a crazy show but its worth it because the environment is so warm and welcoming as a new barista. but be ready for anything, because anything is possible for these coffee lovers."
good,Opening mid day and closing shifts. Setting up pastry case and bar stations. Brewing coffee and making specialty drinks. Learn the ins and outs of a cafe.
good,fast pace but fun at the same time. every one gets along very well and all the other workers are egar to teach you new things. you nerver feel like you are doing it alone and the managers are quick to step in and help when it gets to crazy and hectic.
good,I loved working here it was very fast paced at certain times and always slowed down for a little bit to catch up the rushes were never stressful everyone worked the pay was really good and we got free drinks and really good discounts. You also get a free gold membership for Starbucks and free Spotify premium!
good,"I have a lot of fun working and get a lot done. Everyone works very well together. Working at Starbucks helped me improve on my time management, teamwork, and ability to work fast paste."
good,"I had great time working there, they are very good to their staff. I also had flexible hours and was allowed to work at other locations as well so that i can pick up some extra hours"
good,I didn’t work there long because of my personal responsibility’s but it was one of the best jobs I had it was fun and I caught on quickly learning to make the drinks was a struggle but ones u remember the process it was easy and quick I wish I could’ve stayed there longer the managers were more than friendly and they even tried to help me because they understand what I was going threw they we’re more like building a family bond with there employees and everyone was a team
good,"Making coffee is fun, especially because I work with such a great team at my store. The manager is flexible and very understanding, and the day goes by fast because of how busy the store gets."
good,i’ve adapted at my store that just opened in january and i love my partners we all help each other and that keeps us sane. being a supervisor can become tough but it’s worth it all in the long run
good,"Vous ne pouvez pas espérer mieux que Starbuck en matière de management! Les avantages sociaux sont excellents et le milieu est tout simplement merveilleux!"
good,"I worked at the Atlanta Starbucks located in the Terminus building. I could not say enough good things about that store. Working at starbucks all depends on what store you work at and how the management is there. If the manager and shifts are bad, you won't enjoy working there. If the manager or shift leaders are good and care about you and their job, then it will be one of the most rewarding experiences you could have."
good,"Authorizing orders from cash management, to store supplies; also, in charge of leading teams during specific hours, leading at times up to eight. Personal responsibilities include ensuring a customer environment that’s welcoming, and genuine. My job is to instruct on proper training, ensure that protocols are met, and to run a play that better accumulates better sales, and customer satisfaction rates. If there are any situations that are out of the control of the barista, I am responsible to ensure that both the barista and the customer are safe, and not afflicted in any way. The environment is generally at a fast pace, with quality assurance. The best part of the job is the connections with each customer I interact with, including general opportunities, and bonds made."
good,Starbucks was an overall great company to work for. They care just has much about their customers as they do either employees. They offer benefits and schooling and the way the company changes as the seasons do is pretty fun.
good,I truly did enjoyed my time there. The staff and management is amazing and I really learned a lot. Though sometimes it can be stressful. There are always people around to help you out and get stuff done.
good,Typical shift is busy yet not stressful. Courteous costumers. Supportive co workers. Attentive mgmt. Pay is fair but not enough for cost of living. I love that they give back to the communities whose lands they use for farming and practice safe farming habits!
good,I really did enjoy working at Starbucks. It was just that I did not want to be front of the house. I enjoy cooking a lot more then making drinks. But one of the great things about the job is I definitely got to make connections with guests.
good,"It was a good place to work for temporary. I would recommend this job for more of a place for somebody tow ork when theya re in college at the time, would not recommend for career."
good,This work place is nice for someone that can manage a small space and have a great time serving on the go customers to support them in the facilities.
good,"Never had any complaints, loved the job. "
good,"Where to start..."
good,"We make drink , Also work the register, & Have to cook people food in the oven , You also clean , Mop floors , Fridge , Wash dishes. Make sure eveything is stock up & replace for the customers"
good,"If you personally live out their mission and values and you take personal responsibility for your own career, things will be fantastic.  It is a lot of work to manage a store, but all the resources are available to help you along the way.  The Operational Excellence Guide was my go-to on all things when I wasn't quite sure what I should have been doing in a certain area.  I've had great leadership and not so great, but there are enough resources that you can still do your job effectively if it's not so great."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fun fast paced job.  I learnt how to multi task while having an eye for detail when making drinks. Although it can get over whelming at times , just  ask for help and a co-worker is always there to help or answer questions. The hardest part of the job would be having to be on your feet all day and keeping up with the pace. The most rewarding part of the job is seeing people enjoy what you've made them and connecting with  regular customers. The staff members are great and so is the management in the stores I've worked at.  The benefits at Starbucks are also very rewarding."
good,"It is an enjoyable experience working in this company. Diversity is one good aspect of this company, I have gained a lot of friends with different culture and language. "
good,"The activities you do in a shift are continuously changing. This is good because you do not get bored that way. You can be working on the cash register, making drinks, cleaning and preparing bases."
good,"- Se preocupan mucho por el cliente, tanto externo como interno. "
good,Great place to wrk and advance. The long list of benefits and employee perks also makes the job worth it. Performance reviews are done every 6 months. My first year my store kept losing GM's. It had been a little over a yr before I got a review. Once I finally received my review the company gave me 2 rasies and retro pay.
good,I love working here because I get to meet new people everyday and I get to work with a great group of people. I enjoy working with my coworkers and the shifts go by faster.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks will include an influx of customers, demanding their morning coffee. You must be quick o your toes and willing to work with people who are very particular in their orders. It is a greta way to connect with people and make someone's day better."
good,"Good place to work,  manager she's good at supporting as best as she could. Everyone is friendly even the customers . Busy work environment fast paced"
good,"I am currently a team leader at Starbucks. I open and close the store, I handle cash, coach, and train. I prepare food and beverages and ensure a safe and healthy work environment for both my team and customers."
good,"woriking at staurbucks is great, you get the chance to meet new people everyday and interact with them. you get the chance to make someones day better by making the drink they want."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks and never would have put my 2 weeks in had I not been in school full time at the time. I loved my coworkers and management was the best."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, especially due to the benefits such as healthcare, dental care, Spotify, and tips. The other employees are always nice and helpful and management does a great job training new employees."
good,"Each day at work was always different. I loved working the morning shift with my A-Team! I liked being the first person that greeted the customers and gave them their drinks and pastries to start their day. I learned to move with purpose and focus. I also learned that we are a large part of our community outside of serving coffee with volunteer opportunities that our store manager would organize, or the coffee donations that our store would give to churches, organizations or local functions. The hardest part of the job is when you have a customer that moves away or a co worker that moves away, you feel like you have lost a member of your family. The hardest part one day was when I asked a gentlemen how come I hadn't seen him in so long and where was his wife? he informed me she passed away and I was so deeply saddened that I gave my condolences and offered him his drink on the house along with a hug. It is hard to get to know your customers be cause you feel like family and so you respond as family. The most enjoyable part was seeing my customers happy with how there drink tasted and how fast the service was. I really liked to surprise them by having their drink ready as soon as they come up to the counter if my drink lined allowed."
good,"Very challenging,and engaging it can overwhelming at times but it’s a great experience to learn from and also teach u how to handle things differently and become amazing."
good,It has its ups and downs but I honestly would not leave this company. The customers are what make it and break it. Along with your team. Your coworkers are your family and require a very good communication skill set among everyone.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for, really took care of their employees and the needs of the employees. Also, customer service was always the top priority which I admired a lot."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for they offer great benefits very flexible with scheduling and you can go to school while working School tuition is reimbursed if you go to their online university that they offer. They offer stock 401k medical dental vision. It is also a great company to work for because they are all over the US and you can pretty much travel anywhere with your job if needed to relocate there is always a home for you.
good,"I loved the atmosphere, my coworkers, my location and my benefits. However, my location was always very busy and my manager and supervisors didn't have time to train me on bar in the 4 months I was there. I mostly did customer service, which was very fun and rewarding"
good,"Buen trabajo, buen ambiente, se aprende con un tutor hasta cumpmir la certificacion."
good,Starbucks became my third home and my coworkers became my family. I love the daily benefits and the connections made with baristas and customers. We are given various tools and resources to help us grow with the company.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is you make a lot of friends from a different culture. every day you learned new thing either be from your partner or from the customer when you ask a customer for how they are doing.
good,"I thought Starbucks was an absulutely wonderful place to work!"
good,There was always a positive energy walking in to work. Everyone is friendly and management is very helpful. You can ask as many questions as you want because they would rather you ask a million times than giving the customer the wrong drink. Great place to work at.
good,"Worked at Starbucks after college.  Was a great experience, had great teammates, and truly learned to develop the concept of Time Management.  The hardest part of the job was when customers ordered off the menu items and you didn't know what they were, however it was fun creating the drinks."
good,"Fun, fast paced work place. Rare to get a raise, but lots of benefits. They offer flexible scheduling, the partners you work with are super cool people, and free drinks is always great."
good,"I really like my store and think this is a great place to work. I work here part-time."
good,Melhor empresa q já trabalhei. A cultura da empresa é incrível.
good,"Good management, regular salary and secured benefits and insurance. There is something new to learn in each passing week. I moved from performing barista tasks to working on the cashier to assisting in counting the daily sales made. Colleagues are very helpful and fun to work with as the job is enjoyable and interesting with lots of interaction with customers and as employees are well-compensated despite working part-time."
good,I love being a barista and connecting with my customers and I have been able to network myself with them as well. Was a part time worker and I was able to manage both college and work and family most of the time!
good,"This Is ultimately the dream 1st job # part time. It's flexible, the benefits are great and the possibility to go to other stores for more hours is a plus."
good,Great work/life balance. Fun environment which requires great people skills. Career advancement is really in the hands and work ethic of the employee. The best benefits you’ll find.
good,Starbucks has provided for me and my family in so many ways. They continually assess our benefits to make sure we are getting what we need to live a successful and happy life
good,"The Starbucks company really strives to take care of its emplyees. They provide full benefits at 20hrs a week and provides flexible schedules.  Working as a team can be hard, but absolutly worth it when it comes to seeing eachothers success and a satisfied customer. A day at work can be hectic or, slow but no matter what you'll have a great time. Starbucks is a great starting point or a foundation for other job opportunities. Weather you've taken the job to get yourself through college or to start a coffee based career, you'll never forget your days with your store team. The best part of the day is interacting with your regular customers; to hear about their lives, their families, or maybe just their bad day makes you feel like you are making a difference."
good,"Proporcionan un excelente ambiente de trabajo, con muy buen paquete de prestaciones y flexibilidad suficiente en los horarios para trabajar y estudiar."
good,"Overall it was nice, I just had a hard time being in many places at once since I had two jobs and transportation was an issue that’s why I left, learning curve is pretty high."
good,Arbeitgeber der nach Tarif bezahlt und sich an wirklich alle Gesätze hält.
good,"If you open the store its nice and relaxing. your the first person people see in the morning and you have such a major impact on their mood and their day."
good,"star bucks  is very productive and fun place to work specially for students. the working place culture is to fill full your customers need and it is a type of a  working place where I've learned communication how sociality is in need off coffee."
good,"Starbucks was easily one of my favourite jobs. Most people that I worked with were always ready and willing to help you learn how to make the job easier, which is good when you're making six different drinks in less than three minutes. Managment was also there helping you through the rough patches and giving you advice on how to better handle fellow employees or those customers that just didn't want to leave on a good note."
good,Great space to earn money & save up. Great job for those who do not have much responsibilities. Also a good place to meet some good people. Would definitely recommend.
good,Had a great store manager who took care of her employee's. Provided great training and was a fun and friendly environment which made going to work not seem like a chore.
good,It is a good place to work. Great culture. Fun working environment. And average salary. Overall it’s a great place and fun to work with. Can balance the lifestyle and work.
good,I assessed the store conditions on a regular basses and enjoyed the interaction with Partners and Managers. They were always respectful and friendly enjoyed working with all fo them. Always encouraged the starbucks culture and tried to be an example.
good,"This was my second job ever and it was the best experience of my work life. It was amazing for me to learn how to treat people, co-workers, and work/personal life balance. I absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone as a first job to make sure you have the right mindset furthering yourself in the future."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for and has helped me become the best professional employee I can be. The benefits and home work balance are the best part of this job.
good,"Everyone is incredibly nice and the benefits you get working here amazing. You get free coffee basically whenever and insurance as well. You do start at minimum wage, but you can easily go up."
good,"In addition to having an excellent manager who fostered a team environment, Starbucks offered great benefits, compensation and college tuition, which I took advantage of. I enjoyed my time at Starbucks and regret departing that corporation. Unfortunately, I was young and restless and did not comprehend the advantage of advancements within that company. I will always remember my time at Starbucks Coffee Company as well spent employment."
good,"Great experience working for Starbucks, fell valued as a member of the team, management always ensured work regulations were followed, breaks etc.. would defiantly work for them again. There was always an opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"Muy buena empresa para laborar, flexibilidad de horarios, rápido crecimiento"
good,"Great place to meet new people and create new friends, friendly environment that provide you a way to work as a team and the ability to work well independently."
good,"The people there are friendly and having a great time. I need this job for family, paying rent, getting medicine for my cat and would like to work ASAP."
good,"Starbucks has genuinely molded me into the woman I am today. I've started this job at 16,I'm now 29...I left the company for 9yrs. But in 3 months I got my position back as shift Supervisor! I have now been back with the company for 2 years! And luckily I have my old numbers starting with 15!!! Lol that's apart of history haha!!"
good,Great work place with a lot of fun people. Benefits are amazing. The job can be hard at times but overall a great place to work. Hours are flexible for a work life balance.
good,"Working for Starbucks was a rewarding experience that I took a lot away from. Working your way up the totem pole was,at least in my market, an accessible way to learn how to run a business successfully.  As a store manager your responsible for the whole thing, The corporate culture, is epitomized in the opening line of their mission statement, 'To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one cup, one store, one neighborhood at a time'. I am very thankful for the opportunities, challenges, and fun I had with the company. I wouldn't trade my time there for anything else."
good,"Being a multi-cultured work environment with colleagues of different age range this place gave me my first learning curve. "
good,Honestly a great job only left to try something else. Easy to move up if you are motivated and generally coworkers are great! Hours are really flexible and it is a great job when you are also a full time student
good,"I was used to work full time. I was shift supervisor. I have learned effective customer service, cash management, IMS, deployment, prepared quality drinks."
good,"I had several friends working there with whom I still keep contact today. Many employees at the time used this opportunity as a part-time job while raising children, teaching adjunct classes, being a part-time worship leader, or volunteering/interning in the community. The hours were extremely flexible, and there is definitely the opportunity to pick up more hours than are designated for you because things happen in life. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with customer demand. My store had a drive-through and a large inside/outside dining area, and we were located very close to the interstate. These factors combined to make us the most popular, or at least busiest, in our area. I did develop some tendinitis in my wrists (barista wrist) as a result of this, but if I had worn a brace or properly stretched beforehand, it would not have been a problem. If you are considering applying to work at Starbucks, you should absolutely give it a shot! Be aware that a Starbucks with more traffic will make for a busier workday but your shift will definitely go more quickly, and there will be more people around to support you!"
good,"really enjoyed this job. very busy and lots and lots to learn especially as they like things done a ver very specific way, ran a very tight ship very organised company. only downside was my manger always had me on every weekend as opposed to a mix of the 4 avaviable days I could work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks truly. All of my coworkers and I got along so well together but the manager was the only issue. Also, the wage was/is minimum which is the only con in my opinion of working there"
good,"Es un buen ambiente de trabajo, las personas que trabajan allí contigo son personas que puedes confiar, esto es debido a que la empresa tiene la cultura de trabajar en equipo para cualquier actividad que se realiza en la empresa. Existe la oportunidad de crecer dentro de la empresa contando con el apoyo de tus compañeros y tus superiores."
good,"usually everything is in a routine, I get to work and see if anything needs restocking, then I make a couple of drinks, sometimes i switch to register if I see a costumer waiting or sometimes I will even do bar and register by myself."
good,"Solid job with great opportunities, you have to be willing to meet standards and goals to advance though. Management can be over-worked at times and meet goals / CC is somewhat stressful. "
good,"I worked at Starbucks all 4.5 years of my college experience and I loved just about every minute of it. It was a fun, team-centered environment and I felt like I was cared about not only by the managers but by the company. While working there I met many people from all walks of life and grew as a person as a result. I am so grateful for my time at Starbucks and am so sad to leave. "
good,"Managed baristas, made sure money was counted at the end of the night, task were complete before the next shift arrived, ordered and counted inventory, stocked, cleaned, customer service."
good,"me encanto es lo mejor trabajar en rentals"
good,Fun-fast paced workplace with amazing culture. Individuals worked hard as a team and are encouraged to do whatever necessary to make the customers happy.
good,"I started back in July, my store was a new store that had opened in March. Since being here it has been a great experience, Starbucks offers great benefits a well"
good,I love working for the company just looking to see  if there is something else I could be doing.  The culture is all about the customer . The best part is working with the partners
good,Very chilled out environment that I enjoyed working at. Day to day started off buys and throughout the shift it had peak periods and wass generally fun to work at.
good,"During my work time in Starbucks, I have experienced working with very organised and managed team. They have goals targeted and staff is trained to accomplish certain aims and objectives."
good,"Buen clima laboral, no me puedo quejar, trabajé en la empresa por más de 2 años y siempre fue dinámico y divertido, lo único malo es que es muy difícil ascender a oficinas porque siempre hay vara, pero en tienda si hay posibilidad de ascender"
good,"A typical day would be making drinks, warming food, cleaning, and assisting customers with questions, wants, and concerns. Management is amazing and help set you up to succeed. Tips were not very well, I believe they could do a better job at distributing tips."
good,"-cultivate unique experiences per customer."
good,"La empresa siempre se dedica a ver primeramente por sus empleados por hacernos sentir comodos y a gusto, y el ambiente con los clientes y con los compañeros es muy especial, siempre se aprende algo nuevo, hay crecimiento y beneficios increibles."
good,"The store I worked at was a downtown location. we were always busy! Time flew by because there was no down time but it was a good thing. Everyone worked hard and pulled their weight. The hardest part of the job was educating some guests on the product. Starbucks offers a lot customization when ordering but that freedom to chose didn't always work. Some guests would want flavors that didn't always pair well and while you would try to determine what they would like, they for the most part needed to see for themselves. The most enjoyable part was also the guests! Seeing regulars, watching a persons face light up with the taste of a perfectly made drink or having a persons bad day turn better with a few kind words and good coffee was very enjoyable. Its an experience I'll never forget and will always be grateful for."
good,A fun fast passed work environment. Starbucks is very understanding about your personal life and accommodating to what your schedule needs to be. It can be stressful at times though.
good,"Good environment, nice people, interesting job. Very friendly customers and amazing co-workers. First 2 month are the hardest since there is a lot of recipes to learn. Learned a lot about coffee and brewing methods. Not really hard to work, just getting tired because of standing a lot."
good,"Starbucks was a really fun company to work for. I learned a lot about coffee that I was really excited to share with customers and with friends and family. I grew to love coffee even more after my experience working here. Management was very reasonable: they worked around school hours and vacation days. Management was helpful in times of need. The hardest part of the job was having to open the store at 4a.m. The part that I enjoyed most at Starbucks was the family that was created between coworkers and supervisors. I also really enjoyed learning about coffee, and the regular customers always made my day to see their happy faces come in."
good,"Managers generally care about the health and well being of employees, taking these into consideration when making the schedules. It is a fast paced working environment with lots of customer interactions. It is challenging in a positive way as you are expected to keep up with the influx of people during certain times of day. You gain a great relationship with your coworkers and customers as regulars become friends as well."
good,"Lots of opportunities for innovation, problem solving, and creativity. Learned a lot about quality customer service, importance of following guidelines and routines, and team work. Hardest part for me was seeing others not put in their best work or follow the job description and expectations. It is stressful for some due to the fast paced nature of the job but it is a very rewarding job and fun to interact with people daily. The discounts and free coffee/food is a great perk, and the company takes care of their employees in a lot of areas. There is also a great focus on community involvement."
good,They give awesome training skills that you can take with you everywhere. Very patient. They care about their customers and employees. I would work here again if the pay wasn’t so low for baristas. I also was able to stock up on my favorite teas & coffees while working here.
good,"Gran empresa, genial como de los primeros trabajos"
good,"I dont remember a time i walked into work unenthusiastic about seeing my coworkers my boss or my customers, everyone there was friendly and it was the most positive and greatest work environment anyone could ever ask for."
good,Starbucks is great for students. They are flexible and have many advancement opportunities! Over the years they’ve changed their dress code! Great job
good,"es un lugar donde se aprecia al empleado, un gran impulsor para jovenes y mucha oportunidad de aprendizaje y laboral"
good,"I love working at Starbucks because my co workers and management are amazing. A typical day at work consists of helping customers and creating a friendly environment. It requires a lot of multi-tasking, teamwork, communication, and being on your feet. The hardest part of the job are the busy coffee rushes but the most enjoyable part is creating a great place to get delicious coffee. I've learned many skills working here and I love this job."
good,A typical day at work would always be enjoyed with music of our choice to express our desire characteristics. We would always engage with our customers to better understand how satisfy they were of their coffee.
good,"Amazing customers and Community support"
good,Os horários são bem flexíveis e o ambiente de trabalho era bem amigável e moderno.
good,"A typical day at starbucks depends on your location. where i work it really fast paced and time flies. When its slow it more cleaning and keeping the store up to standard. "
good,"I worked mornings and it was very fast paced but definitely would work there again. There is a lot to learn and remember since every drink is customized to the customer's desire but a great place to work at. However, I did not like how everyday everyone would do the same thing. So the same people would be on register and others would be making drinks."
good,"I've been with the Siren for 3 years and counting. Although it gets really tricky sometimes and I just wanna run out screaming, most days I am thankful for my supportive team and managers and my amazing customers. I love the culture and opportunities this company has to offer - if you work for them of course."
good,"Starbucks becomes your third home.  I have worked at Starbucks since I was 18, and Starbucks has always been my third home.  Where I live being my first, school being my second, and Starbucks being my third.  They have always gone out of their way to support me and help me achieve my dreams.  I will forever be thankful for Starbucks' support."
good,Working at Starbucks entailed a lot of problem solving and connecting to customers on an intimate level. I learned skills about cash management and how to lead a floor for a successful busy rush. I learned how to develop partners and provide a safe environment for growing and learning. I enjoyed anticipating peoples needs and helping to shift the mood of the store to a positive one.
good,"Una buena organización con cada puesto establecido en la empresa,  seguridad para cada uno de sus empleados, estabilidad para personas que inician alguna carrera en la Universidad o cualquier otro tipo de curso y flexibilidad de horarios."
good,"The day to day experience at Starbuck was very pleasant, due to the family like environment. I worked at numerous locations where partner and customers were welcoming."
good,"I loved working here. While I didn't feel that way all the time, i def felt a sense of family and knowledge that as a young person I would be looked out for. I made good friends and have gotten so much experience and knowledge out of my time at Starbucks."
good,"To supervised shift employees"
good,"The best thing about working at Starbucks for me was the environment. I loved being in a place where the customers and partners weren't so far removed from each other as other companies. It always felt like working with and serving friends With the schedule being so flexible there was a great work-life balance that allowed for things like school, parenting, and even hobbies to have a place in ones life. I've always recommended people looking for work apply for Starbucks."
good,"I think the job enjoyment can be very dependent on your fellow employees and management. The job itself is great, and the benefits are awesome. The philosophy of the company is to treat you as a 'partner', not an employee, so you're treated with free coffee, fair holiday, and you're never stuck doing menial things. Always valuable things."
good,"Is a good place to work with benefits, pay, promotion opportunities and great group of partners to work with. Management has a great communication and a diverse and good culture."
good,"The connections you make with your coworkers and customers is priceless and makes you eager to go into work everyday. "
good,支援時遇到的夥伴都很好相處，支援是我最喜歡的事情，怕可以認識新朋友，在星巴克上班是我最開心的工作時光
good,"Starbucks is absolutely great to work at, and you get great benefits. However, the starting pay of $9 an hour isn't enough to get by on for most people."
good,"Good day at work. "
good,Working with Starbucks is the best experience I ever had. I met awesome partners. Communicating with our customers can be really fun too especially with tourist! We both get to know different kind of coffee cultures.
good,I  LOVED working at Starbucks. My crew was so much fun and helpful. Go Team Spirit. Over the years I learned so much and gained so much experience. Staff is valued here.
good,"I made a lot of forever friendships and memories that will last a lifetime. It is a very organized and well put together company. I learned a lot of things about working in a corporate environment and what the importance of having a good team was, a lot about myself."
good,This is a great job for anyone in school as they are extremely accommodating. I love the people I work with and the connections I make on a daily basis.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They're very supportive of all co-worker at work and outside of work. It is the perfect part-time job, if you need a little extra cash. I love working here!"
good,A day within the Starbucks company was always busy and fast paced. The company does structure their business by giving specific instructions each day to follow while rotating positions.
good,The only job I ever worked at. The staff are great and very helpful. Managers work around your availability and schedule . The hardest part was memorizing the drinks .
good,"High volume and traffic workplace, but always a positive atmosphere.  Shifts make it a point to be sure everyone is comfortable in position stationed which makes everyone's mood reflect."
good,"The workplace at most Starbucks would be heavily considered as a second home because of the lack of personal judgement, ability to connect and explore with baristas, and the warmth, comfort, and openness one can have in a public place."
good,"Loved working for the company! Free coffee while you work, along with discount and mark out coffee every week. Great heathcare, positive worn enviroment."
good,"Starbucks has some of the best benefits out there, especially for a part-time job. I have an outstanding manager. The teamwork for my night shift is great. I learned a lot of customer service skills."
good,"Really challenging in the best ways"
good,"The typical day involved working the front cash register, the drive-thru register, making drinks, heating up food, washing dishes, changing trash bags, and with any left over time cleaning anything and everything. The hardest part was working when its busy. Working three to five hours without a break as fast as possible was overwhelming and exhausting for most employees, especially the newer ones including myself. If you like a challenge, Starbucks would be a good place for a first job, but it will wear most people out especially when working 5 to 7 days a week."
good,I love Starbucks because I love coffee. It was easy for me to develop a passion for my job because I already love the product I am serving. I was promoted to Shift Supervisor in 6 months.
good,great team environment. great tuition plan and health benefits. the culture is outstanding and the quality of their product is superb. There are many great people in this company
good,"Great place to learn about different coffees and make relationships with the regular customers. Especially on a weekend morning, my shift would keep me very busy and fly by before i knew it."
good,"Great work environment, very friendly and helpful coworkers. Great training. Options to move up to supervisor(key holder). Management was great and understanding and worked with me on my schedule when my availability changed."
good,"I love coffee so learning how to make different types of coffee is so much fun. Also the people that I work with are so nice they make you feel welcomed and, we treat each other like family."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. It is a very quick-paced environment. It makes quite a difference with the manager that you have. They will motivate you and make it fun. There is a lot of multi-tasking that goes on, so, you have to be on your toes. You need to be effective when working under pressure and be able to manage time efficiently. I enjoyed making our customers happy and ensure recurring business."
good,It's a nice time because our team works so well together. Our team is like a family and we work together to achieve our goals as a company. Our management coaches us to be better customer orientated.
good,"Starbucks is typically busiest during the morning rush, which we call our “peak time.” Everyone is taught how to do every role in the cafe, and you most likely will do something different every shift. It’s initiative based, as you should learn when to help and what to do. Building drinks and memorizing the ins and out of Starbucks will take around 3 months to be confident in what you do. Every day is a new day to learn. Dress code is fairly flexible. You are allowed to wear blue, white, black, or brown and different shades of those colors. No jewelry or t-shirt’s are allowed. Don’t plan on having your nails done (EVER) while working for Starbucks, you will get written up."
good,Work is always fun. Im always looking forward to my shift with the friends I've made here over the years. the team helps each other out and i never feel let down!
good,I only had two managers that made it an unpleasant place to work otherwise the entire experience was phenomenal. I learned not only how to problem solve during tough situations but help walk people through the ins and outs of the menu.
good,"It has always been an honor to work with Starbucks. The work environment has always been fun and motivating. the management, especially the top management will always make you feel that you are part of the family."
good,"Ambiente bom de se trabalhar, equipe sempre animada e prestativa."
good,I've worked at 5 different Starbucks corporate stores and 3 additional proprietary stores and it have overall been a pleasure. I am a fan of the company and feel as if I have been able to grow here.
good,Welcoming environment and a wonderful place to work. Always encouraging the customer experience. Partners are encouraging and supportive of goals within the company.
good,A typical day at work consists of making drinks and handing out food. You are responsible for making a positive impact on customers. You also need to keep your cool even when you're having a bad day.
good,Starbcuks is a great company to work for with tons of benefits suck as stock also who doesn't love coffee. Working at starbucks is great for all types of personalities to express yourselves as you work. Being able to add flavor to enjoy the starbucks experience.
good,"Fast paced environment. Team driven. Higher pay than most restaurant chains (with tips). Employees are treated nicely. High expectation of customer service but high reward. Solid Benefits. "
good,"Its a great place for extra money such as people graduating high school. Pays above minimum and great benefits, they even pay for schooling. One major factor are your co workers and the store you work at. It is very sink or swim in the beginning but once you have an idea it starts moving smoothly. It is also hit or miss with training, you may not get trained in depth depending on who you train with"
good,Working at Starbucks was an amazing experience . If I had a slight pay increase I would love to have stayed and moved my way up In the company. I just however was looking for more financially stability at the time being .
good,"Great environment and very fair. Smart management and a streamlined work process. Had an airtight work plan called playbook, that allowed maximum proficiency."
good,The manager was friendly and my coworkers made things a team effort. Everyone is willing to answer questions and help if necessary. Overall a great experience
good,"Keeps you on your toes if not the job the customers will. They are demanding and impatient (for good reason). Overall a very fun and rewarding job to get to see smiles put on the communities faces with a simple cup of coffee. A typical day at work involved what your shift entailed. If you were customer support you were the stores backup man. Meaning your keeping the brewed coffees fresh, milk carafes fresh, dishes done and a clean store. I learned so much about the coffee and working in a fast pace environment the training took forever to get through. The hardest part of the job was learning how to be a proficient barista while keeping customers wait times to a minimum. The most enjoyable part of the job not going to lie is the free coffee, because who does not like coffee?"
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work at. It is extremely fast paced but very rewarding. Starbucks gives you Spotify premium as one of your benefits and thats really great!
good,"A place to go to work and come home and not have work to worry about."
good,i really enjoy working on starbucks because of the nature it self. i am serving beverage that makes the customer awake. im glad to give them a drink to give them energy to make their day awsome. and now i am looking for an opportunity abroad. and i wanted to work in singapore. hoping to work with you partner! thank you!!
good,You'll have people who complain that management is sometimes unfair or ruthless but to be honest who doesnt have a manager they don't like. Starbucks hires extremely friendly people who are attentive and willing to help (however there will be a few bad apples). The only real complaint is I wish we were paid a bit more. I love to work at Starbucks and management will usually work around a school schedule. I am treated fairly and with the warmest regards!
good,"People were always nice and friendly, there was something to always be entertained by while being at work. It was a fast past that kept the flow of the job and customers coming back for more."
good,The company has such an excellent way with working with baristas! I have worked in the customer service industry for a long while now and I was taught so much while working there! From dealing with a customer to extreme time efficiency it never is a dull moment!
good,"This was my first serious job, everyone was very welcoming and willing to slow down in order for me to learn. They don't expect you to know how to bar efficiently until a month or two after working there."
good,Starbucks is a good start up to work for they provide a stepping stone for success as long as you use it wisely. They also match your401k contribution as well as provide a stock share once a year.
good,"Its was a great work at here. Give me a lot of experienced in how to manage our timetable, communicate with our customers, about cleaniless in our store and many things else. Many of my customers was tourists."
good,"Starbucks cares for both it’s bottom line and it’s employees.  The benefits are amazing, the work is easy to moderate, there’s a strong balance of professional and personal relationships at but, the pay isn’t enough to match the cost of living at a store level.  There’s plenty of opportunities for growth within the company."
good,"Sobre todas las cosas, creo que el trabajo en equipo es lo mas importante que se aprende en Starbuck's. También, si tiene uno la posibilidad de aprender a realizar alguno de los tipos de cafés que la empresa ofrece. Es un excelente ambiente de trabajo, que suele albergar una gran variedad de personas de todas partes lo que hace el trabajo mas dinámico e interesante"
good,"Starbucks overall work environment is professional, welcoming, safe, and fun. Was able to learn a lot from the company that have lead to career advancement."
good,"I had a great time working for the company, I personally worked at a drive-thru and typically saw more volume of customers on the day-to-day grind. ""Grind"" for lack of a better word is hardly what I would describe my experience with Starbucks though, the partners (baristas) are all very warm people and are instilled with the value proposition of the company. I loved making excellent beverages and creating a nice big smile on a customer's face, it was a very addicting sensation and what makes the job seem more and more less of a job and more of a place where you wanted to be."
good,"Es un excelente empresa para trabajar, dan mucho apoyo a estudiantes."
good,"Working at Starbucks you learn a lot of new things. Your customer service skills will definitely advance, you learn how to work at a quick and steady pace, learn to make drinks as a barista. It’s a fast paced environment but at the same time the customers and partners make it an happy and positive environment."
good,"Working for Starbucks is a fun, productive opportunity. You have the option to move up in the business as well as in your local store. The work teams are fun, respectful and make for a great work environment."
good,"all good  can be a great place to get started in a career. "
good,It was a fun place everyone there was friendly. the manger was always in a great mood she was so much fun. we always had a fun time at work we would interact with customers.
good,"Great, amazing, awesome, best place to work. Friendly environment, friendly customer service.  Always aim to please each and every customer. Best coffee ever."
good,"I loved working at Starbuck and I would love to work there again. If you work well under pressure, Starbucks is the job for you. I loved talking with customers and meeting new people. You have to be a active speaker when working at Starbucks because it requires  active communication between customers and coworkers. Teamwork is vital because everyone plays a certain role in order for service to be fast and neat."
good,"Work in Starbucks was a really fulfilling experience. I learned a lot not just about coffee but on how to face people on a personal and professional level. We are encouraged to connect to every customer and make their visit worth their time. There are a lot of things that I enjoyed during my stay here. Seeing and meeting new people, seeing those satisfied smiles in their faces, it fills me with joy to know that somehow, I was able to make their day a bit more bearable from the usual grind. I really enjoyed working for Starbucks and something that would be hard to forget."
good,"It was a wonderful experience. I was given opportunity to grow within the organization. The benefits and tuition reimbursement were the highlights of my experience there. I loved the team I worked with, which made my days at work enjoyable. I would recommend to a friend."
good,"I've been a barista for the past 4 years. I've loved my job, fellow partners and customers. I've grown immensely and enjoyed making customers days brighter. I've applied to Starbucks Corporate Headquarters for 3 different positions, gotten interviews and all the way up only to get 2nd. Even though I had worked for the company for the past 4 years because I do not have any experience working in accounting or finance (beings I just graduated) I didn't land the job. I loved working as a barista and would highly recommend it, but getting into the headquarters is too competitive."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced work environment with fantastic training for employees at all levels. Starbucks also offers it's employees a wide range of options to improve on their personal skills as well as move up within the company. Very team oriented which allows everyone to handle the busy days just as well as the slow ones.
good,"The company has grown to what it is, by following its mission statements and guidelines. Its a great place to work if you are placed with the right team for you and your personality needs."
good,"I learned that I had a passion for coffee and the people that enjoy it. It made me so happy to go to work everyday and see the same customers and partners that I had seen the day before. Work was never boring, something new and interesting was always discussed and new challenges kept us all on our feet. I've not worked with more transparent people and it was great to get to know so many people and develop my future the way that the company did. My management team was phenomenal and I thank them for seeing the opportunity I had and made my dream a reality. It's truly an experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life."
good,"Excelente empresa, con crecimiento laboral, un buen ambiente"
good,Starbucks cares greatly about its employees and thus is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits and work to provide a safe environment.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here and would do it again. The atmosphere is relaxed but very fast paced, and I made several friends in my short time working there."
good,"My typical day at work was a very busy day, with sore feet at the end but every caring coworkers. I have learned so much through so many people there. the hardest part of the job was that I had to leave for college."
good,"My locations was typically steady, but me and the others I worked with always tried to have fun while being productive. I had few problems with the others on staff and I wish that we didn't have to part ways. My team was like a family."
good,Customer service job that allows you to learn and make craft beverages. Highly social job that requires a love of people and customer service. Must be able to multitask.
good,Starbucks puts a lot of care and effort into the well being and safety of their employees. the safety program is outstanding and they really stress safety. they have great incentive programs in place and their benefit package shows the care and commitment they have for the working man or women.
good,"I loved going to work everyday. My fellow employees were always so kind and helpful. Any time I had a question, they were always so detailed with their instructions."
good,"It is such a fabulous company with great values! I enjoyed the human connection and of course the yummy coffee! The benefits are incredible ... free college education, health, stock options, etc!"
good,"Fun making food and drinks, day goes fast and most customers are polite and easy to talk to."
good,"Starbucks is one of the friendliest company that I ever worked to.my partner that I worked with them are really friendly and helpful, they knew that I am new partner that helped me to grow in company."
good,"Although I worked for a short amount of time, I was able to immerse myself into the Starbucks culture and values, which create a very positive atmosphere for work."
good,"The culture of the workplace is astonishing. Not only does one create meaningful relationships with customers, but do the same with other barista's as well."
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company who puts their employees and customers on top of the pyramid. They give back to both the most, as they are the true faces and foundations of the business! Great culture and opportunity!"
good,活潑外向、穩定性高的人容易受重用，要不怕生、能夠細心仔細，在工作方面會比較順利。有不懂的地方就開口問夥伴，大家都會很樂意解答，夥伴最後會成為你另一個家人哦！
good,"I have worked with some hard-working, down-to-earth people at my stores. They strove for excellence."
good,"Great environment, experience and family atmosphere. Supervisor was excellent always willing to work with me and coworkers. Great teachers when learning the job and very informative."
good,"I learned a lot more than I thought I could of how to run an establishment, and I carried that information to my other job, but I wouldn't trade my experience with the company for anything. I had worked there for four years and it was a great four years, I will say that at least in Austin and with my lifestyle, it wasn't feasible and I would end up with little to money by the end of the pay periods, but the growth is there"
good,"A solid company to work for. For a food service industry corporation, Starbucks provides many benefits to its employees, even health care for part-time partners."
good,"Cool job to have while going to school, flexible scheduling and decent tips."
good,"Friendly workplace, always uplifting and everyone was always smiling and happy. Great first job, management was really understanding if you were a university student or needed time off for anything important. I highly recommend this job! If you were looking to advance with the company (i.e from barista to supervisor), they were willing to help train you and find a location that was looking for individuals to fill that position."
good,was very fast pace and fun. you learn a lot about culture and coffee and the different ways of making coffee. the environment is very fun and will never be boring.
good,The aura of the workplace is lively and the customers are amazing.             Learning to make the drinks is easier than you expect. I loved this job.
good,"I love it there, the people, the food, and the overall environment. The only reason I’m leaving is because I want to get out of the food service industry."
good,"I loved going to work because I always felt welcomed and appreciated by my coworkers. For me, the hardest thing to learn was how each drink was made and how to find and enter drinks on the registers, but everyone there was very patient and encouraging to me while I was still learning. I also struggled a little bit when I was in the drive-thru and it would get really busy, but more times than not, everyone was still really patient with me until I got it down. My favorite part of working there was making drinks, especially once I had learned how to make them. Admittedly, I wasn't the fastest, so I didn't get to make drinks often, and I was better in the drive-thru, but when I got to make drinks, I enjoyed it a lot. I don't have anything bad to say about any part of my experience working there."
good,"You are always doing something, whether you are cleaning the fridge, to sweeping, or making preps on the slow hours. During peak time, your day just flies."
good,I learned how to relax and keep calm during stressful situations as well as multitasking skills. Great team atmosphere and a great way of training new employees.
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work part time, but don't expect to move up past being a supervisor. They have stopped promoting from within and instead favor hiring store managers who have no idea what it's like to be a barista and work in a coffee shop."
good,"Able to work with awesome people, learn team work and reliability and the job forces you to be a master multitasker!"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for, they have a lot to offer. From benefits to meeting new people, it’s great. There are many opportunities for raises as well. The people I worked with were the best part."
good,"I worked at a campus Starbucks, and the atmosphere was very fun and relaxed. All of us got along and the customers were all friendly since a majority of them were students."
good,great company to work for. have been there for 4 years and its been amazing. everyone works as a team and you get to drink a lot of coffee for free as well as holiday pay
good,I enjoyed working there. I learned how to make different coffees. It was high energy but not too stressful. There were a lot of regulars with hard recipes.
good,"The best thing about the job is the benefits, which is why most people stay. The environment is very fast paced depending on location and the people you work with are great no matter where you go. Management is different at every store but Starbucks does a pretty good job at making sure all of the store managers and ASM's run their store the same way. "
good,"It was a great experience, many times it was stressful with a large number of customers that would come. guests were constantly picky, you basically had to have a fake face the entire time in order to get through the day without offending someone"
good,Starbucks is one of my favorite places to work at. I fully enjoy my time spent and coworkers. Management is always helpful and they are very flexible with schedules. Its a fast pace work environment and it is demanding in the sense that you have memorize new drinks and recipes daily as per starbucks standards and updates.
good,The mornings are usually very busy and it can be stressful at times but it truely is a great place to work! There’s so much positivity with all the coworkers
good,This is a great place to work as a college student and their college achievement plan is an amazing opportunity. They offer really good benefits even if you`re only part time.
good,Good place to be just no room for growth unless your willing to move out of state in most cases. My manager wasn’t the best he kept to himself didn’t offer much help to anyone.
good,"I loved working here. They were able to work with my school schedule and give me the hours I needed. Very fast paced and great trainers. When I first started there, no one really talked to me. Everyone acted stuck up. After i Expressed how I felt, things eased up. Everyone came around and welcomed me."
good,Excelente lugar para comenzar a trabajar. Un buen ambiente y cordial lugar para generar conexiones laborales.
good,"I love my job with Starbucks. Every part of it is enjoyable for me. I love talking with people in the morning, afternoon, evening even if its just for a moment. You can learn a lot about someone from what kind of coffee they drink, and how they treat the baristas in the store. Its a very social, open-minded, welcoming environment. I feel like every one of my coworkers have become more and more like family with every passing day. The connections you create with coworkers and your regular customers are unparalleled. I highly recommend working for this fantastic company."
good,"Partners and everyone you’ll be working with is always fun to work with. Even when it’s busy, you can always count on with your coworkers to make your days better. My manager is also the best at making sure everyone is having fun and not the only one stressing about everything. He holds everyone accountable which is really good"
good,"me gusto mucho trabajar en esta empresa debido a que tiene una gran capacidad de aceptar y entender cada uno de los trabajadores, orientandolos para que sean mejor cada dia decidi retirarme debido en que ese momento mi pago no me alcanzaba para todos los gastos que tenia y no tuve otra opcion que cambiarme de trabajo"
good,"Being an opener at Starbucks, your day starts at 4:30 in the morning. You set up the espresso machine, which takes only about 15 minutes. From putting on the items cleaned overnight to filling the beans in correct spot. Then you set the coffees to start brewing as well as make the teas for the day. After finished you wait for your customers and the morning rush. Everything from that point on is a breeze. Allowing Starbucks to be a great place to work."
good,"The typical work day consisted of being busy for most, if not all of your shift. Management was fantastic and held strong to the companies core values.The hardest part of the job was that you always had a drink to make an the only break you got was when you got your 15 minute or 30 minute breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with and the customers that I was able to form a connection with."
good,"Great Company to work for, I loved my time with the company. I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule, the willingness to work with different cultures, the people I met. I enjoy the company's education initiatives and their incentives for long term employment. I will miss my discount and the free lb of coffee per week."
good,my everyday life working at starbucks is making drinks and being a cashier. its a day by day on how busy it is. most likely its always busy but you will love it
good,"Working at Starbucks was the best job I've had so far. The people I worked with were very open and fun to work with. If you're scared by competition this is a good place to work because it is not competitive, it's a team effort. Although the pay is not enough to live on (specifically where I lived in Massachusetts) it was a great job to have throughout high school. Overall the company is great and the people you work with make you look forward to going to work."
good,"Excellent company to work for, takes care of all of their employees and its community. Great chance for growth within and make a difference touching the lives of your partners."
good,Loved my job. Wish things worked out. My situation was unique and would still recommend to anyone. Needed to leave for personal reasons but did it the wrong way.
good,"Very fast paced almost all day every day and requires employees to be flexible in their tasks, it can be hard to balance getting drinks made and engaging customers and opening/closing the store. It is really great to have regulars though, they make the rushes seem less busy."
good,You learn a great deal about Starbucks and the environment they are pursuing. Seeks to help you advance your career goals and provides good feedback at your work.
good,Starbucks is a company that Loves their coffee and their Partners (employees). It is an easy going environment that values quality and service. The work can be a bit fast passed but once you adjust it's great.
good,A demanding dynamic work experience that challenges individual abilities in a fast-paced workplace. Personal growth and accomplishment is incubated in a work-environment that effectively balances high-quality service with cohesive support from co-workers and supervisors.
good,I love Starbucks! I still eat & drink there from time to time. We received tips every week. I loved my customers and they gave me gifts from time to time. They loved me
good,A regular day at Starbucks can always be fun. it might get busy with all of peak and at times happy hour but its a comforting environment to walk into.
good,"Have to be quick on your feet and truly keep focus at all times. Drive-thru and cafe stores are usually the toughest to work in, but the more occupied you are, the faster time goes by."
good,"Job is pretty laid back and very customer focused. Pretty easy if you have had previous customer service experience. Job advancement is almost certain if you are hardworking. Benefits are AMAZING. You are eligible for it after 3 months. Free drinks during shift, discounted food, and free 1lb coffee bean every week! Great team too! Management cares about partners"
good,"While I work at a high volume and fast paced store, we always try to keep things entertaining and fun. The company itself is extremely inclusive, and diverse, and my store reflects that. Starbucks has high quality, and health standards which can be a bit overwhelming at first, but that just makes the company so successful. Starbucks really looks out for their partners and offers many great benefits!"
good,"beaucoup avantages !"
good,I loved working at Starbucks! It was a great part time job that introduced me to the food industry! It allowed me to work in High School while also having the flexibility to maintain my school and social life!
good,"I am in a high volume store right on the beach, which can get VERY stressful and hectic a lot of the time, but this has taught me how to deal with every situation thrown at me in a professional manner. My coworkers are delightful to work with, and have become more like family than colleagues, but we still make sure to respect and look after each other. One of the annoying things about Starbucks is the constant pressure you have on you to be perfect. While I do partially understand the ""customer is always right"" approach, I think partners need to be cut some slack, and actually be backed up by management whenever something goes wrong. Management is far too often throwing partners under the bus and completely siding with customers when they are in the wrong. But oh well, I guess that's with every company. While I wish the pay was better, the benefits and stock options make up for all the awful things we go through. Overall, I think Starbucks is a great place to work at, and your coworkers will become some of your closest friends. You will be very stressed sometimes, but at the end of the day it's just another bad food service story to tell your friends."
good,"I really loved working there, I made tons of friends and really enjoyed what I did. I never had a bad day at work. Sure, there were bad moments like soillimg a drink on yourself in the middle of a rush, but it was never enough to ruin the day! My boss in the other hand picked favorites and made it obvious and at the time, I was busy with highschool and was given the cold shoulder at work. By my boss only."
good,"Luckily I had a store manager who truly cared for her partners.  She worked with my changing schedule for school and was truly someone who was in my corner.  She was always willing to work with me and help me grow as a partner within the company, but also supported my career aspirations and dreams.  I enjoyed working with my fellow partners and we always had a good time."
good,"There is definitely opportunities to advance in Starbucks, the only thing that can stop you is a store manager who doesn't know how to run a store. Aside from that, they have great benefits such as healthcare and partaking in their stocks and encourage you to be a coffee guru."
good,"There was never a dull moment, yet your opportunities to have fun and make customers happy were endless, which was my favorite thing about the job. Most of the people I worked with were wonderful people, and I met so many customers who both influenced me and were influenced by me (I believe)."
good,The job was very stressful when you have rushes and you’re working by yourself. The problem that we had was we were understaffed most of the time. We barley had enough closers and I would open and close sometimes. Overall the job was perfect when everything was under control but lately it hasn’t been like that.
good,"I loved working at starbucks, I made a lot of friends, most of the customers were very friendly, and I got along well with everyone. I was extremely impressed how organized it is working there."
good,"Starbucks overall was a awesome place to work. The pay was good, you get free drinks and food while working, and the hours usually aren't too bad. I worked there as my first job."
good,Takes time to adjust but can be fun and customers can be nice sometimes too. The company overall is nice but depending on management you can love it or hate it
good,i liked everything about starbucks.  i only left because i wanted a career shift and was not able to find a suitable position in the company before my contract expired.
good,I love working at Starbucks. I feel very welcomed as soon as I walk through the doors my boss is great and so are my coworkers 👍 and I really would love to grow with the company.
good,"Taking orders and making drinks.  Completing tasks such as cleaning, making coffee or tea and using the cash register! Completing tasks the managers assign for you to do.  Nice company to work for, great benefits!"
good,"Starbucks is a great first job, and can even progress into a career! Starbucks values partners who are motivated and will put effort into promoting its employees who show promise and desire for promotion"
good,"I only work mornings so a typical day for me is coming in while it is still slow enough to stock and get ready for the rush hour. Working mornings, I have learned to communicate not only with co-workers but with customers as well. My customer service has gotten a lot better since working at Starbucks because 95% of the time i am on the clock, i am always helping a customer. The management and crew are both great. The more we get along, the better the shift will run smooth. The hardest part of the job is having to communicate with fellow co-workers about certain things especially since we all go through different customers in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing my regular customers everyday and knowing that I hand crafted their beverage just the way they like it."
good,Love working at Starbucks - people I worked with are amazing and I love the customer interaction. It was a steady pace and full of all sorts of interesting moments in a day - never a dull moment
good,Currently I've been working at Starbucks for closer to 9 months now and recently had the opportunity to go to a new store to open and be promoted. I've had a fantastic social experience with the company and hopefully with me raise it will feel more worth it
good,"great culture, love the atmosphere, will recommend, can be tough but great support from DM. Can't imagine doing anything else. Will like to further develop into new roles in the company."
good,The corporate culture of Starbucks sets it a part from most retailers on the market today.  They put a very strong value in people and it shows from barista to management.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. The job is fast paced and fun and full of such supportive coworkers! The work environment and the job itself was such fun and I'd recommend it to anyone.
good,"I had intended to stay with my Starbucks store only six months before transferring to the one closest to my dad's house, but I wound up staying over three more years because I loved the store location, the community, customer tips were high, and my team was wonderful to work with. The dress code was easy for me to follow without making major changes to my appearance, the weekly coffee mark-outs benefitted my mother (who was more of a coffee drinker than me at the time), the 30% discount at all corporate stores saved me tons of money each year, and I felt that my customers and team genuinely cared about me at all times. If I had shown interest in a promotion, I would have gotten one as soon as possible, and when I needed time off for family reasons, my manager worked with me without hesitation. I truly miss being a corporate Starbucks barista after leaving the company."
good,Loved working there and my employees and my manager.  Pays very well and even offers free education through Arizona State University.  I would definitely recommend working here to anyone.
good,"Depending on the store, peak levels may vary but customer connections are worth the hard parts, like high customer volumes. There is an emphasis on team effort and connections between partners and customers. I have learned that I like to lead a team, and the promotion made me a happier employee."
good,fast paced environment nice place to work and room for growth and advancement. great company but could pay better .. diverse company no discrimination
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is like walking into the depths of what a functional moving machine to pump out caffeine for their customers in a typical cafe. Busy the the key word here. Being able to be fortunate to work as a barista and as a shift leader, I saw the inner workings of a fast paste and high volume of product being moved. The teams are usually very energetic and enthusiastic about the tasks that are needed to continue throughout the whole day. Customers always come first when dealing with customer service. The products quality is the second part to customer service of course. Welcoming the customer and taking their order is the basis and then producing high quality drinks in a timely manner is the other part. After all said and done, the back floor, the store front always comes second. Remember Starbucks was made to solve a problem like any other business. Saving time and energy for customers will benefit the success of the company and leave a customer happy knowing that they receive a high quality product in a timely manner with friendly/ enthusiastic staff."
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work in. The company offers lots of benefits for partners such as weekly free coffee bean and free drink after work. However, get ready to be patient."
good,"I enjoy my workday at Starbucks. My team is an excellent support system both in our daily tasks at work and my professional life. This job has taught me a lot about working with others whether that be customers or other partners. It is a positive update environment. The hardest part of my job is managing people and resolving conflict but, it is also an excellent learning experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is being part of such a supportive team."
good,"The ambiance is great , it is fast pace and great teams .Company is dissolved and no longer there , but the time that i spend with them was great with the COO and president ."
good,"I love working here, I love my team, and the company. Nothing like it for baristas. I would recommend it to anyone - of any age or race or religion. Like family."
good,"The Starbucks Barista job is absolutely amazing! Overall best job I’ve had! Costumers are friendly, partners engage in teamwork and use it as a goal, and the job has ideal goals placed each day for the store to complete. Well organized job."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes preparing the coffee, food and register before the store opens. After the store is opened, I am either given the role of a barista, cash register or food prep. The workplace culture is very interactive, efficient and enjoyable. The hardest part about working at Starbucks at University of Tampa is that it's closed over summer. The most enjoyable part of working there is the customers and employees I interact with."
good,"Starbucks is, for the most part, a fun job. Though the company prides itself on its mission and value, the company could benefit from a stronger vetting process of its managerial staff. The work place is friendly and quick paced and there is plenty of room for growth. However, as partner of 3 years, I have worked beneath 5 different managers. Each had their unique style and Starbucks story, but few have been able to flourish under the strict labor cuts and drive-through goals. I believe the company as a whole should reevaluate their standards and review their origins."
good,In the store that works the atmosphere was very cordial. The culture of Starbucks helped me in my professional life and in my personal life helped me to be more patient and not to be afraid to ask people how they are or how they are doing in the day since those were moments for me that I felt with I was stressed because I did not know how to talk to people.
good,Friendly environment with awesome goal and management. They only hire the best with the brightest smiles and awesome character. Great place to grow and move up in the company!
good,I really loved working here and loved the people and the company. If the pay had been high enough I would have stayed but was in a financial bind at the time.
good,Wen i started working there i actually ha a hard time making the drinks but they had said t was gonna take some time to learn. after two weeks i got a hang of almost everything and started closing by myself.
good,"Great part time job while you have other things going on in life.  Regular customers and friendly co-workers (""partners"") made this job fun. Never boring!"
good,"Working for Starbucks was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever acquired, it provided me with a new found love and passion for coffee and customer service. I thoroughly enjoyed management, coworkers, and even higher up's that would walk through every couple of months to check in on the store. I found myself accepted in every aspect from my sexuality to my choice in earrings. I would love to work for this company again given the chance and even as a shift supervisor/assistant manager to help give more to the company than just as a barista before."
good,"Starbucks has proven itself time and time again to be an amazing company for both its partners and its customers alike. With a continued growth and development plan in place to help partners achieve their goals in life, I highly approve of Starbucks Coffee."
good,"Incredible work environment, getting to talk and make friends with daily customers. There are many standards and can be complicating when first hired, but it’s a company worth staying employeed with."
good,"Londres es una ciudad grande, pensé que no me adaptaría y me costaría pero resultó ser al revés.Llegué, aprendí un montón de inglés, guardo relación con mis antiguos compañeros de trabajo. Lo más difícil duraba poco porque de 6 de la mañana  a 10 teniamos a mucha gente y había que atenderlos rápido."
good,Starbucks is very good company to work for when starting out from school however depending if staffing is short it can be tuff. Great benefits and leadership development.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, it can be very challenging at times. One thing that I have learned at Starbucks, is that communication and team work is very important, without any of that work can be a very stressful with a lot of hostility, communication is key in order to work in a stress free environment."
good,Es buena empresa solamente hay gente que echa a perder a la compañía
good,"There are great days and not so great days just like at any other work place. Starbucks is customer service driven so there is a lot of trying to please the customer and being polite when its difficult. But they also have a lot of great benefits for their partners. Overall, I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"While beginning to work at Starbucks, I found out I was pregnant with my daughter within my first days. My Starbucks family made me feel at home and made work fun for me, made any accommodations for me when I got to big to be on the bar side and when it came to putting away morning orders.  I learned that my body can withstand a lot even while being 9 months pregnant and still working. The holidays were fun to work because the customers would always bring us food to cheer us up. The hardest part about the job was deciding to leave, it was hard because my Starbucks family all grew so much in love with my daughter and we always looked for each other."
good,"I worked at the Tempe, AZ location and it was honestly the best job I have ever had. My manage was an absolute ray of sunshine who fostered the most inclusive, productive, fun and friendly work environment I could have ever imagined. Still feel so blessed to have gotten this job when I did and many of the friends I made there will last a lifetime."
good,"Highly recommended job for motivated, fast paced workers that have a passion for coffee and customers.  Management is great, Partners are fantastic. Everyone is like family."
good,I was always happy to go to work and be around my coworkers. Everyone got along and we made it feel like we were one family. This is the best place to work and I miss it a lot.
good,"I absolutely love this company, it has been there for me thru rough times and amazing times. A typical day at work starts when the store opens, we prep for peak with is typically 7-11am. Work place culture is always welcoming and warm, we are always smiling and try to make sure we greet you at the door. Hardest part of the job is the toll the job takes on your body. But at the end of the day, every moment is made right."
good,"worked there for almost 3 years now. There is a big room for advancement. "
good,Working at Starbucks really made me into a better person. Before Starbucks I was a sloppy unmotivated person and now I'm very motivated to move forward in life.
good,I really liked working there but i just wish the pay was better for how much we had to do. I also wished i got more hours. Coworkers are team based work so its easy to get help.
good,i have been in the company for several years and the experience was unforgettable.  i learned so much such as how to deliver an excellent customer service
good,"I came to Starbucks with plenty of customer service experience but knew nothing of how to make coffee. Received very in detail training of each product sold. How each drink was made, and even shown what an improper drink/product may look like or taste. Very driven environment to provide the customers with positive experience. It is a fast paced environment and learning all drinks to memory was the hardest part. Most enjoyable part would be customers and coworkers."
good,"My typical day at Starbucks: Change screw shoes and ware apron-log in -greet customers, take orders, make payments,make various drinks, toast breads, write daily log - daily clean - settle accounts -cleaning-log off. "
good,"Very fast paced job, and you need to have good memorization skills. You also need to have good organizational skills and you need to be able to handle situations in a very professional and positive way."
good,"Starbucks overall is a good place to work , it’s very friendly. Has great benefits and a nice management team. Also it very relaxing, you’ll always have something to do"
good,"Where I worked it was extremely busy, but I love working under pressure. The people I work with are amazing. If there are any problems it gets fixed asap. I also love that you get regulars and you look forward to seeing them everyday. Overall, I love working for Starbucks."
good,typical day at starbucks is very fast paced from the minute you open the doors to customers. the goal is to strive and make sure every customer walks out with a smiling face.
good,"Morning Coffee everyone wants a Caramel Macchiato which I specialized in making delicious for my customers. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. The hardest part on the job is getting behind on drinks. While the store is busy. But the most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with them, making sure all the customers leave with a smile on there face."
good,The job was a great growing experience with support from other managers where we really worked as a team in the whole district. The company offers great benefits that are hard to beat anywhere else.
good,"Although the pay has not always been fair for the labor involved, the benefits definitely made a huge difference. I also felt empowered and motivated while working there."
good,This is the perfect job for a young person. Very stress free and fun environment. I've loved working here and having fun with my coworkers during each season launch. I highly recommend working for this company.
good,"Its good place to work, all benefits, help pay for college, very flexible. You definitely have to be fast past. They will train you. You will meet greet people."
good,"I absolutely love working here. I have a great team and great store manager. Its a great company and environment. The job can either be very busy or slow, but its sometimes nice to have a mix of that. Everyone is quick to help you learn and grow in the company."
good,"Easy Job, everyone is friendly and it's a very comfortable space. you can pick up shifts at any other Starbucks. Their benefits are incredible, and there's lots of room for growth."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. great vibes, awesome management. The customers were friendly, mostly regulars. Very upbeat job and tasting all the coffee was a plus."
good,"Un día en Sbux es totalmente productivo, desde abrir tienda por la mañana a cerrar tienda por la noche."
good,The company it self is good to work for if you don't mind the hours and the pay. The availability of hours to work is perfect for a college student and helps some pay the bills if you don't have large expenses.
good,"Starbucks has been so much different then I anticipated. It can be fast paced, which can be slightly stressful for some. However I've always found that the staff and customers at Starbucks have made the experience what is is. "
good,It was a great experience. My work team was very helpful and polite. my manager was an excellent leader and kind human. My work experience grew in a very good way and I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Fairly flexible schedule, depending on location. Great benefits possible if you average 20 hours a week. Very fast paced, but once you’re used to it, it’s a fun environment. Get to know great customers and see them on a daily basis."
good,Starbucks coffee make the days better. Flexible hours. Decent benefits. Free drinks. It's local in everywhere. I will be proud if I work for Starbucks.
good,"Get what you put in, learned alot about myself and my patience level. very fast paced but manageable if you actually care. Honestly would suggest if you need benefits even part time. Being a shift is the best until its not."
good,Wonderful workplace.  It is stressful at times because of the pace but the support from staff makes it worth it.  The job itself is not that hard once you got the basics down.
good,Starbucks really puts  emphasize on professionalism as much as friendly atmosphere.Co-workers are really friendly and helpful. Management makes sure everyone keeps high standards but at the same time is patient with their new team members and are very professional when any problems occur.
good,can be fast pace and always something to do. The culture of Starbucks encourages a passion for coffee and community involvement. I enjoyed working at Starbucks.
good,"Worked for about a year and a half at a starbucks and it was probably the most enjoyable job I have ever worked in, the team is like your second family as you always work closely together and you become really good friends with them inside and outside of work. The management always try to give you the hours that you want/need and you can definitely have a life outside of work."
good,working for 8hour per day in 6days per week learn me how to be a good barista. workplace also fun and in a good management. but every workplace has hard part which is we need to reach target but its fun cause we studies how to finding customer in other way not only selling or beverage.
good,"The atmosphere within this company is incredible! The store manager, as well as the coworkers, are super friendly and helpful. The most fun part of this job is the fact that you constantly have to interact with customers and make their experience in the store unforgettable. I definitely recommend working for this company."
good,"Caso haja interesse para crescimento dentro da empresa, o plano de carreira é bem programado."
good,"This was a great job during my college career. flexible hours, decent tips and unlimited free coffee. management was great at my location. everyone got their 10 minute breaks and lunches at reasonable times. Culture is key so its dependent on the work ethic of your coworkers to be part of a good team."
good,"Great if you're looking for your first job, some of a learning curve. Great people to work with if you're nervous about meeting new people. Great benefits for a new job seeker."
good,"I've learned what it really feels like to be apart of a team and I have people who actually help me and don't judge me."
good,Can't say enough good about working at Starbucks.  If they had a job for me I would definitely work there full time. The culture was very young and vibrant.  I was a contract worker and very much wanted to be full time but I suppose I did not fit the demographic they want.  Getting older a b....
good,When I worked at Starbucks I became a shift supervisor in 6 months. They move you up very quickly. They gave raises every 6 months.  The least amount I ever got for a raise was 25 cents. The hours weren't amazing coming to work at 5:30am but you do get off at 1pm. Overall its a great place to work.
good,Can be very stressful but overall is a great place to work. Never a dull moment. Requires the ability to not get flustered easily.  Managers are very helpful and coworkers tend to get along very well.
good,"Fue una experiencia que me encanto, hice compañeros muy buenos y el ambiente de trabajo era excelente."

good,once getting to know the menu the drinks become very easy to make. practice makes perfect. everyone at work is supportive and work together as a team. The store manager is very understanding and will work around your schedule.
good,"In depth training regards to coffee knowledge, beverage sequencing etc. Friendly and knowledgable shift supervisors and managers to help you wherever you need it"
good,"I absolutely love this company if I did not need more money to live I would never leave.  The management can be great at times, and I've really enjoyed working here over the past five years but I'm ready to move onto something new."
good,"The pay at first is minimum wage but there is multiple opportunities to move up in the company. The co-workers/management are amazing and super friendly."
good,I know jobs aren’t suppose to be fun but Starbucks is an exception the workers are lively the musics good and the drinks are great it’s a good job to have whether temporary or long term
good,"Starbucks was a wonderful company to work for. I simply left due to being promoted to a manager at Red Robin. They offered many benefits for partners with 20+ hours of availabilty a week. I wouldn't trade my time there for anything. I learned even more about customer service, even though I had many years prior in that field, and I connected with new people all of the time, making work a fun part of my life as well. The hardest part was probably just simply learning all of the different drinks! ha!"
good,A typical day included making drinks for an ample amount of customers in a timely manner. Was abled to deal with stress from customers and still keep a positive attitude. Seeing regulars and hearing what they were going to do for the day or weekend always was always exciting.
good,really good company to work for
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for, the studio I worked for has an amazing talent pool."
good,"-I learned a lot about the culture of coffee and different types of coffee as well as what they pair with"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work, you meet the most amazing people. The compensation and benefits are top notch, and you're able to have a flexible schedule"
good,Starbucks was a great place to work and get a feel for the real world. I enjoyed all of my coworkers and management and appreciated most of the customers. The work can be hard though and you tend to feel overworked and underpaid... Management encourages you to promote
good,"A typical day at work consist of making coffee for our customers. Usually I work in the morning, therefore, we make sure that our coffee is always fresh. All of our partners help one another in busy situations. We are good at working as team, we try not to let down our costumers. Our hardest part of the job is making sure the coffee is just the way the customer is looking for. Overall, work environment is safe and fun. I enjoy it."
good,"My drive thru store does 100+ transactions per half hour."
good,"I couldn’t tell you how much fun and amazing the baristas are! It felt like I had a second family there. The benefits at Starbucks are great! And starbucks is really amazing to their baristas. It is a faced paced job, but it is so much fun learning new things and meeting new people. I was so sad to leave when I moved and I would go back in a heart beat!"
good,"While starbucks isn't the idea coffee shop job (you don't pull your own shots) it's a great place to start off for people who want to get more into coffee and learn more about it, it also looks great on a resume for anyone looking to apply to another coffee shop because you learn all the basic concepts needed to be a barista."
good,Guests were great. Drinks were easy to make. Staff was helpful and pleasure to work with. Management knew what they were doing. I enjoyed coming into work everyday.
good,"lo considero no solo un trabajo o una empresa "
good,"The Starbucks location I worked at was a high volume, high stress location due to its proximity to the airport. My shift started at 3:30am on almost every shift I worked, and customers already began arriving at 4:00am. At its peak, there could be up to 15/20 customers in line, with new customers consistently arriving to replaced previously serviced ones, and yet the Starbucks team could move through it like clockwork. The shift managers were on the floor, directing the workplace and servicing customers simultaneously, and yet managed a friendly and welcoming attitude despite the inherent stress of their positions. The store manager, as well, was constantly active in the workplace, doing as much as the baristas in addition to his specialty assignments. The employees were friendly and welcoming both to coworkers and customers, creating a rich and open environment that would make anyone feel comfortable and at ease. Almost every part of this job was high stress, yet the job was enjoyable and manageable thanks to the powerful workplace community. I would be glad to work at Starbucks again."
good,"Being a partner at starbucks is one of the best experience I really want, for me being barista is so cool for me because i love what i am doing and i enjoyed a lot"
good,I loved working there I learned new things but it really upset me having to leave.  There were not enough people there to work and I had to leave due to pregnancy.
good,"loved working there, created great relationships and was able to gain valuable work experience. I would highly recommend working there. Great benefits and work hours."
good,A typical day at work varied depending on the time of the shift. Morning shifts were busy with customers and evening shifts were typically quieter but involved more cleaning. The store was incredibly well managed and that's what made working at Starbucks so enjoyable. There was an ideal balance between our manager having high expectations and understanding that as students our lives were also extremely busy.
good,"Great experience, just wasn't enough pay for my age.The job had alot of hands on experience. I acquired management and money tools while working at the company."
good,A great company to work at as far as management and employees. The benefits are amazing and the company treats their employees very well. I got along great with everyone I worked with and they were all very friendly. The hours were very flexible.
good,"Normally in the mornings of Starbucks when it opens is usually the busiest time of the day. When you first come in everyone gets assigned to a station, one person can be at the register and at the drive thru while two people are at the espresso machines and one in the back for frappi's. Usually if there is a drive thru there will be another person at espresso machine back there so the espresso machine up front won't be backed up from drive thru orders. Also there is a person at the ovens for the morning rush for foods and as the day goes on the cashier will take over the ovens when the morning rush is done."
good,"Very demanding but very rewarding. What matters most is the attitude you have while working, your patience will be tested but if you remember that at the end of the day everyone is human it will be okay. There are good and bad days and good and bad customers as long as you have a positive attitude you will be okay."
good,"Pay is just ok, but benefits and culture of company is excellent. Training is good and company promotes well.  Benefits are available if working 20 hours a week or more and include health, dental, eye, life, stocks, 401K and college education."
good,"Free drinks while you work, free food item while you work, free lb of coffee/box of Kcups/Verismo pods/box of tea a week, 30% discount while not working, 30% off all merchandise, ASU online if you work 20 hours a week and find a college degree you are able to do online"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work when you're starting off with employment. It really allowed me to engage with customers and learn different needs of different people. The environment was always fun and energetic. Interacting with new people every day was the best part about working in Starbucks, especially if you're a talker. "
good,I really like working there because it is laid back most of the time and Starbucks really cares about their employees. The only thing I don't like is that we are understaffed most times.
good,Starbucks is a great company to learn how to be with people. You become very humbled by interactions with so many different types of people. It builds appreciation in the customer service industry building strong work ethic!
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for a individual who is a hard working type of person. I liked the fast paced environment while connecting with the customers. I learned a lot during my multiple times of working for a Starbucks.
good,"There were many duties I have to perform as a barista. Knowing every position was essential because I could be placed anywhere in the store at any time. Cleanliness was also important. Whenever I was not making drinks or helping a customer, I would be cleaning the store and doing our daily tasks. The most important thing in the store was the customer and to make sure they were satisfied with their beverage and/or food and that it is their tastes and received in a timely fashion. It is essential to have good customer service skills at this job because at times, the store runs out of product and then I would try to accommodate to the customers needs of what he/she would rather get instead or to give them a recovery certificate for the loss. Teamwork is also important; as I work I make sure that every partner is taken care of. If they needed help, I would make myself available to help and if I was unable to help then get my supervisor."
good,"Great customer service, Professional partners, management was very hands on. Making sure every customer was happy leaving was the most enjoyable part of my day. Customer service is important and maintaining a high level of patience and care in the job is important."
good,If placed in the right store you are welcomed like family and have the pleasure of working together to create awesome experiences while learning about coffee culture and the diversity of the world.
good,"Fast-paced, but good chances for raises. I've heard since I left they've added the opportunity to get free college online through University of Arizona."
good,"Fast paced day.  Lots of people to talk to.  You can make someone's day better with a smile, quick conversation, and a great cup of coffee.  As long as everyone pulls their weight, you will have a great day!"
good,a typical day is creating an atmosphere where customers feel delighted and served by a friendly barista . On the floor coaching and developing your team to drive service and met daily business goals
good,"As a barista, making a perfect cup of coffee or latte is an art for each cup, remembering recipes was the hardest part of the job. Finding the energy boost for customers either by a perfect breakfast or latte is highly important due to being the first interaction customers have each morning, you either make or break their start of the day. Management are great teachers and are always readily available to assist employees with questions they may have.  The workplace is a friendly workplace that will make make the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I miss working at Starbucks! Or ATLEAST the location I worked at. I say this because I picked up hours at many other stores in the district and each one gave off a different atmosphere. The good out weighed the bad and that's what matters most about being apart of this company. I loved the experience, I loved the benefits, I loved my partners, my managers and most importantly the customers(patrons)!"
good,"Loved every minute of my employment, everyday was fun and full of excitement. I miss my co-workers and customers to this day. The best location in New Orleans is on Magazine and Washington!!!! Miss Y'all!"
good,"At Starbucks, I typically worked after school until closing. My manager and I had to work at getting the store cleaned and ready for the openers, while serving customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was always being able to connect with someone, whether it be a customer or a coworker."
good,"Wonderful work environment.  Standing whole shift, heavy lifting, speed, memory, customer service needed!! One ten minute break and one 30 minute meal!"
good,"Starbucks was honestly the best first job a 16 year old could get because it really taught me how to handle multiple different customers in a fast-paced environment while managing homework and my hours as well as driving time and scheduling. It was a coming of age moment for me, so Starbucks was not meant to be a job to last me forever, but it was a job that got me started."
good,I wish I did not have to move away for college because honestly working at Starbucks was the best! They treat you right and allow you the opportunity to better yourself.
good,"I love working here and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a steady paced, stable job with everything like health benefits, stock options, 401K, and life insurance. The atmosphere is awesome and so are the partners. Always ready to help a fellow partner out with tasks, team work truly makes the dream work."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for if your out of high school they’re insurance is the best ever there benefits are super great. They pay for your school but it’s online only.
good,"Great manager, wonderful vibe in our store. Getting to know the customers drinks & making them they way they preferred. Learned that being a barista can be as hard as being CEO of a company. Thank you for all those that work in the underarms to make a company what it really is!!!"
good,"um lugar onde parece sua casa, um ambiente maravilhoso pra se trabalhar gerencia e funcionarios maravilhosos, so tenho a agradecer pela oportunidade que me foi proporcionada"
good,It was a wonderful job. I worked at a branch in a safeway grocery store but it still felt like working in a stand alone store. Customers are wonderful and coworkers are easy to get along with.
good,"Great management, loved going in to work. Customers were friendly, scheduling was easy, if there was ever an issue with schedule management was always there to help."
good,"The Starbucks company is a great company to work for. They are very flexible with my hours and meet all of my needs. I enjoy the environment and the homey atmosphere the store gives off. Learning how to correctly make all of the drinks was a bit overwhelming at first, but the management made sure to assist me when I became frazzled. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting every customers' need as well as making an impact on their life, even if it was just for a moment."
good,I love working at Starbucks! I was hired as an assistant manager without having any prior Starbucks experience. The hiring process was great and everyone was so friendly. The employees are nice and the managers are great.
good,I enjoyed working for this company because my fellow coworkers were great to work with and every customer that came through the door enjoyed returning because we provided a relaxed environment and delivered quality service.
good,"Loved the atmosphere. the menu is constantly changing so I am always learning new things, & it was so much fun to be educated about coffee. plus, the people you will meet & work with are a blast!"
good,"My store that I worked in was pretty quiet but we were always working hard, I was part of a franchise store whilst I worked there. Very rewarding, no complaints, any problem that occurred was dealt with professionally and quickly. I still talk to my Starbucks family even though I live 200 miles away!"
good,"Working the night shift, it was laid back. No one was rushing. It was a low-stress environment. It was easy to connect with the customers and focus on my work."
good,"The entry level position pays a little over minimum wage, but the benefits are unlike anything else I've ever seen.  There is room for advancement if you're willing to do the training."
good,"Great place to work, gives great benefits, met some great people, and learned how to deal with such a wide scope of customers. Wouldn't work there full time, but it allows for a school life-work balance."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working there and was sad to leave. Everyone I worked with was friendly and welcoming, with the exception of one person. You always had something to do. It was never boring."
good,"As the Starbucks was at Sacramento State University, it was busy, requiring the baristas to be flexible with customers and fast-paced. As a team, the baristas kept great communication and a laid back environment that was expected from Starbucks."
good,I really enjoyed my time with the company. The management was great from the start in making sure I understood the values and goals of being a team member.
good,"Wanted to work here for a little bit before I got the job, loved coffee and the atmosphere. Was hoping to learn some unique things, grow as a person and make some friendships. All of those things happened. Got to know the regulars and they got to know me. Being able to rely on others when you needed was very easy at this job."
good,Really recommended for someone who is just starting off in the work field. Great way to build experience in customer service. Starbucks takes care of their employees.
good,My experience working for Starbucks has changed over the years. When I first started at the company the feeling was different and it felt more like a coffee shop where people would hang out to talk and relax. There has been a transition from that tradition to a fast-paced get in and get out sort of place. There used to be time to talk with customers for a moment and talk about their day while making drinks etc but those days seem to be gone as well. I do love working there but I miss how the company was when I first started. There used to be time for fun in between work but now there doesn`t seem to be a place for that any longer. I enjoyed the regulars as well as my coworkers which is why I think I have stayed there for so long because it feels like a second home to me.
good,I was going through a rough time in my life and my manager was very understanding. She understood when I had to leave to take care of my mental health.
good,"I start my work in December 2010 in 2 years i was promote to shift leader and move to more busier store. "
good,It was a very fast paced environment which i loved because there was alway something to keep you busy. All of my coworker were wonderful people to work with. I really enjoyed going to work everyday. I enjoyed making peoples drinks and seeing them happy after.
good,"Starbucks takes pride in their talent and treats them well. I've worked on a few projects here over the years and have always admired how they take good care of their people. They support American jobs, hire people of ALL ages, all while embracing diversity. They are a relaxed culture, but amazingly productive at the same time. I honestly believe most other PMO's have a lot to learn from these guys and the way they run their projects to align with their culture. People come first here."
good,I  would say that just coming in to work were everyone is fretful and ready to work. The work culture was very diverse there was never a duel moment. hardest time their i would say when the cheer convention was there and all they would order was Fraps so it mad it pretty hard to get the drink done in a timely manner. I loved working the overtime just getting to see different people and hearing there stories and just the communication I had with others.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you are a High School, College, and potentially a career starter. A typical day at Starbucks consist of becoming mentally prepared to assist a large number of customers a day. Starbucks gives you a great experience of getting to learn different cultures."
good,"The partners i work with were all very cooperative and readily to help each other. They were really helpful when i first started as a barista. I never have the experience as a barista but because of them, i find it interesting despite the difficulties i faced while trying to make all the beverages. The managers were also down to earth and really good in conducting us."
good,"Although I worked for a Starbucks in a Target, I imagine the experience was quite similar. The management allowed us to be pretty independent on our shifts. Barista training was thorough and "
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. A typical day at Starbucks is fast-paced with a positive work environment. There is always something new to learn with seasonal drinks and limited time offers. Every day poses an opportunity to grow, learn, and improve; whether it pertains to the drinks themselves, the customers and their day to day lives, or updated company standards. Furthermore, the shift leads and store managers do an incredible job making sure each store is running smoothly and efficiently keeps up with company standards, while also creating the best customer experience. The most difficult part of being a barista is getting every task accomplished within scheduled shift hours on top of accomplishing customer needs. What is most enjoyable about working as a barista at Starbucks would be building customer connections and working with such positive and influential individuals working towards a bigger purpose."
good,"The 6 months I have worked here were great! They were flexible with hours, and had many benefits. My Starbucks team was great, and the atmosphere was incredible there."
good,"Co-workers are more your friends, management is awesome, and the benefits are crazy. I plan to work for starbucks at least part-time as long as I can cause the benefits are amazing even for part-time plus 30% all the time isn't too bad either."
good,"It was a temporary job that I had while going through college, but I overall enjoyed my time working there. The people were nice, the atmosphere was pleasant, and it was a good experience"
good,"I love being a barista. It's super fun to make coffee and the culture is fun. You get free drinks and a meal each shift. It is for sure fast paced, but it honestly depends on which store you work at (same with good management). They are very accepting of all kinds of people."
good,"You meet the best people, the management does everything they can to see you succeed. There's so many reasons this company is consistently one of the best to work for. Pay is usually minimum wage but you cant get better benefits for part time work. Free drinks, food, and perks! I love and miss this job. Only downside was i worked openings and mornings are NOT my thing."
good,"Even though the pay is not as high as other customer service related fields, the benefits like low cost healthcare or vision care or even free ""bean"" stocks definitely make up for it."
good,This is a great place to work to get customer service experience. I love the fast-paced environment! Hardest part of the job was lifting things that were heavy or things that were too high. I am 4'11!
good,"Creative, professional and positive working environment and colleagues. Highly recommend."
good,"Flexible schedule, good training, awesome benefits usually cool people and ability to advance. Even when stressful it's still overall pretty chill and an enjoyable place to work."
good,"At a typical day at work, I would open in the mornings. This would consist of stocking shelves, setting up the pastry case, and brewing large batches of coffee to prepare for the morning crowd. However, once the coffee shop opened, I would alternate between operating the cash register and making food or drinks as a barista. It was a fun, and fast-paced job. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that I was working quickly and efficiently in order to keep up with the morning traffic that was coming into our store. The most enjoyable part of my day was making beverages. It was a lot of fun to get to learn so much about coffee and how to make the different kinds of drinks."
good,"Starbucks has been a wonderful opportunity to work with all sorts of different people. The management was great and I love the customers. The benefits are amazing, and the environment is homey."
good,"I would recommend working at Starbucks Coffee Corporation."
good,"Honestly really loved this job, it was a great working environment and the customers were simply amazing. I️ was sad when I️ had to move and leave this job."
good,"Regular day at Starbucks would consist of cashier taking all money, baristas making drinks and finishing there orders out to keep customers happy. Loved the free drinks!"
good,I love working for Starbucks awesome place i love coffee so that made it even more fun to work there. The managers was great and vey understanding...awesome team members.
good,"Starbucks is by far my favourite company that I had the pleasure of working for! I love the beliefs and goals that the company instills in their employees (world wide)! Starbucks is so set on customer service and global satisfaction that the first and main thing they teach you is how to make every customer experience unique, personalized, and pleasant! They want all of their customers to know that they are valued and that when a hard day hits, Starbucks is a place where you can unwind and feel at ease, while enjoying a delicious hand crafted, high quality beverage/snack! They ensure the best quality of product, always. Their standards for service, cleanliness, and product quality are outstanding, which makes it very easy for you, as an employee, to believe in the product you're selling and the company you work for! The customers and the company beliefs to me, are the best part of the job! The other wonderful part of the company is how open they are to diversity! They are all for self expression, which is really nice to see in a company, because it makes it more personalized both for the staff as well as the customers while maintaining a professional setting. (There is a  good balance between self expression but also keeping everything tasteful and professional) I truly cannot say enough good things about this company!"
good,It was great. But since it was an airport Starbucks it was much more busier and fast paced that most because people were flying somewhere. The team was pretty fun.
good,"To love the job you need to genuinely like customer service- if not, just don’t apply.  As a manager you write your own schedule and hire and train your team- so for the large part you are creating the experience for yourself.  There is of course guidelines and rules to follow and s strong company culture-  but for me those things all made the job easier and more enjoyable.  It’s hard work to maintain a successful team-  but for me it has been extremely rewarding."
good,"It was a very fun and fast paced job , there are times we are slow and there were times when we were packed, overall the experience was great. My favorite part about Starbucks was getting to know my customers and building relationships with my regulars."
good,"Travailler pour starbucks c'est travailler avec sa famille. Remplis de defis, de plaisirs et d'apprentissage chaque jours. Ils savent bien prendre soin de leurs partenaires."
good,"Great company to work for, as a manager they really push you so you need to make time for work/life balance.  Great benefits and amazing culture of people."
good,I worked at Starbucks for 1 and a half years and I loved it. The people I worked with were fun and easy to get along with and I always enjoyed going to work. It was a busy job that kept you always moving but that made time go by fast.
good,"Starbucks is the best company I've ever worked for. It is a place to grow as a person. The more you know the more confident in your abilities you become. Working with the team at Starbucks is rewarding, you not only learn about coffee culture, and cafe culture, it gives you a chance to make bonds with your teammates that improve the quality of service, and keep customers coming back every day!"
good,The typical day at Starbucks is fast paste and fun. Its a fun place to work because of the positive environment. Most of the customers were regulars and they became friends.
good,This was such an incredible environment to work in. Everyone should have the opportunity to be a partner at least once in their lives. I met so many people from so many incredible backgrounds. They care so much about their partner's.
good,"It was a pretty great job, loved being around all new drinks and new ways to be creative with them! It was nice to work there, fairly easy going, but when there was a crowd! Whee! You really had to move to get people their drinks, I worked at a location that had a ice skating rink. So things could get really crazy!"
good,"i jacob riley loved working for starbucks, like most jobs it has its struggles but i have always overcome them. i have learned a lot of skills like patients, hard work, n how to work n maintain a positive attitude in a fast paste environment, also learn how great time and place and how to prioritize my time n responsibilities in a scheduled time."
good,Starbucks was and is such an amazing company to work for. Their hours are flexible and the managers are approachable. All my coworkers were friendly. The company has good benefits and over all good work environment.
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits. It is a hard job at first but it gets easier with time. Customers can be quite difficult at times, but most of the regulars are very sweet."
good,At the intersection of Humanity / Brand / Sustainability and Craft.  An amazing place to carve your own self from the wood of your character.  A place that given time you can move the world...
good,"how the staff communicate with their customers is absolutely incomparable to any other coffee shops, they are confident talking about their products no matter what you asked them they can give straight forward answers without any doubts, the coffee knowledge especially of the team is very impressive."
good,"I have enjoyed all my years at Goodyear, although I feel its best to find something different than the food industry. I am looking for a different atmosphere and a different scenery."
good,"A wonderful career to hold to help yourself and other develop a warming and welcoming environment. Will develop skills to create drinks, and specialty orders for customers, meet a network of people from all different backgrounds. You become proficient in the culture of coffee."
good,"Starbucks is a busy, fun place to work. I've learned a lot about coffee but also about customer service. It is busy a lot of the time, but it makes time fly by. One of the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers on a regular basis and becoming a part of their life."
good,"It is always an honour to know our customer in a professional manner, giving the best service that we can! And always going beyond expectation. We always treated each one of us with respect!"
good,"Starbucks for me was a great environment to work in. When the atmosphere is right, the team you work with is unstoppable. Morning rushes are the busiest time of the day but it always made me happy knowing I'm sending someone off to work in a good mood when I provide them with excellent service! Starbucks offers medical insurance as well as a 401K to their employees. They also work with your schedule if you are a student! Starbucks has always been at the top of my list of the jobs I have worked because it just that much fun."
good,"Working at Starbucks was the best work experience I have ever had. People are very respectful and fun to work with, lots of social interaction with customers, and I learned a lot about coffee and working with the public. The best part about the job was that everyone worked together as a team, management worked very well with my schedule, and my coworkers were like family."
good,"I recommend and will continue to recommend Starbucks to anyone looking for a job. Its a really neat environment that if so desired allows quick advancement. OUTSTANDING benefits, plus stock options in the company, a pretty nice discount, weekly coffee mark outs, so much more! They accommodate scheduling so well!"
good,"The Starbucks i work at is very busy especially in weekend considering we are located inside of the mall. I have a love hate relationship with my team but we always work it out and get the job done! Love them, they definitely keep it interesting."
good,most enjoyable job I have had in my 10 yrs of work. benefits are incredible. Customers are the highlight of my day. truly a wonderful company to work for.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work while in college, scheduling is flexible with school hours and always makes accommodations when there is work and school conflicts. Starbucks is a great place to start out your working career with a fast paced environment and interactions with people from different types of backgrounds and life experiences both on the team and the customers who come into the stores."
good,My review on Starbucks is awesome I would have it any other way.. I think Starbucks is one of the best places u can work...I love satisfying the customers customer satisfaction is one important thing
good,Working at Starbucks I truly felt a sense of community with everyone that was employed there. Management is devoted to their store and making sure that all employees are satisfied.
good,"It's a great place to meet fun people, learn about coffee, and enjoy a fast-paced work environment. It can get stressful when it's busy/under-staffed, but overall I loved working there."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. The management was excellent and the staff were a great group of people to work with. I learned a lot on how to multi task, organize my priorities, and make sure all customers had a satisfying experience."
good,"There is always opportunity for improvement. You meet diverse people and learn to develop good working relationships with many people. It is a fast paced and stressful job every day, you must be willing to work and cooperate with others. Seeing customers and partners happy is what makes my days at work worth while/"
good,"I have worked at several different locations and have found that each store team is upbeat, diverse, and fun to work with. The employees are well taken care of by management, generally, and we get great benefits working a minimum of only 20 hours per week. From my experience, managers understand that happy employees work harder and create happy customers, so our needs are always taken care of as best as possible. There is always opportunity for advancing your career."
good,"Starbuck's was a great place to work.  My team and I shared a deep passion for the culture and the company's products.  It was fast-paced, and fun.  Starbuck's is truly dedicated to giving each customer a great experience.  Because of the great customer service, Starbuck's will always be a leader in their industry."
good,"I've loved my time with Starbucks. It's an incredibly conscientious company with immense respect for their employees. Starbucks truly does go above and beyond with everything that they do, and I can't recommend it enough."
good,"•Well-trained in making espresso beverages/coffee expert"
good,"Very faced paced job and you do get to meet a lot of people (good and bad) . At my location, my partners and I all work together well and we are a very tight knit staff. Customer service is our main priority as well as making and fulfilling orders in a timely fashion. I love that Starbucks is very supportive of all no matter the race, gender, and status. We receive great benefits, but a partner must reach at least 20 hours per week in order to receive medical, vision and dental benefits. My most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to talk to our customers, especially the non-regulars."
good,Was one of the best jobs I have had. I met life long friends that i will stay connected with the culture and the people are second to none. The work isn't easy but work never is The people and the culture make it all worth it!
good,"It is a good company I must say. Even its just my first work I was able to excel because of the company's passion for excellence and coffee. You'll meet a lot of people and relate with different kinds of customers. The training was good, I could even call my manager and other boss by their first names. I got free coffees every shift and even incentive quarterly. What I just dont like is when I am sick I have to call 8 hrs before for absence and sometimes it is not yet approved"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, even better if you're a student and need the flexible hours to go with your course schedule. You can always learn more from different courses within the company i.e. Coffee Master program."
good,Want to have fun in a busy environment? This is the job for you.  Connect with people of  all ages and backgrounds.  Brighten someones day with just a cup of coffee or tea.
good,"I had an excellent experience working for Starbucks. As a part time Barista, I made a lot of connections with customers and co workers that I will have for a long time. I appreciate the training process and the management is always available and helpful."
good,Customers are loyal and friendly. Great environment to work in. Loved the team members that helped you out. It is also very fun to learn how to make all the cool drinks and make latte art. Hardest part of the job is remembering how to make the drinks faster and still connect with the customers. Rush is at 6 am til 9 am. Night rush starts at 6 pm- 8 pm.
good,"starbucks is an amazing place to work, i have truly enjoyed working for them 4 years and its great for a first job. the best part of my job is making other people happy and creating an inspired moment."
good,"Generally very good, the cleaning had been done meticulously, great brand culture, very welcome to team players, the foods provided always fresh, had a great experience worked there."
good,Good job for HS and college students. Also as an income supplement. Sometimes a busy pace. Must enjoy working with the public. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"This was probably my favorite job ever. The company really cares, and shows that with discounts, stock options, and matching 401K's.I am a morning person so being able to get my workday done before noon was ideal."
good,"Working With Starbucks Was Amazing! There Is So Much To Learn That You Learn Something New Everyday. Starbucks Is An Amazing Company And Does The Right Thing For There Employees. The Hardest Part Of The Job Would Probably Be The Lack Of Communication Between Corporate And The Stores. However The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was The People, Not Only My Co-Workers And Management But The Customers As Well! One Of The Hardest Things About Leaving Was Saying Goodbye To All The Regular Customers."
good,"I enjoyed my experience working with Starbucks, the partners I worked with were amazing, we always looked out for each other and ensured work safety protocols were followed at all times. Some customers have even said we had too much fun working together, and I definitely agree. Working at the store I worked at for those years taught me so many different things, such as how to better up sale, communicate better, specify questions, and how to keep up with a high energy fast paced environment."
good,"Treinamento constante, capacidade de crescimento e forte laço entre seus funcionários."
good,"Working at Starbucks so far has been great, I get to connect with my customers and make them their favorite drinks! It may be a fast paced job, but the people are great and it really is a great working environment!"
good,"Flexible hours, on-the job training, and friendly environment. Part of training requires employees to taste drinks to determine the difference when a drink is prepared incorrectly in order to maintain customer satisfaction."
good,I work with the greatest team of all and enjoy the fact that we are constantly learning. The company treats its employees very well and management is always fair and just.
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo es atender aproximadamente a 100 clientes por dia en un turno de 8 hrs con 1 hra de descanso, he aprendido en mis casi 3 años en la empresa a mantener la calma ante cualquier situacion, y a agilizar mi mente para la solucion de problemas. El trato con mi gerente fue siempre profesional y agradable."
good,"Fast paced working environment with opportunities to grow with company.  Responsibilities include maintaining store front and following all store operations."
good,"Starbucks, is an amazing place to work you meet new people everyday and build connections with customers and staff as well as building yourself as a person."
good,it was a great place to work. I enjoyed working with the public and having a great product to promote.  The schedule was nice and somewhat flexible as a manager
good,"After working for Starbucks for 4 years, I can say that I was taken care of. Pay is mediocre, but the benefits are amazing. This is a good part time job. The culture is fun as well."
good,"It was a wonderful company to work with that allows connection with the community.  I enjoyed my experience there and miss the interactions with the customers."
good,Starbucks has to be one of my favorite jobs I've had while working in the fast food industry. Though Starbucks was my 1st ever fast food job it still to this day has to be the best experience and training wise job I've had in this type of industry. I had such a fun/ enjoyable time working there that aren't really words that I can use to explain it. I think the just friendly air and thought of them being open minded and all loving/ accepting is what made it the most enjoyable workplace for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the customers and how nice and understanding they were. We would also often have customers that would come in that would ask specifically for me to make there beverage/food. Which sometimes would make me feel happy: like I'm doing my job well or I'm the preferred or go to person to make their food/beverage
good,"Learned many things such as making beverage, handling customer complaint, coaching new barista by giving reinforcing feedback to barista who did a great job and redirecting feedback for the barista who had some opportunitues on their job."
good,"I love this company! Open to all people from all walks of life! Great benefits and stock options, as well as discount programs like vacation, free education and adoption assistance!"
good,Working in Starbucks is the best. Benefits and Salary were amazing and you will enjoy the environment. It was fun and one of the best learning experience.
good,"What I absolutely love about Starbucks as a whole is the ""at home feeling"" you get while in any location. The people that are hired by the company are truly hard and compassionate workers and the benefits that are offered (INCLUDING COMPLETE COLLEGE TUITION REINBURSMENT) are unreal. I absolutely love the company and everything about it."
good,"I've been with the company for 3 years and I have had a great experience thus far. The partners I have came across have been amazing. A lot of team effort! Starbucks gives you the opportunity to grow within the company and I think thats awesome! The best part of my job is knowing that I can make such a great impact in my customers days as well as my partners for creating a welcoming and "
good,I love working for Starbucks. I love the connections I get to make with my customers and building relationships with both my coworkers and customers. The pay isn't the best but the job is fun.
good,"I worked in the airport for Starbucks, i got to meet so many different people every day. The manager was kind, understand and wonderful. training was a breeze and the assistant manager always came in to check up and ask how everything is."
good,"Very fun place to work while in college, although I was already a student at CSULA the company does offer 100% tuition reimbursement for attending Arizona State University. Depending on the store you work at, there are sometimes wild guest but the usual customers are always such a delight."
good,I love the Starbucks company. A typical day at work is getting to know the customers and bonding with them over a cup of coffee. The culture has a positive vibe and positive energy. The most enjoyable day of the job is seeing the smiles on the customers face after they take a sip of there delightful drink.
good,"Gracias a este trabajo aprendi muchas cosas como trabajar en equipo, en una gran empresa."
good,"I not only enjoyed working with my peers on a day to day basis, I enjoyed assisting customers in a fun and efficient environment. I was also able to be extremely creative in this job."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The advancement within this company is nearly endless. It's easy to become close to coworkers, which makes working fun. The benefits are such a plus too!"
good,"With this job, you really get out of it what you put in. Depending on what location you are at, it can be very relenting. However, despite the non-stop work environment, you are able to have awesome relationships with your co-workers and customers. Put in the time and effort to get to know your regulars, they will make the job so worth it when you face ungrateful and demanding customers. The hours go fast and you'll find yourself hanging out after work and even when you aren't scheduled. The work environment is addicting and so much fun!"
good,I enjoy working at starbucks because you will never be bored. Thee are always many tasks you can do and many customers that you can help! I found the hardest part of this job is rush hour if you are working alone.
good,Starbucks is an amazing job. My manager is pretty awesome. He's friendly and actually care about his employees and things going on in our personal lives.The best part is brightening a customers day. Its been plenty of times people come in having a bad day.My bright smile and me offering a cup of fresh coffee or a pastry turns their whole mood upside down. The hardest part of the job would be leaving on time . Its so much to do and you're actually enjoying preparing and interacting with the customer sometimes i lose track of time.
good,"Hugely flexible schedule. "
good,"Honestly one of the best jobs I have ever had in my job career, everyone is very outgoing the job could be a bit hectic but overall it was all worth it!"
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company for part-time students. The company offers a full benefits package to part-time employees, free online education, stock, and much more! I am thankful that I work with an amazing staff and provide customer satisfaction."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks, usually starts slow depending on the day. I preferred Saturday's for the extremely fast paced environment. I learned so much from this job, different Coffees and how they all can seem similar until you pay close attention and notice the slight variations in flavor. Learned different brewing systems and how they can effect the flavor of your coffee as well. Management is always awesome. Every store I've visited or worked for, all management was simply amazing. Super helpful and kind. I don't have any cons about this job personally."
good,"Love working for Starbucks, even though you are making the same drinks over and over, you will still have fun doing it. Working at a drive thru store gives you the ability to be a great multitask-er. You will learn to think quick and efficiently, and your memory will improve from learning all the recipes, customers drinks, and extensive drink orders. Working as a team can be challenging but as long as there is communication things should flow effortlessly."
good,"Demanding but fun. Fast pass and lots of routines. High standards and great benefits! Sometimes customers can be very picky, but if you listen and make the drinks the way that they want them then everything will be fine!"
good,"Starbucks was one of my favorite places to work due to the friendly employees and management, the awesome benefits, the ability for advancement. I was able to be promoted from a Barista to a Trainer and then a Supervisor within a year and was working on becoming an Assitant Manager before moving to Florida. Starbucks has a great work atmosphere that is inviting and flexible. I would both open and close the store and even with my many duties such as stocking, inventory, cash management, and customer service, I never felt stressed or uncomfortable. The hardest part of the job was making sure my employees were well trained, and even then Starbucks puts its Baristas through days of training to ensure proper behavior and procedures."
good,"starbucks is a great place to work, it is one of the best coffee shop in the world, and there is no doubt they do have excellent coffees to offer. The hardest part of the job is you have to clean everything in the store. And the most enjoyable is you can able to try all their beverages, 3x per shift if youre a full time employee."
good,"This job was one of my favorites! I loved working with the public and making tasty drinks. Very busy and holidays were the best. Most all my co-workers also enjoyed the work place so it had a great balance of work and humor. Starbucks was always giving us the proper tools for any upcoming drink feature, making for a successful experience as a barista."
good,I learned my best skills here. I was able to learn how to make drinks but also build my communication skills with everyone. Very flexible and they work with you in all aspects of your life. Easy to make friends and meet regulars.
good,I received a lot of experience as a manager and as a team player. I have learned how to get along with every type of customer/client. I was able to connect and build relationships between regular customers.
good,"Starbucks is known for their company culture of making sure their employees, or ""Partners"" as they like to call us, are well taken care of.  Student assistance, medical and a free pound of coffee every week just to name a few.  I was fortunate enough to be a Partner, Supervisor and a Training Coach in my time at Starbucks, and would happily return if I can find a new fit at a new store!"
good,Starbucks is the perfect first job! The benefits are amazing. In order to receive full benefits you only need to work a minimum of 20 hours per week. The people make the job worth it!
good,Great company to work for as your first job. There are possibilities to grow if you seek them. Fast paced and very friendly atmosphere. You meet great people and might stay friends for ever.
good,Regular customers so it's easy to make drink ahead of time. It's lots of teamwork the hardest part is when someone allows their personal feelings interfere wit they way they work it  messes up the flow of the job
good,"Starbucks is not just some coffee shop where you work and that's it. The work at Starbucks is challenging and they have the highest standards for quality and for their hard working employees. Starbucks knows it can be challenging with changing drinks and standards to keep them the best but, our CEO never makes us feel small and unimportant. The company gives great perks, and will even provide free college tuition with no agreements to stay with them after. Overall, I have met the best people and learned the meaning of team work. If you want to learn what hard work and fun are put together, then join Starbucks and be a partner."
good,"Oldukça güzel ve samimi bir ortam , calisanlarin birbirine karşı seviyeli davranışları çok iyi"
good,"Fast paced during rush hour but fun when you have a good crew. "
good,"I spent my time at Starbucks creating positive customer relations as well as employee relations. I learned what it means to work together and perform as a team. Starbucks gave me a sense of belonging because everyone treats each other like family. I loved the atmosphere at Starbucks. The working environment gave me room to grow as a person and be myself. The management team works hard to provide high quality service, but in my opinion, they are overworked. Overworked shift leaders can cause anxiety and stress that could potentially be let out onto the other employees. This creates a stressful, unpleasing environment not only for employees, but customers as well. But overall, I loved my position at Starbucks and was very passionate about creating drinks to meet customer specifications."
good,Great environment to work in. Everyone is outgoing and there for each other. Managers and supervisors make it a point to know your strengths and weaknesses.
good,"As an opener at Starbucks my day is always busy. Although the hours can be rough sometimes, I have really enjoyed becoming a part of a well-working machine. I love forming lasting connections with customers and making their days a little bit better. Although I do not plan on staying at Starbucks forever, I know that I will always think of the company with fondness."
good,I loved the Starbucks company and what they stood for. I always felt like corporate actually cared about their employees in the stores. It was easy to be trained into my position and the ability to advance into a management position was always open and was welcomed.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. They take care of their partners very well. I have a sibling who still works for the company to this day. I just had my fill of retail management and decided to move on and try restaurant.
good,"I really enjoy my work at Starbucks. Management and other coworkers are friendly, and the pay and benefits are great. Free coffee and a meal with every shift, and tips are included as well."
good,"it is anice atmosphere, but quit challenging. Especially when you have no idea of coffee and your custermors are really demanding. But other than that its good"
good,Very fun job. The manager is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She worked with me to give me reasonable hours at my desired shifts. Customers are always fun to talk to although not always pleasant before their coffee.
good,I loved working at Starbucks great benefits and great coffee! environment is very relaxed and super flexible.  Easy job with decent hourly pay.  Would recommend
good,"Working here has been an incredible experience. I started at a store in one state and then moved across the country and at both stores, though the environments were totally different, I was openly welcomed and immediately felt comfortable. It really is like a fast family."
good,very diverse work place learned a lot about other cultures from the employees and the customers. We would celebrate all the holidays for all walks of life.
good,"Great place to work, great environment . Friendly people. I loved the smile I put on people faces when the came to starbucks. I loved making drinks ...."
good,"My shift started at 6:00 and my first customer was in front of me by 6:04. As the shift is in full swing, I enjoy making drinks and see my busy location fully staffed and customers are coming in and leaving at a steady pace. Everyone is happy and on their way to a great day with a cup of coffee. I enjoy the regular customers the most! I always tried to have their drinks ready by the time they would arrive at the pick-up counter."
good,"Excelente trabajo, siempre tendré a starbucks en mi corazón. Compañeros excelentes, buen ambiente de trabajo, horarios flexibles, es buen trabajo si estas estudiando una carrera. Y no por nada esta en ""Best place to work""."
good,"Starbucks employees are always looking to help their employees. They offer great benefits for part time workers. Recently, the company is providing their employees scholarships to Arizona State University up to a Bachelors degree. In the last six years with the company I have learned management skills and how to exceed customer expectations."
good,Working at the Starbucks inside the Target on the Main St. in Alhambra has been quite a fast-paced and enjoyable work experience. The management was always involved in our activities and giving us guidance. There is much multitasking involved in both preparing drinks and helping customers. The stress of working sometimes can be wearisome but the fellow baristas keep things up beat and fun.
good,"Working in an outside store is by far better than the regular, of course in the morning there is peak period which is it too bad, the environment in the outside store is completely different than the one in the airport. This job makes it easier to balance school and work."
good,"Starbucks es una excelente empresa para trabajar, muchas oportunidades de crecimiento, la empresa apoya mucho a las personas que estan estudiando, el ambiente es muy agradable, mucho compañerismo."
good,"The company itself is decent overall. What really makes or breaks the job is management. If you have a good manager it can make the job really great, if not, scheduling and the shifts themselves can be a nightmare."
good,A job that keeps positive people around you. Always motivates you to want more and make more and elevate yourself. Not only is the staff and crew good people to be around but also the customers. This franchise is a tight knit one so there are times where you will meet with the regional manager and others in the Starbucks family that will help you elevate yourself. You can create great relationships with anybody
good,great work place. if you work with a great team working at starbucks is every teens dream. just make sure you arrive early and prepare yourself for the madness .. it gets busy specially during the summer
good,"Starbucks policy of dignity and respect made for a great workplace with a positive and friendly vibe, always. Store location, in my opinion, makes a huge difference in the quality of work experience."
good,"Starbucks is about partners and customers. The right store and the right manager could provide that third home Starbucks represents. I was able to work with a few great managers that provided that family environment. A place I could have fun, develop, and have a sense of accomplishment."
good,"A typical day is not particularly challenging, but can be interesting and fun depending on the colleagues."
good,Starbucks is good platforms to learn international standards.good relationship with Starbucks coffee customers.it gives employee shelf respect eg; we called as partners.
good,"Bar far one of the best organizations I have ever worked for. The spirit of the company promotes hard work and the ability to move up within the company. Starbucks has great benefits and allows every employee the chance to part-take and receive the full benefits provided, whether a part timer, or a manager, and I think that this in itself shows that they are willing to take care of their folks and shows the value they show to each and everyone employed. They also show great support to its management staff"
good,It is a fast paced enviroment with lots of room to gorw. A great experience and welcoming enviroment.Plus free drinks while you are working which is fun!
good,"Working here can be a lot of fun, but it can also be stress full because of the amount of recipes to learn, and keeping drive through times and food waste to a minimum. i would recommend anyone to work here"
good,"I absolutely love the Starbucks environment, and everything that is Starbucks related. They treat their employees good and the management was very well and everyone had enough training to be well off on their own."
good,"I absolutely adored my store, my co-workers, and my superiors. I worked opening and closing shifts, so my schedule was flexible. I was given time off when I requested it. The pay is not much starting, but you receive raises, and tips. They offer benefits and plenty of career advancement opportunities. I never dreaded going to work because I loved it!"
good,great job to get through school and very flexible hours. They offer health insurance and help pay for school. very accepting environment and the employees are great and helpful
good,"I really, really liked working at Starbucks.  I liked the culture.  I liked the people.  I liked the frenzy.  The one downside was the work/life balance.  As a salaried manager who had to have a completely open availability, and with the store being open almost 20 hours a day, the variance in hours that I worked (opening, mid, closing) was so great that on my days off I only had energy to sleep."
good,"It's a great place to work. Especially if you're in school and needing to find a job to work around that schedule. Building relationships with customers and coworkers is why I've stayed for so long. Management can be good or bad depending on location, so choose wisely."
good,"Great place to work, works well with my busy schedule. Positive, energetic, co-workers are always a plus working with this company. Benefits are awesome."
good,"Serving as a barista for Starbucks was my favorite job by far. I looked forward to work everyday. Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. From the fresh ingredients all the way to the emphasis on superb customer service, this company truly thrives. A typical day at work consisted of completing a check list of ""opener"" duties, and serving a high volume of guests, while maintaining a welcoming, fun, and clean atmosphere, and a check list of ""closer"" duties. During my experience with Starbucks, I learned a large selection of drink recipes, not only customer service but customer care, time management, multitasking, following orderly lists, and maintaining back stock. The most difficult part of the job was keeping my stamina up during extremely busy shifts. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the opprotunity to learn such a unique skill, and the wonderful atmosphere of a coffee shop."
good,Starbucks has been amazing in the time I have spent there from the connection with customers to the benefits they provided.  Management has always been helpful an has given me  the tools I need to thrive within the company.
good,"Starbucks is like my second home, the staff's and manager's we have the same treatment, there is no superiority. During our audits we have team work and also during peak hours."
good,"Starbucks is much more employee focused than most companies these days. Although there largest employment need is baristas, which is definitely not a life sustaining job but for a college student, retiree, side gig, or starter, it is a level above the other comparable jobs and they have good advancement opportunities if you can put in your time as a barista with great management salaries and benefits."
good,Zeer betrokken werkgever. Denkt met je mee.Voldoende doorgroei mogelijkheden.
good,"Having regulars is probably the best part of working here. You get to meet and learn about people, a lot of them own their own businesses and it's just fascinating getting to know them."
good,"must be fast-paced"
good,"Generally, my shifts could start anywhere from 4 am on-wards, and would end anywhere up til midnight I have spent time developing my skills to move forward"
good,"I've been working for the company for two years. Only hard workers survive. Eventually, your baristas become your family. Some of the managers suck, but that's just part of the industry. Overall, its a great company. Just know that the job can be really hard, and you will be expected to sweat."
good,"-Friendly atmosphere"
good,Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for. They really listen to their customers and employees suggestions. They hours are flexible. Benefits available for part and full time employees plus weekly food and merchandise perks. Great place to learn to multitask and learn team work. Easy to move up within the company and they pay is worth it!
good,Starbucks was always a fun place to be at. The customers and team members I worked with were always upbeat and happy to be there. This was by far my favorite place of employment.
good,Working at Starbucks was so fast paced with making all sorts of fun drinks for customers. From the time I punched in to the time I clocked out I had fun.
good,It is very fast paced and always something to do. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and multitask. The hardest part was dealing with unpleasant customers. The best part was interacting with pleasant people and coworkers.
good,It is a good place to work because you can learn and get important experiences and the best part it is that you have the opportunity to grow up in the company if you do your best every day.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. It has flexible hours and the management makes sure you are welcomed. One thing that you will learn from working at Starbucks is that you will learn how to work with different customer attitudes as well as your team members. Also, you will learn how to make drinks with your own spin. Making drinks and seeing your customers face after they drink it is priceless. Great benefits and great environment."
good,"This is such a wonderful company to work for.  Everyone is willing to help you out, the management is excellent, and the benefits are even better. The high paced environment can get stressful, but all partners on the floor work as a team."
good,"Los días de trabajo son rotativos y se empieza de 6 am hasta las 12 o 1 am. Se reparten las labores entre los compañeros, normalmente son dos quienes atienden en barra, y un supervisor que se encuentra en la oficina. Los partners son muy amigables, hay mucho compañerismo. La parte más dificil del trabajo fue aprenderse las recetas tal cual estaba indicado, y lo que más me gustó fue la conexión que se formaba entre barista y cliente."
good,"Working at Starbucks has  helped me grow in many areas in my life both professionally and personally. A typical day at a high volume store can be really challenging but fun at the same time. You may walk into work with a plan in mind and end up doing something completely different. Its rewarding being able to think fast and make hard decisions on the spot. Thankfully I come from a store with an amazing team who treat each other more like family than coworkers and that makes all the difference in the workplace culture. The hardest part of my job is not feeling fulfilled after a long day, and not making a difference in my coworkers success. The enjoyable part of my job is driving change and working as a team to reach our goal."
good,Every morning and lunch shift was always extremely busy. Everyone was running around with things to grab and drinks to make in this odd hassled dance. It was fun to get to know the regular customers and bond with fellow baristas
good,"Starbucks has been a very influential job in my life. I worked here 5 days a week, for 3.5 years during college. I have not only learned customer service, but I have grown to respect my job, and take it very seriously. I love interacting with people daily, and growing almost a personal bond with customers. I have seen worked under multiple managers, and learned to adapt to each ones needs. It may be far from the services that I want to provide in my career, but my job as a barista has shaped the work ethic I want to take with me into my future."
good,"This company definitely offers room to grow and move up. Hectic day-to-day at times, but overall a great company with great benefits."
good,Starbucks is a very awesome job However you may deal with many tourists that may have a language barrier that is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the customers appreciate you most times. The work culture is really nice.
good,"-Great co-workers"
good,"Empresa muito boa. Ótima Estrutura. "
good,"As a barista, it was a wonderful experience! It was face paced and definitely fun! I was able to make amazing business connections that lead me to many job/intern abilities, as well as create friendships to last.  The taught customer service techniques are outstanding compared to many companies I have encountered. However, the pay wasn't fulfilling to my needs."
good,"El ambiente es muy tranquilo, aunque aveces tiene un poco de adrenalina cuando se llena la tienda y las bebidas tienen que salir ya!, es genial la presión que ay en ese momento y aun asi el ambiente es genial."
good,Working for Starbucks challenged me in ways I had never been challenged. I was able to develop others constantly in my role and that brings me much joy!
good,"Crazy busy days always just because of location!"
good,"Valoras al cliente,  a tus compañeros y logras trabajo en equipo."
good,"- A typical day working at a Starbucks with a drive-thru is very exciting and busy. I was always moving around and helping customers. "
good,"I would only recommend this job for people who love coffee and like customer service.  There is a lot to the job as a barista, BUT managers move you forward and help you as well throughout your training process. It's truly a great company to work for!

Otherwise, we are in a bit of a rush to get our customers their drinks quickly and correctly."

good,"A typical day at Starbucks is challenging yet rewarding. It's hard work, but my customers and co-workers make it all worth it. I have learned a lot from working with this company, one being how to take control of a situation. Every day at Starbucks is unpredictable and sometimes things do not go as planned. Dissatisfied customers, sick baristas, and broken espresso machines can easily turn a normal day into a disaster. Taking control of a difficult situation while staying calm and keeping my team positive is where I thrive, and I owe it all to the experience Starbucks has given me. The hardest part of this job is thinking and acting quickly, while the most enjoyable part is building friendships with customers and co-workers."

Mornings can be incredibly busy with all of customers getting drinks and food before work, but there is always a chance for you to make a personal connection with customers if you try. Management varies from store to store. Personally I have only had positive experiences with my store manager, district manager, and area managers with all of them helping me grow as a person and Starbucks partner on my road to becoming a supervisor."

good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for.  The pay is above minimum wage and the tips are decent.  The days themselves get tedious, but the interactions between fellow partners and regulars that come in really make this job special.  Rushes can be frustrating and overwhelming, but when you are able to have a decent conversation with a customer, it makes it feel worth it.  401k benefits are good, as is the healthcare."

Learned a lot of great interpersonal skills through building meaningful relationships with customers. Amazing managers. Everyone had a strong work ethic and worked well as a team.

Great job to practice time management and speaking skills. the hardest part was being on my feet for 5 hours. Management is great to talk to and understandable.
good,"Always loved my years working with Starbucks! Such great benefits and flexible schedules! It was a great work environment!"
good,The work is fast paced and can be fun. The customers can be very sweet and take the time to get to know you. The management is very good and all of the managers are there to help their employees. My co-workers were all a lot of fun to hang out with and during rushes were very fun to freak out with. The hardest part of the job is the length of the shifts. I was put down for 9.5 hour long shifts some days. I truly enjoyed how everybody that worked there seemed to stick together and the regular customers were always very sweet.
good,ever since i started working it is an amazing place. everything was really good. the customers are rude sometimes but that wasnt to bad. the most enjoyable part was making the drinks for the customers and them being happy.
good,"Working at Starbuck is the best experience ever, because we as partners get treated in a professional way, and get great benefits. Everyday just getting to make beverages for customers gets me through the day specially, when they are customers who appreciate, and try to engage in the conversation we try to have with them. we all get along with each other. the hardest part about this job is when it gets supper busy. Messing up is not an option, and being able to multitask comes in handy."
good,"Ensuring proper set up at each station. Serving customers in a friendly, fast and efficient way. Constantly learning patients and to not get caught up on the little things. Management is supportive and there for the employees. Co-workers are great, we all work well together and try to fun at work while still caring for our customers. Hardest part of my job is not having the proper tools to complete my job and being understaffed during high peak times. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships I've built with co-workers and customers."
good,"Brilliant training and development of every single staff, like they really cared about quality obviously but most importantly to make sure that the staff was confident enough to be behind the bar"

good,"Aprendi muy rapido asi como aprendo en todos los trabajos "
good,A typical day at Starbucks is spent with great employees who have become my very good friends. The customers come in with smiles and I enjoy seeing our regulars. Honestly the most difficult part of the job is staying calm during the storm. My location can get extremely busy and we have to focus as a team to keep the store running smoothly. The best part of the job is those who I work with. I am always greeted when I come into work and it's never a dull day with my team.
good,"I love working in a fast pace environment and constantly being on my feet, always having a task that needs to be done helps me enjoy the work day. I learned how to be patient and calm during high stress times and how to handle customer complaints. I do not have a complaint about management. Everyone is very professional and helpful when needed. My co-workers are some of the most hardworking people I know. Everyone gets along and strives to make the best time for our customers and our store. The hardest part of my job would be the repetitiveness of it all. I like being challenged and doing something new everyday. I like learning how to do new things. The most enjoyable part of my job is the connections I make not only in the community but around the new friends I have made in the store. I love seeing customers smile or enjoy the drink they got.

I had two managers one in Hawaii and one in California, both were very accommodating and helpful. Made friendships to last a life time with my co-workers.

good,"The partners, the job, the benefits, the customers and of course the coffee are the amazing reason why I love to work in Starbucks! Its feels like more than a job but a home for everyone.

While I have some time on my hands I decided to work as a Barista.  The manager is wonderful and my co-workers are fun and very hard working.   It's fast paced and exhausting to be on your feet all day, but it's still alot of fun."

good,"Starbucks allows you to not only provide a customer coffee buying experience unlike any other, but also a community of individuals who remain as coworkers and friends."
good,"Coming into Starbucks I wasn't sure what to expect. When I initially joined the team I was fearful of the cliché comments about 'horrible' customers and demanding managers being correct but honestly, this job was incredible. Not only was their training extensive and updated constantly, the benefits far surpassed any workplace I'd had or even heard about. I was incredibly lucky when I came to my coworkers, customers and manager, all of my best friends are people whom I'd met at Starbucks and I still keep in contact with my manager and a few customers. I learned so much about customer service while working there, and even more so that I flourish in quick-paced environments. If it weren't for moving schools I would have continued there without a doubt."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Connecting with your partners and the community builds you as a worker and as a person. Management is always on point and takes great care or their employees. Training is provided, which helps with the volume of individual stores. Working for Starbucks is benifical and fun!"

I wake up at 3am because I'm scheduled at 4:15 to open the store at 5am. so right before we open I set up the pastry case, RTD&E, and date the sandwiches after that we open the store and take care of the customers. on our slow time we clean and have specific cleaning routines at specific times to make it easier for the people coming in and taking over our shift.

What I learned while working here would that working in a fast-paced environment and getting the customers drink to them in a good time and making sure its prepared to their standards is the number on way to stay on top on your work. The management was decent was the manager was very helpful with resupply cups and or syrup and also great help if you may have forgot an ingredient. The co-workers all work together to help each other out not one person is standing around while another person on the hot-bar needs help we all help each other when we see someone falling behind due to an overload of drinks. The hardest part of this job is the very busy and you put remain on top of your orders.

You always have the same connection with your customers, which at Starbucks is above and beyond satisfaction. I've learned how to manage my time effectively and have gained the extensive customer service experience needed to take me to the next level. Management and partners are always great to be around. Nothing is ever hard working for the company; aside from my specific location. In the heart of Toronto, we have a lot of homeless and underprivileged adults that come in and some times cause a disruption but sometimes just need a place to sit or have a glass of iced water. I've learned how to work in those tough situations and have learned how to keep our store and employees safe. I brag to my friends on how great of a company it is to work for. The most enjoyable part for me is connecting with my customers while attempting my latte art! That's all from me!"

good,"At Starbucks I have learned a lot about how to delegate, and manage employees.The greatest challenge I have dealt with is knowing/ understanding where employees have there strengths and weaknesses and understanding how to communicate with each partner accordingly. My favorite part about being a Supervisor is having the responsibilities of making sure specific tasks are completed on time. Delegating breaks at appropriate times, and managing the floor."

good,"A typical day at Starbucks being a supervisor is counting the safe, assigning people to their tills, deploying people to their positions and managing the work day. I have learned how to work with hard employees and being able to understand them and put them in places where they feel comfortable and can do their best. Customer service is one of the hardest aspects of Starbucks because we put our customers before anything we do. I have learned how to deal with them, to make their situation right and make them happy. There is no better feeling than making a customers day.

It is one of the few companies that invest in their workers. A typical day includes me supervising my employees and making sure everything runs smoothly and take care of any minor situation that may take place. I would say some days are difficult but it is expected. I take the bad and turn it into something good. In bad situations you just have to remain positive.
good,"Starbucks is made up of individuals who are unique, hard-working, and independent thinkers. There is a structure routine, that supports the high standard that Starbucks has.

good,"my Job at Starbucks was amazing it was a great learning experience and I enjoyed working there. Everything from the customers to my loyal co-workers was great. I had a terrific time at Starbucks in Page, AZ."
good,Fast paced but very fun environment to work in especially when surrounded by other hard working individuals. Provides a lot of nice benefits and usually always understanding of emergencies and day-to-day needs especially as a college student.
good,loved working here. fast paced and fun. great customers that came in and the people that i worked with were even better. sometimes the hours were crazy but it was worth it. never really had a position that i worked in at this store and did not like.
good,It was very hands on and on the go. I would always have something to do. I didn't like the management. My coworker were  helpful and we always worker as a team. the most enjoyable time is learning how to make the new drinks
good,"My store usually gets regulars, so remembering their names and drinks goes a long way for them, They feel  like we care more."
good,"Fun Atmosphere, Busy Work, Great Customer Base, Great Bar tending Skills. Managers are knowledgeable and direct. Co Workers are responsible and skilled."
good,"Enjoyed working for Starbucks. Co workers were a fun group of people who looked out for each other, were very safety minded. I would work for this company without question. Great place to work and grow."
good,Best starter job ever. Management was amazing as well as staff. the company really takes care of there employees. great customer service as well as customers.
good,"Los días en Starbucks son amenos, dinamicos pero sobre todo motivantes, el compartir el espacio con los compañeros de trabajo hace que el dia sea mas agradable. Aprendi a diferencias amistad de trabajo, a buscar alternativas para el logro de objetivos, sin descuidar la parte humana y el ambiente laboral. En custion de direccion organizacional puedo hablar solo elogios, el logro de establecer buena relacion empleado - empresa es algo en lo que Starbucks hace incapie, y es de admirar. Los compañeros de trabajo son los mejores que he tenido, son entregados a lo que hacen, apacionados en cada momento pero sobre todo cumplidores, rara vez me quede con mal sabor de boca. No hay parte dificil en el trabajo, si eres justo, y sabes administrar las cosas, las cosas se dan solas, sean para bien o para mal, pero siempre se obtiene el resultado justo. De starbucks me gusto la interaccion con las personas, tanto con colegas como clientes."
good,It had a friendly and welcoming environment. The management wasn't as flexible as it could of been. I learned a lot from my coworkers because it was a place of teamwork and we had a common goal to achieve.
good,"llegar organizar tu día con tiempo, llenar de energía al equipo, ver por sus necesidades, tener tiempo de descanso con cafe gratis, de los mejores equipos que eh trabajado, conocer todo tipo de gente, lo difícil podría ser el cliente cerrado, y lo que mas me gusto de este empleo es la cultura al empleado que tienen"
good,"Loved working here felt that the management was just a little too easy going with employees who didn't follow the rules and were always late. That was the absolute only negative. Loved hours, pay, benefits and environment one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I'm very policy and rule orientated and hate when others don't follow policy or recipes in this case."
good,Excellent deployment skills are required as a Starbucks Shift  supervisor to make the day  run by smoothly. A typical day would consist of instructing your team of what position they would be working that day in order to make the business run accurately. Must have superb time management skills and customer service experience.
good,I loved working for starbucks! it was such a positive atmosphere and I loved being that person to make someone's day start off just right with a cup of coffee
good,"Working at Starbucks has been one of the best experiences of my life. I started there with zero dollars to my name, coming out of a 3 year job that I couldn't handle because of a change in management. I was nervous because I was leaving all my colleagues from the previous place. "
good,"Fun place with supportive manager. Very interesting crew..pretty demanding. Great benefits but not great pay. Overall great starting out job, not a permanent job."
good,"This company is a true model of what a great company looks like.  They have mastered the balance of taking excellent care of their employees and delivering great service to their customers.  They do their best to honor work, life balance, they provide the best benefit package anywhere.  The management is encouraged to make the job experience the best it can be for each partner.  The effect is happy partners that deliver a great experience for the customer."
good,"When I first started at Starbucks I was a Barista and I flew through my training checklist, and I was able to learn everything very fast. Six months later I was in training to become a Shift Supervisor. I also helped with the merchandise displays, organizing the merchandise and the storage area. Because of my shyness, my District Manager had me teach some of the classes for new employees. A little after that I was a candidate to become a Store  Assistant Manager. I was teamed up with my mentor and finished my training. Then I went through the hiring process and I did very well. After becoming an Assistant Manager I helped open a few new stores, as well as helped out other stores to organize their display area. i worked as an Assistant manager for a while and then i received my own store. "
good,Starbucks Coffee Co. was one of the most amazing experiences of my life! In just the general way they present the culture of coffee is a lesson of passion that is incomparable to any other. There is nothing like a fresh Starbuckian partner working the beans like they loved each and every drink coming out of the cups. But there's also nothing like a lifer either. The classic senior partner with so much wisdom of coffee it comes second nature to them and they bleed coffee. Those are the ones that become life long friends. Starbucks thank you.
good,Personally aligned to the company's mission and values. Strong focus on succession planning and moving partners through the organization. Work/life balance.
good,"I am busy at work, as there is no time for boredom and I learned from my colleagues that collaboration is the key to success.  My manger was competent and compassionate.  The hardest part of the job is working with the customers, where one is expected to be polite and patient with them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is pleasing and effectively serving the customers."
good,"All the years I worked for this awesome company were a joy and pleasure. Definitely, one of the number one company's to work for. :)"
good,Starbucks was a great company that takes care of its employees. I enjoyed my time there and wish the best upon any who decide to work there.
good,Star Bucks is really a learning environment for a new worker. At work I had difficulty to make cappuccino and latte but now I can guarantee that I will make best cappuccino and latte. I had fun when I worked for Star Bucks. There management and other co-workers are really helpful.
good,great place to work at! very enjoyable and always making customers happy. typical day is making drink threw out my shift and keeping the store maintained.
good,"Management was wonderful , fun place to work, I was unable to lift heavy objects and my bosss required a note from my dr and he would not write one.. left on good terms"
good,Overall a fun culture and if you love coffee and or tea. Then this is a good place to apply. Management is nice. Employees are friendly and really like to work together to get the job done leaving no one behind making sure each person is on the same page when it comes to all aspects of the job.
good,"The Starbucks i work at is the second busiest in northern califonia, so to say the least, we are always busy.  i learned how to work hard and also at an extremely fast paste. My coworkers are awesome, even the ones that transfer into our store, so it must be just a cooperate thing that stabucks hires the best people ever.  The hardest part of the job is probably how fast paste everything was but that doesn't make it not fun.  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely connecting with the customers, and seeing the same people everyday.  A lot of ""regulars"" come in and call us either their friend or family, and that means so much to me."
good,At this job its very fast paced. My time with the company has been great. I've learned how to become a great shift supervisor in my field of work. I provide great customer service skills and use effective coaching and problem solving. There hardest part of the job is learning all the different routines correctly.
good,I really enjoyed working there - people are great and love the free coffee :) Management is generally good and the company is very innovative.
good,"A world of possibilities for those who wants to work, and have care for the job she/he is doing."
good,It's a great start if you are new to the manufacturing world. Hopefully I can go partner soon... But even if I don't I love working here.. Everyone get treated the same partners and cw.... We all get the same amount of breaks and time allotted!! Its equal all the way around... 360
good,A typical day would be constantly greeting and serving customers with a positive and friendly attitude. we keep a clean and organized work area no matter how much business we can get at one time. The management is friendly and makes a flexible schedule. The most enjoyable part of this job is the fun and friendly environment and connecting with customers.
good,"Meet new people everyday, get to actually make new friends/customers. The regulars become your friends and it feels great to make someones morning everyday"
good,"Working here was fun, but can be tiring at times. The fast pace can tire you our before your first break. "
good,"Very good training staff, knowledgeable staff, very helpful, friendly co-workers and management. Very clean and strict guidelines."
good,"Starbucks was an amazing job, and provided many benefits. The people I worked with were amazing and the variety of beverages were delicious and interesting."
good,"Great way to build customer service skills. Great diverse staff and even better benefits. Being a shift here has helped me grow tremendously. Managers are really understanding and fun to be around , really helpful with development"
good,Amazing place to work. Staff are so friendly and understanding. Management is very professional but also fun. The best job I have worked for.
good,Loved this job. Changed my life in many ways. It was challenging at times but I loved it. No food to deal with really. Wish I could have stayed longer but had to move to another state with no Starbucks close by. Recommend over anything else.
good,"Show up to work 15 minutes prior to a shift starting to get our free employee drink of choice. Clock in and start to work right away, it was always fast paced first thing in the morning. Go straight to my position, usually in drive-thru and handle drink orders, food orders and cash transactions. Learned how to multitask in drive-thru, being able to accomplish 4-5 different things at once. Co-workers are the best, they are such great support and understanding of one everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Management is great, they work well with students scheduling. With an open door policy, always felt comfortable. I can honestly say, there was nothing I can say about Starbucks that was hard, I know the job inside and out. The customers are the greatest part of the job, I was always commended from customers on how great their drinks were and how polite I was. That was gratifying."
good,"A typical day at work for Starbucks was mainly fast and slow past of customers coming in. It was a great experience working under the company, benefits were great, tips were high, and the customers were amazing. It was like a ""home"" type of feelings, a third place to be outside of work and home. I learned a lot during the time I was there, I would do it over again if I could. The management was amazing, my boss understood everything and worked around how I was doing. My co-workers were very friendly, I never had any problem with any of them. The hardest part of the job, I would say, is the weekend work and the early morning shifts. Since I live far away from family, I wasn't able to travel to see them at all. Other than the time, the experience was amazing. I would do it over again if I could."
good,"I learned how to communicate and handle customers that may have been upset or unsatisfied with their beverage. Our manager is very understanding, and friendly. She listens to your ideas in a sincere manner. She also works with your schedule, and gives you the hours that you need or prefer. My coworkers are very friendly, helpful, and a blast to work with. They are accepting of any race, gender, orientation, as well as new comers."
good,"We open at 5, so being a shift supervisor I open with another person. We prepare coffee, teas and espresso bars. I count money, do a quick inventory of milk, check fridge temperatures. About 6:30 we start to enter our peak, which is considered our busiest time. I manage all breaks and lunches while maintaing the stores cleanliness and the apprearance of baristas making sure they are following store procedures. Around 10a.m I usually try and do the deposit from the previous day depending on business. I come back down pull sandwiches, making sure daily tasks are getting complete, Daily tasks consist of a bunch of cleaning tasks. I continue with sandwiches and pastry inventory along with providing customer service. Around 1p.m I count the safe and turn things over with the next supervisor."
good,"A typical day included taking coffee orders, making said orders on a coffee machine, and cleaning the store. I learned how to make 100+ drinks and to listen better when people were ordering. My manager was very encouraging and wanted the best for all of their employees. I had 19 co-workers or so, and I was getting along with every single one. They were all friendly and understanding. The hardest part of the job was remembering what went into each drink. With over 100 drinks to memorize, it took time and dedication. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was handing the drink over and the customer smiled after tasting it or said ""Wow this is great!""."
good,"In Starbucks i`ve worked as Barista but i was contrated to work as Shift Manager , there i have oportunitie to improve my english, to guide the staff to do clean tasks,  do some clean task by my self, get chance to learn some business management and work with cash control, etc."
good,"Great place to work. Most people seemed to enjoy their jobs. Things move by consensus, so being a people person is a prerequisite."
good,"I LOVE working here. It is a great environment and I love being a part of this company.  The benefits are great, but the overall feel of going to work makes it fun to come to work."
good,"Very productive and exciting place of employment, constant face to face human interaction with customers and coworkers. Feeling of belonging is clearly present no matter which store you work at, from the three locations I've worked at over the past year, all have welcomed me with open arms. Hardest part of the job is the constant rush feeling you have, being able to execute your work in the quickest and most efficient way possible while also providing outstanding customer service is very demanding but the end result is also the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"I liked working at Starbucks. I am a people person and i am honored to be part of their team. Starbucks is a culture. I have never seen a company that has lived up to their standards anywhere in the world. Wherever you go, Starbucks signature customer service is always excellent."
good,"From a loyal customer to running a store - I loved being part of the Starbucks story."
good,The entire staff is the best. Super flexible with your schedule and gives you awesome benefits. The hardest part of the job would be the pace in the small space. Best part would be the job itself.
good,management are very helpful event the staff. we create a healthy and balance environment workplace.  we ensure that we serve with world class service and communicate with customer
good,"Best job I've had in awhile, great schedules w/ excellent student hours if you are in school. Great company to start gaining experience with."
good,"A typical day involves working with a team who works together and offers support as often as they can.  There is a sense of belonging to a company that ensures that you are incorporated in the brand and what it represents.  While working for a company who truly takes care of their employees, you feel motivated to do whatever you can to make the company succeed.  There is never a dull moment.  New products are constantly being introduced."
good,"Everyone helps each other out and you depending on your store, you become close with your coworkers fast. Great place to work"
good,"Starbucks is probably the best job I have had in the five and a half years I've worked. The company itself truly cares for its employees. And the people I have met are outstanding; both customers and co-workers. I greet everyone with a smile and an openness for questions. I've learned a lot about customer service and of course coffee! They like to make management an opportunity for everyone; everyone that is willing to put in the work that is. The hardest part is not having holidays off. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is the people, I love my customers and I love my co-workers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. The benefits are great. You get full health, as well as free coffee and pastries. Once a week, you get a pound of whole beans for free. It's fast-paced and requires a lot of memorization and multi-tasking. I loved knowing the regulars."
good,"Starbucks uses a complex list of systems in order to maintain and deliver superior customer service and it has been my experience as a supervisor that customer service is the most important part of any business, in turn I learned to share that with my team. Inventory management is also an intricate part of the job and so I practice it daily. The hardest part of the job has been communicating a vision with the team, however the importance of doing so is monumental to the success of the team. It all becomes worth it when stitching all the systems together seamlessly leads to the customers feeling sincerely well served and they bring others to the business because of their positive experience."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks because we were right next to a school. A lot of my customers were people my age and so many of them were regulars and we became friends outside of work. I became a lot more comfortable talking to people I don't know, and learned a lot more tricks to give good customer service and work quickly. "
good,"This is a great place to work if you are looking for part time employment with great benefits. It is a fun, friendly environment."
good,Overall looking back Starbucks Coffee was a great first job to do and it helped me professionally with the mannerisms I have towards customer service and now currently in my patient care career. I went in and did my job and when it was time to clock out it was easy to separate my life from work. The job is easy to do and demanding of course due to its popularity but with all the good and bad it was a good experience especially for an retail experience. Employees were people who came from different of walks of life with different cultures and backgrounds which always made it interesting who you were working with and what story they had to tell. Most connections I made when I worked there still carry on to this day. Some of us still work at Starbuck and some of us have moved on but I never expected the type of unity I would experience working there from both loyal costumers I met at the time and work buddies I developed working there.
good,"My typical day at work includes the most important aspect, making a connection with customers and providing a welcoming environment and a pleasant experience. By making that human connection it establishes trust and fun."
good,"Sólo puedo decir que,  Starbucks me abrió las puertas para empezar mi experiencia laboral en un gran empresa y sobre todo, con una gran familia. "
good,i have my own food business that i used to do when i am not on work. that's my side line during my free time my own restaurant.
good,"Starbucks is a great job with many benefits I have been there for over a year! I love my team! I am only considering a second job and potentially leaving is because I need to start saving more money for the next chapter of my life. If you can work under pressure in a fast pace environment then you will love the job, You get to know in love many regular costumers! My costumers make my day everyday And I love that I am able to make there day with their sup of coffee! :) Starbucks is over all a great part time job!"
good,"Starbucks is the best company to work for! They offer great starting pay, and plenty of opportunity for growth!. An excellent company to work for."
good,A typical day at work consists of high volume of drinks and task to handle but with a good environment and lots of teamwork. Great management that understands there is life outside of work and just overall positive learning experience.
good,"Very Very busy, high volume store"
good,I loved working for banana republic its like the upscale old navy so it was fun learning about all the different jeans and all the cute names for the shoes ;)
good,"I loved this job because I got to serve people, and got to know people on more on a personal level because I saw them about 2 times a day. And I enjoy putting a smile on peoples faces, and making their day better."
good,"depending on the day, my store can be really busy, or super slow. as much as i love how fast the day goes by when its busy, its a nice break when we have those slow days. my co-workers and i work so well together, maybe because we have been together for a year, but we have our system down. The days run so smooth. We rotate with keeping the store clean, trash, and cleaning. Trying to communicate with customers that have no idea what are saying may be the hardest part, it definitely has become a lot easier learning my own way of hand gestures. we dance a little to the music when no ones in the store, to stay ourselves, and keep a smile on our faces."
good,Culturing relationships through coffee. Being highly caffeinated.
good,Cares about your well-being on and off the clock. whether you are a slow or fast learner partners are willing to help you better fit in to the day to day task
good,"Starbucks was by far my favorite employer! I thoroughly enjoyed working there, and to this day still anticipate opening my own cafe, with using a portion of their company philosophies and template."
good,"A typical day would start at 4:45 am and go to 3 pm. Opened the store got it ready for the day. Assigning tasks and dealing with cadh management and deposits. Checked email for any updates for store and company. checked in the orders, received them and did daily inventory. Placed needed orders for the day. Worked the floor and handled any customer service issues. "
good,Troubleshoot computer and repair the issues at hand and possible future problems.
good,"Starbucks takes care of its employees. Benefits are easily accessible, and the culture of work is fun yet professional."
good,I loved working for this company. I have no negatives to say about it. The pay was good and they worked around my school schedule while employed. I only left the company for a financially better situation. I thoroughly enjoyed the customer service aspect and advanced quickly in the company (from barista to supervisor in 2 years).
good,Different hours to work so easy to balance work and personal life.  I learned how to work a faster pace.  Management is really hands on with the staff.
good,really fun place to work. friendly staff and customers and a good chance of progressing
good,"Training when you first start, which is very important. Manager, Isaac Ever, was phenomenal to work with and always cared about all of his employees and customers. The job comes with ease after training, you pretty much learn as you go and pretty soon, you can rank up to ""Coffee Master"" if you want to, the black belt equivalent. Great benefits, 401k, free pound of coffee every week as a partner markout. 30% discount on everything, not just beverages or food."
good,There are a lot of things to accomplish during your workday but it's very easy work. There is a lot of cleaning involved but it's very fair workloads dispersed among the other partners as well. The customers and other employees are very friendly. Slightly strict dress code. No visible tattoos and no facial piercings.
good,"I've had a great experience with Starbucks. They care about their employees, give great benefits, they make sure they help cover shifts if something comes up short notice. Starbucks is family oriented in everyway. "
good,"Starbucks has an ever changing day to day routine. Technically the job never changes, but the people you encounter every day are never the same. At Starbucks, you learn plenty about integrity, and self respect. Management doesn't take well to their employees being treated badly by customers, if the circumstance is the customers fault. Also, your co-workers are always around to help you if there is an issue that cannot be resolved solely by you. The hardest part of being a Batista at Starbucks is getting ready for the night the end and closing schedule. It takes time and patience to work around customers and doing your duties. Showing up the next day, knowing at the end of the shift the day would be smooth was always the highlight. Returning to work was always easy."
good,"A normal day at Starbucks is waking up fairly early and heading into work. I will make sure everything is set up for the morning rush when people come in to get their morning coffee. My managers will then assign everyone to a certain location in the store to make sure it will preform at its optimal level. I really like everyone I work with and we all seem to get along. "
good,"I always love being able to walk in and ready to work. To help customers is my biggest accomplishment because a lot of people don't have that customer service vibe. I love helping people, making drinks and making them happy."
good,"I love working for Starbucks. It is the best for those currently going to school, or mothers who want to work while their kids are in school. Extremely flexible hours."
good,"A typical day at work included opening duties such as cleaning, stocking, and dating the pastry case. I would also brew teas and coffees fresh. I hand crafted espresso and frappuccino beverages, interacted with customers and coworkers, and handled transactions. It was a fun environment and I learned a great deal about coffee culture and different roasts and recipes. I also learned a lot about customer wants/needs/expectations with food and beverage quality. My coworkers were sweet, friendly, and professional. The hardest part about the job was waking up at 3:30am to open the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer feedback comments on our surveys because they helped us improve our store and feel like we were really helping someone's day go smoothly."
good,"Starbucks is an extremely fast paced environment. A usual day consists of cleaning, brewing coffee, making hand crafted drinks just the way they are ordered, and making a connection with customers. The connection made with customers is my favorite part of working for Starbucks. Management is good and very strict. There are many policies in place to make working and coming to Starbucks a good experience. The most difficult part of this job would have to be making sure everyone does what they need to do in order to keep the store running to its potential. If one person is out of place, it can make the rest of the work day run a little less smoothly."
good,"I have learned amazing time management being a barista.  You are required to do multiple things at once, for instance steam milk, pull shots of espresso while grabbing pastries and keeping up a conversation with costumers at the same time! I love the rush. My management has always been there to help me with any bump in the road I have experienced. I enjoy my co-workers, I love all of the different personalities collaborating to make a product that people enjoy.  The hardest part of my job are days when we don't have enough staff and our costumers suffer.  I try my hardest so that they may not notice a difference in service from our situation.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when my customers get so excited when I hand them a drink."
good,"Contributed in accurate preparation and analysis of US and Canadian licensed stores financial statements."
good,"Management will constantly support you best as they can. I learned how to work with customers. The hardest part of the job would be that it is very fast paced inside the university but semi-slow paced in the 2nd location by residence. Co-workers are wonderful to work with.  They are friendly and you will immediately warm up to them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the team, they will eventually and very quickly become your 2nd family."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, they have taken care of me as employee. They are very open to working with your life outside of the company. They encourage promotion with in the company. They think and treat there employees very highly. It has become like a family because the co-workers care a lot about others because the company sets that as a standard. "
good,"Through my time at Starbucks, I have learned that customer service is always the top priority at any organization. A typical day usually consists of making drinks, selling whole-bean coffee and other Starbucks merchandise, completing daily cleaning tasks, handling money at a cash register, and handling customer service politely and promptly. The management staff and my coworkers are the best I could ask for. We have all become a family over time, and we are always willing to help each other out in anything we can. My manager works very well with me when it comes to availability and scheduling. The hardest part of my job is the space behind the bar. At times, it does get crowded, and problems with quick service could arise. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate with so many wonderful people."
good,I love starbucks as a company and enjoyed the interaction with customers and fellow employees
good,"Flexible Hours for college students."
good,"I truly couldn't have asked for a better starter job, going into my adult life (18).  Truly with all the benefits and flexible scheduling, I was crazy to leave. It was a very friend work environment, my managers were very helpful, the co-workers were a blast and still some of my friends to this day."
good,"Varied form day to day, provided customers with service in food, store products and beverages. I enjoyed this job a lot ,meeting different people from various backgrounds, working as a team was one of the things i enjoyed the most because we worked well together."
good,Meet friends and new people.  It was a great place to work and a great company to work for
good,Awesome company with great advancement opportunities!!!
good,"-I love this company and management. "
good,Imagine a place were you get to talk to people all the time about cool stuff. Starbucks is a place were work and socializing converge to form a home away from home environment. Sure its fast paced but with everyone working together it is magic.
good,"The co-workers are fun and enjoyable, a very energetic and dynamic working enviroment. The best part about this job was the interaction we had with all the customers, and learning how to make the drinks."
good,I love working with people all the time! Ive came in as barista and then moved up to barista trainer and then now working on becoming a supervisor.
good,Through out my career with Starbucks I have enjoyed making day to day relationships with members of my community. My job is so much more than just making a cup of coffee.
good,"Great environment to work in. Typical day would be just as imagined. Making coffee, cleaning, ensuring customers are completely satisfied."
good,es una excelente para trabajar con ambiente de trabajo agradable además de ser muy buena escuela y tienes muchas posibilidades de hacer carrera dentro de la empresa.
good,starbucks was awesome i really enjoyed working there. i have no complaints. management could've been a little tighter but overall great company to work for
good,great with school very friendly love it only downside was pay but you were so happy u didn't care
good,"Though I only worked there for just under 4 months, every day was a new experience. Helpful, knowledgeable staff and training materials make learning the lingo and upkeep of the store second nature."
good,"Fun work environment, knowledge that promote the culture, mission and values of Starbucks. Maintain a calm demeanor during periods of high volume or unusual events to keep store operating to standard and to set a positive example for the shift team."
good,"Starbucks was an amazing learning experience not only for making their custom drinks and pastries, but for growing to know customers and their needs."
good,"My favorite part or being a Barista was being able to train new employees. I really enjoyed having to be ready to change my teaching style to fit each new employees needs. By learning all of the different coffee makers, coffee, tea and drink combinations, I was able to successfully help the customer find their personal taste in products and beverages."
good,"Working as a Starbucks Partner was a wonderful experience. I was trained effectively and always felt prepared to do my job. There was a sense of community among Partners and customers that I have never seen anywhere else. The hardest part of the job was getting up so early in the morning, but that got easier as time went on. I learned to work with a team, be flexible both with my schedule and my role at work. The best part about working at Starbucks was connecting with people from all walks of life."
good,"I loved my job. My customers made my day they came in every day to see us. Good tips, great coworkers, all were reliable, trusting and hard workers. Did task and took care of customers first. Great benefits"
good,"starbucks empowers you to take complete ownership and creative freedom in growing your business. It is a people motivated environment where personal relationships are encouraged and fostered. Working with the district management team was challenging and fullfilling. My district manager is not only an exceptional driver, but a personal mentor. I enjoyed all aspects of store management, including hiring, mentoring, sales growth, administration, and community involvement. The biggest opportunity I had came when learning a brand new global labor system, which made scheduling the staff a little more challenging. The most enjoyable part of the position was being able to connect with peers, and executives to strategize and measure growth. I also love people and the customer service environment was the best I have worked in."
good,I work at Starbucks as a shift supervisor and I love to come to work because of my employees. They make me feel welcome. My co-workers are amazing and we all have a positive vibe while working together. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with the outraged customers that come there. I thankfully have great customer service and do not allow these customers to get to me. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the atmosphere that surrounds the store. There are such great people that we consider our regulars and meeting the new customers daily is always interesting.
good,"llegar a la tienda y escuchar tipica musica era agradable,contar con el apoyo de gerentes y supervisores que nos trataban de igual ,risas entre turnos y un muy buen clima laboral,eramos mas que un grupo de trabajo una familia =)"
good,We were a tight knit group of co workers who treated eachother like family along with our outstanding customers
good,this was my first job ever and the benefits that came with it set the bar high for my next few jobs. they really care about their partners and the benefits are easily missed when you leave for another jobs.
good,"I know every Starbucks location is different, so I cannot speak for the company as a whole. But at my particular location, our staff is like a very tight-knit family; we all love and care about each other and we are all very good friends by choice. The staff at Edgewater Starbucks is comprised almost entirely of young adults, so we are all very similar in where we are in our lives. A typical day at work starts either extremely early in the morning (about 4:30am) or in the early afternoon and is always filled with friendship and laughter. When I first started working at Starbucks, I was in high school and I didn't know a single thing about coffee or having a job. I learned very quickly and after almost four years of employment, I can say I am still learning more each day. Of course there are some days where I'm convinced I don't make enough for the customers I have to deal with (they can be quite nasty at times), and other days, I think I get paid too much for all the fun I'm having. But it all balances out and I make a great deal more money than many of my peers in retail positions. I have no complaints about working for Starbucks after almost four years and I have to say that I will be extremely sad when my time comes to move on to another job."
good,"Amazing training management, very thorough training. I enjoy the poeple I work with - you are encouraged to be creative and be yourself. The company encourages you to excel at your own pace."
good,"Its a peaceful environment, very friendly customers, I enjoy working at Starbucks. Its the kind of job I look forward to waking up the next day and going to work. But like most good things eventually working at Starbucks will have to come to an end for me. I want to further my experience in the work force and further my knowledge in management. "
good,"Greeting customers, making coffee, management does a great job with communicating to it's employees, my co workers are the best and make work enjoyable each and everyday. The hardest part of the job is just memorizing each recipe for every drink, and the most enjoyable thing about work is getting through those busy Saturday mornings."
good,"Having the opportunity to help others with a cup of coffee or just make them smile while you were providing a great customer service. I learned a lot of things with this company. Learning coach, cash controller, budget and supervisor training was some of the few things that I learned at this workplace."
good,"Starbucks is a warm and comfy place to be you always feel right at home the music, food, and customer service is excellent ."
good,"I have been working at Starbucks for six years now and I have enjoyed every year of it. The hours are flexible, the people I work with are great and we know how to work with each other."
good,"Everything but the pay is wonderful, but that's just retail. There's actually a lot of areas for growth and advancement for a motivated individual. Starbucks usually hires really great people."
good,"I loved working for Starbuck's and would have continued for years, but I knew I did not want to work in food/beverage management and a position came up at UALR where I was able to use my degree and advance in an academic field."
good,"Not all the world is a stage for me, but the Starbucks counter definitely is. I loved conversing with and serving the clientele at Starbucks. Great people, great product. Challenging in that we worked at the train station and had to stay focused on getting the folks to their appointed destinations on time--and happy with the coffee in hand."
good,a 8 hour shift as a manger if you should get sick its nearly impossible to find someone to cover your shift but the company as a whole is a great company to work for
good,I will bleed green until the day I die.  I loved working for Starbucks!!
good,"The morning shift had people lining out the door for about 4 hours. A fast-paced environment with long hours on my feet, we had to work as a team and work fast to keep costumers flowing. Management was very helpful, however as I was there for 4 years, I saw a lot of change, including management, and had to adapt to new orders. It was a family experience and our staff grew very close. Starbucks was the favorite place I have worked so far."
good,"My favorite part about serving coffee is saying, ""Good Morning!"" everyday. Once I learned the drink recipes and standards at Starbucks, every other part of the job was very easy. I would say the management was always very organized and enthusiastic towards every partners growth in the company. Being trained by older partners, and training new partners, really made it easy to work as a team."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is not a thing that happens, something new happens all the time, that's why I love it. I have learned to be patient with myself and that multitasking is a handy tool. Management at my store is amazing they act more like friends than your boss. In fact everyone acts like friends the co-workers are the best part, they are always outgoing and friendly. The hardest part is having to run around all the time, wears down the legs. The most enjoyable part is the customers they rock and treat you like friends, I love my regulars."
good,I learned so much at Starbucks. I learned to connect with customers on a level above simply serving coffee. I learned to value the customer view of a display and the atmosphere of a business rather than simply the staffs view. I learned to work with various types of people and personalities and adapt to different environments. It was an amazing place to work but I'm ready for somewhere new.
good,At Starbucks I learned that employees should be treated like partners not just employees. You should always feel like you are part of a team. They really encourage integrity in your workplace and they teach you skills that I feel apply to any job position that you hold. My manager and coworkers are extremely supportive and work around my school schedule to the best of their ability. As long as you do what your told with a positive attitude and always try your best you will do well with a company like Starbucks.
good,"Positive interaction with customers and employees."
good,"As soon as I arrive at work, I make the time to scope the environment and see what I can do during the shift. I ask my shift lead what my responsibilities are, then I proceed. I greet customers with a smile and proceed with their order request.  I get along with all my customers and I admire our team work.  I am constantly making sure every partner is set during their shift and are working with a positive attitude. Working at Starbucks is a fast pace job and I am constantly moving around cleaning, making drinks, and helping customers buy our products.  My favorite part about working for this company, is the connections I gain with every customer.  It is always my goal to have every customer walk out of our coffee shop with a smile. I value every customer."
good,A typical day at work was always busy. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a drink order out in under 2 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was when new products came out.
good,"Every day was dependent on the customer flow. No matter what, I made hot and cold drinks according to what the customer wanted. I learned how to multitask effectively and all about the business. I loved my management team! They worked with us on the floor every day and could always be counted on to help with any problems. My co-workers and I were a great team, yet knew when to start working individually to get work done. The hardest part of the job was leaving for a new opportunity. I loved everything about this job."
good,Typical days are engaging with customers and properly executing beverages. You definitely learn how to multi-task. management can sometimes be difficult since they are typically under pressure and can exert an emotional reprimand. The hardest part would be remembering all the recipes and default settings of beverages but after a while of working there everything will come naturally. The best part of working here is getting to many new people with wonderful personalities. The baristas are always engaging and full of energy.
good,"#1 Coffee Corp worldwide. Highly structured, fast paced team environment. Offering a high opportunity for advancement with manager hands on training. Extremely positive enforced environment with customer and partner loyalty."
good,"Starbucks treats the partners very well. I have noticed the benefits provided to partners has decreased significantly, but they are still much better than most. Every store is different with a different atmosphere, but I have worked at many different stores and they have all had a welcoming attitude and most partners have been very inviting. The hardest part about working at Starbucks is being on your feet for long hours. Getting to know the customers is probably the best part about working at Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks has been a great place to work. After the intial training, it takes about a month to get into the swing of things. The partners I work with are amazing. Starbucks stores tend to get busy and hectic, but there are always people there to joke around with you and ease the stress. They are very flexible with schedules and school. You get a break every two hours and a lunch if your shift if 6 or more hours."
good,"making drinks for customers"
good,"Multitasking is a major part of the job, as well as customer service. It is a face paced job that is fun and rewarding if you work hard."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I had so much fun, and learned a lot as well. Working there helped me to develop my work ethic, learn valuable interpersonal skills, and better myself as a person. I felt like management had a vested interest in who I am as a person, not just an employee. We truly were ""partners"", not employees, and that feeling was reiterated in everything Starbucks does."
good,"A typical work day is filled with customer interactions, making and serving coffee/tea beverages with a genuine smile, connecting with other partners (employees), and completing duties and tasks in a timely and prioritized manor. I have learned how to keep my composure and not let the small stuff fluster me. I can learn in a short amount of time and under pressure. The management is there to help me and I can talk to them about anything in my life. They work with you to factor in the fact that I have a life outside of starbucks; they truly care about their partners inside and outside the cafe. The hardest part of the job is learning how to properly coach other baristas in a positive way. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and putting a smile of their faces as they partake in their daily coffee ritual."
good,"The chance to take the average person and have the time, support and resources to make a difference in peoples lives that normally would not happen based on education and negatives."
good,"Making drinks, connecting with customers, ordering, inventory "
good,There is a rotaion of position and responsibilities every hour at work.  We worked for 9hours a day and 5 days a week. I learned so many things in this company. Especially when handling clients. I also learned how to get along very well with my co-partners. Say things to them without hurting their feelings. Responsibilities are equally distributed to us. We are compensated very well. The partners are entitled to several benefits which are really helpful for us. The most enjoyable part of the job is the everyday shift. you'll not feel that your tired during the shift because of my jolly co-partners. THe hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable complaints of some customers.
good,"Generally I would work an eight hour day at work, anywhere from four o'clock in the morning as a start time, to eleven p.m. as an end time. Starting at minimum wage, I am now making a little under twelve dollars per hour. Management is strong and willing to help out when needed, and each of the baristas I work with are fantastic and willing to do their part to make the team thrive. The hardest part of it all has had to be adjusting to my new position as a shift supervisor. The most enjoyable part is possibly the easiest question. It has been wonderful getting to know new people, both coworkers and customers alike. "
good,making the best coffee drinks i can and having small talk with my customerws
good,"As a barista/trainer I on boarded all new employees, teaching them the basics of coffee preparation, knowledge of the company, and customer service requirements. I elevated my already gained skills of the coffee world, becoming more knowledgeable about the growing and processing of coffee. I enjoyed all of the people I worked with, each had a unique story and experience to bring to the table. My immediate supervisor was amazing, supporting us any way he could, be it knowledge or a high five of encouragement. I would still be with this company if they paid more on the hour and had the ability to promote from within more (their inability is due to employees staying with the company for years)."
good,"Good company, meeting new people daily and seeing the same familiar faces day in and day out.  Regular customers make for a pleasant and easy work day."
good,un día típico. llegar en mi horario de trabajo y empezar a desempeñar   mis labores entrar a barra y comenzar a preparar café o bebidas frías postres etc. aprendí el trabajo en equipo a conocer la cultura del cafe y a convivir con mis compañeros durante mi estancia la parte entre comillas difícil era lo pesado del trabajo es una empresa con muchos clientes y puede ser un poco pesado permanecer de pie siete horas preparando bebidas y alimentos consecutivamente y lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente y el horario
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas boas trabalhando nesta empresa, como que um ótimo atendimento faz diferença na vida do cliente , como tratar seus colegas de trabalho ser um ótimo profissional ,como que temos que valorizar a cultura de sua empresa. Um dia de trabalho era bem agradável como todos os lugares tinha seus altos e baixos, porém cada cliente fazia seu dia ficar diferente passando suas experiências e adquirindo as nossas. É somente o gerente aprendi muito com ele, todos os que passaram lá os outros coordenadores eramos muito unidos, pois o trabalho tinha que ser feito como uma equipe ajudando um ao outro até mesmo o próprio gerente.Os dias mais difícil foi quando o quandro de funcionário estava menos do que o padrão a loja cheia, tinha que atende o cliente no tempo padrão e sua bebida sair perfeita. Gostava muito de quando o cliente fala que fizemos o seu dia ficar, melhor é muito bom ouvir isso."
good,Starbucks taught me how to communicate more with my customers and give them a comfortable place to enjoy their drinks or simply just relax. The team was wonderful and we all worked together as a family. 
good,"You have to be ready to be making drinks almost all day, you will learn to be quick, you will learn to communicate with customers, Register. The hardest part of the job is when you get he rush hours and the most enjoyable part is that you can drink all the coffee you want and also can ake lots of friends."
good,"Starbucks has been a great foundation for me for the past 9 years. Not only has it served as a wonderful job to have while I pursued educational goals, but it is fun and rewarding. I have grown to love and meet amazing people throughout my journal with Starbucks, from customers to other partners. I love engaging in conversations and providing great service to people to ensure their day goes smoothly. "
good,"I really loved being able to work for a company where I was not only able to complete the tasks of the company, but I was also able to do it while being my happy, open, laughing self. I loved being apart of a team that worked so well together and cared for each other."
good,A typical day is very hectic but fun at the same time. There is hardly ever any downtime and it makes working at starbucks that much more fun. I really enjoyed working there and was sad when we moved.
good,"I absolutely love working here. It's very fun and all the co-workers are very friendly and helpful. We have a good system and everyone help each other out. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know and connect with so many different types of people, but the hardest part, is the very fast pace we have to work at when the shop becomes busy. One mistake can mess up the entire assembly line in a metaphorical sense."
good,"I learned valuable work skills, how to work with others. How to work a night shift and balance school and work."
good,"Love love love this place as a job. Meet lots of new people on a daily basis. Communications with customers actively, most regulars will be personal communication levels. Very energetic atmosphere. Challenges you on busy times of the day everyday."
good,i grew in this company quickly also because i wanted to the best possible customer service representative when each customer came through the door. This company in my eyes operates like family.
good,"Starbucks provides many benefits for its partners. Paid vacations, 401K, health benefits, and stock options are available. The Starbucks CUP Fund continues to provide financial support for partners in tragedies. Work is fast-paced and demanding, but that shouldn't be a con. Every aspect of the average workday is managed to increase efficiency."
good,"Opened/ closed the store. Ordering, coaching, P and L budgeting etc. Great workers with different reat personalitys. The store layoffs and closings a couple of years back and sometimes the lack of barista training. Great part have to be as a company whole its the best to work for."
good,"Devoted to their mission and focused on the customer. Worked closely with external partners such as Dreyer's Ice Cream to develop proprietary, coffee-based products. Crazy pace, fun people, great work environment."
good,"A typical day consists of my team and I arriving at around 5 or 6 am and resuming to prepare the store for customers before they arrive. Once the customer flow begins it doesn't usually end until I'm about to get off work. During this period, which is very high-pace, I quickly and effectively hold conversations with our various ""regulars"" and connect to any new faces I may see: all while selling whatever merchandise is most applicable to each individual."
good,Making drinks and preparing food. Making sure the work area was cleaned and stocked. Using a cash register to make change and accept cash when drinks or food was bought from the store.
good,It was a great learning experiment
good,"My typical day at work is setting up and preparing for the start of business. I work with my coworker to make sure everything is needed before the first customer walks in. The first customer may come/drive thru as soon as we open or maybe 15 mintues after. That is the unpredictablity of working at Starbucks. My are all different in personality which makes work interesting. You may not know who you are working with or what kind of day it may lead. The job isn't hard however it can be frustrating with the amount of customers that may arrive at once. For the most part it's a good job, it's fast, loose and overall a good atmosphere to get to know your customers on a daily basis."
good,"The benefits are amazing, and the culture of the company and it's stores are friendly and welcoming. Even as a barista you feel as if you have a voice in the company."
good,Great incentives. promotions all the time to keep you on your toes. Great management structure.
good,"Great company to work for. They provided benefits for part-time employees, fun environment and a great product."
good,Fun but awful customer suck but overall its a great place because the pros outweigh the cons
good,"Wonderful teams. Very productive, do not under staff EVER. There is never feelings of being overwhelmed. Very supportive atmosphere."
good,Its easy access to use and really good on finding jobs that fit your needs.
good,"A typical work day for me was enjoyable! I loved going to work. I loved knowing that thru a cup of coffee, small talk or full conversation, a simple smile and/or even the smallest amount of acknowledgment, I was able to make someone's day a bit brighter. Therefore, I gained a value beyond comprehension for the employee/customer relationship. I also learned to go above and beyond (i.e. knowing a customer by name or knowing their drink and having it ready, sometimes, before they even entered the store, waiting for them at the register), and have gained far better work skills in customer services. Our management teams differed from store to store, and I experienced good and bad management throughout my almost 10 years with the company. Mostly good, I'm pleased to say, given I had my fair share of managers within the company. When it came to working with other partners though, I always had good experiences. I always worked with delightful people. We always looked out for one another, providing encouragement and consideration. Friendships were built with a lot of the partners I worked, and some even remain today, years after they'd left the company. I can honestly say that I found no part of my job hard. I loved everything I did within the company and what they did for me as a partner. My job in whole was very enjoyable, and I'm pleased to say I worked for the company. And if it wasn't for a medical condition, eczema, in which my dermatologist prohibited me from working within the company because I'm not only allergic to the cleaning chemicals and soap used, but coffee as well (which"
good,"Shifts fly by, well operated and maintained. Everyone is compensated fairly and treated with respect. Opportunity for advancement and improvement."
good,"I really enjoy the corporate culture. Not very many companies have managers that schedule themselves 40 hours a week! <3 this! Of course if I have to stay a few extra hours, its not bad. Love working with my staff. They are a very diverse and amazing group."
good,great employer awesome advancement opportunity diverse working place all around great... you can't beat the part-time benefits
good,"I didn't even mind working at 5am. The people you meet and work with in this company are incredible. Its not only a job, but a lesson in social skills. You are required to interact with the customer on a more personal level then any other fast service job I've ever held. And with regular customers coming in daily, its easy to develop a real friendship. But not only with the customers, but your fellow barista as well. Working as a team or a well oiled machine this fast paced job is never boring. You are supplied with all the caffeine you'll need to get through a shift because drinks are complementary while working a shift."
good,Good start place to learn good costumer service. Fast paced and fun.
good,served customers as they placed orders. ensured all guidelines and procedures are followed and met.
good,"There's not any other way I can put this really, it really is the best place I've ever worked."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. I think that they are a wonderful company to work for, with all of the benefits and the amazing people I have worked with."
good,I had to help open up up store at :30 am every moring to set up.I learned how to make all differnt kinds of coffee.i love my co wokers. I hardest part of my job was the am hours. I meet all famous people.
good,Company is a great place to work. Partners are ffriendly and work as a team.
good,"A very high-energy company where personal values mesh with corporate standards. As a Shift Supervisor, responsibilities included opening the store, anticipating the needs of the day, planning the work schedule of that day's baristas; managed Points of Sales and deposits; managed daily inventory of dairy and pastry orders. Co-workers reflected the mission of the company regarding quality products and services. My biggest challenge was replacing staff on short notice. My biggest reward was the positive interaction with both partners and customers. My most enjoyable challenge was transforming an unhappy customer into a returning, happy client."
good,"Aside from personal problems employees bring to work and personalities that don't belong in customer service this job is wonderful. The staff is young and fun. The customers are very particular and usually know EXACTLY what they want. If they don't it's an opportunity to learn and share knowledge. The benefits are great. There are 401k, health, and dental options after some time. Employee's get tips and a free pound of coffee each week. The company is focused on treating people properly throughout the entire process from farmer to barista. California employees start off above minimum wage (not sure about other states). Hardest part of the job is the early hours. Overall if you like people and people who treat others with respect and dignity you should work here."
good,A day working here is both challenging and fun. You are able to develop relationships with customers. There are often new products and procedures to master and there is always something new to learn.
good,"Working for Starbucks in South Carolina was so rewarding due to the Partners I had hired and the Customers that came in and the community service events we coordinated.These partner are hard working and also up for a challenge we were one of the store that would always come in the top five if not first with sales,profit and loss, or contest . They are just a awesome bunch of partners . And the community we were in was just as great we organize a cancer walk and the school aloud us to have it at Football field and all through word of mouth we had close to 200 people and raise about 2000.00 dollars"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a journey that I would never take back. I learned so much working here. Cash handling, customer service, communication, responsibility, and an all around growth because of this organization. There are days where work is hard, just like any job, but the pros out weigh the cons and I have learned how to be a better person in and out of the workplace."
good,"As with any service job, there are always people that are tough to deal with. My days were always made better by great coworkers and a great manager. Everyone came in happy and had a great time, even if it was extremely busy or we were understaffed. I learned to deal with stressful situations quite well as well as multi-tasking many jobs at once to ensure my job was done correctly. I took pride in my work and always appreciate compliments from customers and coworkers."
good,"Starbucks is the perfect example of a business establishment that is what I call ""Turn Key"". With the organized business structure, the Starbucks Culture that doesn't settle for any customer dis-satisfaction, and the great Training Systems, this is a company that anyone can run with success and much joy in the process. And a whole lot of coffee. Room for Advancement is there for those who are willing and more important , able . This is an all around great job, and anyone who worked for Starbucks would come away with highly developed communication skills as well as the knowledge that comes from satisfying all costumers without compromise, even if it cost the company money , maintaining the customer satisfaction is the primary intent at Starbucks. The days while working here are very fast paced, after working for Starbucks face paced & Multi-Task workflow become second nature."
good,i wish that we had better shift supervisors there wasnt enough hrs but i enjoyed helping the customers
good,"Open/close store,staff is great, communicating with individuals of hi-end law firms, serving that particular community was the best . absolutely no down fall."
good,Starbucks was my first job and I had a blast working there. I loved the customer interaction as well as the compensation and tips.
good,I open the store so I had to be at work at seven thirty because we open at eight. Working for Starbucks was adventuries for me because I greeted the customer engaged with them made them feel like they were at home. A typical day for me filling the pastries smelling all the different kinds of coffees training new hires was fun for me my guest loved me and gave me great compliments. Inventory was some times the worse so much stuff to order but I loved it didn't like running out of things especially caramel for the caramel marciotto the guest loved that
good,Great company to work for. Advancement is easy. Starbucks provides flexible schedules.
good,I enjoyed answering phones and helping customer in coffee service.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. Overall, it's a terrific place to work with a lot of growth opportunity."
good,"This company offers great benfits, Schedule flexability, Short shifts and on-the-job training."
good,"Starbucks was the best place I ever worked. They understood the value of their ""partners"" (what Starbucks calls their employees). Good pay and benefits. I had lots of ability to try new initiatives and not everything had to be done by the policy manual."
good,Circadia was a Starbucks concept store which I loved but unfortunately did not last. Night life and live music with good food and great atmosphere.
good,"I genuinely am so happy with this company. it's hard not to feel happy working for Starbucks. all schedule requests are usually 99% accepted, asking for days off isnt a hassle considering we use a specific app to do so."
good,"Starbucks was exactly what you would expect. Made drinks for customers. Served bagels, bread, etc.. Hours were flexible and management was good. Had no complaints."
good,Such a wonderful place to work. The culture and experiences make you want to go back each day. Corporate really takes care of us with excellent benefits and resources.
good,A friendly environment where you can strive and achieve goals as an individual. Helping each partner to be on top of their tasks and enjoy their service to the customers.
good,"Starbucks strives to create personal connections with their customers and staff as well as creating an environment that is cozy, safe, and welcoming. i admire and love this so much because i always felt welcomed and loved while working there. it is a very fast paced and at times intense environment, but if you're good at managing time, being outgoing and energetic than this is the perfect job for you."
good,"There is constant movement in the work area. We have many responsibilities in the work place and each individual is assigned tasks, but we all learned how to do each task in order to stay productive. We are always communicating with each other, both in and out of the work place as a team. We get many guests, so we're constantly providing positive customer service and are skilled in communicating with people."
good,"After, being with the the company for over six years. Working in customer service will always have it's ups and downs. But I learned so much about myself and how to work under pressure. Starbucks as a company has so many outlets to support and protect their employees. Always assuring of potential to move up to management roles."
good,it was so great the people are so nice and they are always willing to help when needed they take their time training you and they take it seriously and it a team environment
good,I was with Starbucks for 3 years. Awesome company. The management needed help. Favoritism was presen. I worked at a flagship store. I had fun experiencing the different types of coffee.
good,Nice place to work as a student. Very flexible with your work schedule and coworkers tend to switch shifts often in order to help each other out. Bosses typically have your best interest in mind
good,"Customer Services, is a great place to work I love everything about this company the pay is good and the work is not bad..nnnnmmmmm?  And the coffee is the best"
good,I love working there it’s was a great experience It was a busy place at times but over all the people I worked with was great and they have good service.
good,"It's an amazing place to work at since there aren't any weird things going on like in some other work places, they try to keep the company really safe for work at all times, the teamwork always feels sharp and fun once you get to know the people. It also helps you in areas of work you've always wanted to improve in as well."
good,"Working at Starbucks previously, I can say it is a fair and friendly work environment that allows young adults to better practice good customer service"
good,I would high recommend Starbucks to be your first job. They're a great team and always try to work around your schedule.  Management was always friendly and wanted you to succeed we
good,They have the best management I’ve worked for by far. The pace is fast and the customers are fun to talk to and get to know. Management always has your best interest at heart and is always willing to work with your flexibility when dealing with more than one job
good,"I learned so much, even though the beginning was overwhelming since I was hired during peak season (in the holidays). My training was not as thorough as others who were hired around the same time, but I caught on quickly and they never made me feel bad about it. "
good,"Coworkers are nice and collaborative, customers are kind and you get to learn people's names and connect with them after a short period of time, learning how to make drinks and being on the go makes it fun and not repetitive. Great benefits, free drinks while clocked in, discounts on food, good food, etc."
good,"Honestly, it's the normal stress a cafe environment has, but the people I work with make it worth it. Management is also very supportive and understanding. It's a great place to work if you're a student."
good,"Starbucks coffee shops are welcoming not only to their customers but also their staff. Management is always happy to work around your schedule as long as you're upfront about when you need days off. The atmosphere never gets old since they let you play the music you enjoy, so long as it's appropriate. Shifts are short if you have half days and 8 hour shifts aren't hard since everyone does their part to make the store work as a whole."
good,"I have nothing negative to say. The people with whom I worked were lovely, and I felt encouraged to do my best with the fast-paced environment and the positive adrenaline."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, but your time at the work place can be heavily influenced by the type of management you have.  I believe that I loved my time at Starbucks due to an excellent manager during my time there."
good,"The job was fun, stressful yet rewarding. The staff and customers made it easy to come to work. The environment was fast pace and the duties were challenging"
good,"Good Company teaches you lots of skills for any industry.."
good,"Great job if you can handle a lot of pressure during a rush. It's really fun as you get to do a variety a tasks. There's never a dull moment. They pay minimum wage as far as I know, but you get cash tips on top of that."
good,I started without any barista knowledge but I got an extensive on hand training for the skills needed to be learned. Though there are ups and downs they will treat is as a learning experience for you to get better.
good,Great job and upward mobility woulnderful work environment great training and great management always promote from within and amazing c culture and fun atmospheres
good,You master the art of multi tasking working for Starbucks. You must be quick on your feet and learn how to keep your composure while tasking and providing exceptional customer service.

good,"Starbucks was a very good intro to learning about coffee, the origins of coffee as well as learning the different types of brewing processes. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have a foot in the door with coffee"
good,"There was never a slow, boring day at Starbucks. My store was very busy in the mornings but so fun to tackle with my partners. I had an awesome manager; she was always on top of things and a great leader. They always taught us to create a third place environment for not just the customers but within ourselves as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting that morning rush; it was so fun zoning in and slinging out drink after drink."

Starbucks is a very fast-paced work environment that requires hard-workers and the ability to multi-task. Management worked together with team members to provide the most best and most efficient setting. My co-workers were some of the best people I've met and continue on as some of my best friends. The most difficult thing about the job is how fast-paced and overwhelming it can become, especially with irate, hard-to-deal-with customers."
good,"Staffed large drive thru store. Did payroll. Read monthly P&L’s. Interview for my store and other stores. I was elected a recruiting store.

Through my 4 months a starbucks I gained not only friends but a work family. I achieved my goal on customer communication and I also become a more vibrant person who connects way more easier with customers. I learned that arguing with the customer is not a option, take the blame and remake whatever it was that they wanted. Management was great I Loved all my shift managers including the store manager. The hardest part about my Starbucks was having a drive thru, because when it was rush time you had to make sure both cafe and drive thru got the correct drinks in the order it was taken. The most enjoyable part about Working in starbucks was creating bonds with customers."
good,"Baristas prepare and serve drinks in coffee shops. They may also be responsible for performing cashier duties, food preparation, and general management of the shop.

Baristas typically hold at least a high school diploma, but some also hold a special barista certification."

I learned how to use the Mastrena espresso machine and also learned how to handle money. Management was super awesome and helpful and very flexible about hours, specially considering I was taking university classes at the time. All of my coworkers were a lot of fun, and we would do things together even out of work. The customers can be really sweet, but there are also those that are very picky and rude. As long as you can work in a fast-paced environment the workload is not bad, with the morning being the most fast-paced and the afternoon/night usually being very chill. Also get lots of tips, specially if you become friends with regulars!"
good,"Working At Starbucks Was A Life Changing Experience, It made me into the man I am today & im honored to have had such a great opportunity to work there ."
good,Was fun job very fast past it made the day go by fast had wonderful customers which where a lot of regulars that came in everyday and was the sweetest and made me love the job more

good,"You never know what is going to happen every time you clock in. "
good,My experience at Starbucks provided me with skills that I can take with me any where for the rest of my life. Being able to work with different types of people at different locations across the country was a unique experience. Sure you will come across managers that aren’t so wonderful and partners that don’t do their share of work but that is the hazard with working with humans. The only negative thing I have to say is about their rehire qualifications and basis on which they will fire people. Some of the best leadership has been let go due to the most absurd allegations.
good,Starbucks is very diverse and allows anyone to have the opportunity to start and grow with the company. There is a lot of opportunity for promotions and there are incredible benefits attached to the job.

good,I started not knowing how to get anything done and the recipes memorized to becoming a pro-barista and a genius with beverage making. I would recommend to anyone who loves food/drinks and conversations with new people.
good,"Working at Starbucks was an overall great experience. I learned about coffee but mostly how simple it can be to connect with those who consistently came in for their same coffee or beverage of their choice & the Starbucks culture of giving would show up in so many of ways by customers paying for the person behind them & seeing how it would keep getting passed to the next person & the next...That was a typical day working in an environment that at times was fast-paced & could get a little high stressed trying to keep things flowing fast enough.  But from the Starbuck partners to the customers the environment was positive & at the end of the work-shift, it felt rewarding. "

good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, I made plenty of friends new and old, it brought to my life a lot of relationships and excitement. It’s a great place fast moving environment"

good,although we serve coffee the job teaches you how to connect on a deeper level than just serving the product to the customer. we are motivated to talk and meet the everyone who walks in
good,"I started at an older store and moved to a new one in town during my time with Starbucks. They provide you with literally everything you need to know. Training is thorough and there are constant updates that upper management was wonderful communicating about. When you first start, you are placed in each and every role to not only cross train, but to see where you excel. Once you have been in each role enough to learn them, they typically stick you to one or two they see you thrive in. Of course, supervisors always have to weigh their options with other baristas on the floor as well. So you might get stuck somewhere you don't like as much to accommodate another employee. The culture is unlike any other. You are always recognized for your efforts. My favorite role was actually the DTO/DTW. If you want a fast paced environment, this is the place for you! ""If you have time to lean, there's time to clean!!"""
good,I developed quite a few meaningful work relationships as well as ongoing friendships.  The customer experience was wonderful.  The product offering made it easy to relate to everyone.

good,great experience being a manager it was diverse dealing with college students tourist and people who never been to a starbucks my dm was amazing and the benefits were great
good,"If you work hard, it is very easy to move up in this company to the store manager level. Without experience, it is challenging to work your way up to a multi-unit role."
good,"Everyone is friendly and wonderful at showing you the ropes. The pay is pretty low and tips aren't dependable.There is a lot of versatility needed for this job, I recommend for young high school to college students."

I was overwhekmed with passed information towards me. I could not grasp everything all at once in one day. However, the team who I work with have never pressured me, rather they wanted me to learn from my mistakes. The encourage me to do better, which I have done so in the next 4 months."

You learn how to communicate better because they're always people there that never been to Starbuck, so giving them details on what a drink taste like or what it is made of  and suggesting the different ways they can get their drink whether they want it hot, ice, or frappuccino. Starbuck is a fast working place where you always have different things to do. You actually develop a family among those who work there and the customer which is the fun part about working with Starbucks. The hardest part about working with Starbucks and actually getting comfortable and familiar with how to make the different drinks, it all takes time to learn but you always have help."

good,"Customer service and inventory management skills gained working for them."
good,"The job requires fun and active people. It can be very quick-paced at times, or even slow to the point you could fall asleep.

My store was a Drive Thru in Uttoxeter which got very busy but the days flew by as the team always worked together to achieve the overall goal. If you get the chance to work for them don’t turn it down!
good,I loved working for starbucks but the pay is less then desirable. That's my only complaint. Even with tips it's not enough to live on unless you live at home with your parents or in college.

Working with this company I improved my multi-tasking skills, along with my customer service skills, and the ability to work in a fast-pace environment. The hardest part of the job would be learning all the drinks and what goes inside them. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to be productive while making connections, not only with my other employees but also with our customers."

It's a lifestyle."

good,"We were fastest in the nation for drive-thru times, so that could be stressful. However, the team I worked with was super efficient. It is not a chill job, as some might think. It is fast-paced, and you are always busy. If you aren't busy with customers or making coffee, there are lists upon lists of cleaning to do. This isn't a bad thing, this means Starbucks is a company dedicated to a clean environment for customers and employees. Starbucks really focuses on customer service. "

good,"A typical day at Starbucks was starting around 4:30am to open, which I liked because I'm a  morning person and it was the busiest part  of the day and I am a fast pace person who thrives in a busy and challenging work environment. I learned how to communicate better with people and how to work through situations where a problem was presented and how to handle it quickly and efficiently. Management was amazing they were always there for their employees and helped us strive to be better and achieve our goals. There really wasn't a hard part. The enjoyable part was bettering myself as a person and making connections."
good,"Working at Starbucks will be an unforgettable seven years of my life. Having started in high school, it was my first job that wasn't limited to summer time hours. For probably my last two years with the company, I only worked one day a week -- five hours every Saturday morning -- simply because I couldn't bring myself to leave the people who had grown to feel like family in all the years I had been with them. I would have loved to stay, but I needed to make more money, and I moved thirty minutes further from where I had been living previously, so it proved too much to have three jobs on top of driving nearly 45 minutes after closing my bar the night before. To conclude, Starbucks was a wonderful experience overall and I really have nothing to say about the company or the people that work there!"

Because I worked downtown Chicago, we were busy from open to close. I enjoyed my partners (coworkers) and my manger. They all were friendly and my manager was very humorous so he kept us entertained on the job. Because we were a small group, about 15 employees in total, we all got along like a family.

In the morning we usually set up everything for our pea hour by setting and restocking everything from lids, cups, food and etc. After peak we must refresh and re start everything while multi tasking. Towards the end of closing, we must clean everything and restart everything as if we were to open. Working at Starbucks is really great because you get to work with a diverse team and has a great culture that everyone is welcome. The most enjoyable part of my job as a manager is to be with my partners and being able to create relationships with my customers as well. The toughest part of my job would be having confidential conversations with my partners when I know that they might be going through a tough situation."
good,"My favorite part of this job was the team atmosphere. We were all a pretty close knit team. This being said, a close knit team allows for sibling-like drama to occur, but not often and it definitely doesn't last long if you know your team well enough to resolve problems quickly. It's a little stressful in busy times but that just adds excitement to the atmosphere to see what your team can handle. A strong team will allow for a smooth transition into and out of busy times."

good,"Job can often be challenging, but very rewarding. Typical store in DFW manages roughly 25-35 employees. As a manager, I reported to District Manager every week and Regional Manager every quarter on sales trends, customer satisfaction and overall operations. The hardest part would be that some days were very long because after working an eight hour shift on the floor, you would often have to complete schedules, review inventory and waste levels and prepare for expected deliveries, check sales reporting, as well as analyze hiring needs & review applications. The most enjoyable part is daily interactions with customers and working with such a great staff and supportive peers."

A typical day at work was very relaxing, I had learned guests by their name and what their ""usual drinks"" were. They felt welcomed and appreciated, I recommended new pastries or drinks.

good,J'ai adorer mon expérience Starbucks et j'y retournerais n'importe quand
good,I worked for Starbucks for 6 years full time starting as a barista and moving up to supervisor. Progression is really easy and doors are always open for you to move up the ladder. It’s a really fun place to work and becomes a home from home rather then the dreaded work place. It really is like being paid to hang with your friends ( customers and colleagues ) Standards are set high so it’s still professional. Shifts are manageable too with social lives. Either early mornings so you get the rest of your day to yourself or afternoons so you’re free in the morning obviously depending on the opening times of the store.
good,"I enjoyed most of my regulars and being able to make relationships with them and my other customers. I have no drawbacks to working here, it  allowed me to be creative and stress free"
good,So far the most fun store I worked with. I get lots of benefits. Free drinks. Best teAm. Flexible hours. Great culture. Lovely people. Coolest manager.
good,I enjoyed my fellow coworkers as they were all aimable. My store manager was kind but worked as a very effective manager. They kept the store running smoothly.
good,I highly recommend the job if you are trying to define yourself in the customer service representative department! I remembered working at Starbucks during a very difficult time (super-storm Sandy) and the company was very god to us about everything!
good,"I worked at a license store on a university campus so everyone knew each other even though we had a large staff of almost 200 people. A typical day at work included working around one of our machines being broken, whether it be a brewer oven or espresso machine which had relatively easy fixes because my store was double sided store front. Other than those issues the job was fairly easy and i was promoted within 6 months of working there."
good,Good place to work. We do have a high turnover due to full time students. Hence why they shh away from hiring to many.  40 hours weekly if full time with opportunities to grow.
good,Starbucks has provided a great place to work allowing me to balance my family and work life.  The benefits have been fantastic.  It's a great place to work if you're planning on staying long term since your benefits will just continue to grow.

good,"Trabajar en Starbucks me enseñó muchas cosas buenas, como trabajar en equipo, tratar con la gente y estoy muy agradecida"
good,"Starbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Getting to know customers is the most important role in this job! Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. Starbucks baristas may also operate cash registers and credit card machines. Baristas may field customer complaints or questions, as well. Working well in a team at a fast pace is required."
good,Everyone worked as a team and made sure each spot were fulfilled. Everyone had a task and people followed through. We also helped each other when the time came.
good,"Really chill to work at, good pay, flexible hours and most awesome of all free drinks all day long while you working so you can have about a caffeine overdose if you want while working lol"

good,"Working at Starbucks teaches you many different skills, and life lessons. You will meet people that will change your outlook on life forever, and the work experience there was exceptional. You will learn how to communicate with your team, work efficiently as well as manage your time better than before working there. The hardest part of the job was working with frustrated customers and being understaffed, however working with the thought and believing that all things will pass, helps to get through a bad day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work as a team and being able to build professional relationships with not only the regular everyday customers, but the rest of the staff as well. Building a connection is very important in an everyday working environment. The support of the manager, supervisors, and the baristas is what really helped build a smaller community within the store, and poured out to our everyday customers. Every experience working at Starbucks, has helped shaped me into a team player, being able to communicate efficiently with my team, and be able to see the best in every opportunity and person."

good,I worked in Tim Hortons for 4 years now. I love the people I worked with as they are all nice and very accommodating. Health benefits is one I liked most of the company. Not much challenges except for the standards as not all people are working on it. I always worked morning shifts so that I have time for my kids when I go home.
good,"I worked in Starbucks Philippines over 10 years. While working there I have learned many things like how to deal with different personalities and how to manage people with confidence and enthusiasm.

good,"I  had a great working experience in Starbucks. It was a fun, family environmental work place. We treated each other like family. I would recommend people to work at starbucks."
good,"I suffered a traumatic brain injury back in 2010 and became a very different person. I was a super outgoing, friendly, talkative, energetic person prior and became a polar opposite afterwards. I isolated myself for several years so I had no human interaction, my jobs were very mundane and unstimulating. Eventually I became an alcoholic. After getting a job at Starbucks I started to feel some life come back into me and got to a point where I quite drinking and it's been all uphill from there! I'm getting out! Meeting new people! Making friends! Talking! Starbucks has played a very crucial and instrumental role in my recovery and I am beyond grateful."

good,"Starbucks is a team based environment, where everyone has a specific task to make the day run smoothly. Its a fun place to work where everyone rotates tasks and helps each other out. My Starbucks family is by far my favorite team I have worked with. "
good,"Just like most retail jobs, the hours are variable and off-kilter with other people's ""normal"" schedules. Generally, my shifts could start anywhere from 4am onwards, and would end anywhere up til midnight or so (later on nights we did sets for promotions and holiday), depending on what the particular store's hours were. There was no such thing as a set schedule, even as a store manager, and week to week, day to day, my hours would flip-flop. The worst were the nights when I'd ""clopen"" (close then open). Although theoretically, the scheduling guidelines were that we'd have at least eight hours between shifts, that just doesn't always work out, for various reasons. And as a leader, I made sure that if anyone had to do it, I was the first on the list, if at all possible. Getting home after 11pm and needing to be back and perky (har har) at 4am sucked, I won't lie. But you also get those moments of showy bravado then. Once you've done it a few times, you're a veteran, and you can shrug it off with casual nonchalance. Pride moments. As a store manager, my average week contained two opens, two mids, and a close. (At the store where we had more business in the evenings because of being a college town, this was two opens, one mid, and two closes for me.)"
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. Get a chance to meet different types of people and you get to know people on the regular. Creating new and exciting connections

good,A wonderful company to work for. With much room for growth if you’re in the right store. Wish I could go back but unfortunately had to move out of state.
good,Starbucks is a fast paced working area. In the mornings i tend too move more quickly than an evening shift I learned how too prep myself for the morning rushes. One morning I had too keep up with the mobile orders things got a little too busy but I was able too maintain by doing four orders at a time and also helping out my team. Without a organized team the store wouldn't function well.
good,"Working at Starbucks was quite the experience.It's a fast paced environment with everyday challenges. With the right people,crew,it makes a difference.I loved working there.My crew was awesome and so were the managers. We were a true definition of a team.

good,Starbucks doesn't only care about their customers but they definitely take care of their employees as well. The store I worked at was pretty busy but the system for deployment and the overall workflow gives us the opportunity to focus on a job and still connect to the customers. I love how there are weekly incentives of coffee or tea for each partner. Partner bean stocks that you accumulate and sell once matured. Overall a great job and definitely met a lot of my good friends through working at Starbucks Polo Park.

good,Great job while attending college. You get free coffee and a lunch while working. Discounts for pretty much everything. Tips every week. Paid every two weeks.
good,"During morning shifts we are to open at 10 in the morning and we close at 11:30 in the evening as we follow the mall hours. I learned that its not easy to be a barista whenever you when there's a lot of people and you still continue a connection between them, simple connection matters, to brighten the day of the people even though they're rude and through that, I learned to never lose composure and smile. Our workplace back in the Philippines is something that I had an emotional attachment especially with my co-baristas. It is a place to grow and the management was good, very considerate in making schedules and giving our off-requests and vacation leaves. The hardest part of the job is how you will continue to never lose focus with a lot of customers, even you are tired you have to set your mind that everything should be smooth. The most enjoyable part there is where you connect with other people, you get to know the customers and became your regulars."

good,I loved my job til I had a manger that was not understanding of situations. Alot of the Partners are gone now. And it was not just me who saw that things where not right with how she was runing things. The company is great. Just one bad person mananging it shouldnt have ruined my chances in the company.

good,It was a good job with a lot of benefits. I enjoyed working at Starbucks because of the customers and co workers who made working there a fun experience.
good,"I have been with the company for 10 years. It's my first and only job so far. I have worked as both a Barista and a Shift Supervisor. This is the absolute best company because the employees become your family. The company itself is supportive of individuals. Moving within the company to a new city, a new state, a new country is all possible."

good,My time at Starbucks was amazing. The staff there were very polite and understanding. While interning I was to keep all stations and tables clean also I had help pass out orders. Interning at Starbucks helped me be more open with others due to the fact I was very shy. It also helped me grow as an individual it made me proud of myself and for that I thank the Starbucks franchise.

Everyone stays fairly focused on their job and are all very friendly. During my time employed, there were a lot of opportunities to be promoted or change departments. Looking at other people experiences, Management was very accommodating in helping them find the right position within the company. I was sad to leave, and would probably still be there if I didn't have family issues that required my full attention."

I am not an employee at the company right now, but would happily return and because I believe in the structures and systems that are in place to ensure success."
good,"I absolutely loved working here."
good,"If you work under a manager who cares, you'll have the best time. I worked at 2 different stores, and picked up shifts individually at many others, and the vibes are mostly the same but the people at each location and the manager you work under really determines how much you'll enjoy this job. I had the best time there for about 2 years and although it can get hectic, overall it's a very relaxed vibe with nice structure and benefits!"

Then we got to do the mid-day garbage/recycling/espresso run which was lovely because it was snowing today in my city! Guess that's what's coming up for the next 6 months haha.
good,"The management was very understanding, very helpful and always there. I can honestly say the two managers i had there, were probably the best managers i have had. Drinks come in all different ways from hot to cold, to lattes too refreshers. Everyone helped out, if you got slammed you didn't do it yourself."
good,Starbucks is a great company who offers many benefits and room for growth! enjoy the customer service relationships built and always had a great team!
good,I enjoyed everything about the job. The atmosphere was great. The hardest thing about the job was angry/lack of coffee customers. The only reason that I had to move on was due to college requirements.
good,"Working at Starbucks comes with many perks, just on a day-to-day basis. Workers are entitled to free drinks a half hour before their shift through a half hour after their shift. A typical opening shift begins at 430am, a half hour before the store opens and goes through around 10am. This time includes the main peak period, which is fast paced and in high demand of perfection. The job is very understanding about life/work balance. The hardest part of the job is learning the speed, which comes with time. The most enjoyable is seeing the same faces everyday and getting to know each and every one of them. As a barista, you are also a therapist and a friend to customers and partners alike. It is truly the best job in the world."

good,Mejorar técnicas de comunicación con cliente. Responder preguntas de clientes y tomar sus ordenes. Trabajo en equipo eficiente.
good,The hustle of Starbucks can be intimidating but it is very rewarding to have meaningful connections to customers. The job interfered with school a little bit but my manager did all she could to accommodate me.
good,"working at starbucks was my first job, and it taught me all the customer service skills i have to this day. it was a great learning job to get my foot in the door for experience"
good,"Making several drinks at a time, management could have been better, workplace culture is great, hardest part of the job is when you are the only one making drinks."
good,"Nice job, nice surroundings and people care about you.  The bosses are all understanding. The only thing is, if you're sick or need to call out it is very hard to find coverage."

Management was down to earth and treated all employees equally and with the utmost respect. The best part of the job was getting to know the customers we saw every day and the free beverages!
good,Most days are structured the same and makes them easy to get the hang of. I typically open the store and get it ready for the days operation which I find enjoyable and rewarding. The best part of the job is the people I get to work with and all of my regulars that come in  for their daily cup.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks! My brother and I were partners at different locations and both of us really enjoyed what we did day to day. In fact my brother received his Bachelor's degree through Starbucks' college program. I only moved on because I wanted a change of pace, but I often miss it. Regardless of the occasional upset customer, the work was fairly easy and there was always a simple process for everything in house."

I learned a lot about myself from working at Starbucks. I learned how to be a better manager and how to delegate tasks. Helping customers and making beverages was always the most fun part of the job. Having people come in upset and then leave happy because of their experience always made my day. I've always had a good time with my management, it's a very positive attitude type of company which I've always appreciated. I love Starbucks, but I want to try something new."
good,"I have so many good things to say about Starbucks. However, my only complaint is after working at a few different stores management can have a big effect on how the store is run and employee experiences.

The company does an amazing job of sourcing and hiring individuals who would have a positive impact on the company, it's partners and its human connection with their customers. I will be forever grateful for the amazing mentors I had while working with this company. It wasn't always sunshine and rainbows, but in those stormy times, my team was always there to raise me up - even if it was tough love. My peers pushed me to grow, and management wasn't something to be afraid of. In fact, management took great interest in learning about all the partners and the journeys they wished to pursue whether that was with the company or another pathway. I can't say enough good things about the company. I know this review is on more of a ""front lines"" level, but the company as a whole is a global leader and I know for sure other companies look towards Starbucks as a positive model. Of course there are SOME bad eggs employed by this company (as in every other company) but the ""higher ups"" are always ready and willing to listen and be an unbiased third party perspective in the eye of non judgement and fair justice. I'll always be grateful for being a partner and I will always look back on my 5 years of experience with a huge smile (along with the life long friends I have made while working for this wonderful company)."

good,"Over the eleven years I have been with Starbucks I have seen it  evolve into a more connective place in a lot of ways and yet disconnective in others.  In 2007 when I started, one could not have visible tattoos, must wear black or tan slacks with white, black or tan collared shirts.  They have a more relaxed dress code now, you may show tattoos if they are not offensive, you can have hair color of an unnatural color if so chosen...even a stud in your nose if you like."

The hardest part of the job was wanting to get everything done at once, i enjoyed it so much i just wanted to do everything. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes customer service."
good,"The store I work at is a very high volume store. Everyone works together very well and supports each other. I enjoy my manager and the people I work with, they are fun and inviting. The hardest part for me is Corporate standards about donation policy. We throw away several large bags full of perfectly consumable food that goes to waste, because the ""specified donor"" does not come and pick it up. No partners or customers are allowed to take home or receive this food for free or at a discount. I would either take this food to a homeless shelter or feed it to my family of 4 kids, share with our neighborhood, etc. Seeing all the waste KILLS me."
good,Wonderful place to work with many outstanding employees! Very fast paced but it is easy to get into the swing of things once you are familiar with all the recipes and the computer system.
good,"I have learned so much working at Starbucks. Although I started there knowing nothing, the learning process along with the managers and trainers really helped me to become a very self sufficient, organized, and understanding barista. The hardest part of the job is learning all the steps and recipes, and to keep moving because there is always something to do. The other baristas are always very nice and will answer any question in a helpful manner. Once you get used to everything, the only thing to worry about are the rushes and big holidays, and those days have taught me to become faster and to stay calm when hundreds of drinks are flying at you. In the end of the day, the fast pace jobs makes the time fly and I love working there."

good,A typical day at work is fast paced and I was required to stay organized and multi-task. The management was always friendly and worked with my school schedule.

Not only do they concentrate on their excellent customer service, they also concentrate on their partners (employees). This is what they call the ""Starbucks Experience"", to make Starbucks a welcoming ""third place"" where everyone feels safe and welcome. It's a standard they have, and they truly live by. Being a barista with Starbucks has truly improved my communication ans social skills. The job has helped me become a better person, and has enabled me to improve on my professional skills to be able to deal with almost any social situation. I would highly recommend working with Starbucks to anyone!"

good,It kept me on my toes. I’d work there again if they paid me more. It’s very organized and systematic. They are always looking for new and innovation. It’s never dull.
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks is inherently stressful. The pacing is so fast and the scheduling is so tight, that you are forced to do the work for two people or more. This work load plus the stress factor is not compensated by pay or benefits in my honest opinion. If you are a competent worker you will be the one to pick up the slack of your younger inexperienced team mates. Yes you will have a larger chance of being moved up, which I was on track to do, but I was deterred by the amount of stress emanating from each and every manager I worked with. Good management is hard to find, and if you work for a good manager this job is not that bad and does come with great benefits. I personally just could not benefit from them."
good,I enjoyed Starbucks immensely. My coworkers and bosses were all amazing to me. The benefits are also a plus! I have recommended this job to many people because of the overall experience I received.

good,"Starbucks is honestly one of the best jobs I've had. Although a retail position like that cannot pay the bills, I was blessed to have a wonderful team, a great manager, and a company that continuously did its best to provide the best to its partners. Never felt like slave labor - it felt genuinely enjoyable work that did not go unnoticed or unappreciated."
good,"AMAZING Company and leadership!   They allow you to develop others and yourself at the sale time."

You also recieve tips that are divided amongst everyone hours, The Health insurance is very affordable and gives great co pays and out of pocket cost, using familiar health providers (aetna, blue cross etc.) This is set up to be taken out of your pay every 2 weeks, nothing huge I literally pay $ 45 for everything, every 2 weeks."

good,"Wasn’t that hard very friendly environment, fast pace and fun."
good,"Honestly, i very much enjoyed being a barista. Starbucks helped my knowledge and passion for coffee grow while allowing me to create memorable partner to customer experiences."
good,"This company is great! has room for growth if employee is serious about the company. The work atmosphere can be stressful due to the high demand of customers and their lack of appreciation for the employees. The store manager I worked for, for two years became my great friend and I volunteer every year to do Christmas in July with them although I am no longer an employee they still treat me like family."
good,"great job, great place to work help, guest, stock up make drinks, clean and also sale item cook food, it a nice place to work i enjoy dealing with people so i love it"
good,"Starbucks has changed my life in many ways, from my own leadership and personal development, to making lifelong connections with coworkers and management.

Starbucks cares about its partners and about its customers, and because of that everything else falls into place. I feel so fortunate to have spent so many years developing with the company."
good,Starbucks helps me communicate better while having fun and making peoples’ day. Smiling is key and human connection is also. Starbucks is a great place to work and I would recommend to anyone.
good,"I worked for Starbucks while living on the east coast with family. the managers were all very nice and receptive to questions. They were patient, even when there was a line, and showed me the way to craft the beverages and to accomplish necessary tasks. I appreciated working there and would work there again given the opportunity. It is fairly fast paced, but the people I worked with kept it fun. there is a lot of information, but giving yourself patience and just diving into the job, you'll get it. I was told it takes about two to three months to really start feeling comfortable with the drink recipes and the rhythm of the work. I enjoyed working with coffee and talking to the customers. There is a culture around coffee that gives a sense of imagination and conversation. It is very open and enjoyable. folks come in and buy coffee just to sit and watch people go by; to contemplate life. I find that to be wonderful and truly appreciated being part of it."
good,"I am having training, and so far, so good. I am enjoying to learn new skills and to know diferente cultures and people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the motivation I get from the team."

good,"It was always walking into a place of familiar faces and attitudes. You would prepare for the morning rushes of people coming in so it was almost preparing your arsenal of cups, products, and foods.

good,"Great company to work for but management sometimes need more people skills (Ranleugh street Starbucks)"
good,"The job was cool. I got to learn a lot of things about coffee that I didn't know. Plus, I had the opportunity to connect with customers and get inside they lives a little."
good,"Great company to work for. I really enjoyed the people and the atmosphere. Set up for day, clean, take orders, process orders, run cash registers. I learned to make a mean cup of coffee. The hardest part was standing in a small area on my feet for extended periods of time. There really weren't any hard part...maybe learning to make all of the different types of drinks. The most enjoyable part was greeting and visiting with customers"
good,This job helped me learn about coffee and the company of Starbucks. I worked well with others and enjoyed seeing the same faces come into the store every day.
good,Great company to work for! Really enjoyed what all there was to be offered by the corporation. There seemed to be a lot of growth from within. I would suggests anyone to work there.

Customers always come first and the quality of service must always be 100%. I also learned how to be assertive to employees to ensure that their tasks are always completed. I was also a trainer and loved to be able to pass down the knowledge that it takes to be an excellent barista."
good,Starbucks really cares about its employees and shows it. The company is really organized and you know what to expect every day. This job requires a lot of multitasking and working quickly due to the fast paced environment.
good,"My typical day at work was awesome. I loved the people that I worked with, and everyone was friendly. The management was always understanding if any emergency situations came up. The management is also really friendly and caring about their partners. The hardest part of the job is when it becomes black Friday and the lines are out the door. I loved that I was able to wear my own clothes within the dress code. That was awesome."
good,I love my job. I am coming up on my 15th year with the company. When I'm on the bar or at the register the customer connection is the best part. You would be surprised at what the smallest cup of coffee and a smile will do to a person's day.
good,typical day at work is doing some coffees and frappuccino's taking to the customers making them feel that is there second home. what i learned thru this journey I've experience allot of things like making latte's making frappuccino and the difficult part is multitasking like in the drive thru are im talking to the customer while im making there drinks but its sure a lot of fun. hardest part of the job is when its rush some of the trainees didn't know whats going on then you have to guide them as well as taking the customers order. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you meet your friends trying to work with then is the fun part. there not considered ans my friend but my family.

good,Best company I have ever worked for.  They helped with my promotion. Great benefits. Starbucks was really accommodating with my military leave. It was like i never left.
good,Greatest company I have ever worked for! Company culture is key to Starbucks and it shows. Hardest part of the job is getting to know drink formulas. If you have a knack for customer service and enjoy fast paced work this is the job for you! Couldn't say anything bad.
good,"Starbucks is a extremely high paced job. Lots of things to remember, and they are surprisingly easy to remember. Thanks to so many protocols and systems that Starbucks has in place it makes a typical high paced work day go smoothly and well. Starbucks also prioritizes partner friendship as well as customer connections. Which leads to a happy environment for partner and customer. Definitely would have to say the hardest part of the job would be the occasional angry customer. But they are few and far between. A huge perk of the job is you can cover shifts at other Starbucks locations near you which can help you gain more hours and wages, as well as tips! And with all the benefits Starbucks has to offer. It is definitely a company worth working for."
good,By far my favorite job. The people are easy to work with and make the job fun. Management is wonderful and easy to work with. Love every second I spend there.

I learned in working at Starbucks that no matter how heavy the job is they still managed to smile. give the customer the best service they need. they make me feel that i'm a part of the family/team. and they accept all cultures. they help each other in times of needing. there is no hard part of Starbucks when you enjoy working with a great colleague. I enjoyed at the Starbucks is that no matter what they managed to make you smile. they concerned about how you feel. its just like we've known each other for so long.
good,Starbucks is the best job to have. Surroundings great energy and good vibes. Makes you want to get up for work everyday with a smile. Working here keeps you busy and you get to meet great people.
good,"From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee but also connection. We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of your daily routine. Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew. We call our employees partners because we are all partners in shared success. We make sure everything we do is through the lens of humanity—from our commitment to the highest-quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly."

good,Starbuck is hands down the best company I have worked for. The opportunities offered are endless. Starbucks has prepared me for any future career I may encounter because of their excellent work environment and skill sets they provide you with. You learn much more than making coffee. You are introduced to an incredible staff that becomes family. The most satisfying thing is pleasing your coffee lovers while working as a team with your fellow Starbucks partners.
good,"Fast past work flow which helped time go by quick. Very helpful co-workers if you needed a question answered fast. If you worked better as a cleaner then a cooker they would help you find your better position, but all work had to be shaired."

good,"Working at Starbucks has definitely prepared me for working in a fast pace environment. I worked in one of the busiest Starbucks in the district. Although we got slammed everyday, customer satisfaction was our biggest goal and making sure every guest was warmly served in a timely manner. The Starbucks culture is so unique. As a barista, we get to incorporate our own style from customizing drinks to spicing up our own dress code. There is no no one role at Starbucks. As a Starbucks employee, you are the Barista, Cashier, Server and face of the store. Its all about teamwork, fun, and customer satisfaction."

good,"I learned to be upbeat and personable under pressure.  A typical day consists of making the store look presentable and ready to appease customer needs.  The hardest part of the job is pleasing everyone, and accepting that once in a while there will be an unhappy customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make customer connections that have lasted me long after I had moved on from the job."

I learned to be more patient and solidarity with the people, always have the best attitude and enjoy My activities were: staff training and supervisor, look after the stock and customer service. One of the things that i like to feel when i'm at work. is like my home because i want to feel that i'm enjoying what I am doing, meeting new people and at work everyone has to be treated equal. I think that the hardest part of the job is when the partners don't want to help each other and the work starts to be more difficult to do it, but comming an agreement, we can solve the situation and i great ambient at work.  The most enjoyablet part of the job is when the customer recognizes your effort and the good service you have given. of course have a good relationship with your parents."

The managers and supervisors were so understanding and always made sure to meet everyone's needs, partners and guests alike.

Teaching our partners the importance of urgency at work can be challenging, but practice makes perfect and I believe in that strongly.  It's really enjoyable when we can see that customers are truly happy when they leave and when we've made a positive impact on their day."
good,There are many jobs that don’t provide the flexibility. Meeting new people is easy. this job provides much more income to be cycled back into the economy more.
good,"La cultura de esta empresa es muy buena, me gusto trabajar aca aprendi mucho."
good,"The work flow is always busy, due to the volume of customers and a small store the work never stops but everyone is supportive and fun so that all makes the work day all the better. It is a historic tourist attraction, which gives all the more character and reasoning to be on your toes."

good,"We have a best team, I'm feeling here like in my second family. The customers are coming 2-3 times per day, so we know each other. When is not so many customers, we are making coffee tastings for us, or for people sitting there.. so many things I like in my job."

It was tough in the beginning learning all the drinks and how to properly make them while multi-tasking but after I got the true feel of the job I loved being there. The atmosphere was very welcoming and everyone got along for the most part. The hardest part of the job for me was maintaining a great amount of energy for the customers. If you came to work with a negative spirit it reflected in your work ethnics. You always had to keep in mind that the customer is always right and it was hard to sometimes go along with that rule. I would love to go back but now being that I have a Child I had to work towards something better. But overall Starbucks is an AWESOME PLACE TO WORK.

It is an warm welcoming environment. the hardest part of the job was dealing with 20 customers in line, employees under me becoming annoyed, not enough staff at that moment, but the most enjoying part was the partners because they create the environent that we work in."

good,"A day at work in Starbucks is so enjoyable because from the minute you walk into work you get greeted by all your coworkers. You put on that green apron and you don't even feel like you're going to work you are just going to be able to try and make someone's day that much better. You get to know your customers and hopefully remember their names, you get to learn about what is going on in their lives and you even see friendships begin from those connections you are making at work. For sure the most trying time at work is when we have our promotions and it gets crazy busy, or when a manager comes onto the floor and starts to stress out, and takes that stress out on our partners and it begins to stress us out when we could definitely work more efficiently and pleasantly if we weren't being nagged during busy hours.

good,"I loved working for Starbucks. I was good at making coffee and got lots of compliments. I enjoyed that customer interaction and getting to know my regulars. The hardest part of my day was the drive. I mostly worked morning doing the opening shifts which put me on the road really early in the morning. But, overall I had a great experience and if they had one in Picayune I would apply to work there."
good,"Working at Starbucks is very Professional, but also friendly. Partners are all nice, they may have their own standards, but who doesn't."
good,One of the best places I have ever worked at loved the customers and all my co workers who helped me suceed in this job. I would love to go back but we would have to wait and see

good,I love working for the company. I feel like they make sure that u are in good hands. The experience is great that’s why I’ve been there for years m. Just never give up.
good,"Feed back constante, dando a oportunidade de crescimento pessoal. Relações interpessoais e respeito mútuo."
good,"At Unt Starbucks we mostly had early morning shifts. It was busy with long lines of students, therefore working at a fast pace was immensely necessary. We had to be an expert in cash handling, as customers can get upset if you took too long or made a mistake. I have learned to make variety of drinks. I have improved my communication skills with customers and have enhanced my leadership traits. Hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for 8 long hours. The most enjoyable part was to see your customers smile after you have served the perfect drink they have ordered."
good,"Starbucks is such a great company. They have great benefits and a great flexible schedule. You make great tips and fun work environment. This job not only gives you skills for future careers, it gives you skills for life."
good,This is one of the best jobs that I’ve come across. I enjoy learning new things here at Starbucks. Interacting with different people everyday has become something I enjoy doing.
good,"I personally loved this company, I loved everything from the products we carried, how they treated employees all the way too how they let me show tattoos and be myself. My partners became some of my best friends whom I still contact today. Although I loved this company I had to resign due to my relocation to California."
good,"Desde el primer día me sentí dentro de una gran familia, nunca imaginé que trabajar allí me daría tanta felicidad. El ambiente laboral es muy bueno."
good,It was like working with family. Being able to enjoy and get to know you customers on a level where they seemed like family as well as the partners was one of the best reasons to work there
good,I love the Starbucks environment and the Starbucks partners I work with overall a great experience. It is fast paced but more than likely you have a great barista trainer to help you with anything you may need.
good,its a great place to work. hard work but work it. you must be willing to come to work prepared to work very hard. Learn to handle all different types of people.
good,"A typical day at work is very high stress and fast paced, there are very few moments to stop and think about anything unrelated to the job."
good,"This was my most favorite job that I had.It was fun, kept me on my feet, kept me going, I could solve problems and make drinks! I never signed up for the benefits because I was under my mom's at the time but I heard all about how amazing they are. Starbucks definitely takes care of their employees and I would love to work for a company like them again."
good,The job fast pace and alot things learned about the drinks and people working with are awesome. The management is well balance and go very smoothly. The workplace culture is fast pace because it hard to connect customers during peak hours
good,Very fast pace work environment with challanges to help improve adabtability and work ethic. Inspiring and positive co-workers and managers. Free coffee!
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. You learn a lot about how to provide exceptional customer service and how to go above and beyond for customers. Working there also helps you develop your patience while dealing with irate customers who have not had their coffee or perhaps received an incorrect order. The company does a great job of promoting you if you're interested! There is a lot of room for growth, both personally and professionally. Starbucks does not discriminate on who it hires, so you'll work with people of every age group and ethnicity. The hardest part of the job is handling the busy times of the day, such as the early morning rush. The value of collaborative cohesion is immense in this job. You won't be able to make it through the day without relying on the other team members, but from this you develop awesome relationships with your coworkers, which to me was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Engaging with new and regular guest."
good,"Working at Starbucks at the time was fun, interesting and productive. There's a lot of demanding and phone calls and researching too. The issue is everyone trying to make their self looks good for the manager."
good,"Starbucks my first and only job for the majority of my time here. I was able to live life comfortably and the job environment is great, but of course  varies per location. Opportunities to move up are great, so I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys coffee and has great people skills."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for. Glad I have had the opportunity to gain excellent interpersonal communication skills as well as learn so much about the company itself. They are very flexible with schedules, especially for students."
good,Its a great company to work with and working with partners that aren't just co workers but friends and some i even call family. Of course any job has its good days and bad but i work well under pressure and always made sure to stay positive and do the work that is necessary to keep my team and customers happy.
good,I really like working at Starbucks. Im just waiting on my benefits and I'm 3 months in. I did ask for a raise the answer was no thats the only down fall but other then that fun environment great people and fast pace.

good,They offer lots of training. have lots of benefits. I wish more full time job opportunities where available.   good place to work. got a long with co workers. management was good for corporate store. Did not like working for a license starbucks they are not professional and do not adhere to starbucks mission.
good,I love love love love Starbucks its a great place to work for college students .The company is always there to make sure you feel welcome and secure .However if you live in New York and can not work fast pace this is not the job for you the hours are there however after four hours the job is very draining
good,Great place to work  because you get to learn so many new drinks and it’s a great work environment. You also to have personal relationships with the people you see daily.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work, they worked with my schedule had great benefits! Plus you can move up with the company if you choose to! I would suggest working here to anyone!"
good,"went to school in Nashville, TN where I had to get a part-time job to pay the bills while in college. starbucks was located in the middle of Opry Mills Mall in Nashville. Starting the shift we would stock the kiosk as well as make sure that everything is clean; bring out everything that is needed for our shift as well as cash for the register; cups for the drinks, etc. When shift starts we will take orders, make drinks or distribute the purchased pastries to the customers as well as making sure that every order is handled at a reasonable time; when done with shift we make sure to clean and stock for the next day."
good,Starbucks is an amazing career opportunity if ever given the chance the company goes above and beyond for it's employees making each  employee feel as secure in their position as any employer ever could
good,When you work for Starbucks its more then just a job it is a family. the environment there is opening and welcoming to all. Management is always invested in pushing you to be better.
good,Its been an amazing time with starbucks i think the company is amazing they have some amazing benefits. They are very flexible with schedule and they are always open to promote within if your trying to move up
good,"Obviously the individual personalities of your co-workers will always be a big difference in the workplace environment.  However, the company training and stated goals are meant to create a positive and enjoyable work environment where every member/partner feels valued and appreciated.  I had some great management that worked to fix or remove any of the negative and petty employees and help create a really enjoyable workplace.  The location in a college town meant it was very busy but also very profitable and frankly, we all enjoyed our jobs and were always seeking to help each other grow in knowledge and ability.  If you don't like coffee or making frappucino then you shouldn't consider this job.  It is a great company, it will work to help its employees/partners, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a positive and motivated attitude."
good,I've been at Starbucks for two years and my store is very much like a home environment. There are some rough days but as a team we push through it. I love the manager and my coworkers.
good,"it's fun to learn more about coffee."
good,Loved the staff and environment. My manager was always available if I had any questions and the shift supervisors were excellent! The discount was decent and the pay as well
good,"Es de los.mejores trabajos que un estudiante puede tener, los horarios son flexibles, las prestaciones son muy buenas y el ambiente laboral es excelente."
good,"A typical day at starbucks with a drive thru. During the first peak of the day, it was stressful, quick paced, and you had to be ready for the customers. I learned how to deal with different types of customers and people for the public. My manager was very young and he knew how to do the schedule and schedule interviews well. The work place was very stressful and more business culture and not really a relaxing place to be. The hardest part of the job was remembering the dates and dealing with customers at the drive thru. The enjoyable part of the job was making the drinks and working with some of the employees."
good,great place to work . fun atmostphere. flexible dress code . awesome support.the benefits are awesome. starbucks is just an amazing company. i think it makes specialty retail special

good,"At Starbucks, you will be tested on your patience especially you are dealing with a lot of people everyday. Shifting schedules, Fast pace of promos being offered every quarter so you really need to study and familiarize yourself with the products. District Managers visits the store once a month and questions you all and the rate of your store will depend on the observation of the DM on how you follow certain protocols."
good,"Great first time job. Works well with scheduling needs, great benefits, and great coworkers. "
good,"Starbucks Gave me the ability too start college, built me up too be able to be responsible for my fellow partners working around me. Gave me the confidence to express myself and also push for our everyday motto that our company strives off of."
good,"I loved getting to see my regular customers, that job taught me how to handle difficult situations with customers really well. My manager and supervisors were really nice but stern people. The only hardest part of my job was when we would have to promote or learn new drinks, the lines.. I really liked my coworkers and the customers I got to know and chat with."
good,This is truly a great Company to work for.  They value everyone and i mean EVERYONE. No one is left behind. It’s is very fast paced and you have to keep up. I leaned a lot about making sure you do things right the first time. Things operate more smoothly.  The hardest part of the job is just getting into the swing of things. When you get into it then its easy.
good,"The barista job was fun and very personable, i had two take orders and make sure they felt comfortable.  i made drinks in a timely fashion with care of following the procedure to making them correctly."

good,An amazing thing about Starbucks is the collaborative environment offered during the workday. The flexibility to be yourself was an incredible encourager to work harder.
good,"Starbucks values customer service, customers is their number one priority. Health, safety, cleanliness, and preparation standards are strict, but you will come to realize that it makes the work day go by more smoothly, especially at peak hours. There's never a slow period where you have nothing to do, every 10 mins fresh coffee has to be made there's fresh milk to change every 2 hours etc. The hardest part of the job is usually only an issue on busy days when we have tasks that need to be done while we still try to achieve customer connections. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who share the same love for coffee and are able to deliver that to all coffee lovers. Making customer connections and meeting new people is what I love about my job. Starbucks is a team work environment."

I learned how to work well with an awesome team and to work fast and how to treat customers. Starbucks is huge on customer service and my specific team always got compliments. My specific store had one of the best management teams I personally have ever worked for. I'd say the hardest part of the job is if you are not used to working in a fast paced environment it may take you some time to get used to, especially with a morning shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was making regulars and learning how to make good coffee and working with a wonderful team."
good,Working at Starbucks was an absolute pleasure. Getting along with the employers was an absolute walk in the park and they were more than willing to help me if I had any questions in my first beginning days of working there.

The customers are very friendly and I have many customers that come to say hi to me. I recently had a few surgeries after having a complicated pregnancy, one surgery which was major. The company assured me that my job was secure while I recovered. I was also able to trace some of my shares to have a little extra money. I enjoy working here, and actually look forward to going to work each day."
good,"As a barista at Starbucks, it is your job to create a ""third place"" or home away from home for each customer. This is accomplished with impeccable customer service, keeping your store clean, connecting with each customer you meet, and making sure everything they order is made correctly to their specifications. Starbuck's management teams are phenomenal in most of the stores I've had the pleasure of working in. They ensure that the customer's are taken care of, and part of that happens by taking great care of the partners. You get free drinks while working, a free food item, and one mark out per week of a retail item such as a pound of coffee, box of instant refreshers, or even a box of Teavana tea! The environment is very fast paced, especially in stores with a drive thru, yet the atmosphere always remains calm so our customers can focus on their homework or meeting within the store. I love working for Starbucks! They truly care about their employees, and it shows every day."
good,"I worked part time with Starbucks and it was a grand adventure. Wonderful environment, great customers, fantastic memories. This is the perfect job for a young adult who is looking for supplemental income or benefits."

good,"do your job, have fun and its great."
good,"Awesome job! I live working there, customers and coworkers are the best. It really is the third place. The management is great, we have a great set of crew members that cooperate very well with each other and all go above and beyond for customer connections which are important."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at however i did not like my salary as a barista back then , it was very low . It was a lot of work and then you would get paid very low. it offers free college and it offers health benefits as well."
good,"Starbucks management is great.I learned communication is key, providing great customer service is what keeps a company strong, seeing your co-workers as you ""partners"" (because at the end of the day, they really are), working as a team, honesty, kindness, how to include all your partners and make them feel welcomed, and building relationships with customers."
good,"The work is fun but it is taxing. There is a lot of walking around, bending down, carrying 5 lb objects around etc. I would very much recommend this job to any college students as the culture is very student friendly."
good,Learned basic formula of making peoples favorite drink.Apart from i'm able to developed my interaction skills with customer and able to understand the criteria and rules to be great barista.

The hardest part of the job were the late night shifts, but only because I am more of a morning person. I LOVED coming home smelling like coffee grounds every day. You get to meet new people all the time, and you really get to know your regulars. You get a free drink for every break, a free food item for every five hours worked, and every week you get a free pound of coffee.

Los Gerentes de tienda se preocupan de sus trabajadores, capacitándolos en todas sus funciones o debilidades, para crear un buen equipo de trabajo."

The work place is so inspiring and challenging in a way that we meet a different level of rich people who is usually our costumers and guest.

On down times my associates and I kept ourselves busy by restocking or cleaning the store and making sure that guests were enjoying their overall experience. I don't recall there being any difficult tasks during my time as an employee. In my opinion, the most enjoyable part of my day was working with my associates and providing guests with the best customer service possible.

My team and I quickly developed a routine ensuring that the store ran smoothly and at the end of the day associates were eager to attend the next shift."

good,"Empresa impecavel, trabalharia lá novamente com toda certeza."

It was wonderful to become privy to all of the amazing experiences/knowledge this company has to offer. The manager I have had the pleasure to work with have been nothing short of professional, and possess an immeasurable passion. The diversity, and acceptance of who you are is incredible. It can become busy, and almost overwhelming. The dedication to teamwork ,when the pressure was on, came into fruition beautifully each time. If there was ever an issue, we solved it as a team.Giving back to the community nationally, and globally is a fantastic reality with Starbucks.I was able to bring my creativity/customer service skills,and was allowed to use my artistic abilities to create happy experiences for the every day people."

good,"Constantly working with diverse individuals from all over the area.

good,"Overall, the Starbucks environment as an employee has been outstanding. Though being the youngest employed has been a little rough. I brought it to the manager's attention that I've been harassed several times by a specific customer on the basis of racism due to the fact that I don't speak spanish. Though the only response and solution he offered was to learn to speak spanish and understand that not all customers are going to be nice."

Other employees are quick to assist you and everyone is part of a work family that is very close. The hardest part of the job is getting the training down and remembering how to make drinks as this could be difficult for some if it is not elaborated on in the training. Most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you are encouraged to make with your coworkers, everyone is supportive and fun to be around."

good,A typical day at work starts very early at 4am in which we all gather to make some coffee. Team work is a building block to the success of our teams. From there typically it will be time for inventory management on the list of my personal responsibilities along with ordering and waste control reports.

good,"While taking orders, the staff engage us in a friendly talk, probably sensing we are local tourists. They offer suggestions which places to visit and how to go there. Such warmth makes visitors feel hospitality at its best."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for and grow with. But if you don't stay focused on the goal at hand you will be left at the back of the line. Engaging customers and surpassing their needs - Taking orders and ringing up sales -Preparing and serving coffee and other drinks
good,"This employer was a generous and fair one. Benefits and discounts were very much appreciated by people of insufficient income and the social programs Starbucks supports very much match what needs to be done in the community for social and environmental welfare.

good,I do love Starbucks. There was a lot going on within upper management that I did not agree with and did not want to be part of that is why I chose to leave. I loved my customers and miss them dearly. I loved making drinks and just meeting new people all the time. I really loved Starbucks as a company that I would go back if I could find a great Starbucks to work for. Sadly I wasn't the only supervisor who left who felt the same way and it is really sad because that Starbucks lost a lot of amazing employees.

good,"Starbucks is a great place to constantly grow and learn. With new beverages, policies, and products you're constantly learning and building your skills as a barista. During your time as an employee, there is always room for growth and promotion. I've personally watched baristas turn into supervisors and I've watched supervisors become the manager. My time at Starbucks helped me build my customer service skills and helped me pick up my work pace. Hopefully, sometime in the near future, I'll be able to join the Starbucks family again."

Prepared and maintained food displays, coffee and assorted food."
good,A good first service industry job that's more interactive and involved with customers and other baristas than other jobs. Fast paced and demanding but fair and with good benefits.
good,"Working at starbucks was so much fun! They provide a very flexible work schedule, I'd work early mornings when it was the busiest but it was the only time i had free. Even when it was the busiest it was still so much fun. The only hard thing about working at Starbucks was when the customer was unsatisfied with their drink but as a barista it was your responsibility to make it right. Most of the time the customer would leave with a drink they loved. It was so awesome learning how to make all the different drinks and once you got in the groove of things, you didn't want to stop! I highly consider going back!"
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and learning how to make different kinds of drinks.  My manager, Saebom, was very nice and always helped me when I needed it."

It pushed me to grow in communication aspects of my life as well as provided me with many benefits. 401K, health care, dental, vision and well as investments into the company itself. I really hate to leave Starbucks but I am looking for a more professional work environment that will give me better skills for design and writing."

They will never add up to the people you meet, the awesome opportunities that will come your way and the lessons you will learn from many of people! Starbucks was my first job and I promise had I never work there, I would have never learned the things I know today that helped me get the job I have now.. Starbucks is a wonderful company with wonderful people and its an awesome place to work."
good,"a typical day at my store is pretty hectic but in the midst of it all, we all find time to have fun and crack a few jokes. so, even though it can get super busy and we're all stressed out, we're also having a blast at the same time."
good,"Starbucks is a leader in the customer service industry for a reason. The company has taught me to enhance the customer experience by connecting and making best moments with them. We build relationships with each customer that walks in the door. Along with exceptional customer service, Starbucks has taught me to multi-task in a high traffic environment, while remaining calm and collected. The most enjoyable part of the job is the partners who work there."
good,"This was the best job I've ever had as far as everyday job environment and benefits are concerned. There is ample room for advancement, the pay is good and competitive, management will work around your schedule if you are in school or have another job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the high volume of customers during peak hours. Since I've left they even offer sick pay and a free lunch while on shift."
good,I really enjoyed my time working here would love to work here again. my boss and coworkers were great. they worked around my school schedule.I loved coming into work everyday.
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks was us taking orders, making drinks and food, customer service, cleaning and any other small things we needed to do. I learned how to talk to customers when they re upset. The management varies from being amazing, to really bad. My store had a lot of different managers and 3 out the 5 were actually good ones. The hardest part of the job would be days that are the busiest and the most enjoyable part of the job would be the partners. The people that work at Starbucks are amazing, and they become not only your co-workers, but your family."
good,"Fast paced when there are new promotions out that the company offers. As a barista, we would have to memorize the ingredients that go into every drink. Also a very productive environment."
good,"When I was working at Starbucks, I have experienced so much. They have the best people who helps you to grow as an individual. They mold each one's character and attitude, They are not just a company but they they treat each other as a family. I just remembered last december, one of the company's head gave me a birthday letter because it;s my birthday"

good,"A typical day at Starbucks was always fun and fast paced. I learned how to use the register for taking orders, more information about their ingredients and drinks. Management was great i actually think for a small team we were very organized and handled things well. Starbucks culture is one of the best things about Starbucks because it's best known as a place for people to meet, network, and socialize. Which makes the perfect place for business meets. Trying to accept constructive criticism from others was somewhat the hardest part about working at Starbucks but it did not tear down my confidence i just learned to work harder. We had so many great customers and employees that made the highlight of my experience at Starbucks. They were always helpful and friendly, but this amongst so many other things is what kept me motivated and prepped for work each day."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was one of the best jobs of my life. Customers and co workers were great. Also the environment was very laid back and the fact that I love coffee helped
good,"Great place to work! Such a fun atmosphere and they make you feel so appreciated and valued. Get raises every 6 months, and can be easily promoted within. Free drinks while you work, 30% off when you're not working. Free 1lb bag of coffee or tea every week. Great health benefits, as well as other benefits (shares in the company, discounts with cellphone providers, movies, etc)"

good,A typical day at Starbucks is coming in on time ready to work always with a positive attitude and willing to learn something new everyday. My manager is always very understanding and very fair as well. Our work environment is very fast paced and we are always remaining occupied. The hardest part about working at Starbucks is probably the beginning its a lot to learn but nothing anyone can't handle. What I love most about working here is the people. We grew so close in so little time. And they made my experience here 1000 times better.
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks as it was fun and the hours were flexible. I met many others employed within the company in many different areas within the corporate office in my efforts to pursue advancement from within,The only negative thing I can say is that it was difficult to find emergency coverage as a supervisor."

good,"Starbucks goes above and beyond to make both their employees and customers feel at ease, at home, and cared about. Training is super in-depth, and although it is expected of you to be able to work quickly and efficiently and to deliver top notch service all the time, it doesn't seem at all unachievable. Starbucks made me passionate about delivering the best customer service possible and always made me feel like my opinions mattered."
good,I worked as a shift supervisor at Starbucks for 5 years and was ultimately working my way up to running  a high volume store as a store manager but between constant transfers to help struggling stores and constant dramatic schedule changes between stores became a little much but I learned alot about waste and inventory management as well as floor planning and employee scheduling and food projection.

good,great place to work ive worked at two different location and both location had the differences my first location was in the heart of the city on summer st Boston downtown. I all ways worked the 5AM shift and when the rush started it felt like never ended but that was my fav part of the day just because of the fast past environment. The second location was located at the chestnut hill mall loved working there as well because you got to learn all of the regular that came in. This was the place i was asked to become a manager when i was just working as a regular barista. i worked very hard and showed the manager at the time that i new everything there is to know about Starbucks. from teaching other how to mark cups and helping make drinks and teaching employ how to move when in fast past environment.

They give you booklets and papers to help you remember and everything is labeled.  It took me weeks to get it down and when I would mess up, my co-workers would tell me stories of when they started to make me feel better."

good,"Typically, we always have morning rushes. From six in the morning to  about noon, we stay constantly busy. Working for this company I have learned how to work quickly and effectively. I have learned to be patient. My manager was one of the hardest working individuals I have ever worked with. She gives 110 percent every day. My coworkers were very diverse people and that is what made our work environment fun. We are all different but we always work as a team. The hardest part about the job was when a coworker called out and didn't show up for work. When it is busy, being understaffed takes a toll on productivity because we can't go as fast or serve many customers as we would if we had all team members on the floor that were scheduled. The most enjoyable part about my job was the interactions with our loyal customers. Seeing our customers that came in every day for a cup of coffee happy and satisfied was the highlight of my day."

good,Starbucks is a fast paced job that requires a lot of hard work. In my 9 years with them I learned a lot about work ethic and teamwork. There is a lot of multitasking required for this job.
good,It was a nice place to work. I learned the art of making drinks and making the customers feel like they were in a second home as opposed to a store. The people I worked with and the customers were all nice and a pleasure to be around.
good,"Starbucks is a company that offers constant growing and learning opportunities. They always introduce new products, new systems, and fun ideas for advertisement that everyone got to be a part of. Their entire job is based around giving a a sense of welcoming and warmth to anyone who walks in their door. Managers work along side you on the floor so you are constantly supported and guided to giving the best experience possible for the customers. My absolute favorite part of working for Starbucks was the customers. We built long lasting relationships with them and even to this day I still go to my old stores just to see how their doing. Working here taught me how to be extremely transparent with everyone. The bond with my team and customers open my eyes and showed me how to be more understanding of people. Our motto was ""Make every moment right"" which we were able to demonstrate at any given point. If someone if having a bad day we were allowed to make the moment right by buying them their coffee. The only problem I had with this job was not getting enough hours. Even as a manager, hours were hard to get. It meant working at multiple stores each week which was difficult for my position as I was responsible for ordering and inventory."
good,"Before transferring to my nightmare store, I was working at a wonderful location in midtown, Manhattan.  Everyone was enthusiastic to work, loved working at Starbucks, friendly, and my manager was nearly perfect, and very driven to work.  He often worked with us on the floor.  The manager I had after transferring to a location in Union Square, it was a total nightmare from then on.  The customers didn’t come first, the manager never worked with us or interacted with us.  The partners were bullied.  The shift leads had their favorite, and the playbook (roles) never changed.  We were literally stuck doing the same role for the whole 8 hour shift.  Constant arguments with the customers, and the store was full of drama.  I quit on the spot without a two weeks notice because I had another four months to be able to transfer, but I’d rather die than continue working at that store.  Starbucks is an outstanding company to work for, it just depends on management whether or not you’d like working at your particular store."
good,love the job and the people manager is great and hours are good if you are full time love the free drinks and the company as a whole and hope to continue my journey and move up in the company
good,"Starbucks was not only fun, but rewarding.  There was on emphasis on customer service and community, while also offering the ability to learn, grow, and ultimately make Starbucks a lifelong career.  Management is engaged and involved, and the culture in consistent through the entire company.  They are flexible with school and personal life and provide and enriching environment for both customers and partners (employees).  You are encouraged to be yourself, and let your own personality add to the culture of the experience for your colleagues and patrons."

good,"Although I do not intend to stay at starbucks for the rest of my life, it is a wonderful job and gives me great comfort to have it. The ceo is generous in that he understands how important health care is and provides you with just that. I worked this job over the summers and during my college career and I would not trade this job for anything. My manager is very flexible and understanding of me as a student. Great company."
good,This is one job I would definitely work for again. I was not only taught about just the store front (day to day) but I got to learn alot about the company itself as well as the culture.
good,"Make beverages and expand knowledge of coffee, engage with customers about current issues, follow food and safety guidelines and adhere to all starbucks standards"
good,"I love to constantly move and this clearly was the perfect job. Being located right next to the Dunkin Donuts Center, the huge crowds would come through to get a drink and/or food before hand.

good,One of the best jobs I have ever had. you always have the ability to be yourself no matter what. They have great leadership and are their to support you
good,I would maintain a clean workspace at all times. I would make sure all the ingredients and pastries were well stocked so I wouldn't have to interrupt my orders. I learned to work under stress and not panic. The management was excellent. I was well informed and prepared for the position. I would say the hardest part of this job was making sure each drink was properly prepared. Starbucks has a little saying about how if you but a Starbucks beverage if it is properly prepared it should taste the same on the other side of the planet.
good,a great place to work and great requirement. i learned to make drink and met great people. the hardest part of the job was how busy it was all the time.

You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules)."

good,"Starbucks has been a great company for work for over the years. They care about their partners, customers, and business. As a Store Manager you are required to work forty hours a week and overtime is discouraged. The company really as a high focus on operational excellence. It is a very quick pace environment and things change every week so you need to be able to adapt to different situations quickly. I highly recommend working for this company. You follow a lot of roles and routines. Everything is based on  a system, everything down to brewing your regular cup of coffee. They have a third party that does audit around cleanliness which ensures managers really maintain their stores."

You get to make someone’s sucky day better"

good,"A typical day at Starbucks always started by hitting the ground running. Corporate and marketing always equipped us properly to run efficiently and proactively each and everyday and for every part of the day. I learned to be able to multi-manage certain systems of the store and understand the strengths and weaknesses of my staff. The workplace culture was an atmosphere of belonging with a combined work ethic. The hardest part of the job was only if someone called out sick or any other reason that would disrupt the flow of work but only for a moment until I, myself, as a manager would fill in. That is followed by the most enjoyable part of the job is that the rapport we build with customers and coworkers make the workplace very familial."
good,Starbucks was an excellent place to work. I had a lot of fun learning about coffee and tea. I made a lot of friends and met a lot of awesome customers along the way.
good,I work for Starbucks to many years. It is the best place I have ever worked at. They offer amazing opportunities for their partners. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,they can work on a few things as far as making sure that they increase their customer service more then regular everyday and having to many shift managers all on one shift is not good for business

good,"Muy buen clima laborar , muy dinamico donde se incentiva a crecer."

good,Great place to work really fast paced so time fly's by. Management is usually amazing I have worked at 3 different Starbucks and the one that I didn't like was in the college town of Clemson because the manager was a student and did not schedule people currently or order enough supplies.
good,"El ambiente laboral en Starbucks, fue bastante bueno."
good,fun place to work at. meet great customers and co-workers.
good,I loved the people and my co-workers.  The customers were nice and pleasant. Management was great. I learned how to meet and greet new people and how to deal with high-volumes of customers. The hardest part of my job was me learning to say no because I loved to work.

good,"El trabajo en equipo era lo más importante, ya que empezando por los partners con excelente actitud brindábamos un excelente atención al cliente."
good,Over my past 6 years at Starbucks I  have really enjoyed working for such a giving and loving company. They do so much for their employees no matter how big Starbucks continues to grow. I  have transferred to several stores over my years working with the company and I have always been welcomed with open arms. I   think its incredibly when each store no matter where you go operates the same and is held to the same accountability making it easy to stay working for the company while making changes in other aspects in life. I would highly encourage anyone to work here .
good,"To work at Starbucks gives you a second home and a second family. Starbucks has taught me leadership and has helped me grow as a person. Without working for Starbucks i wouldn’t have learned how to handle difficult situations such as; helping difficult customers, being able to diffuse a situation with high intensity between customers and our partners if they were to arise. The work environment is made to almost not feel like work, we try to make it a fun experience no matter how stressful the situation is. We have appreciation cards to show our gratuity to eachother. The whole Starbucks experience is to make every moment right."
good,"Un ambiente realmente agradable es trabajar en un equipo de Starbucks, pero la organización no fue del todo buena, bajan los sueldos de la nada y por otra parte exigen demasiada actividad fisica para todas las tareas que se desempeñan dia a dia."
good,Here I really found a strong drive for becoming capable through a passionate work ethic and focused team cooperation. I believe this is one of the best places to find your footing and begin exploring your success and productivity with a positive company and team holding your ground.
good,"Good place to work and grow with company and engaging community."
good,Gives back to community! Great benefits! Friendly environment staff and company love to please Custumers. Room to move up in company. Loads of oppurtunity
good,It's a job for kids fresh out of high school or going to college. Unless you want to move up in corporate then it's not a long time job. Nice pace and tips are included.
good,el ambiente laboral es muy jovial. Todos son personas muy alegres.
good,"Enjoyed working as a temporary job, learned a lot about coffee.  Can be a little demanding, but for the most part store is well staffed.  I had a good experience, but some people from other stores had other experience."
good,I loved working here. You will make a lot of tips everyday and pay very well. I worked at the one at the airport so I had many great experiences and met a lot of different people.
good,I've been here almost a year and a half. I love what I do. They pay me to go school. We stay busy and it can be crazy but the connections you make and the people you meet make it so much more better.
good,"I strongly enjoy interacting with coffee lovers like me! Memorization has always been a very strong trait for me, making this job even more amazing for me. After working with the company for a year and a half I have grown so much and also memorized many of our regular customer's orders. In the past I learned how to do invoices, train other baristas and work an opening as well as closing shifts. I am proud of all the knowledge and commitment I have for the company. I have enjoyed helping new baristas grow and learn all the drinks and how things are done in the Starbucks company. I really enjoyed how close the employees were at the location I work at, but sadly it was a licensed location and I would love nothing more than to expand into a corporate location and further my knowledge."
good,Face paced. There is a lot to learn about but you can learn quickly if you pay attention.There is a lot of room to work up in this company if you are loyal. I wish I could have stayed there longer but I had to relocate and I could not transfer.
good,"Honestly, this was the best company I had worked for in my career. It was great getting to reach out to people through coffee, and have friendly conversations with people of diverse backgrounds and different experiences. I have worked in 3 states, and all of which were none-the-less amazing."

good,My manager was one of those that actually cared about her employees. Was very lenient about sick days/family emergencies. Starbucks on the other hand is fast paced and very productive place to work but will teach you a lot about customer service.
good,"A day of work is when I come into the store and say ""Hello"" to my co-workers and greet customers about how their day was. Then I go right to work asking my manager what place they would like me to be present in such as making drinks, washing dishes, drive through orders, and or being a cashier. The work culture is great their is always a good diverse group of people that come in for you to talk to them and thats what I love the most about my job, meeting new costumers and expressing how good the Starbucks brand is. I learned many things through having this job which included the most important thing teamwork. This allowed us all to be positive and have a fun loving environment. The hardest park about my job was dealing with the amount of drinks to make, its a great learning process that taught me how to be fast while doing something correctly."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of prepping the café for a morning rush, having everything clean and ready to go. I learned the importance of time management in a high demanding workplace. The management for my location seemed to work well with there associates giving them the proper training and coaching when necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relations with all my customers and keeping a positive attitude for my coworkers to reflect on."

I enjoyed my costumers the most."

Hours range between open (4 am) to close (around 11 pm), so this is perfect for any college student looking to work flexible hours. The coffee culture naturally aims at college students and the perks and benefits are great. Can be fast-paced but one learns so much about customer service and team work. I recommend this job to any college student looking for a fun, flexible job."
good,"You work with amazing people, and get to meet even more amazing people that come in each day for their coffee. This was one of those jobs that I adored going into work and didn't mind staying later!

good,"There isn't a typical day at Starbucks!  There are always new customers to make sure have a wonderful experience, new drinks to learn how to make and always something to clean.  The hardest part is being on task and aware of what needs to be done next, as well as maintaining a positive attitude no matter what situations arise during the day.  The most enjoyable part is meeting new people, the friendships of co-workers and sharing my love of coffee with others."
good,My store is a very busy store. I learned how to learn and adapt quickly. The management was awesome and workplace morale was good.

good,The work schedule was very flexible and my manager was the best. My coworkers and manager were a joy to work with. The regular customers were the most enjoyable part of the job. I would work for Starbucks again. The worst part of the job was all the waste. Left over food that has not been bought but is still good should be given to those in need and the company should encourage the use of the coffee grounds in gardens to the community.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work and is full of opportunities!  And it is really nice to work for a structured place so you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.

good,"A typical day at work was very busy. I learned how to multitask and complete duties efficiently and in a timely manner. My manager was wonderful to work with and created an understanding and hard working environment for all of her employees. The hardest part of the job was learning how everything worked in a hectic environment with time commitments. However, this is what helped create my ability to pick up tasks at hand quickly.

At Starbuck I have learned how to make all kinds of coffee, teas and foods etc. management is awesome very helpful, the hardest part of the job was waking up at 4 am, and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing everyone's happy face when I would hand them there yummy coffee."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for and has many perks to it. The one thing that some don't realize though, is that depending on the store you work for, the experience changes. I have always really like the job, but I know plenty of others who couldn't thrive in a busy store. There are stores that are tremendously busy and that will affect how partners feel about the job. If you work with good partners who can excel in the busiest times of day than this job is incredible. When you work at a busy store with not so great partners, it makes the job difficult to handle. It's pretty much as simple as that."

good,"great place to work"
good,Great place to work awesome benefits the location i'm at has some wonderful partners. Best lot of people I've had the pleasure of working with. Pay was a bit below what i was looking for but the additional benefits at  a part time level more them make up for the lower end pay.

I also learned different values while working there because of the good traits that my co-employees show to me as well to the customers."

good,Management cares about work-life balance.

good,"Working as a barista and moving up to a shift supervisor I learned how communicate and lead a team effectively throughout my shifts.  My store is located across the street from a city college which most of our business comes from.  From 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. are our most busiest times during the week and being the supervisor during those times can be stressful if you don't know what your doing.  Being a shift supervisor requires quick thinking, flexibility and ability to delegate where your partners need to be on the floor or for any lunches or breaks effectively is key to getting through peak times.  This in my opinion is the hardest part of the job which is getting through those rushes.  When things start to slow down it is easier to connect with customers by getting to know little bits of information about them each day when they come in.  Furthermore, working with other partners on the floor can be fun and productive which is one of the reasons that motivate me to come to work everyday."

Every shift I learn more and more about connecting with customers in varies ways and developing a better understanding of how to present leadership with every shift I am assigned as Shift Lead. The work culture is nothing I have ever experience in any company where it is very professional, positive and communal. Its also very encouraging to know that majority of our customers are well known to us because of our customers daily visit in the car and drive thru.

good,"Some great, friendly service and big, delicious portions at a reasonable price? I'm sold. Would definitely come back, and I'm surprised I haven't been prior because I go to school right down the street. Be wary though - I did get a tummy ache shortly after but that's most likely because my body hasn't had healthy food in weeks because college stress is real"

good,Working at Starbucks has been such an amazing opportunity. Your coworkers truly become a family.

good,"This is a very fast paced job that teaches you all about who you are and what you're capable of. If you're shy, you won't be anymore. If you have little patience, you will learn to be patient. If your'e sensitive, you will learn not to take things personal. This rings true for just about all facets of a person. You have to be on your game."
good,"On atypical day I would be settling all the teas and coffee needed for the next hour, with this i would also be dealing with making drinks while other co-worlers were assigned to other positions on the floor to keep the flow and efficiently going. Many times it would get crazy but as long as we all worked as a team the job would get done. Its all teamwork and communication."
good,"During my stay at Starbucks, I have experienced many customers and many different types of coffee and merchandise. I was truly starting point to develop your social skills or show off your my fantastic inner customer service skills. The best part of it all was when you remember a customers drink and their reaction towards you."
good,"Coffee all day everyday. It is fun to find your dance behind the bar in making each handcrafted drink to company standards with speed, efficiency, and presentation. There were three breaks a day and the hardest part was timing those breaks with the rushes that would come through the door. Management was always fair and well organized to provide an enjoyable environment for employees and customers."
good,"I started working here when I was a senior in high school. Its a pain when your manager doesn't understand your schedule (usually they are) but some may not be. You get paid more than most minimum wage jobs, theres a lot of down time when its not busy, this would be in the afternoon or night time. Mornings are pretty packed. They don't hire based on race, religion, etc. This was my first job and it can get annoying when customers are impatient but I've been working for the company for a year and a half and the only reason I would quit is because people who got hired after me are being promoted. Plus you also get tips which are split amongst all baristas once a week!!"

good,"Not every store is as amazing as mine but the company as a whole gives you every opportunity to succeed or the opportunity to fix what is holding you back. The job is pretty much what you would expect, make coffee, be nice to un-caffeinated customers, keep everything clean and do your part to help the team function. You learn quickly how to talk to customers, how to multitask and how to function as a team. The hardest part about the job is how easily you can get stuck in a rut doing the same thing day in and day out. There is a reason you see people stay with the company for 10+ years. It's an easy enough job that has amazing benefits, really great staff, the company promotes within and helps it's partners grow."
good,"My typical day at work is like any typical day in a coffee shop. You have your peak hours, and you have your slow hours. It's always a good place to be, with enjoyable coworkers."

Great leadership starts at the top, and my general manager was amazing in every way.  Highly recommend working for Starbucks!"
good,"Spent much time dealing with the public. I learned a lot about time management. Most of the time I closed, so I needed to learn how to finish everything on time. I worked at two different stores. One store was very helpful, but the other one had very bad management. My fellow employees were very fun. The hardest part was having to deal with very impatient people."

good,You learn a lot of basic skills which help you out in any jobs you are looking for in fast food or customer service. They offer a lot of benefits which help out anyone.
good,There's alot more to learn about coffee than you think. Like for starters certain coffees pair with certain items. Like coffee with hints of cocoa pairs well with chocolate croissants.

I love my coworkers there and I have one of the best managers I have ever worked for. I've learned how to work well with others, keep up with cleaning tasks to stay above standards set by the company. I love the regulars that I see every single day, I love knowing their names enough about their lives to have conversations with them everyday about what is going on.

The work atmosphere was amazing all the managers and staff were so helpful and uplifting. The job was very fast paced but enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was how busy it was.

good,A typical day for me at Starbucks would be for my shift leader to put me on the bar to craft the beverages. I usually bar throughout my whole shift since I happen to be one of the most effective workers on bar. If I choose not to do so or I am switched I usually tend to housekeeping which means cleaning designated areas that have to be cleaned everyday at work.

I enjoy working at Starbucks franchise. it develop more of my skills in leadership and managerial experience which gain me confident  to run the store operation. it help me to booths my personality and more wide range of understanding not only to the people I work but also to handling the store operation.

It is great for students that live at home as the hours are pretty flexible and you receive some of the best benefits packages in the retail industry. I learned how to connect with people in the customer service realm. The managers were great and want to make you a better partner. The culture was good for the most part but I won't get into that. Hardest part of the job for me was going in super early in the morning, had to be there by 5:30am. I loved working here, the pay was ok and you received tips at the end of the week, not to mention the benefits again. If you are a student this is a great place to network for your future career as you can speak with people that have connections/roots in the professional workplace."

good,Working as a barista was challenging in the beginning but as soon as you get the basics down you will do fine. I think that the memorization was the harder aspect of this job. But overall the work load was large but worth it for the coworkers you meet and the people you see almost every morning.
good,I learned how to make coffee.  I would come in and greet my coworkers and we would have a exciting day.  The culture was great I worked with many different ethnicities.  The hardest part about the job was making sure you made the coffee how the customer wanted it.  The most enjoyable part was the tips.
good,A typical day at work was always entertaining seeing the different ways people like their drinks or pastries. You learn different combinations and at the airport got to see the difference in each cultures taste. Management was laid back as far as work performance and cleanliness as long as you do your job.The best part of the job would be getting to meet different people and being able to make someones day just by their drink. I wouldnt necessarily says there is a hard part but if i had to choose it would be when you first get hired and your trying to remember all the new codes for the different drinks.

Management wise its great i get along with my manager and all of my shift's i adore them and their work ethic , the hardest part of the job i would have to say is working on bar and having office orders which can be pretty intense and having to make them while making drive thru drinks but you just have to keep your cool and just get the drinks out as fast as you an on your own pace and finally the most enjoyable part at Starbucks for me are the people i work with they bring me so much joy and laughter and i wouldn't trade that for anything"

good,"I absolutely LOVED working at Starbucks. This has, so far, been my favorite job. Meeting new people. Working in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job was when i switched to the Mall kiosk when I moved to Atlanta. The space was smaller than i was used to but I  adapted to the change and rose to the occasion. The only thing bad i would have to say was that I did not make enough money. Living on my own in Atlanta, barely making $8.50 was unrealistic and hard on me mentally and financially. But overall, i give this company 5 STARS. 10 if I could."

good,"Always moving around, never stuck in one spot all day long. You're always learning new things every day from managers, coworkers and even customers on a daily basis. Management is always looking for new opportunities to put an employee in a new area they have no experience in to make them a more rounded worker in the environment. The hardest part of the job though would be the customer support position which is not really a job for you if you're a person who becomes easily stressed or has anxiety. It is a cycle where you would stock the store basically by yourself on a timer continuously for that period of time you are in that position. And the most enjoyable part would be making the beverages for customers and seeing their faces of excitement as we hand them the drink."

Generally, my shifts could start anywhere from 4am onwards, and would end anywhere up til midnight or so (later on nights we did sets for promotions and holiday), depending on what the particular store's hours were. There was no such thing as a set schedule, even as a store manager, and week to week, day to day, my hours would flip-flop. The worst were the nights when I'd ""clopen"" (close then open)."
good,"If I could go back to this job, I would. I regret quitting every single day. AMAZING benefits, amazing coworkers, amazing employers, amazing overall experience."

good,"A typical day at work involves creating a positive environment with my coworkers, because it helps us work well together and our customers will feed off that positive energy. It is comforting knowing that when I clock into a shift my team has set me up for success, which will make me want to set up the next crew clocking as well. Also, I enjoy the many experiences not only that I receive through working with my different coworkers, but as well as the various and diverse customers that walk through our door everyday. When we are making their coffee they enjoy a conversation with us and I am fortunate to hear about their lives, because here we are as total strangers having a conversation about a little piece of each others experiences that sometimes lead to a deep connections that you wouldn't expect when you are simply buying a cup of coffee. There are sometimes difficulties that can arise, just like anything else in this imperfect world we live in. For example, coworkers including myself can all have bad days outside of work, which can make it challenging to keep our personal emotions and hardships out of the workplace environment."

Corporate is very big on employee feedback; if you're having an issue and aren't getting support at the store level, corporate will step in if they need to to resolve it.

They strongly believe in home/work life balance. I LOVE the company and always will."

Starbucks has great partner perks and sure knows how to treat their employees."
good,"I've learned how to effectively communicate with my fellow coworker in order to maintain a mutual level of respect and dignity.

good,"As Howard Schultz took his first sip of Starbucks Sumatra coffee in Pike Place Market, Seattle, WA, an epiphany struck him like a bright bolt of lightning.... if this coffee shop could adopt a particular ideology, it could be the top coffee retailer and make multi-billions. That ideology, was simple: people. Starbucks is all about putting the customer first; cheery 'good morning's, asking ""How is your day going?"", and remembering customers' names... That is what keeps customers coming back to Starbucks. Keeping up with caring for customers, the company also cares for its partners. I love Starbucks because they focus on the people...put others first and you'll receive ten (or billion!) folds in return!"

good,I love working for Starbucks. The management is wonderful and is always willing to help you out when needed. It is a very busy environment to work in so there is always something to do.

good,Loved working at Starbucks! The staff was fun to work with and everyone worked together as a team to service the customers. It can get stressful if the 'rush' doesn't die down and lasts for most of the day. You are allowed to have free drinks while you are working but you cannot have them out 'on the floor' when you're working. You get to know the regular customers really well and it's always nice to see them when they come in.

good,"I have only been working a Starbucks for 2 weeks and am not even done with training so I do not know how helpful my review will be. A typical day at work is getting coffee then clocking in, washing hands and going to my assigned spot. I have learned how to make most of the drinks and how to make each guests' visit as memorable as possible. I have yet to work with my actual store manager but the place I trained at had amazing positive happy managers. The vibe I get from the workers is so accepting and laid back. Hardest part of the job is definitely the rushes. Most enjoyable part is getting to interact with customers, the benefits and of course the free drinks!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work! I love the environment, the partners involved, and the time spent on my improvement in the job.

Starbucks has set me up for the rest of my future endeavors and has taught me about communication and customer relationships that will never leave me. Starbuck's has also helped me as a student with having flexible hours and has also helped me with paying for school tuition with loans from my own 401k and easy to step process on to do so. This company has been nothing but an amazing experience as well as the people that work in it."
good,"Fun and outgoing environment. Plenty of benefits, and great for first time employment, and students. Extremely sympathetic and passionate coworkers. Scheduling allows for  me to continue with my extra curricular activities and schooling."
good,A typical day at Starbucks usually has a lot of rushes from having long lines of costumers waiting to get their coffee.One thing that I have learned from working at Starbucks is that by working together and communicating well with my co-workers we are able to complete our goals of obtaining a high level of customer satisfaction. I really enjoy the fact that we have regular costumers that come and visit us because we are not only selling coffee but we are also making customer connections by making new friends. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes costumers are mean and don't understand that we are doing the best we can to make them happy but the best thing one can do is to not let one bad costumer ruin the day because their are plenty of costumers that are really nice people and make the day much better.I have learned that I can work well while being under pressure and still have the time to greet someone with a smile.

good,"Great place to work! Great benefits and very wonderful working atmosphere. would love to be full time however it is not available so "
good,"Such a greater appreciation for food workers and just customer service workers in general. Great management. My store manager makes a great effort to remind us that she's not just our boss but, a barista as well that started from the bottom too and went/is going through all the same things we are in the workplace. You become family/good friends with your coworkers, you're all in this together. I learned just how much a genuine please and thank you can really positively impact a person's day and attitude. That goes for workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is when you are really busy and/or short staff and feeling very overwhelmed with tasks. Also being disrespected and treated rudely by customers whom assume that because we work in the fast food industry that we are uneducated or unprofessional."
good,"Starbucks was a relaxed and fun job. Not only did I love learning about the different beverages, I also loved working in the middle of the city and being around different types of people."

good,"A typical day at work consists of working together as a team to make drinks, and ensure our customers are treated with respect and appreciation, as well as dividing up different tasks for each barista to complete. I have learned to work with other people even during difficult situations such as a heavy rush during our peak hours and making the best out of a stressful situation especially when a person is unable to work.

Working here provides friendship along with a pleasant work environment."
good,"a typical day involves taking orders, preparing beverages, and constant cleaning. I learned a lot about costumer service. management is always willing to work with your school schedule. the workplace can get hectic with long lines and a packed store. the hardest part is having up to 10 beverages to prepare at once. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you started your costumers day off right with their morning cup of coffee."
good,"I love the benefits, stock, management, pay,coworkers. But I hate frappuccino! And that's why I left...... Sike nah I left my Starbucks cause management switch up like 4 times. An when you from a really awesome manager to just a cool manager then to dumb manager then to a wtf is this manager. You get tired of it. Starbucks beside the drinks taught me team work for a job. An how to deal with bullsh*t on the quickness. Also taught me on faking be considerate and humble when I'm not feeling it at the time. Taught me to always be respectful"
good,"Great starting job. This company is flexible with college student hours, great benefits and great staff and customer relationships. Would definitely recommend for high school and college students."

For a company to offer full benefits to those that are part time and pay for tuition at Arizona State is unheard of and keeps its staff loyal and happy.

But espresso coffee is one of those rare products where consistent 100% quality matters. Customers will walk past ten other competitors to get the best espresso, which is why this factor alone means you don't need the highly visible, most expensive location. So buy the best espresso coffee machine"
