bad,"The company as a whole may be a good company, but Supply Chain Department is toxic!  Management is VERY unprofessional, shows favoritism, and lacks the knowledge, and organizatoin to run a smooth, efficient, department.  This department has a very high turnover rate, and upper mangement should clean house!"
bad,"Denbury has had an annual RIF for the last 3 years which cut employee number by 10-20% each year. "
bad,"The Company was always going through changes, there was a lot of favoritism, nepotism, no basic structure, no unity within the company .people were put into leadership  roles with no"
bad,"I had several great years at Denbury.  I loved everything about my job and my company.  I was very dedicated for many years.  The changes in management made it so hard to know what was happening.  We went from being well informed to not knowing anything that was going on.  It was hard to trust our leaders at a time when we needed it the most.  I believe those in charge have a hard time with difficult conversations so they ignore them.  It is easy to lose respect for people that don't do what they say they are going to do."
good,"Very top heavy. The executives at this company make the bulk of the money. They will even take an increase in a down turn when main employees do not. Other than that, a good place to work."
good,This was only a temp Job. Not too much I can say about this company. I will say while working there I did enoy the atmosphere. Very relaxed palced to work
good,I had the ability to make decisions and create my own safety culture. Hardest part of job was dealing with my direct supervisor. Due to his lack of knowledge it made things difficult.
good,"Good people, top heavy, big disconnect between lower level employees and management. Stock is really low so lay offs were common and cutbacks at the expense of lower level employees."
good,"Fascinating work on very challenging properties - CO2 flood.  There are many great people at Denbury, but the work environment deteriorated with the oil price downturn."
good,I don't understand how this relates to the position I am applying for. I will keep typing and try to make it long enough for the system to accept.
good,"Good Company, poor management values, management is unorganized, vindictive, and highly stressed. they are quick to throw someone under the bus to make themselves look better."
good,Fun and challenging place to work. Very family oriented and willing to work with you. Always fun to see the kids faces when we were able to fix the rides.
good,"Depending on what department you work for will determine how much you enjoy your days at Denbury.  Overall it is a great company.  The building is lovely and the culture is upbeat. I learned a great deal about ""Corporate America"" while at Dendury  - information I will refer back on the rest of my working career.  The hardest part of my job was trying to balance getting a job done and making sure everyone was happy with the end result while staying on budget.  Most enjoyable part of my job was working with a great team during the move from Tennyson to the new buildings on Legacy."
good,"Hasting Field lease operator - worked for company for 6 ears."
good,Denbury was a great company to work for. The benefits were great and that made up for the difference in pay compared to offshore.
good,Great place to work but lacking severely in promotional opportunities in the I & E Field.
good,"I worked at Denbury for one year. The company had a great compensation program and benefits. The culture was good but leadership was not honest with employees about the state of the business and lied when it said it would be able to withstand the downturn in oil and not lay people off."
good,"My day consists of going to all of my lease locations and checking tank levels, inspect for leaks, and troubleshoot. This job requires you to solve problems when it is not exactly visible i.e. Our wells are 9,000 - 10,000 feet deep and are lifted by double action hydraulic pumps, but the well pressures aren't visible. So, we have to use other clues and experiences to find out the variable. We depend on our co-workers to keep our production up and at times increase it. The hardest part is not having the problem visible. The best part of the job is having great benefits for me and my family."
good,"Work four 9 hours day and one 4 hour Fridays."
good,"A typical day at work with Denbury would begin with making calls to drilling rigs at approximately 6am, then taking and quality-checking operations reports that were sent in electronically. Denbury is a good place to work and is a supportive environment for engineers to work closely with other professionals and to add value.  My professional experience was appreciated there and there were many opportunities to positively affect projects from the start and to see them through to fruition.  I believe management is sound and has a good focused vision for the company.  Depressed prices in oil and gas were the only limiting factors for this company and its employees."
good,Denbury was a fun and friendly and laid back place to work. Coworkers are very friendly and everyone seemed to be generally happy.  I was there for almost 7 years before layoffs due to the economy.
good,"Denbury at the time I worked there was a business active work place..there was a learning experience everyday you work from oil spill clean up laying gas and oil lines,replacing busted lines,and finding old lines...."
good,"During my time at DNR the company grew at a rapid pace.  This was very exciting to be a part of and challenging at the same time.  I had the pleasure of working with one of the highest performing teams within the IT group.  We completed projects on time and under budget, had amazing chemistry, and everyone always found ways to improve."
good,"Day to day operations include, pigging, one calls, aerials, 3rd party excavations. Good co-workers. Typical management"
good,"Fun place to work, great work/life balance"
good,Fast-paced and challenging environment; great working relationships with co-workers; excellent teamwork; job safety was a key factor for all employees; some jobs could be made difficult due to weather conditions (oilfield work); enjoyed the teamwork and company incentives.
good,Love it. Great place to work at. Schedule is a little hectic. Most of your social life outside of work is limited depending on which shift you work on.
good,"Denbury was a great company the first 5 yrs I worked there. Leadership changed, and the company started a downward spiral. A employee focused company, quickly became a numbers driven company."
good,"I enjoyed the culture and working at Denbury. Overall it was a great place to work, with high integrity and good ethics. It was competitive & healthy."
good,"Great place to work.  Salary and benefits were really good.  It is a very fast paced environment work wise, but very casual culture as far and dress, punctuality, etc."
good,Immediate Supervisor had a drinking problem. He broke company policy everyday I was there.  I left when he lied about me. Cost me everything financial
good,Denbury is a great company that cares about its employees overall. Great work/life balance!
good,Enjoyed my time there and my coworkers. Good learning environment and people to help. Manager was easy and friendly to get along with. People were willing to help and teach if you did not know something.
good,Play hard and work hard we all worked together very well and we played well we lived together one week on and one week at home we cooked together every night at work
good,Denbury treated me fairly and was an amazing company to work for. When the oil and gas industry began having troubles Denbury held on strong for its employees. I was laid off due to a forced down size of the company due to the oil prices. Denbury was a great place to work for
good,"Even with the volatility of the oil industry, Denbury has dedicated themselves to a great culture, which in turn produces productive employees.  I'd recommend the company to anyone."
good,Denbury's upper management is great to work with. Your input regarding day to day operations is highly regarded. You are allowed the flexibility to make decisions & suggestions. Safety is job priority.
good,This is by far the best company I have ever worked for. It has great benefits and getting time off is very easy. You don't have to beg your employer for time off.
good,I really miss working for this company. Great people from coworkers all the way to management to the CEO. I would definitely recommend working for this company.
good,Great work place to be in. Positive environment and management had a great impact on my career. Typical day at work was enjoyable. Great culture. Wasn't very hard place.
good,One of the best jobs of my life.  They had excellent CO2 supply and good oil fields.  Allowed me to perform miscible reservoir simulation studies and pay was excellent.
