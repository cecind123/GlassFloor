bad,Several of my coworkers would use vulgar language at other employees and in front of customers.  They were making the facility a hostile working environment.  The general manager needs to be investigated by corporate.  There is a lot favoritism that goes on.
bad,The management is all about telling everyone's business to other employees. If you call corporate they sure do retaliate. They make up stupid rules that nobody follows. They lie about things to save their own skin. They blind eye drug deals and drunk employees and theft. Cashiers drink on the job. Managers sleep with other managers. Disgusting
bad,Dont work here you will get fired for something you didnt do. The boss doesn't listen to nor cares about you as long as you do you your job and that's it.
bad,"Used to work for this company a few years back and came back being told the company was now starting techs out at 13/hr. I was like cool the company is starting to show value to their employees considering we have to supply all of our own tools, etc etc. Never at any point did they mention oh after the training period that you have to go through since youve been gone so long, that your pay drops to 10.50/hr. wow. really. management has no idea what they are doing and techs burn down trucks in the shop. Still have yet to get uniforms. The shop cannot operate because equipment doesnt work properly and is a safety risk. They lose sales because nothing works and no one knows what they are doing. Drivers should not be using this location, even for oil changes."
bad,Don’t work here  it’s a bad place to work  josh the gm is rude to about everyone sends people home for no reason and you’ll be lucky to get over 30 hours a week
bad,"Not enough hours, not enough pay, no benefits, and a typically dramatic work environment that doesn't do much to nurture their employees. It's passable if you're desperate."
bad,"They pay on the gender gap equation to a tee. I did the math with real facts. The GM in the shop accepts no responsibility for anything. The only thing he ever says is “that’s not my job”  Handles problems by basically throwing a grenade in it, and it’s everyone’s else’s responsibility to fix it. That’s a manager not a leader. Leaders are part of the solution, and not above it."
bad,"I can sum it up in one sentence: Management doesn't care about you. All they want is a body to do the work. If you need a little understanding or you need paperwork filled out, you won't get it."
bad,Was rehired as my old position which was a fuel cashier/CSR2. Waited almost 2 weeks before i could start and when he finally said i could come in he changed my position to deli clerk without even talking to me about it. Was stuck on the 4am -12 shift and a majority of the time i worked alone until around 8 or 9. Never posted the schedule so i had to always ask when my next shift was and was expected to do a 3 person job by myself.
bad,"No Lunch Breaks & Poor Management The GM Is Very Childish,The Employees Are Lazy & Disrespectful, Slow Customer Service,Don't Get Lunch Bteaks,No Days"
bad,"Forced shift changes "
bad,I like my job the managers was not good of doing they job they talk about you Among them selfs and othere employees they are not compassionate about what going on with other people but they own
bad,"I left the first time because I couldn’t work 50 hours a week with a newborn baby. I went back almost a year later, I just became the go-to person when someone called in, which was all the time. I left the second time for health code violations and drama in the management. Customers are low end truck drivers with no respect."
bad,This place is a joke...Management sucks poorly...Shower systems been down for a month.They treat employees like crash dummies...The store sales expired food and drinks...
bad,Manager is terrible. She likes to sexually harrass the employees. She pulls them into the office and gives them an ultimatum. If you don't comply your life is made bad.
bad,I would live on the streets before I when't back to that mess they call work bosses don't care about nothing but there bonuses that's why you won't get a raise cause that come out of the bonus and if they get busted by there bigger boss they will just blame it on well my team of people suck only why to make it there is to walk around with a brown nose and your good tell they throw you under thebus
bad,They treat you like a thief always watching your every move make you feel like your not trusted they dont train you properly and if you dont stay up to there level your trash but they dont train you so you look like an idiot when you start working on your own and they belittle you
bad,"I would never work here again over chage the truckers"
bad,Hostile work environment with horrible management who can't produce a proper schedule let alone an edible menu! Place was dirty and filled with just as dirty people. Stay far away from this place. Evil people work here.
bad,"It wasn't a bad place to work. But do NOT ever think you will ever move up with this company. It takes 18 months to do your MIT and that's ONLY if the GM feels that you are worthy. So, if you aren't, you're stuck wiping counters and stocking cigarettes."
bad,Place sucks!! Management don't get me started there the worst!! Very rude never talk good only down to employees make them feel like worse than trash never give raises or move u up ever
bad,"Management was not the best. They would not listen to a word someone had to say, they would not stop the harassment instead they would switch you to a diffrent shift that they knew you could not do. Over all it was one of the worse experiences ive ever had job related."
bad,The management is absolutely awful. Serving is the only time you make decent money but it isn’t worth the drama. Not one issue is ever resolved. This place is not worth it.
bad,"Manager at the fuel center does not care about anything but smoking and playing games on her phone, Deli supervisor is a 50 year old woman who still gossips about people like she is in high school. Abusive customers will be the norm for you here, and management will do nothing about it except threaten to fire you if you complain."
bad,Good place but poor management. To many rules and procedures to follow made up by someone who works behind a desk all day. Many polices are unpractical and take money out the technicians pocket
bad,"Management is worthless, paid big $$ to fail. Rich @ Columbia is spineless , some techs are cry babies while others take the PM jobs and abuse. The best thing they can do is fire the crew. Once the District idiot got fired for stealing it was open season to be lazy"
bad,"Sucks"
bad,Horrible work environment. Management doesnt do there jobs. Raises are terrible. Couldnt even supply me an exxon coat that zipped and i worked outside in all weather conditions. I wouldn't recommend working there
bad,"If you want to work your tail off and get treated like nothing, this is the place for you! The management is never consistent and they don't want to train. the pay is never good and you have to deal with truckers talking to you like you're a piece of meat. ridiculous."
bad,Horrible management.  Under staffed due to poor management. management does not care or do there job or handle issues when brought to them.  Mostly every peice of equipment is either broken or not in proper working condition.  Job is 100% a joke.
bad,"Management doesn’t care about their employees. The drama is disgusting. You do so much for this company and they just look down on you. Everything is overpriced. If management cared, it would be a great place to work. It’s so sad how they could care less about customers or their employees even after everything they do for this Company. I can’t stress enough how much I wold advise people to not get a job st TA unless they like being treated horrible and kicked to the curb after management thinks  they don’t need you anymore."
bad,"Honestly I was here for several Years. The manager that came in to Perrysburg ohio location hired people based on their looks. He has horrible job ethics. He enforced rules for some but not others, and if you take it to higher up management they look the other way. Cashiers pull outdated products off the shelfs and he has you put it back on the shelf for full price. there was things that i pulled off the shelf that were over 2 yrs outdated. If it has a clearance tag look at the dates and such as to why. Usually its way outdated. Look at dates on food there period. They either clearance it or sell it to you half price. The manger makes others do his job for him while he does didly squat. I would never recommend this place to anyone unless you like to be harrassed or retaliated against if you do say anything to higher up management"
bad,"The company encourages unsafe work environments whose ""Whistleblower"" ears will use an apathetic and lazy approach in reporting and handling. Unconfidential are these lines as Management stated ""everything you say to HR is told to us anyway."" Even high disorganization abounds in HR as I was terminated for the reason ""because of your dissatisfaction and our inability to satisfy, we are cutting ties."""
bad,No room for advancement the management does not do anything if there is a problem They allowed bullying by an employee who was not management acted as if was and nothing was ever done.
bad,3 managers to do ones job. while i had no hours. insufferable customers and worse coworkers. really its not a good corporate culture they created and a worse environment.
bad,"In the 6 years I was there they went through about 8 general managers and I believe 3 in the service dept. Obviously management has no idea what they were doing but were very quick to tell you how to do your job. The company rarely promotes from within they prefer to hire random managers out of the blue. Corporate is useless and taking to them about issues at the site will get you fired. A lot of favoritism and bullying, my manager wrote me up for not writing a false statement that would have helped him deny a recently fired employee his unemployment benefits. Stay away!!! You aren't this desperate for money!!!"
bad,I worked there 6 1/2 years ago and just recently went back and then they called and said I’m not allowed to be rehired! They say they tried to get it over turned and they would t over turn it. So I worked two days and they said I’m not allowed
bad,Large amounts of poor quality food for truck drivers and travelers. Served buffet style 24 hours a day.Staffing was poor due to locations. Poor working condition.
bad,"This job is VERY cut-throat, & competitive.  The flat rate for a PM A was only $20.00 per PM.  It takes an average of 2.5 hours to conduct a thorough PM.  Ultimately you can only do about 2-3 PMs per night.  Paperwork is constantly shifted around to where you will get the low paying jobs, and when you call them out on it, you get written up.  I will never work at a TA or Petro again regardless of what they claim they would pay me.  They offered a 44% commission if you are ASE Master Certified (as I was/am) and they never lived up to that promise."
bad,The resteraunt is poorly managed and he creates a hostile work environment. The atmosphere is one of total lack of respect. Short staffed almost always.
bad,I was generally working back to back double shifts because of no call/no shows or hung over employees. Customers and a couple of the other employees were the only things that made me stay as long as I did.
bad,"The head manager was very unprofessional, mean, and always gave an attitude. I wouldn't recommend working there since its alot of cry baby managers working there on crack."
bad,This is a horrible place to work for. The upper management has lost touch with the working force to maintain a positive environment for employees or its customers.
bad,"I was suppose to get off work at midnight. The next shift never showed up. I called my manager snd she cursed me. If she would've asked, I would have stayed. She was really rude and have a I don't care attitude about her. "
bad,"when i worked there, there wasnt any good management and lack of responsibilities. they moved me around a lot and never gave me set positions. Turned out i got laid off due to my hearing impaired."
bad,"Cover extra shifts when people do no call no show.Very long late hours lots of inventory ordering and control. Stocking deposits bookwork. Run pay point, janitorial work as needed"
bad,The pay is not good enough you only get 1 15 break I hated it when I worked here Customers are rude employees are rude I didn’t like it at all The pay is 8.50
bad,"I would not recommend working here.  They change shirts at least four times a year and you are required to buy them for $20 to $25 per shirt.  They are never reused. No uniforms provided. Food comes out of the kitchen slow and it is often not up to standards.  It is a tense place to work in.  Three managers quit in a period of one month.  It is a trickle down effect.  You are required to sign up for a meal plan that takes $3 a shift out of your check.  The choices are limited and they get tiring after a few weeks.  If the cashier or prep person calls off they pick a server to put in that less paying position and you have to move into it  or be written up, you have no choice. It cab happen more than once in a week.  Also servers are required to prep and set up the salad bar once a week. Once again a lower paying shift.  You do server for an hour or so, then you are cut to go in the pack and prep salad bar for the night shift.  Hated doing this."
bad,"waste of time, boring, needed career advancement, not enough money, no benefits, temporary contract work, hiring recruiter............................"
bad,"This is not a good company.  They do not care for their employees.  All truckers should boycott all TA's.  Maybe if upper management has to live at our level of income, maybe an just maybe,  they wouldn't be lining their pockets so heavily.  Really, how much money do they have to have, we're the backbone of TA not them."
bad,Dont work TA Greenland NH treat staff like their stuped and dont matter GM creates drama and shift battles. GM steals money from servers when the drops are over when it should go back to servers considering its their tip money. Treats staff like they dont matter when your nothing with out the people around you.
bad,"One particular manager hated me and seemed like he was out to get me he made me feel as if i didn’t know what i was doing, and rude even the simplist questions when i first started he was rude and not very managerial like at all"
bad,"Management made things very stressful for employees, everything was cutthroat and no one wanted to listen to anyone. employees were treated like slaves without compensation"
bad,"One of the worst job I ever had! Hard to do your job when your surrounded by lazy and inept coworkers. Work conditions are unfair, rules apply to some but not to others. Management should stop with the favoritism and treat all employees equally and do their JOB."
bad,Honestly I didn't like working here. There were too many customers complaints and there is really only so much a waitress can do. I just didn't want my name associated with the place anymore!
bad,"The manager didn't manage. You handled problems on your own. It didn't matter what the issue was weather it be an employee or a customer, You dealt with the issue your self. The manager was never there. He was fired so it may be different, however it is unlikely."
bad,Have trainong on registers and lotto. They dont train u well enoigh.  Just throw u out there and its sink or swim. Management alos needs to b more respectful of associates and deal with customer issues not let the emplyees just deal with it
bad,I worked at the corporate-  not worth the stress at all-  they pay you 15 dollars an hour to literally make your life miserable.  the manager is a complete pervert- and they are racist.
bad,"Travel Centers of America is a terrible place to work at. You’re overworked,  underpaid, and underappreciated. The management is the worst part. They're rude, incompetent, and unmotivated."
bad,I would never work for this company again. Not after all the back stabbing going on since the new general manager came on board. I don't think this company is good to work for.
bad,Management is horrible! Biased and terrible place to work. Nepotism and favoritism abound! They could care less about loyalty or length of employment. Constant turnover and it's who you know not what you know. No raises. No reviews. No breaks.
bad,"Bad place to work, forced to take lunches that u work through, pay isn't bad if u get the hrs and make commission. Other wise ur screwed. Nothing changes, corporate and managers are in it for them selves. Only favorites get away with things. No promotions or pay raises. Overworked and under paid. No appreciation and to leinient."
bad,There is a revolving door on management and employees. Benefits are expensive and yearly biometric screenings that are unreal to obtain unless you are a pro athlete. Work most holidays and the commission scale isawful
bad,This company is awful to work for...no promotion no raise...management is terrible...great co-workers but overall terrible company to work for.dont treat employees good.dont give employees no training.management dont handle situationa properly...a lot of misleading information....just horrible
bad,"I worked in the Westlake RoadSquad.  The new management especially the head lady is terrible, DOESN’T care about her true good people & just wipes staff."
bad,"DO NOT APPLY HERE.  No details given in application page.  Asks you to fill out lots of personal information including a SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  For a company that doesn't give you any details on what, where, and even who you are working for as the hosting company is not the one asking for your personal information."
bad,"Almost 7 years at this company. Gave them almost seven years of honest, reliable and dedicated work. Passed over for promotion twice with no explanation. "
bad,"Manager changes clock in/out times, is a pushover, lets employees walk all over, lives for drama. nothing seems to ever work or get fixed when its broken."
bad,Was released from my position for simply following the managers orders. She than in turn blamed me for an employee giving his 2 week notice off of her statement. When I filed for unemployment they quickly disputed but I had evidence of her toxic behavior and the accusations made by her in which she blamed me for an in turn released me from my duties. I would not suggest this company to anyone as it is corporate company that thinks the laws in Ohio (location of main office) are valid in all other states and when you have an issue they simply will not listen and their managers are always right even when you supply photos of texts showing you did nothing.
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. It is right up there with walmart. They do not put their employees first. They do not care about customers happiness they just want money by any means necessary. The management can not keep their hands to themselves and corporate would not help.
bad,I was fired because I tried switching days so I could attend the funeral of my uncle. How unsympathetic can a person be to fire someone over this... horrible management!!
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company i work with them for almost 4 years and managment told bad things about m they are out for them selfs an nobody else
bad,"The lack of employee worth to the Company was outweighed by the bottom line profit. In the course of my employement with the company. I was stabbed in a robbery, The lack of security of the staff was not there and the security measures that were asked to be fixed before the robbery were not due to budget cost. And even after the event still weren't."
bad,bad management and bad crews. i did a lot of on job learning or got all the jobs nobody else wanted to do. people had bad attitudes there and it was not a very friendly environment.
bad,"Employees constantly engaging in drama, nobody wants to do"
bad,"it was hard work, fast paced but it was alot to learn and very easy to do once you learned how to do it, i liked who i worked with and the truckers were nice"
bad,"Travel Centers of America is a very fast paced place of employment and I like that part of the job, however it was short staffed the entire time I worked there which made the work load much harder.  It was definitely a stepping stone."
bad,It was an awful job; it was very stressful and a very drama filled work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet the food safety expectations when the manager didn't care for them.
bad,"worst place i have ever worked, techs dont care, management doesnt care.  they take money out of you paycheck for drinks then make you buy the drinks."
bad,"The worst place in the world to work they overcharge there customers for aercice and underpay there employees "
bad,I couldn't afford the benefits. I did above my job duties and yet another worker that did  none of their job duties got a better raise. I felt unappreciated. And it hurt me bc I gave all I could to be a team player and all that hard work and effort was waisted on ppl who didn't care in the first place. Listened to all the employees who didn't want to do what was required of them on a constant basis. Most of the workers complained about doing their job which made my job hard to manage getting through the day. Was happy to get away from the negativity.
bad,"Cashier at the front desk was the worst job ever! The managers didnt help with anything and were very rude. We got accused of stealing produts all the time and when they would watch the videos and see we didnt steal anything, we wouldnt get an apology.. worst place to work."
bad,Was expected ro know how to do everything first day out of training. Was accused of stealing tips and not running food. Not true. Got in trouble for not remembering how to do everything I walked out. Dont work at rhe Brooklyn Iowa restaurant. Always hiring there reasons for this
bad,This use to be a good place to work but now it's horrible nobody shows up for not even the General Manager and the moral is horrible. The service writer can show up to do there jobs but without a technician on the shift it's impossible to do your job.
bad,"It may just be the site I worked at, but the schedules were NEVER consistent, they could NOT retain employees for the life of them, teamwork was a foreign concept, and the manager was insufferable."
bad,would not recommend working for this company managers take things and blame on employees and accuse employees of things they didn't do and lie about employees when they know they didn't do it
bad,Has to much money in the registers Management do not know what they are doing. Most enjoyable about the job is all the different personalities you will encounter.
bad,Hard on employees always have there favorites don't follow through with things to make sure there employers are being taken care of
bad,complete jerks with no knowledge and skills. management did not care for the employees at all. hostile work environment. general lack for personal saftey.
bad,"I worked here for three months. I made $10.50 an hour plus commission, but commission only if you made the company over $3k in labor. Which is hard to do, when the Service Advisors cut time due to drivers throwing fits or companies throwing fits for inconvenience. "
bad,"in my honest opinion, I would not advise anyone to apply here. Management will make you believe there is room for advancement, when in reality, they will just hire more part time people, leaving other people in the dark basically. I have worked there a year and have asked repeatedly for something else, and each time is another excuse as to why they won't move me up. "
bad,Management is very two faced and only concerned about themselves. They make promises of advancement but do not follow through even after years of hard work and dedication! Benefits are available but are extremely expensive and not very good. The corporation is more worried about their money instead of their customers. Just one of the worst corporate businesses to work for.
bad,"The managers have no sense of accountability for their treatment of staff.  Always trying to pass the buck and when something big finally gets goes wrong they look for the easiest (escape-goat) person to blame without proof to cover themselves. "
bad,"Horrible company, and what is worse is you are never appreciated for what you contribute."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. They do not care about any of their staff, from management down to the porters."
bad,Thought stepping out if factory to this would be better. Just to realize the people and mangers are just as much Of a joke.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend TA Travel Centers to my worst enemy. The pay and hours will kill you, the benefits are non-existant, and the overall morale of the employees is that they're only there until something better is found"
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work here as a diesel mechanic. No management what so ever. The two managers there are very close with ""specific"" workers and if anything is done outside of the books, nothing will ever get done about it. The place is dirty in any aspect you want to take it. If you try to contact the district manager you will get nowhere because he is in on everything with the two managers that run the place. It's a complete mess. I would also like to add the office there is used for inappropriate activities with the TSA girls they hire (except for one that's been there long term). If you're looking for a place to work with other grown ups, then this is not your place."
bad,Management is horrible and the staff their are rude and only care about themselves. And they work you like a dog. The hardest part of the job is that they have one person doing a three man job. The most  enjoyable part of the job was when I got to leave.
bad,"While I can't speak for every TA, the one that I worked in was horrible. The employees had their ups and downs and they were especially rude to the night shift crew. Management wouldn't enforce chain of command. Products were always going empty which resulted in very angry customers. The daily job tasks were unorganized and some are very time consuming. (A much more efficient way could have been used when counting DVDs, Cigarettes, and CDs.) "
bad,i liked working wioth the people just did not like the bosses they were  never there and always leaving money out of your drawers and making everyones drawers short.
bad,"Easily the worst job I ever had!  Unless you were the manager's personal buddy you got treated worse than a slave.  No amount of hard work or going above and beyond the duties or willingness to compromise made the slightest bit of difference.  That place was ruining my health! Coworkers who didn't show up and having to cover for them-- backbreaking, and they were still scheduled despite laziness and unreliability.  Certain people just refused to work."
bad,"I love it all. I love a good day I do not want to."
bad,Management was not remotely good.  Nepotism at its finest.  A lot of truckers constantly hitting on you and being forced to smile and wave.
bad,"A lot of slow dead time, very unorganized. "
bad,"They don't give you enough hours, everyone I worked with hates it, hates management."
bad,The best part of this job was the customers.  I thoroughly enjoyed talking and understanding their jobs and needs.  The most disappointing thing about this job was the management.  They were all harsh and threatening continuously.  I kept the job because of the customers and the convience.
bad,"not enough commission oportunities./some work experience obtained performing tasks not done before,.regarding components changed on trucks/trailers."
bad,It is not a family oriented company to work for in the least.There is an issue with drug use by coworkers and corporate nor management is willing to address it.There is alot of misconduct in the work place and it is not a very structured work enviroment.The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and performing the duties that the job entails.I very much loved the job until I began to really take notice of how little concern there is for the employees and the work enviroment they are creating.
bad,the business was ok
bad,i learn a little and some days stand around do no work and had been move from 1 shift ti 3 shift can't make money had to pay bill this company don't care about you
bad,This was a great job but it was a horrible company to work for!!!
bad,I did not care for this job but I did what I had to do to take care of my family.
bad,The management is inappropriate and completely disorganized.
bad,"it sdounds good but its not dont like it keep trying to make it better by advancing, just getting worse"
bad,in the interview I was told I would be making between 15-25 dollars
bad,Do not work at the Troutdale location unless you can handle a high amount of stress/harassment/hostile work environment.
bad,"Inventory is a joke."
bad,Shop 0255 has the worst Management if your in the family click your job is safe. If you start to figure out what's going on with the manager your out!!!
bad,"The entire work culture here is besought with Social Loafing due to non-motivated management leaving a small group of good employees to perform all task induced labor that is not accounted for as all management sees is the ""work is done"""
bad,I worked there almost four years and they have different levels that you have to do to move up and get a pay raise. I did all my classes and videos and they still only give you a raise if they want too. The general manager there didn't wanna do his job and tell people what to do and tell them when they were doing wrong so he made other people do it. All that matters in the shop is the mechanics. If you were a TSA they didn't wanna hear anything that you had on your mind.
bad,I liked the customers and the work! I didn't like the management because they will schedule you on days that you tell them you can not work! The management team will tell you not to do something then turn around and get on to you for not doing it!
bad,"Dispatching, very fast paced environment. No lunch breaks and holidays are required. You have to work your way up to get a morning shift but other than that its ok"
bad,Worst job I have had. Work in shop for my shift then have to do road calls for the next shift of the day. Used old tools for road calls. Forced to work and train new employs making more than me. Vet in trouble if u don't have your training on computer done but work whole time so u can't. No lunch brake but forced to clock off and still work. Half time i was only tech in shop and doing 3 jobs.
bad,Poor quality labor due to drugs afflicted technicians. Manager doesn't seems to care at all. Many customers pointed out that some of the technicians appear to be high but still no action.
bad,"Extremely inflexible management, poor salaries. High theft locations, and high stress enviorment. Quick turnover rates, and almost no commendation. Will bend labor laws if you aren't knowledgeable."
bad,"No one listens to you as an employee, management doesnt really care what happens. should be payed more for dealing with managers alone, not including the terrible attitudes the customers have. pretty much just an annoying place."
bad,"Horrible managers.do not go to work there Period!!!!! GM takes certification tests for employees, meaning techs who work on your truck probably do not have any experience in the repair your truck needs. Very poor work."
bad,General Manager does not care for anyone except himself. Likes to write up employees for any small thing and will figure out away to fire an employee without the employees notice
bad,"The general manager for the shop is a great guy, but so busy he leaves the managing of the shop to idiots. Basically, if you don't kiss sub-managements hind quarters, they do their best to get you fired. Hostile work environment"
bad,this was the worst place ive ever worked. not because of the people. because of all the drama. and on top of it all are manager was a meth addict who didn't know how to run a restaurant
bad,"Working as a tech you are managed by a person who has no clue how to do you job but will tell you how to do it and you have to do it their way. Place is totally disorganized, employes that are responsible for completing the services customers pay for are treated poorly by managers who soak up the ac and are horrible at their own jobs but are able to entirely to avoid discipline. Work not pick up my worst enemy a application for this place."
bad,I worked there for a little over a year. The managers were all friends and had very poor skills and was very unprofessional. I had a manger hit on me the first day I worked along with a girl I trained. They would call you into a meeting on your day off an hour before the meeting. They were under staffed and worked workers hard with no awards. Very poor team work. It was more like high school.
bad,"The leads and supervisors purposely create a stressful atmosphere to ""keep the agents on their toes"".  Not a good place for someone used to working autonomously."
bad,"Typical day at work: I come in and stock, there is a lot of cleaning involved which is fine and understandable. If you want customers to purchase our merchandise the store needs to be kept. Management: lacks experience, leadership. I believe the Assistant Manager is more up to par then the Manager. Our Assistant Manager is more understanding I feel he actually listens and tries to resolve any issues that we ( the employees) may have. The hardest part of the job: I understand it's a truck stop and atleast half of our customers are truck drivers, but they are the worst part of the job. There is a lot of harassment that comes from their part. I have brought it up to our managers attention several times and only recently have they attempted to address the issue. It should not be a norm to feel threatened or frightened when at work. I have had several incidents where there has been more then one intoxicated male harassing myself or my co worker. The most enjoyable part of the job: My co workers I work with a great group of people. They are the only reason why I think I stayed around so long."
bad,Management is a joke. Worked for this outfit for less than six months and in that time i seen more favoritism towards the big mouth mechanics that knew everthing that never would man up to there mistakes. I seen more good technicans leave or get fired just because they refused to upsell un needed services. They want unskilled people who want to be called a mechanic and work for 10.00 an hr. Working at the truck-o-mat does not qualify a person as a mechanic
bad,Good place to get some experience in the field but terrible place to make a career.
bad,"Stressful, constantly busy, rude customers. Usually hires everybody part time. Nobody has patients, managers try to blame there mistakes on hourly employees"
bad,"Alot of fluctuating. Poor GM. Rude. Ran everyone off. Never wanted to help, but take all the glory. The DM was amazing until they fired him for ""reconstructing of company"""
bad,"Unstable schedule, unrealistic goals, managers are not very reliable or resourceful. They pay you very low for the amount of work that you juggle and maintain. They have no respect for your personal life. Do yourself a favor and consider somewhere else."
bad,"There is nothing good about this company. "
bad,"Working there was a walk in the park. Management was poor and I had to step up and do more than what I was paid to do. The people there are great, it just hard to run a restaurant with two people for the back of the house."
bad,"I worked at the TA in Southington for 15 years!"
bad,the manager allowed her employees to cause problems on other employees and it was just a bad place to work for and i would never go back.. the employees started rumors about each other and if they didnt like you than they would intentionally team up together and have you fired or try to set you up to get rid of you.
bad,"The management is horrible , and the place it self is horrible. There’s very little help , a lot of drama , not enough crew members. Managers doesn’t give you days you need off ."
bad,The management is horrible. No one stays longer than 6 months. Pay is not worth it. Treated unfairly and when you go to the managers they say one thing and then do another. It’s very stressful. If your looking to have gray hair within a few weeks of working you’ll get it
bad,"I was a former employee at TA DENMARK TN. But do to very poor management I put I my 2 weeks notice in.   We were terribly under staffed which made it difficult to focus on one task at a time. After quitting I received my separation letter stating that "" I WAS FIRED"" for ""Detrimental Attitude"""
bad,"The customers (truck drivers) can be bad at points but over all they are the reason i worked there. Management sucks, they dont know what they are doing and pull in randoms from outside the company. If you have a complaint and need to go to corportate, id suggest not to cause nothing will be done. Managekent and corporate are so bad that it makes the great employees leave because they get walked over and worked too hard while the people who dont work get raises. Backwards company"
bad,"Management has their favorites. Manager told me to turn in a diesel spill  to the company safety person. I did what she said and then what the safety person said to do and got fired a week later for doing it. No warning or anything, came in one morning and was fired. Very shocked because most everyone there needed good leadership and someone to hold them accountable."
bad,The company has discounts for employees and offers excellent health benefits. Management is not very good. Scheduling is confusing and often changes. Coworkers don't have the most positive attitudes about jobs. Very lenient.
bad,"this is a stressful work placed to work due to everyone trying to out each other and there is some days where is not enough work everyone, i tell everyone that this is not a job for everyone"
bad,They don’t really care for their employees. They want you to do everything a manager does without pay or title. You get treated horribly by drivers & customers & you’re on your own.
bad,The management was probably the worst part of the job. I originally got the job out of high school to offset college expenses. The management literally stated that they would only hire part time and cut everyone's hours and told the employees that if they want to survive they need to find another part time job and the only jobs around were only hiring part time.
bad,This job wasnt the greatest but its was a job...if you are despreate in finding something then this would be ok. But if you are looking for more stability and advancement then this job is not the one.
bad,Very stressfull working there. I dont recomend it to anyone. Management is not friendly and not helpful. They only pick people that will kiss but to management . if you work hard and do what your suppose to do they will let you go. You can not be yourself there. Management and the Assis. Will not help will the work they put it off to spmeone else to do. In other words thery are lazy.
bad,"my general manager was lazy constantly harassed me and the company didnt do anything , you are always left short handed , the management team didnt care about their jobs . it was a mess not a place to work ."
bad,Depending on what department you work in. I hated working there. Some of the managers are okay but need to learn how to manage the work place and employees better
bad,If you dont like drama or people screaming at you like a dog dont work there. When i first started working here im not going to lie i did like it it was fun fast paced.
bad,"TA is a good placed for pay, but as of site 058 they are very young managers who often are very unethical with drivers and company's as well as not very flexiable as far as work schedual they will have you work 1600-0000 and have you come back in at 0600."
bad,"management is awful from top to bottom. they lie about the salary you'll actually make. (unless your a seasoned mechanic, who knows almost everything, and also likes to work as hard as possible and work over your required time.) the tools the provide for you are junk and you never have what you need. they spend money on stuff thats not required but wont buy the stuff that is needed. very unclean place."
bad,"Horrible for me. They hire ex-cons, racists, and the workload is immense with little pay. Under staff so you'll be doing someone else's job. Management get worse as you get to the top. It smells like something died all the time. They have money for the people at the top, but none for you or the building that's falling apart in front of your eyes. Black mold in the bathrooms."
bad,"Management was not approachable.  Overall, it was a decent learning experience and taught me a lot of patience with foreign drivers, dealing with difficult customers, and breakdowns."
bad,"Poor training"
bad,"Often came into work with things not having been done by the shift before and had to do that before I could even start on my own work. I was a Porter ( I cleaned the bathrooms and showers), and the location I worked at didn't have any security cameras down the hallway with the Porter work room in it by the shower rooms. "
bad,"Working here was not the greatest job, you have staff stealing, management didn't know half the time what they were doing.  If you work at the fuel center, you are mostly on your own to deal with the busses that come in and truck drivers.  You will need to know how to manage multiple computers at one time.  You do get to meet a lot of famous people if you work overnights.  If you work days, you will have lines of people out the door near lunchtime and dinner.  It can be very stressful, working here isn't for everyone.  Lots of drugs being used by employees on duty and managers.  Staff is shady, very shady.  I did learn a lot working there on mostly what not to do.  You do have to know how to work independently.  You deal with a variety of people from all walks of life, which I loved.  "
bad,Flexibility depends on other employees. Management will say what you want to hear to get you to work there. Promises definitely not held. You have to be good friends with management to get the good jobs.
bad,Left ta on a short notice ( and I let the manager I would be back when I got a truck to pick up my tool box ) well they all took what they wanted from my box and acted like no one took it managers as well . So no do not work here and if u do lock up ur tools
bad,They don’t care about their values any longer. The Restaurant group is not important to their future. Once a great company is now a company that only cares about their fuel and their bottom line.
bad,"The specific site I worked for had horrible management. GM's were under investigation for extortion and not paying breaks, people were putting in years of service there and making less money than new hires because the prevailing wage was now higher than the cap for existing employees. It was a mess. I liked the work, but it was a very stressful environment."
bad,"Workers don't show up for 2 and 3 days and still have a job, I have a medical issue and I get let go ; it goes like this I took a allergy pill passed out and woke up at 430 ish and was supposed to be there at midnight I called said I was to messed up to drive! But yet they can keep people that no show good luck with this place !"
bad,"bad hours, pay is only good if you where on the right shift due to the bulk of your pay coming from commission. The other techs where liars and thieves, techs that couldn't get work anywhere else at any respectable truck shop. TA is not a career worthy company. good to get into the ground floor and see if you can do the work, if you can do it for them, you can do it anywhere."
bad,"This can be a very difficult place to work. not because the work is hard but the employees and management make it difficult.No one works together, there is a serious lack of communication.  Management is unstable, with 4 managers in the last year. Its a good place to work if you want to Make fast Money because they will give you around 50-60 hours some of that will be 10-13 hour shifts.They are always under staffed and everyone pretty much just does what they want because there's almost never a manager there to tell them otherwise. turn over rate is also very high for this location as well."
bad,"Management is too busy covering up for their own inadequacies to care about the employees beneath them. This has to be one of the worst corporations to work for.  Management preached teamwork, however I found that there in fact was very little teamwork taking place. Management spends most of the time hiding in their office listening to music or watching videos on their phone. The biggest problem is mainly management at the store level and the corporate level!"
bad,Was sent for training at another store. Was told would have manuals and such to help out in learning on job. Was not the case. Had to do all by memory. Was on 3rd shift and was told would never got off. Had to work double shifts because person on after me didn't show. Was still working there when I left.
bad,Mistreatment of employees. A lot of sexual harassment and nothing gets done. Management treats employees badly. Management has favorites and treats everyone else like dirt.
bad,"Travel Centers of America, at least the one in Missoula, MT, is probably one of the worst places you could actually work. There is no communication between managers, and employees. The managers barely have time to even focus on employees with all the things they have to do daily. There is no manager on swing shift, or grave shift, and they don't even know how to train anybody properly."
bad,"Cut throat business. People at corporate level would make a $100,000 mistake and just laugh and say that they will make the stores make it up."
bad,"One thing is for sure no matter what you do you won’t get fired, people all the time no call no show and nothing is said or done about it. No one in the shop has pride so you always have to clean up after everyone else."
bad,"Rang up fuel sales, paid out cash advances to cdl drivers. Was fuel desk supervisor, made schedules, in charge of safe and money disbursement to cashiers"
bad,Bad management to much greed not paid fair cut time with out u knowing training for there system is bad most employees are treated different from others
bad,"Very high turn over. Spent most of my time on-boarding new hires. There wasn't a lot of support from upper management. The training was extremely poor. I spent less than 10 days of training in Ohio, then came back and had to perform a quarterly inventory, which I had no experience doing."
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and found they had been shorting me on pay almost the entire time, they owed me $3800 in back pay. i brought it to managements attention and they admitted shorting me but never did make it right. Horrible company to work for, stay away."
bad,"this company does not follow Nevada Laws so make sure you know your rights. No drug tests, they hire felons, no consequences for poor behavior, no structure. toxic work environment and they cannot keep staff because of it. Employees are like family. Management is shady and talks badly about their employees."
bad,It was a huge favorites club where all blame was placed d on 3rd shift. Upper management never did anything to help the workload. Great company horrible management
bad,"Great pay/bonus/benefits. Bad, diseased, toxic, bullying, threatening environment. Awful management/office heads. Stress/chaotic. 24/7. Holidays/wkend"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of collecting PO numbers from various trucking companies. Creating Receipts for the new customers that came in, keeping the structure organized and timely for the technicians. The hardest part of the job was the work culture and the unfriendliness of the staff and managers."
bad,Productive environment but management was too concerned with making money over customer satisfaction and employee compensation.
bad,I have been there for 10 years I have seen many people come and go. Recently rules have changed once again. Typical day is to just wait on tables deal with rude customers and the pleasant ones. I have learned good social skills. The management is not the greatest just very rude at times. I work in the morning and most of coworkers are great people. I love working with them! Just dealing with all the stress walking on egg shells they are just out for their dollar. The customers and most employees.
bad,Customers were nasty. Employers would throw you under the bus in a heartbeat to save their own butts.
bad,A manager didn't care to discipline an assistant manager for theft from another employee. That's just downright reprehensible. Would someone say that that was proper business etiquette? That right there should be the proverbial red flag.
bad,No room for advancement...manager is prejudice in women being in management. Was promised mamagement and a certain pay and was givrn neither. My raise was chump change for being there a whole year..
bad,Techs talk bad about each other in front of customers. One employee creates a hostel work environment. Employees constantly talk about if you get hurt don't report it cause they don't want drug tests.
bad,"You are not part of a team at TA. You are a worker. You better be ready to stand on your feet for 12+ hours because if another server doesn't come in you are stuck. Management will go home. Got belittled for a year and if people didn't kiss up to the manager they got their hours cut, if others got their hours cut then you would find yourself working a 12-14 hour shift with no breaks and no one to relieve you. Noone wants to work here for too long of a time and if you are getting paid by them $3.59 an hour they will have you dishwashing and doing other peoples jobs. I eventually became a prep cook because there was no one else to do it, and I would have to be the dishwasher too and go back and forth. They expected me to live there, I was like an on call employee. This place wasted a year of my life will my grandfather was sick, I became his caregiver and TA did not respect my availability at all."
bad,The workers there are nice but the management sucks.I went there for fuel and the manager was rude when I told her I couldn’t fuel.i would never go back
bad,"Not good management,  poor employees, . They do have good benefits for insurance and paid time off. Works around your life schedule for the most part."
bad,The job was good just poor management. Pay was good and discounts were nice. Would have loved to stay there longer but it was also too long of a drive every day
bad,Lottery fast paced could of been better management I left cause it was a far drive... Checking in vendors cleaning wester union money orders customer service took care of the bar with the food kept it clean  stocked
bad,"Never enough people to work and the people that does show up it's only a few who want to actually work. managment doesn't care about anyone. some of the managers are really shady"
bad,"Managers work 10+ hours per day"
bad,"You have to work crazy hours just to get any kind of decent paycheck. Compared to other shops, the labor rates are a joke. Be prepared to work 10+ hours a day 6, sometimes 7, days a week to see a real paycheck."
bad,"I would be lying if i told you this was a great place to work. Its decent money, but not worth it in the end. "
bad,"The job itself is fine, however the management is so far less than professional. Bugs all over the place they did nothing about, coworkers doing no-call no-shows go unpunished but simply requesting a day off gets me told that I'm ""trying to dictate the manager's schedule"". What a joke."
bad,"Assistant managers/manager were rarely any help to the staff and workers. Cleanliness wasnt good in general store. Constantly called to ask if i can pickup shifts or come in, but manager openly mentioned he doesnt like to view applications or hire new people. Unprofessional"
bad,"My whole first day was my trainer telling me how lazy the whole crew was and was telling me who to talk to and who not to. She complained about the supervisor of our department, who quit a few days late. When it came time for closing, I would be stuck with doing all dishes, cleaning grill, cleaning serving fridge, cleaning the hot case, along with sweeping and mopping. The crew I worked with were constantly taking 30 minute smoke breaks and would take the whole last hour counting the till while I cleaned. Finally I realized that it wasn’t going to get any better, once my trainer was moved up to supervisor."
bad,I had some great team member but the work environment was horrible. They could never keep staff at the facility. The job came with great benefits. Several harassment suits were filled against management at this facility. It was a nightmare working at this job.
bad,Jobs at this location was stressful with little or no team work. Learned how to work under pressure. Management needed improvement. The hardest part of the job Organization. I enjoyed the money after being put on Commission
bad,Most people including management are fake to your face...you will be held accountable while others do nothing and will be judged and reprimanded for things that others wont be and may even get fired for less than what your co-worker is doing....drivers and the people passing through are great but the management leaves little to be desired
bad,"a typical day at work was basically being a cashier "
bad,"I called this gm on phone to tell him I worked at another truck stop and would like to keep my current pay,he was very rude! Idk why but I went for the interview anyway,again very rude! Talked in the most unprofessional way! If he didn't like me on the phone why call me in for an interview duh! He was calling me girl . Where do they get people like this! It makes their company look so bad! I wouldn't wanna work for them anyway.i guess it was a sign to move on thank goodness!"
bad,Management was unorganized and one sided. Everyone did what they wanted to do.Everyone wanted to be managers.It was just childish.Even the adults.No control
bad,"Gm treats you like you don't ever matter. Complain hr &dm nothing was done about it. So if you like to take abuse go work there ,if not pass this adup"
bad,Probably worse company to work for!! Place is full of drama and drugs they pay the bottom dollar to deal with the most! The employees run the place and the managers allow it! I watched drugs deals go down in front of the store by employees and managers just the worse!!
bad,"If you plan to work in the food court at this company, you will unfortunately need to be prepared to endure extremely fast paced and overly strenuous labor for very little pay!"
bad,"the new manager absolutely sucks, and does not do a thing to help their workers out or try to evolve himself in the team. Very slow and very incompetent."
bad,"As the facility maintenance tech you were responsible for more than what you could do for 1 person.  The management did everything possible to keep everything very stressful.  You had your daily/ monthly/ annual list plus the list of stuff they wanted you to do plus fix all the broken stuff(which was alot). Before you could get the managers list complete he would have a whole new list of stuff he wanted you to do.  The assistant manager was a very grumpy old man who was never happy.  They also wanted you to supervise the porters.  Thr managers did a really great job holding their chairs down in their office.  I do not recommend working for this location on Lovell Rd knoxville, tn"
bad,"During my time here, The management team had obvious favorites, and ignored the concerns of others. The feel of the workplace was cutthroat. There were good people working there that made the shifts fun, and the interaction with the customers, local and the truck drivers, was very interesting."
bad,management does not run it very well and everyone is out cut everyone else's throats so they can make more than everyone else overall just not a good place to work
bad,"good management, helpful staff, grateful drivers , clean work place, open classes , good computer programs, lots of shop tools. lots of knowledge that can be helpful"
bad,"was asst manager for payday loans, had to also market for the company."
bad,Not enough pay but job security is great work in any weather condition no matter hot or cold and snow but the overall job is not bad just not enough money for what you do
bad,"There are plenty of good employees and they provide great service to the customers. We enjoyed plenty of days there."
bad,"long and aggravating , too much drama with coworkers , managment is horrible and there very racist.. enjoyable part is break time and the hardest part is when its hot outside"
bad,This was a great oppurtunity and expierence i had the chance to move up in posistion at a great pace and i loved the support.
bad,The techs are all together and management is on the other side .needs improvement on the management in order to have a better work environment once they do that then its a good job
bad,Some of the techs and TSA were good people. Management here has a thing where they tell everyone what they want to hear then do nothing. upper management is an absolute joke. We had 3 service trucks that didn't even run and they wouldn't let anyone fix them.
bad,TA doesn’t care about you. The only good thing about working there is the free meal and everyone smokes weed on their breaks. It’s slave work and the pay is similar.
bad,Managment had lack of communication and when asking managment for help you were told to figure it out. Arrange for different hours so someone could watch my kids was turned down. They would fail at giving you your sick pay.
bad,"the management is awful "
bad,"I didn't like working there because of very poor management and the harsh work environment (lots of debri, oil, sut). I would not recommend this job for anyone looking for work."
bad,Long hours doing more than your share of the work due to inadequate staffing. Must be able to work with male GM who brings down the morale of the staff. Don't get sick! it will cause you to have your hours drastically reduced if you call in. Make sure your life is perfect cause any outside distractions will cost you your job.
bad,"This company is lacking management skills, they do not care about you or your family, they only care about themselves.  The managers do not answer their phones when another employee doesn't show up to work, leaving you stuck there to cover double shifts and sometimes triple shifts."
bad,"long hours, worked 18 months at 6 days a week about 14 hrs days. No bonuses. as stated in the hiring interview. I didn't have a life, it took a toll on my family life and my son. never again."
bad,Benefits are the worst from low time off to  expensive medical   Culture is not forward thinking.  No real training or recognition unless you are a manager or director
bad,Had s bad experience with coworkers and managements inability to perform as such. The pay was good if you had the correct people billing it out otherwise if trying to learn you have to on your own. Not only on your own but most likely not get paid for it. I loved my job and friends I gained from working there just very difficult to appreciate something or somewhere where your treated like a expendable source. If you work herewdofn go to far out of your way. Just be careful they will screish you luck and make as much money as you can also get good st anything and everything’s. Pay attention to your work orders being paid out properly and
bad,"Customer Interaction and variety was amazing, the best part. The management was poor and not as as knowledgeable as should be.  The rules and guidelines varied for each supervisor/employee making it difficult to follow. Giving being loved by all the customers there is NO SECOND CHANCES. I miss this job dearly strictly because of the customers, currently they are hiring for 5+ positions and was told for 3+ weeks I was to be rehired. I was giving a date and time to restart employment. I stayed unemployed waiting for this date and 1 hour before said time I was finally informed that I was NOT rehire able. Leaving me screwed after 3 weeks of unemployment I ended up homeless."
bad,"The management blamed me for stealing an energy drink which was dispelled by me having to make them check the security footage and was cleared of any wrongdoing. Then they moved me to night shift, alone, where there are barely any customers which made me not hit my commision and so my checks were 1/4 of what they were when i started working in the daytime."
bad,"The pay is absolute trash, I’ve worked here for 2 years and now I only make $1.35 more than I did when I started. Management sucks and corporate is unpleasant and also very hard to please. They don’t show appreciation for their employees and will literally hire anyone including hiring back old employees who just up and quit in the past."
bad,Rate of pay is below poverty level even for full time employees unless you are GM/upper management. But i have met some amazing people during my time.
bad,"Love most of my co-workers, but management was awful, pay was low, expectations were high. Was asked every single day to stay late. Management doesn't care about the store but expects mistreated employees to care."
bad,"People were told they were hired on hourly/commision, but not paid for work done on the trucks until which ever company paid their bill. For example: I left and started a new job and was paid 2 months later for changing a starter after I had quit. It's more of a contractual hire on status than an hourly/commision. Also a lack in chain of command and lack of following up on reports of harassment from co-workers."
bad,"I would never consider working for this company again."
bad,"I was a lead at a store got a new district manager, and he demoted me after 2 months for not knowing how to do everything in the store. Then asked my boss what he was going to do about my replacement in front of me. My GM and AGM never had my back."
bad,"Most of the work wasn't hard, just time consuming. What was bad was being out in the elements 100% of the time. Emptying trash, and sweeping the parking lot pretty much consumed my day. It wouldn't have been so bad, except for the General Manager was rude, unfair, and had no respect for his employees whatsoever."
bad,"The staff and environment was to hostile and unforgiving, constant pressure and arguements. Nothing was every good enough. Management would not hear out or understand any problems that were existing or prior that would conflict with the work environment. Quick to fire and reprimand over anything."
bad,"Since the management has changed, the work environment has declined severely. Several employees have quit, and the ones that remain are not happy. Management does not have a clue to what they are doing, and it is costing the company in profits."
bad,"I stayed with Travel Centers far longer than I should have. You are expected to dedicate your life for the company with little to no compensation. The attitude of ""whatever it takes to succeed"" is one I have had my whole life, and if you also have this attitude BEWARE because Travel Centers will abuse it. I worked in several different positions at this company and always succeeded. They asked me to relocated 5 times in the span of 4 years and 7 times through out my career. The consistently dangled promotions and growth opportunities if I could just do a little more for them or cover someone else's short comings. Which is where they took advantage of my work ethic. They never delivered of the opportunities or growth. When they told me to move to a location with a much higher cost of living I did but when I explained that the compensation wasn't enough for where the told me to relocate corporate stated ""You should have negotiated your salary better when you started 8 years ago."""
bad,Not the best place to work at if you have big family. People steal and it make our hours cut because of it. Alot of stuff need fix but and corporate dont want to spend more money to fix it rigth then half fast it.
bad,"Typical day at work was completing a variety of financial and procedural transactions for Truck drivers and everyone else. Keeping the store stocked with product and making sure drivers always had hot fresh coffee and a variety of food items.  Keeping up with inventory counts."
bad,"From the start I knew something wasn't right about this company. Starting with the influx of upper management, down to the shady side work being performed on company time. Seeing price fluctuations between owner/operator and company drivers."
bad,I was trained on company software which was a plus since I was hired in through a contractor. Too much paper. Company deals with high turnover. They rely on metal file cabinets which overcome certain departments. Management did not realize the difficulty of the large project we were dealing with.  I enjoyed working with the reps and helping them out.  The hardest part of the job was moving and shifting thousands of files on a regular basis.
bad,Was working here with diagnosed Diabetic keto acidosis. Was given a lot of grief due to the complications by other co-workers. Often scheduled to mid-night then back at 8 same day.
bad,i enjoyed my job in and of itself but i do not as far as the company as a whole they leave alot to be desired. i went through 9 managers in 5 years and countless employees because of those managers.
bad,was on call day and night with a very week and changing work force. Difficult to get good employees and pay rates offered. Could not be sure of a life outside work as always had to be available.
bad,"Manager screws up and blames employees. Negative comments constantly. It's like high school all over again. If you aren't the managers  buddy, bye!!!!"
bad,"Very busy, you make decent money, but the management is very poor, there are different rules constantly, the managers on different shifts do things differently.. There is a huge turnover rate, and there is NO consideration for family life whatsoever"
bad,"If you want a lot of stress, work here, make sure you do not make to much money with them or they will try to replace you to bring in someone cheap and stupid so they can can micro manage you to death."
bad,"Poor management, mistreated employees, and depressing work enviornment. Everytime going into work I was never excited I knew that it was going to be filled with rude managers and no recognition for anything that was done."
bad,The people are fun to work with but the management is bad no  Communication and they do not know how to handle things as far as unhappy employees  I have worked ther for 5 years thinking it would change and it never has
bad,"underpaid, unable to pay employees the proper dues, jobs always threaten by management, shop is never clean, all tools broke "
bad,"Small restaurant, business slow in winter months. Picks up for a bit in the summer. Soon to be remodeled, Was a lot busier in 2014 when I started."
bad,"The job itself was great, however you must be extremely self motivated. Do not expect any help from your manager or any of the management team. You must rely on your own knowledge and even then you will still get yelled at or fired by managment if the decidion you made, when they wouldn't answer their phones, isn't what they thought it should have been. The managment team has been caught on several occasions yelling and cursing at customers. I am very happy to no longer be there."
bad,Job is never the save form day to day. You are trained on many different areas from hot food bar to merchandise management and ordering.
bad,"The job is your typical job.  The place in Demotte has your typical drama and issues you get any where.  Compensation as a server is a dollar more than most server positions.  You work nights, weekends, holidays, kids or not.  They will work around school schedules which is nice.  You can work an 8 plus hour day with no break at all, no sit down break, no lunch, nothing.  You are on your feet the full 8 hours.  I learned to cook, run buffet, do end of day paper work, I was basically the manager when there was no manager and didn't even get compensation for it.  So I was trying for a promotion that I didn't get but they would take advantage of my great work ethic."
bad,"TA pays better than other companies for similar positions, but that is about the only pro of working there. Upper management is unfriendly and constantly use the threat of termination. Department managers are required to work a minimum of 50 hours per week, but often work much more without extra compensation."
bad,I find that the management at Travel Centers of America are overwhelmed by social drama and semantics. It can be very stressful and difficult to work there.
bad,"This company gives no encouragement or recognition to those who do a good job. hours of work changed daily..one day you may be on first shift only to work the second or third shift the next day. Takes away from being able to have a life away from work and gives no job satisfaction. Cleaning up after other people all day long by cleaning the showers, bathrooms, floors, and emptying garbage that can be to o heavy to lift. There is no teamwork among co-workers. Constantly getting complaints about something not being good enough for someone. The most enjoyable part of this job was time to clock out for the day."
bad,"A typical day at work was mostly busy. We were constantly assisting customers and getting familiar with new policies, procedures, and products. The most important thing I learned was how to be patient and how to interact with others. My co-workers were very outgoing and fun to be around for the most part. The hardest part of my job was keeping the work area clean; the most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers and getting to know them."
bad,To many different opinions low pay for the job required not very dependable on hrs from one week to next would not recommend at this time I am looking for a new job.
bad,"Pays poorly but you can basically go in with no experience and learn some basics to move onto something better. Just be smart and don't stay long. The pay is terrible, the hours can be very long and you will be doing hard work"
bad,"The pay was pretty decent if you were scheduled properly.  You would be scheduled anywhere from 7 to 15 days straight with no days off, or would work three days and be scheduled off for 7 days straight. Favouritism is unreal. It's not entirely bad until you get accused of stealing money. "
bad,"Bob is a great manager. But the job as a cashier at TA was very stressful. The truck driver's are very rude. Some driver's are nice, but most aren't. They are demanding, and have no patience. My coworkers were awesome and fun to work with. When I was hired they didn't hold back a few weeks on pay like most jobs do when you first start. You get hired quick, which is cool too."
bad,Ain't a bad place to he if you have no experience and you're looking to start out but if you know what you're doing you're busting your butt pulling everyone's weight and still get treated like garbage management  is by far the worst issue when working here. Shops always a mess every thing is either missing or broken wouldn't recommend it
bad,Don't work with employees. Poor management. There is no consistency in any area of work at that location. No career advancement. You may possibly get a 50 cent raise if your with the company for more than 4 years.
bad,"Truckers are very rude, management is very rude. Employees are very helpful and polite to customers. Location has a great view of the area and history."
bad,"The call center was ran like a sweat shop.  no lunch break.  only three 10 minute breaks in a eight hour work day. "
bad,very very busy always having to catch up on what the person before you didn't do whIch sometimes was OK mostly it was just go go go . Felt very over worked and way under appreciated.
bad,"bad management, very rude and disrespectful to their employees, and like to choose favorites. I love the job itself but the people and drama at this location is ridiculous and not worth my time."
bad,"There are no cameras so everyone pretty much gets away with anything. Staff stealing tips and food. Everything is unkept and gross. First day was expected to know everything and be let loose. Not that i didn't know how to serve, it wasn't my first job as a server, but still. Management is super unprofessional, supervisors sleep on the job. "
bad,It is a fun and challenging place to work. You get to meet a lot of people from all over the world. The only problem with this location is the general manager. She lacks business and personal ethics; willing to throw anyone and everyone under the bus to make herself look good.
bad,Different crowd. Been called every name in the book. The company does not care for their employees but only for the customer. Only thing positive is the crew I work with.
bad,Re building the restaurant team was hard but fun enjoyed work with my team each day they had rallied to one of the top crews. Despite the upper management not supporting all that they had achieved. This made it harder to keep spirits up but with constant reinforcement and coaching we still had great food and truly outstanding service each day I told every one that they are winners and they are.
bad,"The environment is unprofessional. There is no training or availability for the proper people to advance. Bad practices at this place."
bad,The bells and whistles look nice they are not. The company promotes family oriented background and base but it is not. The management looks out for themselves and has their own disarray and also plays favorites. Not a good company and for what you are paid it is not worth the hassle or being there.
bad,Facility is open 24 hours and not enough support from management for the daily activities.
bad,"I only worked here for a few months, but alot of my co workers were lazy and didnt want to do the work that they were supposed to and the manager did not like to handle the problems that we were having. The hardest part of the job was remembering everything off of the menu and the seating arrangement. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers smile. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to process payments."
bad,"I was a deticated employee, who made a clerical error and was terminated. With all the disrepect and lack of integraty the company employes it's a tough company to work for and with."
bad,"10/10 do not recommend. It's boring with no where near enough pay. Plus management has no idea what's going on. Drivers stink, are rude and can be creepy."
bad,"Don't expect to go anywhere unless you're willing to get a lot of brown on your nose or getting on your knees.  There is no real leadership, or orginization, no real proper training.  Basically thrown to the wolves and made to figure things out on your own"
bad,"If you need money, this is a good place to be. Management is iffy and drama is inevitable. You work hard, you will will be given more hours. if you mess up or management doesn't like you or hears bad things about you you will loose hours."
bad,The pay needs to be better to keep the good employees that end up leaving because they have to constantly pick up the slack left my lazy coworkers. Management needs to hire proactive and professional leadership not their friends who don't make a schedule for 3 weeks for new employees.
bad,"Management always find a way to try and not pay you for work."
bad,The work life balance is very poor. They use people up. Compensation is below industry standard. Knowledge of and assistance from most upper management is very poor.
bad,the hardest part of the job is consistently moving to do other peoples job due to not having enough staff or because someone quite and no one was hired to replace them. sometimes its the over employment that causes hours to be cut and having full time workers work part time.
bad,The manager I worked under would yell at you and would not listen when you needed to talked to him about doctor visits. He would threaten to fire you if you make one little mistake.
bad,TravelCenters of America is a good place to work but a whale as a bad place the have poor manger on all 3 sides of the store and ever one doesnt be leave in team work just b leave in getting ever one fired and manger dont care about the people they work with of for they and just there to get a check
bad,i only worked here for a short time and they treated the workers very poorly. the manger is very perverted towards the younger female staff. i worked there when i was 20 and he was a pig.
bad,I was employed while going to school in the same field but I was underestimated in my skills. I knew a great deal more than I was given credit for and was mostly given jobs that no one else wanted to do or felt like doing.
bad,.Local management is great.  Co-workers are wonderful.  Love my job and perform to the best of my abilities everyday.  Hardest part of day is figuring out what Corporate Office is loading.
bad,Hostility in the work place was a huge issue in this company. There was no respect for management from employees and vice versa.
bad,"I think management needed to do better as a hold. The hardest part of the job was dealing with mean type of customers, and issues with management. I had no problems out of my co-workers. I enjoy most of my time their. I just felt like the company can be ran better than it is now."
bad,"A day at work was a lot of standing around, the only thing that I learned at this company was how to keep myself busy. The management is not very strong, can't seem to keep up on their duties to make the employees to do their part."
bad,My typical day at work started at 4:00 pm and continued till 12:00 am.  I typically got a 30 min break around 7:00.  I learned to have more patience and increased my confidence.  Working here has made me less shy.  
bad,Very quick burn out in a very short period of time due to lack of management support.
bad,none how to deal with unfriendly people and how to deal with a bad situation
bad,"clock in get dress see whats on the board to be worked on call up the truck if its not already in bay see if we have parts in stock if not order them "
bad,This wasn’t the best company to work for in my opinion. Lots of hard work and little pay. It was also very hard to advance within the company. Not my favorite.
bad,This company would always change your work schedule on you with out letting you know or asking you if it was okay for them to change your hours. Company did not take their employees into any type of consideration.
bad,Management was great however the environment among my co-workers and the customer was very hostile and volatile. I felt drained after every shift. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who had unrealistic expectations.
bad,"TA isn't a fun experience, especially if you're a young woman working overnights full time at the fuel desk of all places. There's a hierarchy, and the management always played favorites. And you're not protected from disgusting people continuing to make passes at you, even after you've repeatedly told them you're not interested."
bad,"Poor management and little training, figure it out as you go. Company policies are in place. But aren't  consistently enforced. Annual pay raises are a joke. Then after being there for a minute, you'll discover the new hires make the same if not more as you. Real kick in the teeth!"
bad,during my time there management changed a few times and favoritism was shown often to the employed family members of the management team and the poor treatment of the others; also a lack in proper training
bad,Virginia marks 5 days a week 40 hours never worked weekends. What restaurant was busy was reluctant to get up and help anyone. He put everything off on his assistant managers promising them promotions that never came. Had favorite staff members who weren't performing that were not dealt with and without harshly with staff members who did not like assistant managers were told to to push to push them out
bad,No one gets along. Not the cleanest place. You have people not showing up for there shift and nothing gets done they still get to come back to there job with no consequences
bad,"Great way to meet returning customers from all over the country, especially truckers.  Not the best way to earn a living.  Employees have a lot of discontent for what they are asked to do.  I found it best to just do my job. This was a temporary job while I was looking for better work elsewhere."
bad,I worked for this company for a few months the managememt is rude and doesn’t care about the employees they make you work a lot for a little bit of pay
bad,Crummy hours even crummier experience. My boss at the time was vindictive and cruel while teaching if things weren't exact she would go on a screaming spree.
bad,If you want a job where you do nothing but stand. This job is perfect. Its like high school. Everybody talks about everybody. Very stressful environment.
bad,Cuthroat place to work.  Busniess is not what it used to be. There is no team work. No mamagement outside of office. No good working shop tools.  Not what it used to be
bad,"Worked as AGM at the fuel desk...Job is very stressful and also 24/7/365 Even when off the clock you have to be concerned about having to come in and cover a shift or emergency.......There is no work/life balance...."
bad,to many company politics going on with alot of finger pointing and back-stabbing among the employees as well as jobs not being done properly by the employees
bad,"Worked here for 9 months and wasnt paid according to the work. I felt like i should've  gotten hazzard pay for dealing with showers and nasty bathroom. Management is not great, and they are not fair with hours. I made $8.75 and only got paid every two weeks. Too much drama in the work place and employees were rude to other employees."
bad,working on the busiest shift there when i did i came in ready to work and would handle my work keeping everything up with the pace and being organized while trying to clean up the shift before me and management would not take any of that in consideration with paying more or helping more.
bad,"On the graveyard shift, I clock in, count my money, and then clock right out for a ""break"". Not a hard job. It's me, security, and the people in the shop."
bad,"Working at TA was very tiring due to poor management. We were always short staffed, eight hours felt like 15. Managers always expected employees do to the entire job alone."
bad,Management was not supportive in certain areas.  They allow cross training if desired.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the drivers from all over the US.
bad,"Very basic job duties, changing tires and performing PM intervals. workflow very unsteady, roadside mechanic work has been too safety oriented, resulting in a rather unsafe work practice."
bad,"This was a great place to learn about writing work orders and the computer system for inventory pulling. "
bad,"When I hired on with this company I thought advancement would be a part of my future. Then when I was told that no advancement was possible , I decided to look for something better."
bad,"There was no chance of really advancing, employee and management turn around was horrible. I had 4 different managers in 2 years. A serving job is never a stable income."
bad,"Learned bookkeeping skills"
bad,Poor work environment due to management turnover. Management mislead the advancement policy.
bad,"This company continually took advantage of the good employees. There are so many unmotivated people that work there that a majority of the work fell on the few people that did their jobs. There is no pride in their work and the place has poor moral because of it. After figuring out what my hourly pay would be, when comparing how long I worked and what my salary was, I discovered I was making 4.75 an hour."
bad,"clean and restock showroom.  write up work tickets for customers."
bad,"pay wasn't desirable at all after the first month guarantee period, other techs not as willing to help due to strict time restrictions on work. Poor learning experience."
bad,The summary says it all. I would not recommend working here unless you have no option.
bad,"I Get to work ,clock in, Count Cigarettes, Count drawer to make sure there is the right amount of cash in it, open register wait on customers if needed, go onto the sales floor restock shelves as needed, Check in vendors as needed, end of day i count down my drawer and do the end of day reports. I have learned how to use different computer programs. The Management here is very Unprofessional but the co workers are fun and friendly. There is no hard part to my job. The most enjoyable is waiting on the customers and making there day."
bad,The management was bad. I quit because they did not give me enough hour. They did not like that I was in school.
bad,"Management does not care how you do or get the job done. They expect unrealistic results in the amount of time given to you to complete tasks. Upper management does not have your back in the general manager does not get along with the employees. Pay is not bad, but benefits are not good. You only get 4 paid holidays and that is only if you work it. This a terrible place to work for. Stay away from this company if you want to succeed. This company sets you up for failure."
bad,If the store Upper Level Management were more professional job would have been perfect. She allowed personal issues to effect her evaluation of job performance..As well as schedules and expectations of employees.
bad,I enjoyed my short time with TA/PETRO. Had no issues with anyone except the floor manager. I was hired as an inexperienced tire and lube tech. If you aren't perfect after your first week here be prepared to get talked down to.
bad,"I can't speak for all locations but the one I worked at was not so great. "
bad,"I don't remember much of it other than me being the bottom of the totem poll, as I was still a high school kid who got a job through my mom. At the time no one was really hiring in my tiny town, so not only did I have any previous job experience, I was lucky to have a job at all."
bad,"Management is very hit or miss when it comes to competency and general likability. Overall, most of the departments are very well managed, but I strongly encourage job seekers to thoroughly vet their hiring manager. Technical competency is severely lacking within departments and any attempt to introduce or suggest more efficient software/processes are frequently met with glazed over expressions and general dismissal of ideas."
bad,"I really enjoyed the team effort we all would strive for. My daily routine was to make sure the cooks were set for their shifts, makes sure the servers had enough cash in their drawers and knew what the daily specials were.  I was also in charge of counting inventory with the GM and do drawer audits to ensure all food was accounted for."
bad,"Working here, I would seem that every one here had things better than the mechanics. Not so great of a place to work but it definitely beats flipping burgers if that is your alternative."
bad,"I met people from all walks of life working in travel centers, hardest part of the job is working in diesel fuel some of the customers are over stressed and under patient. my experiance with the company as a whole was positive. however I feel site management has too little resources to match or meet expectations of upper management, and yes this can impact the regular employee"
bad,your were either busy or slow there was no inbetween all the co workers except one got along with everyone the most enjoyable part of work was meeting new and different kinds of people.
bad,"Preventive maintenance service, tire repairs, Electrical repair,Road side service repairs.The Management wasn't really professional. I enjoyed my co workers they made the job fun and they always were will to lend a hand when requested."
bad,"I just started diesel tech school in May not knowing too much about the industry, but I do have mechanical knowledge. I needed a job that I could get my feet wet in the truck side of diesel technology. TA isn’t the best place to start if you’re a greenhorn such as myself. Management is a joke, the service writers think they run the place."
bad,Bad management likes to not pay you on days you come in to work when people call off. Management was not clear nor do there jobs correctly. Unprofessional and doesn’t support veterans
bad,It really depends on your management team and unfortunately there are a lot of bad ones. Ive worked at 4 locations and had over 5 manager teams. Don't be fooled into thinking that you matter bc when it comes down to it your just a number.
bad,I would have to say the TA in amarillo texas was open and flexible and the only reason i stay was because its easy. Management wise theres no changing in lack professionalism especially the fuel desk manager. Its too much family working together same manager over 10+ yrs so turn over rate is horrible but noone cares to change there routine but instead just hire another person o'well.
bad,For the most part I loved the people I worked with. I worked there nearing my 12 th year. The last 5 years I worked there management just got worse and more prejudiced.I was forced to give up my full time status which meant losing my benefits.And either management above them didn’t know or didn’t care enough about their being prejudiced to do anything. Either way that site has really gone down hill.
bad,Money is good. Higher ups have no idea what they are doing at times. Not home a lot. Hard to get good help. Good training. Not hard work. Commission work is not for everyone.
bad,Everyone try’s to be involved in your outside life. No privacy working here. No one respects each other. Others will talk behind your back and in front of you and management. Worst work environment possible. Everything in the shop is broken or not working since before I started working here.
bad,"I loved the job but worked with this company for 12 years, very dedicated and was fired in the blink of an eye all over hear say without question. New District area manager didn't like certain people so he was coming up with the littlest things to write them up and later fire."
bad,"unprofessional behavior in front of guests. Arguments and belittling behavior. Backstabbing and attitudes between co workers. The line cooks are rude to the servers and they act put out if a guest returns what they ordered. Management gossips with other employees about other employees. they have there clicks and if your not included you wont make it very far."
bad,"During a typical day, I would wash dishes, clean the floors and converse with my coworkers while doing so. While I enjoyed the company of management, they never allowed me to sit still for a second. I would be understanding of this if the pay were better. I also didn't like the mandatory training I had to do every month or so. The most redeeming quality of this job was the free meals. In short, great people, bad environment."
bad,my coworkers and customers are what made my job amazing. i felt i never worked a day there because i thoroughly enjoyed my position with TA.
bad,the co-workers were fun to be around but got wrote up for stupid stuff
bad,hard work alaways busy on showers people were not that easy to get along with
bad,"Management is slightly inexperienced, corporate management couldn't care less about whether you have a job and have absolutely no issue firing or docking pay for things that may not be your fault. Compared to other service writer positions this place is WELL under average."
bad,I enjoyed serving the truck drivers. Some of them would come in angry. All it would take is a few nice words and they calmed down.
bad,"The job itself is not a bad job, but the management team sucks and they have their picks and favorites. The truck drivers are rude and socially unacceptable and the management feels like it's okay to be mistreated because they are customers."
bad,poor business decisions     hot water tank always runs out of hot water when the 6 showers are running constantly which results and drivers getting angry that they paid for a cold shower. this has been a problem for over a year and it just seems like they are never going to fix it.
bad,"Not very clean, management was clueless, you can make pretty good money if you know what you're doing, but for an entry level diesel technician job, it's tough."
bad,"Expect to arrive to a hail storm of calls that poor supervisors get railed with and management caring less about solving because meeting quotas is the only concern. They used to have monthly meetings, which helped with understanding where the ship is being steered and morale building, but quit due to thinking it didn't help (really they rather spend their time elsewhere). The only way you get in is as a contractor, which please expect to be treated less than dog poo. End-users are foul-mouthed hilljacks who think you are the end all be all problem solvers of everything they have. Literally calls for toilets and microwaves happen. Co-workers are what makes the job most pleasant, that and the payout is favorable for the TIME BEING. Do not let the laid back nature of your most tenured co-workers lead you down their path, because telling on people is a big plus there and you need to watch out. ""Practice what you preach "" is not what occurs in this environment. Management are great personalities. They are charming, easy to get along with people however they operate with hidden agendas. Corporate shakiness is always at a 10. If there is anything to be taken away from being at this job is play the corporate game up to the tee. Overall its not a bad place to work, just be mindful someone is always out to get you."
bad,"Do not work for this company if you do not already know what you're doing. It's hard enough to learn the ins-and-outs of mechanics without the manager constantly breathing down your neck about how slow or inexperienced you are when you clearly stated in the interview process that you were relatively new to the field. Only seasoned veterans of the wrenching variety should seek opportunities here, because if you don't already have the know-how, your pretty little self is getting canned."
bad,"Not the best management but my overall experience working there was great i enjoyed my coworkers,very fast paced and got a lot experience."
bad,"I worked for the company and thought that I worked for a much of very immature adults. Dirty place to work, language was vulgar and unprofessional atmosphere."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company at first. I noticed that the management takes alot of personal problems out on their employees at the fast food restraunt. In the dine in restraunt you have great opportunities to get more hours and such things. I was in a situation where I needed to get ahold of Human Resources and all the managers in the building refused to give it to me. I finally had to go through the book keeper to get it.
bad,I might just be biased toward TA because I was switched from morning shift to graveyard shift without all the knowledge of the responsibilities and duties that are required by the Graveyard shift but other than that the pay was good and i was offered more than enough hours each week.
bad,company is growing and is a decent place work for. Work/ home life can be a challenge at times.  But if you like fast pace and ever changing environment this will work for you.
bad,"The concept of the company is good, the food is awesome this is the opportunity for any trucker or traveler to visit and relax and get a great meal. The staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home either with a friendly conversation or if you want to be left alone.  This is a place where you can meet people from all over the world and meet very different personalities. You also get locals that come in and give you stories of history of the city or town of the area and they tell you with heart. It is one of kind and I have to say it is a pleasure to meet each and everyone of them."
bad,Honestly working for TA hadn't been all that bad but they are there disrespectful to there employees and wont work with them on there hours or anything
bad,"TravelCenters of America was an interesting place to work. You would meet all types of people on a daily basis. The pay was not great and there was no room for advancement, but they did offer me my first job."
bad,Not bad if you’re getting outta high school but I only recommend this job as part time the customers can be a little aggressive and have bad attitudes from driving all day
bad,TA is a great company to work for. They have given a annual raise every 6 months. Management has changed and the company seems to be changing for the worse. I am seeking a different environment and to gain experience in a job that will provide benifits.
bad,I was at this company for 3 years and felt like I didn't matter. It is a TERRIBLE hamster wheel of GMs. The DM seems to hire only his friends. GMs always are lowkey perverts but nobody wants to report them.
bad,Siri is a good starter company they send you out for a lot of training support ASE certification and pay for this will give you bonuses upon completion of certificates however there is lack of leadership too many people in the shop considering we make commission very cutthroat it is deafly not a place that I would recommend anybody to stay for for any amount of time
bad,You have to be a strong person to work at TA. Some guests are so mean they could make you cry. It's happened to me a couple of times over the past four years. My manager right now is wonderful though and he works well with everyone and tries to make the schedule fair. There are also the guests that come in every day and you get to know them and their life and sometimes they become like family.
bad,this was a good job meet a lot of ppl I love serving so this was a plus for me the tips were good and the friendly faces you see everyday was good tooo bad they are no longer open
bad,"managers only care if you show up and work."
bad,Most the views come from the people who are related there and work with in family means or with in a circle of there exceptions.
bad,"I was hired to Travel Centers of America as a normal entry level cashier. Before my90 day review was up, I had earned a promotion to manager in training. Subsequently before my 6 month review, i was sent to Michigan to take on the Assistant General Manager position that was vacant. The Field Manager ""loved me"" and had nothing but kind words for me in pushing me to take the position. I ultimately had to turn it down as it was a relocation and they were not offering me enough money to make it worth the move."
bad,Co Workers Are Pleasant and Management is Wonderful. But just not enough Help during regular Shifts.  During Busy Times not enough people are being Scheduled
bad,this job gave me the opportunity to meet and converse with people from all over the United States.
bad,"Work was slow sometimes. Management was horrible. If you werent number one mechanic, the management didnt care about you."
bad,"there was no equal opportunity. the management was not fair and "
bad,did not enjoy going into work because of the environment management was very bad
bad,My GM was a great gentlemen and we worked great together.  Once again no praise for hard work and the TQM  position is a joke.  Walk around on you phone all day and get away with it ? Shop is always dirty after our shift would bust cracks to clean it from previous shifts . Not a bad place to work just needs more employee recognition for the work they put in for the managements bonus .
bad,"Its a very busy job and you are constantly on your feet all day. Meet new people from all walks of life. Can be very stressful, and sometimes very hectic."
good,"Flat Rate Pay /Plus Hourly... Poorly Managed, Co workers dont work as a team,,, Not enough product to fix Tractor and Trailers that require repair,,, Managers play favorites,,,Bad Road Calls with Truck"
good,"The management does not listen to employees problems. They do not fallow any safety procedure and expect us not to. If you file for workmen comp you will be fired. They don't offer benefits, No Health Insurance, No Vacation Time, and no 401k."
good,Other than the poor management and benefits it was an okay place to work at. The customers were great and so were my cowokers but the job itself was terrible
good,I moved before I had time to actually learn anything from this company. I had no fun working there and the staff was extremely lazy. They did not clean the aisles like they were supposed to and I ended up having to do it all.
good,Meeting new people from all over the US. Learning new things about State Laws that Semi-Truck drivers must follow in order to drive. Handling large sums of money.
good,well it has been so long sence i have workes here. from what i can remember it was a good place to work. The old gen. manager was not a good manager but he dont work there anymore
good,Its not the place to be. The worst job I've ever had. No job advancement. Rude management. Rude customers and bs pay. Not for people who have a family to support. More for teenagers who don't have bills to pay.
good,"It can be a fun place to work if the co workers are nice,sometimes you get really rude customers,for me the pay wasn't enough but we were allowed to get tips and sometimes the truck drivers did leave tips"
good,It's a fast paced business. Management needs improvement. Communication needs improvement. Company needs to hire more reliable employees. Lack of appreciation for dedicated and reliable employees
good,"HIgh Stress, low pay for what you go through on a day to day basis. Dealing with the drivers and all the attitudes that go along with that. Hourly employees would always call off and the management would have to cover, never getting support from the corporate office."
good,There was really no chance of moving up and if you did the pay became less. Days needed off just depended on if they wanted to give you the day off not on the importance as in your childs in the emergency room with something seriously wrong they would tell you to wait till your shift was over. There are no benefits except life insurance and you wouldn't know if you had a job the next day or not.
good,at times ti was ok work environment at other times it felts like things were just getting pushed on others so people didn't have to do there jobs or they didn't want to do there jobs
good,"Work live balance?  Bonus? Support from your direct supervisor? These are questions that were never answered. We never got support from management to hire or fire who you needed. You have to keep people around in insure that you had some support. Bonus, Ha! that is a laugher. Support from anyone well that didn't really happen either. All in all the check did not bounce when it was deposited"
good,Male dominated company. Management may or may not like you. And if they don't then your job may be in danger. Unfair and inconsistent disciplinary actions. If your liked you will be given more chances and if your not then it's out the door. Doesn't matter how much you work hard or do your best if your manager does not favor you then he will just build a file on you till he has a reason to let you go. The managers at TA click up with the hourly employees and those employees get more perks.
good,"Commission based salary, Fast pace environment. Decent pay and plenty of work, great commradery on lower level, poor benefits no sick or personal pay. Poor management. Poor training. Twenty four hrs a day seven days a week. Always a technician on duty shop never closes on holidays"
good,If you are looking for a foot into the diesel industry TA is a good option. The downside is there isn't much opportunity for growth. Financially speaking TA pays much less than their competitors. I was a home office employee and the culture in home office is not the same as being in the filed.
good,"Kind of like our congress, this place needs a change in management. Very stressful place to work. The work is fine, the co workers and management not so much. They've settled into that good old boy logic over the years, follow no policy, building is a dump, Really no incentive to do better. Great job for those looking to get back into the work force, that's it."
good,over all good start for people to get there feet wet with maintenance.  hardest part of job is the hours manager required to work 50 hours a week and  technicians work 40 hours or more depending on job
good,"The experience was ok, I had more great days than bad. You have rude people everywhere you go so its to be expected. Most of those truck drivers were pretty nice and just wanted someone to talk to."
good,"when shnow shower ,learn how to stock things from place to place,good relationship with co worker .to go outside to dump garbage work in store work in cafeteria."
good,"It help provide for my family. It is very dirty work. I would not want to work there again. Thank You, I have nothing else to say."
good,"there isnt enough work to keep 2 or 3 people busy at night time, and the managers do not have a mechanics background so there forth they don't know how to lead."
good,"I had formal and non formal IT training, which provided me the foundation for a well rounded technical background. My SAP lead (supervisor) taught me everything I know. I had a very good experience working with him at TA. There was the matter of my salary which really did not match the market for Basis/UNIX Admins. That was the only problem with Travel Centers."
good,"A typical day at work started with coming in with nothing done from over night, a 86 list through the roof. The only think that kept me insane were the people i worked with and my customers."
good,Turn over ratio on managers is bad. Hourly pay for higher techs like my self should be alot more then it is. 5 ASE 11yrs junk hourly pay. Never got any kind of end of the year bonus.
good,"Good company but can use better management , everyone is friendly acts like family and at times it can be ruff but over all a good company to work for."
good,"The worst manager I ever had, spends more time texting and flirting than working. To many unskilled Techs causing extream wait times and and a lot of warranty work."
good,It was ok. Pays every 2 weeks but I never made over 900 which is garbage for the work. But you do learn and have room for some advancement. Management at my store was bi-polar. One day they cared for you the next you where worthless. People always come and go. I was grateful for the opportunity but the pay was not there for the work. A stepping stone at best.
good,Horrible  manager that gave bad  hiurs. I would always have to work overnight from midnight til 8 am and then that same day have to be back at work at 4 pm and work til midnight. Having 8 hours in between shifts sucks especially when it would be hard to stay asleep after being up all night because i just couldnt sleep longer than a few hours during the day because i was not used to sleeping during the day. I quit after i found out i was pregnant and my manager still kept giving me all those crazy hours working 2 days in the morning 8-4 one day 4 to midnight and then one day midnight to 8 am and then having me come in 8 hours after i had just worked overnight by myself and not getting a lunch break. I was creating a life inside me and didnt think those hours were healthy for a pregnant woman.
good,"•It was a fun experience helping traveling customers and truck drivers"
good,I heard new people are there maybe its a better job now i would definitely go back to work there now I did learn a lot I was thrown into things I wasn't properly trained on but learned real quick
good,A lot to learn computer wise but also great to get more training.  You meet lots of people with different ethnicities  and you must adapt differently with each customer while keeping good customer service and always be respectful.
good,"Don't waste your time. Throws you under the bus as training and when you make a mistake big/small they look at you like you've been there for years and know better, and you're stupid,  but not really trained at all."
good,"This was my first job and I liked that I was making .75 cents more than minimum wage.  I had fallen in love with my Job.   My manager were all positive - made working there a breeze as long as you'd follow policy and did your job.  Unfortunately, the company had switched store managers and there was a lot of catty behavior going on.   It was not all bad but the management could not be trusted."
good,"There is not enough training and support. Due to lack of training, mistakes are made that you are held accountable for. Although you were not taught or trained correctly."
good,"Good company, need too have managers with less favorites.The company is a good company to work for. Excellent run repair shop, with a great manager."
good,"Unprofessional environment, disrespect allowed by co-workers not addressed and allowed to continue, promises not followed through with, workload very demanding, supervisors not actively involved in what they claim to be a team environnent"", overall the level of professionalism in a supposed growing company is a joke! Poor decisions made daily, not enough interactions from supervisors to allow team to understand their responsibilities. They need to get their ducks in a row and keep their employees under control. They also treat temps with complete disrespect!"
good,"I was on rotating shifts and I felt I had no social life. The truck stop was a 27/7/365 operation. The location I worked at hired half its employees from a halfway house. I'm all for giving  anyone another chance but it was ridiculous. At one time, over 75% were fired for using meth on the property. The company needs to be more diligent in screening its future employees,"
good,my typical day at work is when i work doubles for someone calling out. i have learn alot of this job been a cashier and a server. the management talks to you nice sometimes but they get they job done. my co workers are fun at the work place we all get alone.the hardest part of the day is when we get a rush when we short of staff. the most enjoyable  day is when we have fun and joke and laugh.
good,"very hard working enviroment at times , but love the fellow emplyoees, and I am a very loyal employee, a team player."
good,"Not much to say when the customer truly runs your company, I see the company taking a dive in there stocks, because you need to treat your employees as well as you treat your customers."
good,It was a long day work and I enjoyed working the graveyard by myself.
good,"Recent Management changes have reset the goals for several departments, not for the better. Numbers are the goal, not solving the issues presented. "
good,Working is fun as long as you have a good crew. Lots of call outs and covering shifts. Management is poor. Only benefit I can think of is if you want overtime you can defiantly get it
good,"TA has horrible managment! And horrible training program, dont learn anything from the videos you do have tine to watch and learn mostly from the advanced mechanics in the shop or reading books on your own time, the service writers do not know how to do their job due to lack of knowledge of parts or any kind of diesel anything, and this place only crunches down on their employees when the big boss is coming or when they get in trouble themselfs.. this shop is not ran right! Benefits are extremely expensive,  and the shop is dirty because not everybody cleans/ picks up after themselfs"
good,"The General manager I had constantly belittled employees and often took credit for employees work when meeting with the district manager. "
good,"Redding TA is a ""good"" place to work. But they do have their way of discriminating, humiliating, down heading other employees, customers. Poor management."
good,"Had a guy doing lube jobs on a truck every three hours, and management refused to replace him with someone ready to move out of practicing tires all day everyday."
good,"Stressful BS. Angry customers for no reason, everything is rushed but slow due to ESHOP and obtaining authorization on repairs, commission based entirety. Feast or famine. Hot or cold."
good,"As it says above, over worked and under paid. Corporate didn't seem to care about their employees as much as they'd claimed. The daily customers is why I returned every day."
good,I enjoy my customers and interacting with different people however the location I work at is disorganized. With that being said it makes the work environment stressful.
good,"Many customers there are very rude and perverted. Truckers are very messy and needy. Management is weak and lacks work ethics, a lot of favoritism. Super chill job , not like many."
good,Truck drivers are nice . They give you good hours they are nice people that work there they give small raises they are open 24 hr and they have good managers
good,High paced dispatch center. Many incoming and outgoing phone calls. 8 hour shifts and 3 breaks per shift. Dispatch mobile mechanics to road breakdowns on tractor trailers. Monitoring these road calls while keeping customers updated.
good,Come to work get straight to work do your job and help where ever needed if it needs done do it no sense waisting time.Productive is how i like things
good,"Fun to chat with truck drivers all night! Working the graveyard shift, one has very little to do and few interruptions. Complete inventory, wash towels, help with cleaning of showers, mopping floors, stocking coolers; anything to help pass the time. Fresh coffee is a must! Great way to learn more about the Americas if you have Over The Road drivers. Assisted the bookkeeper on the weekends for deposits and daily reconciliation reports. Hardest part about the job was making sure the morning shift actually showed up. Management is pretty much non-existant on a graveyard shift, though readily available by phone. After I transferred to California from Oklahoma, I was informed management didn't want ANY calls for any reason after their appointed shift. Poor transfer training, no access given for computer tasks. No support from middle or upper management. No confidentiality with paychecks."
good,"Decent pay for a cashier position. Hard work. Can be fun. How can you expect to hold someone accountable for the money in the safe if 3 out of 4 employees have safe access? How can you suspend a cashier for ""unauthorized overtime"" when you asked them to stay over? I'll tell you how.... bad management. And how can you expect your employees to feel confident going to corporate about a problem with management when the district manager and the general manager are besties?"
good,"A typical night at work is cleaning the store and taking care of customers and the gas pumps. Any issues that arose with the gas pumps I had to call or email the help desk and fix the issues since I was the only one working at this time of night with no managers..  Believe it or not the most enjoyable part of working here was the fact that I get to work alone. The co-workers did minimal work, and the managers never enforced anything and when they did it wasn't in the correct manner. The hardest part of working overnight was when none of the other employees can be found, its up to me to find them so I have to stop taking care of my customers to go find the other employees. There is also no security during the day or night, so if something were to happen there is no way to try and stop it."
good,"A typical day would be answering telephones to take orders, seating people at their table, taking their orders and delivering their food. Guests are great.. Management was terrible, people requested off all the time and got it (favoritism) while us other employees wouldn't get the days we asked for off. I loved my job but the management was terrible."
good,"if you aren't friends with the service writers, you will not get any work. they pay on commission. I worked for 8 hours a day, all decent paying jobs were thrown to the established ""crew"".  multiple jobs I had started were reassigned once I found anything past a tire. the  ""crew"" utilizes high turnover to make good money. they have the new people do the pm, tires, cleaning, running for parts. those are all none paying jobs.  the manager was nice tho."
good,"A typical day at work would be to stock all hot food, keep coffee makers full, clean constantly and interacting with customers. I learned to stay patient with customers even if they're a little too up front, angry or rude. My coworkers there were awesome people."
good,"Working for TA is great and lot of the people hired now there are usually part-time teenagers that don't care about their job or people that have been there forever and ever and don't want to go anywhere else. This is the perfect job for you if you want to be a cashier and are not really interested in moving up. If you are part-time you can only receive up to 29 hours of work which means no benefits for you. It is unfortunate that by next year, if you do not have benefits then you will be fined around tax time. But if you work only 29 hours a week, you can't really afford it. So prepare to have no life, and possibly look for a second job while you're at it, and make sure you don't put that you can work any hours on your application. TA is looking for those who are committed to the job and are professional. You can't just go in, do the job and just go home. You're responsible for a large amount of your work which plays a big part in the store itself. Honestly, if you're a teenager looking for a summer job, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS JOB. But if you're someone who is willing to put in the time given and is ok with working ANY SHIFT and is alright with being called in on what you thought was your day off. I would recommend this job;"
good,always something new to learn. good hours. boring job at times. customers were hard to deal with. management was constantly changing.
good,"I honestly enjoyed my job as a cashier at the fuel desk. I started on days, then moved to overnights. Working overnights was a huge mistake. The schedule ended up conflicting with my husbands on-call schedule. Manager could've done a bit better when responding to this issue and it was because of the managers response as to why I quit. Also, there is not enough coverage on the overnight shift."
good,"The company has a very stressful environment because you are being watched physically (“leads” walking around) & through the computer, monitoring your work modes. You only get either one 30-minute break or three 10-minute breaks & that doesn’t count bathroom or personal time. They put you in training for like 4-5 weeks, which is nice, but once you’re on the floor it’s almost impossible to getting help even though there’s always someone walking around or watching you. 10/10 wouldn’t recommend."
good,"It all depends on Management. Some managers are great, others not so much. Too many politics and too much rigidity at corporate office. Need more local flexibility."
good,"Not a job for the lazy or weak willed.  Do not expect to do nothing and get paid, always something you need to be doing, so do it.  The job doesn't pay that great but it's good for someone starting out, but you must have computer skills!"
good,"I clock in walk my store, check on shelfs for outs, and items that need straightened. Check my planograms, check if items need brought in from the trailer out back.  Make a list for items that need to be stocked.  Two days a week i would put a truck with merchandise out and away in the back.  Help customers if need and answer the phone.  Paper work and order 4 times a week."
good,There was not a lot of predictability of the job. there was not a lot of consistency with my instructions on how to do the job. Whenever I was asked to do certain job tasks each shift manager gave their own instructions.
good,"T.A. had potential to be a fun workplace, but the favoritism from management to certain customers has the possibility of souring ones position. The job task were not difficult."
good,"There are a lot of long term employees at TA HQ but unfortunately I was not one of them.  Co-workers are great, micro-management is not.  No one in Systems is happy."
good,"We are paid an Hourly wage plus commission however commission is unreliable.  "
good,it is corporate owned now and too much micro-managing. But the customers make it worth to work there. Greeting them with a smile and being pleasant makes their day
good,A typical day at TA would be clocking in doing a quick inventory check count your cash drawer watch the counter while the shift before you counted their drawer down verify the cash for the previous shift make cash drop run printouts for inventory management write down starting numbers for all items required. do a floor check front and face the shelves and stock as needed answer fuel desk as needed when customers needed fuel  process credit cards and check for payment or run in house accounts as needed.
good,The company was alright to work for. The corporate bosses do not care about you. you are just an employee number to them. There was no teamwork outside of the location
good,It is an ok place to work. Management is hit or miss most days. My biggest complaint is how they don't realy work with you if you have drs appointments.
good,"Nothing special it's just another cashier job,...... Really slow, lots of crazies and drinks..... Gets quite entertaining the later it gets perfect for slackers"
good,"If you clash with a co-worker even in the slightest, you will become the target of all retaliation. Especially if that co-worker is good at playing the victim. You may even spend a few minutes crying depending on how sensitive you are to getting yelled at when you're already stressed to the max and can't handle one more thing only to get screamed at when you do nothing wrong. If the managers have a favorite and it isn't you, don't even try to get them to see how that favorite treats you or anyone else. They won't listen. They only care when their favorite complains about you. Even when you try to get them to see the truth, unless you can befriend your other coworkers that witness that favorite treating you or anyone else poorly, you're better off just brushing off the BS from the co-worker and focusing on getting home."
good,"TA isn't a bad company, they just don't pay you decent wages. They have poor management. You have to get a weigh masters certificate to work there. Just so much to do, and not enough employees."
good,"I learned a great deal about the truck services industry and, surprisingly, about real customer service... putting yourself in their shoes and seeing problems from their point of view, reach makes problem solving a major priority."
good,It's an alright job. It helps pay the bills. There is not really any room for advancement and the not all the employees do their job.
good,Very exciting job because of the different truckers and their different needs.  The job was in a casino which was a smoky environment but all in all it wasn't bad.
good,Management is very poor. The assistant manager should not be left to do everything. Only getting to sleep a few hours and being called all the time after work because the other managers are not awake is not exactly fair and was above my pay grade.
good,"Wait on customers, count drawer down after shift, help stock shelves wait on customers, count cigarettes, make drops of money throughout the shift, clean the shelves, face the isles, change garbage, and clean all countertops."
good,I enjoy my customers the best. Management needs work (training). Co workers are bearable. Working with machinery that works some time.
good,"the hardest part of the job was working mid-shifts days"
good,"A typical day of work consist of oil changes, brakes, inventory, tire repair, inspection of the truck and trailer also installation also cleaning of the work place. I've learned a few things form how to properly install brake cams and bushing, and many other task, also how to to work in a fast work environment. My co-workers were very knowledgeable, they was also good at working as a team. It was not a difficult job at all the changeling part of the job was to get use to the fast working environment and locating the parts in the parts room. Going to work and learning something new from good and knowledgeable people."
good,"a very busy place, you will keep your self busy, a busy store to maintain"
good,The job of TA truck stop was an experience that made me realize I need more in life. So by having to service behind Truckers. They showed me expired me obtain barre class A CDL
good,"Started out as a good job but soon you realize that the managers are lazy and don’t really care about the employees unless it benefits them. The pay is pretty decent, but the work environment isn’t entirely worth it."
good,It's ok to work there.. decent co workers. They work with your schedule. Truck drivers can be grouchy. Gotta have good customer service to deal with them.
good,"Every day was at times challenge  w management  n others."
good,It was the job I needed at the time. They don’t offer benefits and the pay is minimal with very few raises.  It’s an ok starter job and there are several departments to choose from.  It’s a 24/7 Business
good,"Travel Centers of America is a company that portrays good management and a good environment, but doesn't deliver. Managers are more focused on being friends with the workers and playing favoritism rather than focus on the people who actually do their job. They are a company that over work their employees without compensation, and is just all around a bad place to be employed."
good,"Upper management discriminate against women and African Americans. I was terminated for inventory shortages. The General Manager wasn't held accountable for anything. I was doing three persons job (Cashier, Inventory, and Assistant Manager). I was let go for failure to control inventory but the inventory was in good standards. I was told there would be b.c and investigation on the alleged miss inventory but no investigation was done.DONE"
good,Changes within company are never thought out completely before implementing. HR is so far away from each site. Therefore complaints are researched with the most ineffective person. Company does not give any sick time nor cares about the individual employees. Gives very poor training especially in the management entity.
good,Casino area was hit or miss somedays where great others were  dead. Must find ways to  entertain your guests and yourself during slow shifts. Make sure u had enough money for all cash outs.
good,want the greatest place to work but wasn't rhe worst they could have taken better care of employees and given them better equipment to work with and their benefits won't the greatest but people were nice and environment was decent has potential if ran better and I would say if you are new to industry don't work there if u have been around industry for a while you should be OK
good,"cut throat place to work, everyone was all about them selves and not team players.  management is in over there heads because corporate offices like to micromanage."
good,"A good training company. Most employees last 6 months. Commission based pay so paychecks In my case would fluctuate by $500 take home. Also you have to compete for ""good jobs"" with people on your shift. Overtime hardly affects you paycheck. Simply more time equates to more opportunities to generate labor. The technicians who made the most money are in constant pain from rushing through repairs and by doing so not ergonomically lifting heavy components. Always understaffed."
good,"The employees work hard. TravelCenters of America prefers to hire from within. They do a decent job of training their managers. They do not have many perks for the employees. They generally get a yearly raise, only 4 holidays are paid and only if you work the holiday."
good,"Not a horrible place to work, decent pay if you work for it. Hours can be extreme and working conditions aren't the best but overall a good platform job to get yourself on your feet."
good,I like work at Ta because i meet lots of nice people what i dislike about it that management not treating all employee equal always leave me at the register alone not giving me enough help no room for career advancement.
good,I would've suggested a better manager for our restaurant. The new manager pushed off most of his responsibilities on to his assistant which resulted in her resigning. Business slowed down and Suffered because of him.
good,cut throat and fast paced. you have to be fast and know what you are doing to make good money. watch your back because other techs will be after good jobs
good,I told my store manager that i had got a second job so my availability was going to change. As soon as i did that i was treated like the scum of the earth. He purposely scheduled me on days that i worked at my other job. i was given the graveyard shift the night before i had to work daylight at my other job. After 2 weeks of this i came in for a graveyard shift and was told that i was fired for not showing up to work the previous day. the schedule was changed and they failed to notify me.
good,they have you make way too much food only for it to sit up in the window and and throw out after it sat. and then they take the loss out on the manager and fire him/her if the food count is too high. well stop trying to put food up in the window when there is No customers in the day or night in the 1st place.
good,"I work there because I needed to work. Its fast paced. Some customers are hard to deal with. Most truck driver are prima donnas and very rude, I don't much care for them."
good,Working here almost 2 years and still get minimum hours and uneven schedules. Schedules always change and hours are unpredictable but coworkers are great and management is alright.
good,"Decent company to work for. Ok benifits, some chances of advancement. Fairly low pay for the position. Very poor work/life balance due to never having a set schedule and hours."
good,Workers were not held responsible for the job they did. If someone did a hard task and someone just sat there and did nothing the manger would not know the difference. The manager just sat in her office all day and really didn't interact with the workers.
good,"every day was the same. I worked a cash register, counted my till in and out, helped customers, cleaned the store, then went home."
good,"Its like any other customer service job. Hardest part of the jobs is dealing with picky or rude customers. Coworkers are ok, but their is a lot of gossip."
good,I love my job at TA but I dislike the shift unfortunately I was given this shift because I was in need of more money and what was suppose to be only 2 weeks turned out to be 6 months. I'm more of a morning of afternoon shift but they cant help me so I need a new job.
good,"I enjoy most of the people I work with, but there is one lady there that does nothing but complain, and I mean every time that I work with her, she is complaining about something and wants people to give her money, and I seriously would be surprised that she would pay the people back."
good,Work here after high school was fine for me at the time  was not what I was looking for but out cash in my pocket. Nice for ppl in the trucking ind..
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with. Had a lot of responsibilities such as counting register once you go in, helping truckers with fuel and whatever else they may need, sending and receiving money, selling fuel, transacting a lot of different kinds of checks, answering phone calls and answering questions, translating for Hispanic truckers to mechanics.. etc"
good,"Really fun job, you interact with drivers from all across the country. As a service advisor you will write up work orders, contact companies, order parts and bill out invoices. The only downside is that there isn't that much room to advance."
good,"Needs better management and employees who know what they are doing, hard to to my own work with having to assist everyone else at the same time..."
good,"Most of my days working at this company were spent waiting for customers to come in, cleaning the store, filling out papers and answering phones."
good,"busy at times"
good,"A typical work day would be clocking in, count your register, ring up customers, check the coffee/to go area, put up back stock while dusting, fronting and facing, if it's a Monday or Thursday you have delivery trucks to put up (Mondays there are two trucks),relieve cashiers for their breaks/lunches. Ensure that the coffee area still looks good and fully stocked, stock the cooler, check expiration dates, dump trash, of course you are assisting customers the whole time as well. Count down and leave for the day. "
good,the work in itself was very easy such as diagnose and make repairs but the scheduling was very difficult because of the short staff making the hours long and hard for not very much pay
good,They worked with my schedule i needed and i had off days that i requested. I was there for a 1 and 9 months never received a raise or the things that someone was to obtain over the time i was there. My co workers for the most part where awesome. The management not so much. My new boss was very stand offish and didn't really communicate he left that up to the assistant manager or the pic (person in charge).
good,Company philosophy seems to have changed from a company that realizes that well trained well paid associates and managers translates to return customers.
good,"I enjoyed working with my employees and my employees loved working with me as well. I learned a lot from Popeye's and told to run a Subway. Big transformation for me. The hardest part was learning to run a whole different franchise, it took awhile but I got the hang of it."
good,management didn't really care about staff. It was really dirty and up to employees to clean excrement after truck drivers. Turn over is 100 percent.
good,"customer service based company, 24/7 365 days.  Based on time management and customer experience."
good,"arrive at work and clock in  before 11 pm, would  check the  coffee pots first then ready my registers  for the night before the  prior shift eneded, maintaining / cleaning the  food bar as well as keeping fresh coffee, Communicating with customers dealing with gas and deisel transactions, along with trendar transactions as well, Cashing and dealing with truck driver cards all of that was fun but not when you get robbed cause the  building lacked security."
good,"I enjoyed everything but my hours. I would go from working the overnight, to afternoon, to morning shifts, all in one week."
good,This was a stable company to work for but there was little to no room for advancement. I was one of the lucky few.
good,The company does offer its full-time employees fairly good benefits. Health 401k and paid time off. If you are willing to travel for this company you can make great money. They do have several other locations within a hundred-mile radius that they will send you to work at. Company-paid travel and hotel expenses. I really did enjoy my two years of employment there. The only downfall is the local location for this company it's in major decline.
good,"Shop assistant manager with no manager for our store.  Overloaded in work and short handed .   Makes for a stressful life.  Inventory, customer grievances and lazy employees who know everything about doing your management job but cant do their own job.   Our manager quit and never replaced by corporate office."
good,Blah fast paced. Poor work environment. Hostile workers seeing as you had to fight for work to make money. Management was only worried about selling stuff and not about safety or concerns of workers or customers. Always got lippy with anyone
good,Depending on the shift you worked you would leave later then expected due to lack of people to cover. Then you would get reprimanded because of leaving late. When ever you asked for a promotion they would just walk around it. never really gave opportunity for growth. expected to solve every issue even if its not in your department.
good,The business is open 24-7 so depending on when they need you. I work for 6 months over night and I was hired to work 2pm to midnight. Once you start working a shift it very hard to switch shifts.
good,Its good for the giu on the street to learn how to properly work on commercial vehicles in a safe manner an good stepping stone company with a good learning program
good,Not a bad job you meet a lot of new people. the management is not bad and you get many opportunities to advance. the atmosphere is fun and they provide a discount to employees in the store.
good,Working for travel centers of america my first 5 years was new and exciting fast pace some stress.  There over 200 site in the usa.  You are able to transfer too any site that has an opening.  You can move up corporate ladder. There  are training class offered.
good,"its a good place to start off , but the managers need work , other than that the experience was ok . it been a while and im sure people have changed so it might be better now from when the managers girl friend decided to steal ."
good,"Overall decent employment; however, the pay scale is based on commission and a.s.e.'s held. Also you compete for labor with every other mechanic working your shift"
good,"Fast paced work environment, commission based pay. Worker friendly environment that pays for ASE and training advancement. Benifets and paid time off are provided"
good,The company can be great to work for. They provide a learning environment for their employees and also provides technical training. There are advancement opportunities for employees that are in consideration of continuing as a career employee.
good,The Field manager and I didn't get along I was there 5 years and she decided to let me go for reason's she accused me of taking  money when there was proof I didn't and she hired back people that was stealing had me as no rehire I enjoyed working there made good tips the managers I got along  with  I works with others servers that I I loved working with was a day maker
good,Due to broken promises in the verbal contact re-guarding my pay after several conversation with the district manager. We were unable to renegotiate my contract. I chose to leave on good terms and was very thankful for the opportunity.
good,They grew to big and have 3 different Manager levels after the general manager before anyone get to corporate. This leads to 3 different ideas on how anything should be done. Make confusion and stress for unit Manager and crew.
good,This job is a low paying job and you will be treated as a low paid employee. Questionable business practices in for most departments a lack of leadership
good,The job was not hard and could have been better. It had ok working environment but you are limited to what you can do and if you want to have a relaxed work place. This is not the place to work at.
good,I really enjoy my coworkers and the job itself but management is only for themselves and no one else. Company has great stuff but this locations management is terrible. I thought I had a career but not with this management. Forced transfer or else I would've lost my job. It's all about their bonuses and nothing else. Repair old equipment over and over when it should've been replaced. After 5 years to be treated like I'm no-one just shows me I wasted my time and effort.
good,Shadow trained with a highly trained Technician for 6 weeks. Training is really good. Pay rate is terrible for new guys. Bi-weekly pay periods. Schedule was all over the place week to week. High commission jobs always given to same techs. Good stepping stone if you need training.
good,"A typical day as a General Manager involves a couple hours of paperwork, handling vendors, managing staff and ensuring customer happiness."
good,Be prepared to come in on your days off police half hours no benefits a lot of gossip and drama don't get the days off that you asked
good,A lot of judging. Very hostel environment from other employees. Worked very hard and did not seem like the management worried about it. Not very caring on the way the food is put out or away.
good,"I love the university. It needs an overhaul of its culture, but it provides many opportunities to faculty, staff, and students. Great leadership, but that is due to change."
good,"I did not like this job, there was a lot of employee turn over. Corporate management not involved enough with day to day operations."
good,"During my time there the majority of it was spent working nights as a cashier and as a housekeeper. I respect that I learned so much about the trucking industry because it helped me have so much more respect for the drivers. Co-workers were nice and pleasant and some still remain my friends to this day. As for the management, they were mostly pleasant and friendly."
good,I would go in everyday count the safe make drawers make sure all my cashiers were at their right location make sure the porters were doing their job. through the night I would give breaks fix register problems take care of the customer service calls then I would make drawers and count the safe.
good,"my work day at walmart was never boring,there was always something different going on. everyone i worked with had a great personality. friendly,happy people. days never seemed to drag on. i would have to say the hardest part of my job was black fridays,giving that there is never enough cashiers.black fridays was one of those days you learn to never expect anything or do anything other then stand there in one place and check out  customers continuously."
good,it's hard to count on a good pay day. some dayes you make good money and others you dont
good,It was an okay experience. Not a career or full time wanted job.
good,"worked 50 to 55 hours a week, sundays and mondays off"
good,"management is very much a profit first with out propper planning company non competitive pricing nonemployee friendly attitude though stated in their statuses and bylines,caring employees caring lower level non corporate manager good with thereory fails at implementing execution and helping with said execution"
good,"long hours, working all shifts required. all holidays required. fun guests and staff. responsible for all areas of business including financials."
good,"A typical day at Ta was clock in, go to work, clean up other co-workers mess which put in a lot of over time, Management was terrible and unorganized, co-workers were good to get along with, the hardest part was missing a lot of school."
good,Managed 3 assistant managers and 50 employees.  Very hard to keep staffed for 3 shifts.  Eventual burn out.
good,"A typical day at TA is clock in, count the drawers, run registers, help customers, Cleaning, stocking. do end of shift and clock out. The best part of my job is the customers and fellow employees. I enjoy interacting with them all and having fun. The only complaint I would have is the inconsistancy with managment and employees. No one does things the same way. Sometimes rules are broken and depending on whos working depends on how its handled. It can get rather confuseing at times. I'm use to working in an enviroment where everyone is on the same page and everyone knows there job and the consiquences. The customers are my favorite part of my job."
good,"work hard to keep customers and co workers satisfied.chemical awareness.management flexibility.coworkers content.needed more pay per hour,helping others."
good,A typical day at work is beging with checking emails and talking with other mangers and finding out whats on the agenda for the day. I learned more indepth about budgeting and inventory control and labor and parts control. I am one of the managers in the Ta co-workers are great. hardest part of the job is being in five hundread places at once. Customer satisfaction and employee retention.
good,Good pay and benefits. Flexible and understanding. Can learn alot if willing to. Room for advancement if wanted.
good,"listening to truckers stories while i work on there rigs,meeting different people and learning about there problems"
good,"A typical day at that job was frying chicken, making deli sandwiches, cashiering people out, keeping everything clean."
good,"it was a part-time position, hours ranged in a 24 hours period. most coworkers were pretty cool. one manager was unfair and perverted and didn't care. wasn't much advancement opportunity available anywhere. got to deal with a wide variety of different people and that was cool. sometimes it was really busy you cant hardly think straight and other days you had to look for things to do."
good,Customers sometimes can be ugly just keep a positive mind. Trying to make customers happy to come in. Other employees are sometimes hard to get along with.
good,"wasn't trained very well. The l casino part of the TA was very new. The casino manager had to have emergency surgery the day after I was hired, The casino part was fun and you got to meet and know all sorts of people from all over the pace"
good,Commission based salary you make what you do. I am a very hard worker and made the most money as a tech. Management didn't get paid as much I i made that was the reason for not wanting to be manager.
good,"Just do your job at and you we'll be alright...the expect the best for their customers as any other business would you definitely will have to cater to the Truck drivers,the hotel guess as well as the walk in customers. thanks"
good,Always hireing due to fast turn around rate. Fair oppertunity for advancment however. Fast pace and always something new. Depending on location and department experiences may change.
good,It is a good job if you have availability. Work flow is constant and not much down time. The managers can normally work with you schedule. They pay decent as long as you are willing to exceed in training and working on truck.
good,"Needs better employee/management relations. A lot of feuding between employees. Building needs a lot of work, would give everyone less headache. They put to much responsibility on to one person."
good,Overall a good place to work guaranteed to get your hours management needs a lot of improvement work load falls on a small group of employment who actually work
good,Aquired all of my ASEs taught many of the technicians moved up in the company. Was well trained and given knowledge. The more you seek and attempt to gain the better you will be.
good,never got any breaks management was never there. 90 percent of the customers where complete jerks. there was very few things to do when you finished everything during your shift.
good,it was a fun place to work while in school but i do not see a very big opportunity for advancement they pay isnt the best and the mangers at my location were alright we usually had atleast one thing out of stock and the manager was hardly ever down on the floor in the kitchen helping
good,"I really didnt care to much for this job, I love working with the public though just not fast food companies the most enjoyable part was the public alll different kinds of people came through those doors it was of  course a truck stop"
good,"My manager, the maintenance tech was the only reason I worked there as long as I did. Great guy, great to work with, very knowledgeable about his job. Besides that, upper management was awful, employees were slow and customers were rude."
good,"I was a full-time employee for a 1 year and received no vacation time. I was also apart of the management team but I wasn't paid for the position I was in. The management team didn't communicate whatsoever. The manager could not handle criticism and people telling him no. All benefits offered aren't worth the cost. But other than that, the people were helpful and fun to be around (most of the time) and the job wasn't that hard."
good,I have no comments about the company at this time.  Normal work hours 50 per week.  It's a normal restaurant environment.  Certain times a year high turn over.
good,work wasn't bad. just wasn't as competitive in the pay area as they like to promote. forget about over time cause its not there. You will be busy from clock in to clock out and always meet new people everyday
good,"Travel Centers of America is not a bad place to work over all.  There are opportunities for advancement and as far as the food industry goes, the pay is competitive."
good,Work was usually busy and had to do a lot of work. I learned how to work in a stressful environment and still hold myself together. I also learned about people from different backgrounds and nationalities.The hardest part was having too handle multiple tasks at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job was building a team of employees who became like family.
good,"it was a great place to start out my diesel  career. i personally quickly out grew it and went out looking for more. if you have no clue what a truck is, this is the place to start."
good,Enjoyed working with everyone.  As all retail positions its important to keep our customers happy so they come back again.  The store and restaurants provide a great service to our customers for the products and services that they need.
good,It is a great starter job but it is not a good place to really grow and develop. the management team is not the best and the communication isn't great either but in a pinch this is an okay place to work.
good,"There is no order, managers are rude and incompetent. Customers are always angry (truck drivers). There is very little room to move up and in the FIVE raises I received in 3 years I barely went up a dollar per hour."
good,it was cool I just didn't really have a chance to become more before I got layed off when the econmy slowed down kind of mess my chances up but if I had another chance I  would take it
good,"Was a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work includes always being understaffed and never appreciated, a hot headed manager that expects nothing other than perfection and excludes the fact the we have human error. I learned basic receptionist skills at this job. Management is the reason I am looking for a new job. My current coworkers are useless they worry more about lunch then getting their job done, but the hardest part about this job is not the rude customers but rather the fact that this company takes all it can from you and gives you nothing in return. It punishes the good and rewards the bad."
good,"- Co-workers, for the most part, are knowledgeable and willing to do their jobs"
good,"This is unique form of retail with a diverse customer base yet targeted to a small group of individuals. Every day you meet people from all parts of the country. At TA you refuel their trucks, fill their bodies and meet their everday need in terms of businees materials and personal. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working there, Meeting new people. Learning new things, there was never a dull moment. Management was always easy to get along with and always available in times of need."
good,I've learned how to deal with customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the disgruntled management and the disgruntled employees. I enjoy getting together with some of the employees and accomplishing things in teamwork.
good,"TA has great training once you get past the 6 months of employment and are able to access the ARC system. Then and only then can you get more training at the corporate location which is where you get the advancement. I enjoy the work, just hate being bored. Some of the shifts they have there just isn't any work to be done unless you count cleaning up the place as work. I will say that since I have been working there I have learned heavy duty truck systems and electrical truck systems, which has inspired me to learn more and want to continue working in the industry."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working and dealing with my customers, especially my regulars. I had many customers who would come to the store just to see and interact with me personally because of the great Customer Service they received. Though my coworkers and managers were very rude and unkind both to coworkers and employees, I tried my best to only worry about the job at hand and to take care of the customers. I learned working here that as long as you focus on the job and the goals for the day that it is possible to love your job."
good,I learned how to be a manager.  I really enjoyed my co-workers and staff.  The hardest part of this job was trying to make it profitable after it was neglected.
good,"Management is outstanding on the shop level, but going up the district level it becomes uneasy to work with. Always on your toes to make sure you are not fired over something that which you didn't do."
good,"As a whole TA is a good company but when it comes time to move up i have found it hard to move forward, i am looking for more opportunities and advancements in my career i want to move from working as a mechanic to being someone who makes the calls that makes a company better then the rest."
good,I enjoyed the people and customers but had no way to advance or more up in company.  The hours are all over the place and turn over is high.  Management was good but since I left has gone down hill.
good,Fairly simple food service job. Management was nice and worked right alongside you.  Coworkers were friendly.  Dishes could be overwhelming if the shift before you did not keep up with them.
good,"Bad food,no structure, do not follow serve safe guidelines ,employee do what they want poor pay and it all boils down  to management like having us serve Turkey as chicken"
good,"Pay was not good because we were on low hourly pay until we hit commission.It was hard to hit due to lack of work, I had to work outside along the side of the road in all types of weather,"
good,Overall great location and great people. Always a challenge and glad to meet new people. Had a structure change in management which now makes it harder to move with condensing the team
good,Very fast paste and stressful during busy times when greyhound buses stop in at the parowan location. Vegas location was stressful working all by self
good,Working at TA is an okay job.the manager just don't like talking to the employees.the job is very easy all I did was as a porter cleaning the showers and bathrooms.
good,"Great place to grow and learn. Many opportunities for advancement. However, lack of acknowledgment of success and overwhelming pressure to"" succeed at all cost ""not conductive of a positive work environment. We should always strive to be better but not beat each other up to get there. Hand out, not slap down."
good,"In the past two years TravelCenters of America has taken an active roll in improving the employee work environment, employee benefits and employee engagement."
good,fast paced and hard work. Company will train you in what ever you do. Fun place to work most of the time. Most  of the managers are understanding for all issues.
good,The job is not bad you just have to go in and do your job a d really stay to yourself in order to stay out of all the foolishness that goes on i mean its a nice place to work but be mindful
good,"Full-time hours. Consistent work. Nothing more. The majority of the other entry-level employees are really hard working and friendly. The best part of the day honestly, was break time."
good,Company cannot keep management due to unrealistic expectations. I liked working here but could not stay because of the demands of management. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting to learn the trade but you must have a flexible schedule.
good,"was supervisor over janitorial crew, cleaned truck stop, changed diesel filters, gas filters, checked fuel tanks, pump water out of tanks, cleaned showers, bathrooms"
good,"Unless you’re shooting for upper management, this is just a second job or a step up job. Something used to move on to better things in life. But the environment was great and I really liked most of the people I worked with."
good,"no  opinion nothing to say...I don't wish to review, it was a long time ago it is very stressful..all work not many rewards The employees work really really hard there"
good,I liked working there I am just moving to a different town there was plenty of work for the most part just need some different oppertintes and better pay
good,"To be clear, as a whole, this is a wonderful company. However- in the RoadSquad dispatching center (next door to HQ) it is an endless sea of new faces as they shuffle through people coming into positions and leaving or being fired from positions. The pay is great, depending on how long you end up staying. Management within the building is continuously changing. 3 different managers during my 8 months there. Certain supervisors pick favorites and some go as far as to pick employees they don’t like and creating a cause for separation from the company. As a RoadSquad dispatcher you start at a minimum of $16 hourly and get 3 weeks of paid vacation from the start. There are perks to this job, as long as you’re on someone’s “good list” but watch out if you don’t like to play into workplace politics because it will chew you up and spit you out. Good luck!"
good,Too much administrative work to effectively run the restaurant. Many hours used to deal with staff. Not enough to deal with offering customers better things.
good,"Research bounced checks, paid utility bills for building, reports, "
good,"Interesting place to work very fast paced lots of cleaning making food and coffee sometimes had to work alone, used your vacations days if you missed work for any reason. Did not give yearly raises. Generally it was a fun place to work because you meet a lot of different people. It is a very hard job cause people from different cultures."
good,"There were fast pace, but some slow periods as well, you could start off with working behind the grill; but end up prepping, and working the buffet table as well."
good,Was a good place to work for got me certified in all the areas I'm certified in. As well as the staff being very friendly with a great company to work for recommended to anybody
good,From what I remember TA was a good place to work. Environment was good but time to time the truckers can have attitudes but I have thick skin and my father is a truck driver so I could relate.
good,Nice shop setting to learn the basics of the profession.   Willing to train new employees. Wages set on commission. Very nice to get paid more for doing more.
good,"You'll get plenty of hours at Popeyes most likely, because the turnover rate and general treatment of workers there is mediocre. Watch out for the weekend and Mondays for high customer volume, in the summer too."
good,"They are Under paying, and have lots of drama.  good people overall. They have a ton of call ins because nobody ever wanted to work especially on third shift"
good,The required you to clean the store from front to back. Some or must days if one shift didnt do there part then of fall on you and the head manager would question the job you did after.
good,Not the best place to work but it did the job the for the time being. The hardest part of the job is that the truck drivers could be very mean and hateful.
good,"Good job, but just was going through something within moving would recommend if you live near Ashland. The most enjoyable part of the job of to be the 11$ pay rate I consider that above average for a fast food business."
good,There are no benefits available for the first year at all. They were also critically understaffed when I left which caused the rest of the techs in the shop to be run rampant.
good,The job is okay if your just starting on your own other then that dont waste your time. I dont think they pay enough for working 3rd shift. I work 70-80 hours every 2 weeks and only make 600
good,I worked at Travel Centers of America in the restaurant as AGM for several years. Working all holidays are mandatory. Being a single mom working 12+ hours a day all hours of the night including holidays wasn't worth it for me. POOR MANAGEMENT!!!
good,"During my time with TCA, I cross trained employees and helped reduce labor and food cost. The best thing about TCA was the bond I made with the surrounding community members."
good,Only a few employees did their job others would just do what they wanted Agm were the worst in the world. You not do anything about lateness of poor work ethics
good,"Poor managers, poor pay, no advancement opportunities, poor raises, no benefits paid for, what can I say... nothing to write home about..............."
good,When they discontinued my position in the restaurant my manager helped to transfer me to the popeyes. I was young and it was a great job for someone starting out or just trying to stay afloat.
good,"Learned to do a job of cleaning at a fast-pace, I enjoyed meeting new people daily, the boss where ok. The hardest part of the job was when you had to work alone doing a two person job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on the faces of the customers after they ate their meals. Knowing that they were satisfied put a smile on my face.
good,"Worked here for 3 years can be anything there if your willing to work for it, Great people, just keep eyes open for bad people, typical truck stop job. I'd still work there but you can't live on 11$/hr, and if you have the wrong employees getting hired money comes up missing and you don't wanna be the guy responsible."
good,"Management lacks a lot, working environment is unorganized. Learned a lot about costumer service this wasn’t my first actual job. Was a tad bit stressful at times."
good,The staff was knowledgeable but it seemed like everyone was always worried about job security . I can't say whether or no that has improved. Overall it's an opportunity to earn wages.  It's what you make it.
good,Wash dishes mop clean vents work doubles as cook get oe rders out fast work work work work work work wont get rasie no bonus no thank you nothing just a check that's under your work output
good,"great place to be trained in not only the basics of diesel technician work,but also gives you the chance for outside training through the company. flexible hours."
good,It was cool fixing diesel trucks and helping drivers and learning have to fix them in a hassle and learning new things everyday there. There was always other workers helping each other
good,I loved working at ta was fun caring place to work.Friendly customers.Wouldn't have been a bad job if I had the management support behnd me and supported me when needed.
good,This company pays on commission your check depends on how much work comes in and your ability to perform the task at hand after working for this company for an extended amount of time you have the opportunity to expand your knowledge the send you to school
good,I enjoyed working at the travel center because it was a truck stop and I got to interact with people from all walks of life and hear some of their life stories.
good,"Very fast paced.  Easy job but, very minimal respect and concern given to people that want to learn.  Not a very good company to work for if you are not a male."
good,i liked the job i was pregnant with twins and it was summer and it was hot so that part sucked and i worked 2 midnights a morning shift and an afternoon shift every single week so it was crazy.
good,"Had family problems, Early on management knew what was going on and still terminated me!! No warning at all..And I really liked the job!! Wish they had given me a second chance to show them my work ethic!!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different customers and co-workers. Loved meeting new people of all different walks of life. Hardest part was relocation and having to move stores.
good,Fast paced restaurant setting where you adhere to both the brand standards along with TA Standards. Must maintain high level of Food Safety standards and acheive passing score in 5 assessments per year. Unlike most food service jobs the weekends are the slowest days of the week.
good,steady pace job fun people to work with and interesting meeting people. Would go back to work there if I ever needed to. I do miss working there. Long hours made short due to staying busy
good,"Co workers were a little harder to work with, we never knew how long someone would stay. Management was loose on enforcement of task completion, safety, cleanliness, and organization. Lots of hours available, dress code easy to work with (casual with a smock), advancement to a higher position takes a lot from all party's."
good,"Good place to start and gain experience . Not much training . Pay is by commission and there's a lot of competition between techs to get the ""easy/ best paying job"""
good,A normal day is taking care of the driver's purchases and working closely with my co workers.  We take care of our deli and coffee bars during an 8 hour shift.  The only thing I dont like is dealing with drivers that think they are the most important thing in the world.  Everyone in my book is equal.
good,"Working in the Arby's at TA was a great opportunity to learn new things and gain experience as it was my second job. A typical day consisted of prepping and making the food, taking and handing out orders all while catering to the customers needs.The staff and management was great ad taught me a lot about customer service and many other things as well. Although the working conditions were at times tough, overall I enjoyed working there and all the knowledge I obtained."
good,"stock shelves."
good,Cleaned the showers and bathrooms. Talked to lots of people everyday. That wore on trips. I liked hearing all the crazy story's from truckers. It could get very busy.
good,"Good people to work with. No room for advancement. Same thing everyday. Learned problem solving. Family owned but, then bought out by a corporation."
good,"Fast pace, great experience. Customer service was a huge part of the job. I received a lot of management experience. Co-workers were fun and upbeat. The best part of the day was pre-shift meetings and agenda reviews."
good,"fast paced and on a run, management needs some work, co-workers were  fun and enjoyable, the hardest part was working graveyard"
good,"Site Management was very good.  They lead an up-beat crew, making for a very friendly and fun workplace.  Nice staff 24-7, very pleasant business,"
good,Drivers can be rude and crude and very perverted and you have to take it with a grain of salt. The people are fun to work with and one of the managers are absolutely wonderful to work with.
good,"Simple responsibilities were sweep, clean, and perform simple tasks on the register. The hardest thing about this job was to control a packed line."
good,An easy job as far as the work was concerned but the major issue was the manager hiring friends and not enforcing rules when it came to certain people. The customers were great and most of the co-workers were good people. I would have rated better if all employees were treated equally.
good,"*slow but consistent"
good,"Hardest part of the job is math. giving out change correctly."
good,"There isn't a typical day here.  Thy sky is always falling.  Low pay, bad benefits.  Health screening."
good,typical day at work involves counting in the register as well as counting cigarretts and dvds. then you move toward the grab and go where you insure the coffee and other things are fresh for the drivers and customers. co workers are excellent always friendly and easy to get along with. very good working team. always get the job done. management could use improving but for the most part they are good.  and enjoyable part about this job is meeting all the differnt people that come from different places
good,"•	Provide superior customer service while performing all cashier duties."
good,fast passé and good customer service it was fun working there the only thing I didn't like was there benefits weren't very good.
good,"Work day was greasy, I learned a lot about heavy trucks, Management was good, Co workers good, Hardest part was trouble shooting problems, most enjoyable part was the scheduling."
good,"A typical work day consists of cashing out fuel and store transactions all day until the end of your shift. Computers are very aggravating and slow, however us cashiers sweep customers off their feet with accurate, fast and friendly service. Co-workers are friendly, don't work as a team very much it's much more independence. The hardest part about this job is remembering the different kinds of checks and different kinds of ways you can process just ONE transaction. Also not being able to leave the Fuel Desk. Most of the time I just stand in that one spot all day. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is I actually get a 30 minute lunch break every shift. And most of the time my lunch was FREE!"
good,"Commission-based job. Sometimes very busy but other times techs sent home from lack of work. Benefits were not the greatest to begin with, then were dropped to lower coverage, higher premiums."
good,When you come in for the day you clock in on shop time and wait for a truck to come in that needs work done. A work order is made and the mechanic picks up that order by clocking into the truck on the computer. The mechanics rotate the jobs by who is up next on the shop clock. Once a specified dollar amount is reached then you are working on commission only. We also do road calls where we go out in a service truck to repair  trucks. Hardest part of the job is waiting around for jobs to come in. Most enjoyable part of the job is the independence .
good,Working for Popeyes is a fast pace job. Great people and great customers.
good,"show up on time, clock in, and start working which i did janitor work such as cleaning up bathrooms sweeping and mopping."
good,"all depends on the staff, it is a fast paced restaurant that can easily become stressful."
good,working for this company was fun and love learning new things here. i learned how to manage a crew and make them understand how i wanted things to flow on my shift. I like the management team here when i was working with til jun of 2004. My hardest part of the job was being a rookie supervisor my first month of learning everything. Just loved working that's all.
good,"I worked night shift here. Other than the occasional cranky truck driver I enjoyed this job. I loved working with all my co-workers, there was nothing hard about this job and overall I very much enjoyed it."
good,Enjoyed the face pace environment and getting to meet new people. Management was good learned skills related to cashier and waitress.
good,I learned how to look up many of the parts we use on a daily basis for different trucks on the web. I also learned how to find part numbers from local vendors to find parts in our inventory for the daily work.
good,Learned about communication with different people. Worked well with co-workers. A typical day was meeting new people.
good,was a alright place i was just starting out.theyll teach if you want to learn
good,typical work day would consist of working on trucks and trailers a wide variety of problems.
good,I couldn't advance with the knowledge and wisdom that I had so I left for more advancement
good,This job is perfect for a college student. There isn't enough hours to support a family. It is a faced paced environment. I love helping customers.
good,Handled customer service calls and issue. Communication via telephone and email.
good,I enjoyed working with TA but the employees and manager I worked with did not seem to do much and left everything for someone else to complete. 
good,"Worked only part-time but the times I was there things were out of control, always."
good,I worked the overnight shift and that was the hardest part of my job. The best part of my job was the customers that came through the door.
good,"No work/life balance, company culture is great in theory, however very little support from upper management"
good,The hardest part of the job was the hours. An operation that runs 24 hours can be demanding.
good,24hr repair shop. if there is no work your not making any money. when the shop is busy you can make money. schedule is not set.
good,I enjoyed the challenges I faced going into this job. However what was disappointing was the fact that the employees there did not enjoy change. The hardest part of the job was getting the employees to handle change.
good,work on large diesel trucks and trailers. operated forklift
good,"great place to work, small tiny, also fun the managment team could have provided better stability to the company and gave better results."
good,Got along great with co-workers however did not like the shift hours.
good,I enjoyed my time there. It was my 1st full time job and I learned a lot
good,I worked at three different location while employed. I felt comfortable and confident with most managers and spent nearly 11 years with the company. I trained in multiple positions and multiple departments.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at TA very much! I enjoyed my co-workers and my customers. The daily task were never too much for me because there were always enough people there to even out the load. My problem was never the job, my problem was the general manager. She was rude to her employees and treated us as though she didn’t care to have us or want us and over time that became to much for me so I resigned."
good,Great MGMT for years..current manager not so good. Benefits and advancement once was good but all changing think they will be closing only a matter of time new truck stop built next door witbetterbetter ul
good,"I would recommend TA if you enjoy gas station jobs, truck drivers are nice and polite. Staff is well trained and so is management. I cannot vouch for the Diner, but they seemed nice as well."
good,"I worked on my own everyday in a private office for the site. I started out as a cashier in the restaurant for the first 6months filling in  for the bookkeeper. Then had the opportunity to go into the office as the bookkeeper moved up.  There was a change in ownership, which gave me the chance to move to a central office doing books for the entire site. I learned a lot more from this move, taking on more tasks."
good,"During the peak hours time flies. I learned so much about Comdata, personal checks, and point of sale during my time there. You will be crosstrained in both fuel desk and store transactions."
good,"the job has its pros and cons, if you enjoy meeting people from all over the world than this is a good job for you. the people you work with themselves are pretty nice as well. . .the company itself though is not good at taking care of their employees. the benefits are fairly slim and the insurance is high. . .they will give you as much responsibility as you desire, but will not offer you any raises"
good,It's a easy job poor management no room for advancement for this company. Company do not take care of there workers..there is no room for advancement they want u to do a lot of work for really no pay been there for 7 years still don't get paid enough
good,"Overall TA is a good place to work. The pay is decent, but the benefits are very costly. To balance it out a part time job is a MUST if you need to have benefits. They do offer some overtime and paid vacation days after 6 months."
good,"Great  company for advancement. Working with the public is one of the most satisfying things about this job. It is also a great place if you want to learn, they are always willing to teach."
good,"high turn over rate. hard to keep qualified techs and counter help"
good,making sure i was dependable and on time for work. i learned how to deal with customers and how to greet them. the management was very laid back but i knew the people above them put the pressure on them to make us be on our job correctly. the workplace culture was fairly busy because of the other gas stations and businesses that was around. the only hard thing about working for TA was dealing with the customers. the part i enjoyed the most was being able to help customers and actually knowing how to run a store or a business.
good,Good people and great learning experience. Will hire people with no experience and train them. Will also send them to training class
good,"good place to work barring the management. new management was brought in but because of personal friendships between two managers things were made worse. management was more concerned about making the store look pretty rather than properly train employees or help when needed. managers constantly disappearing together for ""smoke breaks"" that would last double of the allotted 10-15 minute break."
good,The Travel Center of America is an excellent beginner's job. This was my first job and it taught me responsibility and self discipline. the upper management always encouraged me to do better and learn from my mistakes.
good,Graveyards in a truck stop got lonely. It was a great opportunity to meet many different types of people as well as learning to handle situations on your own since there is only one server and no management on shift.
good,"This location is a combined pay point, which means that it is always busy. It is open 365 days a year 24hrs/day. This place is constantly changing and you need to be willing to learn the different systems and adapt to the new policies."
good,Good place to work for and opportunity to make a lot of money if you are in the right location. For the most part you control how much money you make and advancement.
good,"a great place to work and meet people from all around the country,would be  probably bring in more buissness if they brought back the buffee"
good,I worked in the truck shop where I managed the inventory and created work orders. I would hand out the work orders to certain techs depending on the job. I would also sell products.
good,"loved meeting customers needs, management wouldn't work with their employees"
good,Very political and much opportunity for advancement. learned how to manage all aspects of multiple concepts at once Co workers where different. The hardest was the hours most enjoyable was the training and coaching of potential managers.
good,"I have enjoyed the people I work with, the daily workload is simple and manageable, and involves a lot of basic cashier tasks. Management is great, they're all very friendly, helpful, and easy to work for. Customers can be difficult and the job itself can be boring at times, but making someone's day can be more than rewarding."
good,Good company to work for. Very detail training program. Travel Center provided a quality product.   
good,"I worked 50 to 60 hours per week, i enjoyed my job,i started running taco bell then got moved to manager of the repair shop.I was responsible for schedules,safety,hiring, inventory,cash control,ordering.I was also responsible for the profit of my department."
good,My typical day at work is very busy. I have sharpened my kitchens skills while working there. The management is respectful and supportive. I have worked with the General Manager before. My co-workers are a very happy group and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the never-ending prep work. The most enjoyable part of the job is appreciation of my work from the staff and management.
good,The pay was decent and the atmosphere was laid back. Only real problem was corporate. Their decisions or lack thereof caused me to get laid off with no notice.
good,"Was treated well from management and employees, was given all the tools to learn what was needed for the job. Wasn't too keen on working for commission based earning."
good,"At times the Travel Center Of America.. could be very demanding,, but i enjoyed my time working there but my reason for leaving was because the rate of pay"
good,A typical day at work there is pretty laid back everybody works as a team without fussing and arguing the managers work with you whenever needed when it gets busy in the evening between 4pm and 9pm when the drivers all come in at once just to get a quick shower then after that it dies down got good tips too just because we make the drivers feel like they are home
good,"It's a great place to get diesel experience and learn the basics. You will not get much specialized experience, but you will work on all makes and models."
good,when i started at TA i knew i was going to like it i was always busy. All of my co workers were really friendly. My manager was really nice and understood things and helped me out when i needed it
good,"Organization could be a little bit better.  Management team needs to take a more active role in the day to day operations in the shop.  Long term employees seem to get left behind.  Been a while since worked there, things may have changed."
good,"Customer Satisfaction"
good,been with TA for about a year now and I enjoy what I do just wanting to be able to do more then just the minor repair and learn and do more repairs on these truck.
good,"I learn how to stock freezers and dish wash when i was working with this job. As a matter of fact my job mainly consisted of stocking the freezer or fridge and prepping dishes and foods to be used. Most of my co-workers were good workers and they were very helpful in the fact they would stop what they are doing to help out if they could. Maintenance of facility was the hardest part of my job. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of my job had to be the customer service due to the fact i love to help my customers in anyway possible."
good,"I  attempted to pass  6 tests! missed them by 4-7 questions for certification, i did get a/c certified"
good,Management is always in the kitchen making food and if any questions are asked at cash register they always say they always say they told you how to process things in the computer. They are not always willing to assist with questions.
good,"Overall,  the job as a cashier,  is very high maintenance between running the register,  and maintaining the deli.  You have to be very good at multi tasking"
good,Workimg at the taco bell  was a good learning experiance. It's a great working environment. Friendly co workers and great management. I improved on my comunication skills and customer service skills.
good,"Making and packaging pastries, I learnd how to make the pastries. The management was good, work place not so much alot of everyone wanting to be in charge."
good,Travel Centers of America takes great strides in making sure every guest leaves happy. They maintain clean facilities.  Employees make great strides providing good customer service.
good,This job experience was very enjoyable. I met a lot of people from all over the country. I was able to operate the cash register and provide great customer service.
good,"Great small mom and pop shop to start out at. not much room for advancement, no real benefits. good pay, reliable 40 hour 7-3pm schedule. hardest part of the job is customers occasionally, best part being able to learn as you go."
good,"A typical day would involve talking/advising truck drivers on required maintenance required on their trucks, pricing, and sales. Also, communicating with employees performing preventative and unscheduled maintenance."
good,"Checking and verifying Various Depts. for compliance to assigned objectives."
good,"What I learned from TA is multi tasking, reason being because TA had lack of lube techs thats not will to get their hands dirty. Usually a PM services takes at least 45 minutes to 1 hour. When lube techs don't show up for work and theres very little of techincians and I was the only lube tech through out the day I had to do 2 PM's at the same time and finished both trucks in an hour. It helped me to gain experience because I was usually been given a task and I just go ahead and do it. Anything else about this place instead of the pay was good. But ir helped me to gain some experience when I didn't had any experience."
good,Work as team give it your best do your job do what it's takes to succeed to the next level and be respectful to others as you would want to be work smarter no harder be professional help people out with things
good,It has it ups and downs but the people that you work with make the day go better and always there when you need them
good,Decent store with competent management. Most coworkers were friendly and supportive although some younger ones were little to no help. Overnights were often slow but cleaning duties kept workers busy. Upper management out of touch but local management did a fair job. Premises were usually safe and clean. Employee discount offered.
good,Working in this company was sometimes a challenge but I did learn some valuable life lessons.I learned how to handle situations with difficult customers and co-workers. I learned to Work at a fast paced and follow orders per receipt and screen.
good,"It is a great busy place to work. No quality of life. It is a big company. The pay and medical coverage is good. I have learned a lot of manager skills."
good,"I worked as a diesal mechanic making repairs on semi's and their trailers, whatever need fixed. what i learned from this job is too much to list but a few examples are air systems and electrical systems I was the only night shift tech so I had a service writer and drivers as company but the other guys on the 1st and 2nd shifts were outstanding to work with. willing to help, loan tools or whatever you needed. the management was good people too they would do their best to help you with what you needed. the hardest part of the job was the hours i did not like 3rd shift. the best part of the job was meeting people from around the world and when there was time listening to their stories. The pay wasn't bad either."
good,co-workers are great and some of the managers are great with some downsides. hardest part of the job is where multiple people need too
good,I would fix the things that needed to be fixed. I supervised other employees withing my department.
good,I started with this company almost 8 years ago. It was a great company and growing rapidly. In the last few years it has gone down hill fast and hard. In 2017 i had my best financial year in my career with the company and recieved a pitiful at best review that was sent to me in an email to sign and scan back. No personal troop welfare from upper management. Looking to go somewhere that takes care of their managers and doesnt see them as an expendable number.
good,Graveyard workspace was a really fun environment to work for. All the employeess where really kind and helpful to one another. It was a very calm workspace.
good,"Great place to work. Good people, good management. The downside was the amount of physical labor you would be doing on a day-to-day basis. I was the company trainer and had the task of filling the spots with people who could adhere to this much physical work. After working there for 2.5 years I had only advanced in pay $1.10, even though the new hires were being brought in at a higher wage and would make more than me on once their 90 days reviews were over. The management worked well with me in trying to fix this, but you can only do so much when corporate will not allow you to give an employee more than a dollar raise. It was fun, hard work, stressful, unfair, amazing, etc. All in all this was one of the best places I have worked."
good,"It depends on what department you're working in, it can be great or it can be very stressful. Most of the people are great or fun to be around (that includes management). Like any other workplace, things can go well but it could flip at any time. What I learned is you think you're secure in your position but you're not."
good,"A typical work day at Travel Center Of America also known as TA is always a mystery.  By it being a truck stop one department can affect another department no matter what the issue was. We have a truck shop, C-store, and also the Quick Service Restaurant. The General Managers of each department try to work together to help the company and handle issues at the store level."
good,I wish I could go back here and work they were amazing. The customers were also an enjoyment.
good,Management was not very good & would blame others for their mistakes. No sympathy from any management for anything ever. Co workers were the only reason people stayed as long as they did.
good,"The challenge of the entire job. Typing, Data Entry, Input of all Realty listings into 3 MLS's (Multiple Listing Services). Upload of all photos. Price changes, Extensions, Expired, Withdraws etc. Dealing with all the legal forms, deadlines. Keeping files stocked of all current and legal documents. Fax machine, Multi-Phone lines, Customer Service, Money Back Guarantee, HMS Home Warranty. All by deadline requirements. Phone Roster. Schedule showings. Set up for Tuesday meetings. Up keep of showing logs and log book, Preparation for weekly sales meetings."
good,"The atmosphere at Popeyes was that of a team, we would all work together to get the job done. If a problem arose the team would work together to find a solution. Management would always make sure that the team came together to make everyone feel like there job was the most important job. My overall experience was a positive one."
good,Management makes up the rules as they go along.  They basically do not follow the corporate guidelines.  They are really sharp on the criticisms and never give you an at-a-boy.
good,Fast pace customer service environment.  You have to constantly deal with people with low patience.  Everyone is in a rush & you have to keep up with the pace.
good,"Fuel and Inventory count done daily per shift. Restocking store product. Faxing in paperwork to corporate office involving the inventory and store counts. The Management team from upper level continues to try to undercut budget due to economy or political procedures being implemented. Normal coworker life. Dealing with irate drivers due to rising cost, lost time, or malfunctions with store equipement would be the hardest. As for the most enjoyable, would be seeing that the customers leave in a better mood than when they come in."
good,bad management makes for bad days. There was days that I had to be the manager (without pay or respect) because the regular manager only wanted to go out and take smoke breaks. when they get there after you and have taken 13 smoke breaks on your shift alone there is a problem.
good,"Love the people I worked with, management is the only thing I can complain about, along with the fact that you can work 40+ hour weeks for months in a row and they still won't give you full time"
good,"Not a guaranteed 40 hrs. Lots of drama, never have set off days unless you’re higher up in a position. The customers can be pretty rude. Favoritism plays a big part here."
good,"I enjoyed some of the coworkers I had but management seemed to be a little behind. And the pay was ""horrible"" in my opinion seeming the business was so slow and there was no advancement."
good,TA wasn't a bad place to work it was fun most of the time. The customers that came in were the best most of the time. Working long hours wasn't bad just hard with two kids at home.
good,"A typical day at work calls for allot of energy and the ability to lift at least 50 lbs. I learned how to multi task while getting the job done right the first time. Management was very rude and will not work with you if you have transportation problems, even if your trying to get up there and it is your first time. My co-workers were very friendly and make you feel like you are needed. The hardest part of the job was taking out the trash to the dumpsters when really full which wasn't that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was making a difference and having such easy going and friendly co-workers. Most of the customers are truck drivers who have been on the road for a while and they are very exhausted so it was nice to make them feel at home and put a smile on their faces."
good,When I started it was great. After I became the lead I ended up stuck with the crew that didn't like to work. It just got really frustrating after a while.
good,"I worked most of the time by myself, there were supposed to be 2 cashiers during my shift and 1 fuel hand, I ended up being the only one working and that's the reason I have some fuel hand experience."
good,I enjoyed working there for 4 years! As a server you can make good money there. Working in the back of the kitchen is a nice change also. Everyone is nice.
good,It could be good if you didn’t have to deal with the drama. There are some great things about this place but there seems to be a lot of family working together and if you aren’t then it becomes more drama. I don’t mind my manager he’s got a lot of responsibility to do.
good,Ta is not a bad place to work. Could work on communication and working together but all together not too bad. The boss is understanding and reasonable to things going around the store and your personal life. But not alhard to get things done customers are usually pretty nice considering there condituons
good,"I like working here. I would recommend this job to anyone. This is a job for someone just starting out, trying to get on their feet, or looking for something extra."
good,"Great company to work for, however the General Manager of this location was horrible to work with. The amount of hours was very difficult because I have 3 children."
good,It was a great place to work until my shift got changed to graveyard all of a sudden for no reason. Other than that it was fast paced and pretty exciting to go to work everyday.
good,"I enjoy the job itself. I've learned a lot working here. Just don't enjoy that some co-workers leave their work for the other employees to do; and when you express it to the management, they have a talk with the employee but, nothing gets done about it."
good,TravelCenters was an excellent place to work until current management took over. They went from a culture that cared about their employees to a place run by knee-jerk managers. The IT management is especially inept.  The CIO is an uncaring individual who favors contractors over in house employees.
good,Fast paced environment.  Working closely with co-workers and customers.
good,Had lots of buses coming thru and I got along with everyone. The management wasn't all that good but overall it was a ok job.
good,The new managment doesn't show appreciation for employees.
good,Overall fast paced shop. Plenty of opportunity to better yourself as well as pay. The company training really helps you better your knowledge.  Not the cleanest shop and shop tools are not up to date.
good,Ive been here at this place for 7 years and I'm only making 11.83 an hr and I'm supposed to be in the lead position I'm basically doing the job but not getting the pay up grade !
good,I cleaned all the showers and the store making everything look presentable. the management was terrible and found any way possible to find someone to be able to yell at. I was once even yelled at and threatened with losing my job because I took a nap on my break.
good,"While working at Travel Centers of America, I enjoyed working with lots of the people there but I felt as though their management was very poor. They always put the customers first though."
good,for many who do not know working at a truck stop is hard it takes alot of patience and understanding. You WILL have some very difficult customers but you also get to meet alot of people from around the US. It is fast paced and you never know what may happen thats why i love this type of job your always waiting for the unexpected.
good,Some DMs could be more professional. Sick of being called a liar. Sick of being talked to like I don't know what I'm doing or like I'm stupid. Company doesn't pay managers or other employees at site level enough st all.
good,"Great people over there. Great company to work for. Great Bosses. The only thing is that as working a Help Desk Support, you ran across the same issues and they just put bandaids on them until they came back"
good,the job was okay but they make a lot of promises they don't keep. also pay is not to good and understaffed seems to need to build more in the communication department.
good,"Busy light mechanical semi tractor trailer repair facility"
good,"food service prep food cashier and cleaning the only thing bad would be while on break u still take care of customers "
good,"Generally the work day went by very fast and with relatively few problems. From the day I started there I liked my job, and my co workers, everyone worked together relatively well, and we were like family. I still miss working there, my customers, my co workers."
good,Was a very relaxed environment. Loved the co workers! very compassionate. worked well with other jobs. Was only a part time job but would have stayed if offered full time.
good,Has the possibility to be a great job. Management needs to be worked on. The winter is a rough time to make money in the shop as a diesel mechanic. They don't really treat people that put 110% into the job any better than people who put less than 50% into the job.
good,"Requires a lot of mental work, and patience. It is very stressful, and the customers are difficult at best. The upper management can be tough to cope with as well."
good,The company was great for years but has really regressed on the concern of not only employees but also customer satisfaction. It has only been sense November of last year that it has changed.
good,Travel centers of America is overall a good company to work for. They always promote within. Also corporate is very nice team and is understanding the stress of site level complications
good,"i learned how to change tires on semi trucks. i was able to find air leaks on semi trucks and trailers, adn reoair them. i also changed oil and worked on brake systems."
good,"get work orders for tractor trailer repairs"
good,"the most enjoab;le part of the position was being able to develop and create new concepts and teams to execute those operations. I typically worked 5 days per week 10 to 12 hours per day then a couple hours on my days off. I increased my knowledge in being a stronger planner and to build resourse outside of the core of the business - distribution, procurment, and pricing structures"
good,Over all I liked this job. Something I enjoyed waking up to and going to. There was a lot of change in management while I was there and I never believe that's good for any company.
good,"tons of great employees"
good,Altough I enjoyed this employer the pay was not good. It was also no hours and little stablity in the company.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, But management was a revolving door new management does not care about employees only about making money. Job task wise was easy, and fast paced work place."
good,"This job was fast paced and taught me about cash counting and making sure all money was accounted for. I worked with busy, ready to go customers who needed to be taken care of and get on the road."
good,TravelCenters of America is a great company to work for. I am thankful for the opportunity here. I have became more knowledgeable while earning decent money.
good,"Small shop made everyone work several roles. Repairs, customer service, and parts look up were some of the main ones.Not having many people on staff, we all pitched in to get things done."
good,Jobs not bad but its all swing shifts. So no real consistency as far as any other apect in your life. Again no room for advancement unless you are the bosses pet. Regardless of experience on the job.
good,You never got your schedule until last minute. Other than that the job was very doable if you had someone working with you. Sometimes you were forced to work alone on a busy day and it was overwhelming.
good,"Good place to learn and work "
good,Focus on customers rather than competition between servers could have been better but it was overall a great experience.The opportunity to speak to people from all over the country was amazing and I left with many new acquaintances.
good,"Challenging environment, but customers and staff have a good relationship.  The team efforts took some time to build, but overall respect was there.  Having an assistant manager that did not have the drive and focus caused a large problem for 8 months, but only district manager could  do anything about."
good,"Everything was good, I have no complains to give. This is a place of business; however, there are a few things that could be different and that can change. There is nothing wrong with helping others, but some might see it as a true issue of the fact. This is a place of business and everything needs to be ran successfully and proper."
good,Mark Koenke was the store manager. Everyone employeed made it a very fun workplace. We all got a long quite well. We tried to make our days fun and exciting.
good,Very happy workplace. From meeting new customers everyday too interacting with the truckers. You learn a lot about traveling and other people. The cleaning and maintaining the store cleaning is easy. This was really a great job
good,"Over all, TA is great. It is simply one of those jobs that gets old SUPER quick. Same stuff, different day. There are chances to move up, as the company does prefer to hire inside."
good,"You are expected to work, they pay on commission, so if you dont work you dont get paid. They train personal there, so if you dont know how to work on trucks, they will teach you from the ground up."
good,It was a very good place to start fresh out of college but the roadside stuff keeping me out alongside the highway all night long just wasn’t for me. Assistant manager was really nice and helpful. Where as the actual manager had his favorites and if you weren’t one of those you were not a priority to him.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and some employees, but did not agree with management on some issues pertaining to other areas of importance in terms of pursuing education, etc."
good,The Owners of the company are non-caring and tight people !! They dont offer any benefits and Pay is disappointing !! My co-workers were fun to work with !! Constantly busy made the hours I worked go by fastet !!
good,For the most part I really enjoyed working here. It was always fast paced and there always needed to be stuff done. Never a dull moment. I absolutely loved meeting new people all the time.
good,"The people there when I worked there are great, the work was quick paced, and the managers are decent. The only problem I had was the fact that I was still fresh from trade school."
good,"I don't really want to fill this out, but since I can't seem to proceed forward I guess I will anyway. I was a good first job as a diesel mechanic, to learn the trade and has been an educational experience. I do wish I had more advancement opportunities, but was kept in the oil pit so more experienced mechanics could get trucks in and out fast with the harder jobs instead of me shadowing them to learn more new skills."
good,"Was a great place to start, they give a chance to start with no experience and learn all the basics needed for industry. Fast paced and good learning expierence for those who have none."
good,"Expect to work weekends"
good,"This job was challenging and fun."
good,"I enjoyed training new General Managers or helping General Managers who were struggling."
good,"I enjoyed being a merchandiser.  Worked independently with two other employees installing new fixtures and setting to planogram."
good,Ok place to work but pay was bare min and would rarely get raises even if you did great work for them. Don't like to let employees have time with families
good,"I enjoyed the outdoor work an the people I worked around, an also the customer I enjoyed meeting new people an helping them if possible. An made sure I kept the place clean an welcoming for customers."
good,"Was a typical truck service location, somewhat disorganized at times, and foul mood technicians made for a stressful work environment. The compensation was not worth the headache."
good,"I worked P/T and enjoyed working with all the people in that area, the truckers some were nice others were very rude and some didn't speak english. had to count my drawer before and after shift, learned how to use weigh scale for semi-trucks, sending/receiving money, setting up pumps with their company cards or checks. stocked clean area, cleaned bathroom all the time since the cleaning crew was always busy cleaning showers."
good,"My typical day at work consist of taking care of all aspects of putting customers into the shop system, taking care of obtaining authorization from company's, obtaining payments once jobs are completed. I also take care of ordering the parts and keeping track of inventory used. on a average day I process any where from 4000 to 20000 dollars worth of payments in a day. I'm an amazing people person which comes in use on talking to upwards of 300  people a day. I'm currently looking for a new challenge with advancement opportunities."
good,Very fast paced environment. Part time employees may receive up to 35 hours a week. Very friendly coworkers and leadership.
good,This was a good job to work full time and know you are getting a check there was a lot of cleaning and keeping the customers happy by making sure the showers are really clean.
good,very easy place to get a job. they will almost take anyone with a good attitude. the job was easy but the schedule was never set in stone. i enjoyed working here.
good,"Usually a relatively busy day. Time will go by fast and that is always a plus in my eyes. Management is a little off from what other companies use, as far as structure, but it works for the company."
good,"learned a lot about fuel payable and thought that it was interesting.  worked as a temp for the time I was there.  normal 8-5 hours , but was able to come in earlier if needed."
good,they taught me how to work in stressful environments. and what is was like to work with a variety of different individuals.
good,An overall good workplace. It did lack in enough actual training. I certainly enjoyed working there for the three years that I did.
good,"As the FMT (Facilities Maintenance Technician). I had extensive responsibilities ! Which varied daily along with regular scheduled routine , I Was required to obtain a UST (underground Storage tank) Operators License. as well as complete Many online tests for Electrical Knowledge, Carpentry Knowledge, Plumbing Knowledge, HVAC, Knowledge Roofing Knowledge, as well as complete daily weekly monthly and semi annual as well as Annual checklists. Also responsibilities included documenting any fuel spills caused by drivers which were very frequent and sometimes very time consuming as well as documentation for the DEP. Main responsibility was to make sure Diesel Pumps remained  operational and efficient on a regular basis and they were constantly breaking down. Facility was constantly having building issues as well as the Showers for the Drivers and Bathrooms always needing maintenance Mechanically. I was also told I was responsible for the Janitors which were staffed to Clean all the Showers and other common areas of the facility. Many of these responsibilities were not explained at the time of the hiring process. And hence the starting wages I Iater found  were about 20% below industry standards. THe facility operates 24/7/365  and the staff gets very poor benefit package.. This position was considered to be the highest hourly paid position in the facility for non salaried or Diesel Truck Mechanic. Many of the part time staff were poorly treated and often looked down on by management as disposable part time employees. None of Part time workers were paid much over minimum wage."
good,"I worked my way up from a wait staff member to management in just one year with TA's Country Pride, I foresaw over up to 9 crew members during the evening shift. I scheduled the wait staff and rotated the floor to make it fair for all servers to ""get the good sections"". Customer service was my #1 priority, and I made sure each and every customer that entered the restaurant on my shift left full and satisfied."
good,"I really enjoyed this position at TA because of the daily challenges I encountered and the exceptional people I had the opportunity to work with over the years I was there. The best part of this job was there was no typical day since we worked with over 230 stores and multiple business managers in each store and interfaced with a variety of departments in the headquarters as well to make the corporation operate efficiently and profitably. The hardest part of the job was motivating our employees to do the high volume of work  that needed to be done at month end which was very hard and required patience, especially when working with young or new managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching young managers how to be profitable and thus successful and watching them grow in their careers with our company."
good,"a variety of work, good help, good people, hardest part is u work on commission and in winter time work is slow."
good,"In this Job it's ""Who you know"" .  I worked with a great staff . Best employees ever , but higher ups were judgmental on many different levels . Dedication and hard work not so much a plus ."
good,Customers were always interesting and friendly. Management was always friendly and helpful to workers and customers.
good,"Stressful place to work."
good,"work on tractor trailers basic maintance and cleaning shop, road service good pay"
good,I did housekeeping. I also made sure that the customers were satisfied with excellent customer service. 
good,"A typical day at Travel Centers of America/RoadSquad Connect has a VERY fast paced environment.  The ability to multitask, stay organized and pay attention details is an absolute requirement.

good,enjoyed working with different people.Also all the mechanics work together well. 
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. Most enjoyable part was the truckers, always had a joke about something just hated that my schedule was NEVER the same each week!"
good,"TA would go much farther as a company if they would not give out so many freebies to ""keep customers happy"". Most loyal and good customers do not want hand outs they want an excellent experience and great customer service."
good,"enjoyed it, pay could have been better, as well as benefits . overall was a fun environment very inviting"
good,"Reviewing the required work for the day, inventory, waitstaff schedules and drawer handling."
good,Was a learning curve but once you got a hang of the computer system. The hardest part was just adjusting to all the different people you interact with personalities.
good,Flexible schedule.  Opportunities were given to cross train in other departments.  Nice coworkers.  Enjoyed my job.  Was given opportunity to lead others.
good,"Great management, a lot of people interaction, I learned a lot about people and the duties of being a cashier. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked there."
good,I worked in the shop half of my time and did road calls drove few hours out the different locations to work on trailers do pms and fix what ever it was demage
good,"This was an alright place to work. It was above minimum wage, and easy to get lots of hours in. The downside was that the management played favourites, and some of us were slightly overworked."
good,Learning experience it taught me to work with people all over the world tough me to work in a fast pace environment I learned things that school did teach you
good,"just like any other gas station. I cooked cleaned the lots, cleaned restrooms and ran a register. the job was a little to far away from my liking but it was a paycheck"
good,"In the truck service department you deal with a lot of responsibility as far as correctly ordering/inputting the parts used and services of labor provided. Working with 1 to 5 technicians during 2nd and 3rd shift. I've learned a lot about time management and organizational skills. The management is generally great, always working with employees to make things better. The workplace is typically stress free as long as everyone communicates properly. The hardest part of the job is not always being able to help those that come to us as far as scope of services. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am helping people get through their day everyday ."
good,"TravelCenters of America is a truck stop. This is a very challenging place to work, sometimes very stressful. You are on your feet most of the day. Sometimes you have to deal with very rude customers and management does not always back you up."
good,"This is a great place to work. The upper level management can be difficult to adjust to, and sometimes you may not know the tone or how to take them, but then again that is in every facet of life, and if you can't handle that then this isn't the place for you. A lot is expected form you, but if you are willing to make sacrifices to get the job done and adapt to change on the fly well you will succeed."
good,"My site in particular was very fast paced, somewhat chaotic but good spirited. over the previous few months a change in management has taken the site in a new direction but from a field level, the company, overall, was a decent one"
good,work was fun and fast paced just had some minor issues with the higher up management taking advantage.  Problems with paying people the appropriate pay for the job positions.
good,"advanced gas station"
good,"Fairly good work experience with some job security. Not much chance for advancement. Overall not a bad place to work at all."
good,"Days were typically very busy. The servers were not much help, make a list then hand it to me to restock what was needed. Other than that I was pretty much left to my own devices to get other duties done."
good,"on the job training online and travel for classes leading to paid ASE certifications. coworkers can be like any other job some you get along with and some you don't. management can be somewhat lacking. mechanics are paid based on tech level for their commission percentage, if commission is not reached due to you not producing enough billed labor dollars you still get your hourly rate."
good,"It's always the people that you work along with that can make or break a job. In the case of working for TA, I surely made some friends. Management, at least in our store, were awesome!"
good,Travel Centers of America is a decent place to work at.  Many different personalities to handle each day.  The work is not hard but you need to be a self motivated person.
good,"If you enjoy working with the public, this is the place for you.  Promotes from within.  Very busy atmosphere.  Insurance, 401K."
good,My typical day at work was great i really enjoy working for this company. I love meeting new people.i was a very fast pace job. We were always busy
good,"Co-workers were nice and friendly the management was fantastic. It was a good place to work, but computer system needed a update bad. Once everything was learned not much could be learned that was new."
good,I would come in. in the morning and count the safe. Then I would start prep the food. Then by 7 subway would be open to get food. I learned that in the fast food business. its more then just serving food.
good,"Long hours, but usually well compensated monetarily. Though the quality of life did suffer greatly in the position I held the last couple of years."
good,"This is a great place to begin, but is not a certain place for advancement.  Have been offered advancement several times then they turned it down after promotion meeting/dinner!  I have enjoyed my time there but want to advance my career!"
good,Although they don't pay very well and their health benefits are awful it is a pleasant place to work. The job is simple and the employees are usually friendly. The management was friendly and flexible with your schedule.
good,winter season usually slow but spring and summer was great if you want to work extra hours due to being busy. Great money in that. Co-workers were helpful and made the job fun an less stressful. Met many people from all walks of life from various parts of the world.
good,I've learned to be able to work effective and learned and applied new skills within the expected time period.
good,"I would start my day with pulling reports then I would gather deposits of all departments. I would then verify and count all deposits by department. Once the deposits were counted and verified I would proceed with the daily reports. First I would have to balance fuel for the previous day. After I balanced then I would work on reconciling each departments paperwork for the day. This would include entering sales, paid outs, paid ins, comps, and coupons. On Wed. we would enter payroll into PeopleSoft which would then go to corporate. If there were invoices to enter, then we would enter into SAP. Filing, faxing, coping were also part of a day."
good,"Never knew what day by day would bring,so always took every day with a positive mind.I learned many great skills and keep wanting to learn more to open my path in business.Loved the co-workers I worked with.The hardest part of my job was to let other employees free after training.The most enjoyable part was always making sure my coustomers left in a happy satisfied mood."
good,repair any and all items to do with tractors and trailers.
good,"I would patrol desinated areas and check in with management. learned how to work on my own called if i needed back up. I had co-workers but, work on my own most of the time. The hardest part of this job was the overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part learning to makes decision."
good,"Travel Centers of America has a long and popular work history. Great food, managers, and workers. Fast food service and great prices on foods."
good,"As long as you have the ability to learn fast and adapt to various situations, it's a good place to work. They offer decent benefits, and they provide the opportunity for advancement.  You will need your own tools, excluding jacks, tire bars, etc.."
good,Love the people I work with. The bad is the drama created by other departments and pay could be better for hourly employees that actually deserve it..
good,"Started with little to no experience on deisel engine repair, TA provided training to become Freightliner certified and ASE certified master technician. Does not leave much room for advancement after becoming top tier technicians due to having to still perform lower level tech job duties."
good,Many great things about this job. Every day is something new and you meet lots of people from all around the U.S. and Canada. Advancement depends kn your motivation
good,Good place to work when the trucks are in the bays there is money to be made you just gotta hustle.get your ase's and you can make more money. I'm just writing now to make this program happy.
good,The company is decent. There have been many changes throughout the company. Daily tasks have increased tremendously.  The is no bookkeeper do management has to deal with all of the little frustrations that come with bookkeeping.
good,good people to work with and always room for advancement. there are the downs to the job such as the road side service because it is very dangerous but in all its not a bad job.
good,Was a fun job that I enjoyed.  I left for a better paying job but didn't realize what a change in atmosphere I was going to be shocked with.  I miss face to face interaction with the public.
good,Travel centers of America was a very good job experience for me for 3 years. I learned how to do more then 1 thing at a time. I leaned great peoples skills. I handled money and any issues with a customer. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,TA lets you learn all the basics on all the trucks.  great pay for starting out.  Biggest down fall is they give everything to the customer in the name of customer satisfaction
good,"The job requires that you are on the phone throughout your shift.  You receive phone calls and make them  As a Dispatch Agent, you will mostly assist truck drivers who are broken down on an Interstate by dispatching a technician to their location from the nearest shop.  On occasion, management will provide food for employees, which is nice. There's a fairly relaxed culture - not a whole lot of pressure placed upon you to reach certain numbers, which is also a plus because it keeps the employees motivated.  Instead, they incentivize emploees to do well by giving recognition and occasional gifts to top performers.  One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is knowing that you've helped someone who needed it."
good,Never a dull or unproductive moment. There is always something to be done. The work itself is enjoyable and the culture is vast. The environment is casual. It's clean. The staff is diverse and refreshing.
good,Overall good job..they pay decent. The job requires long hours at times. That’s the major downfall. It’s a fast paced job. You also meet a lot of different cultures!
good,Great place to meet all different types of people from all walks of life. Management is a great source of information for work and help they are all willing to help when and where they can.
good,"I worked her for over 10 years and really enjoyed my experience there. Through the years, we had a number of different management changes and layoffs and restructures. It was a pleasure to survive that all and still have a job. I left because I was in a bit of rut and wanted to relocate and learn some new things."
good,i did basically every job there was to do in the place from cashier to janitor so i got a pretty good feel for the company as a whole. the management was a revolving door. they had trouble keeping a manager for more than three months.
good,The best part of my job was that I had my own hours and set days off.  I loved the managers and the people I worked with.  The worst part of the job were the mean customers.
good,This was a great place to work as far as getting customer service experience. Truckers can get rude at times but you also meet a lot of nice people. some of the coworkers are a little difficult to get along with
good,Must be able to accurately make transaction  for the truck stop. T.A. has multiple establishments in one location. To maintain cleanliness of store. Stock merchandise. Great customer service to America's travelers.
good,making coffee for truck drivers clean every night receive outside deliveries from vendors maintain the register stock shelves and stock the coolers clean gas pumps
good,"payed invoices, counted inventory, in-processed drivers for repairs/services on trucks, went on parts runs as needed, stocked the shelves in the display room."
good,most the coworkers I worked with were very easy to work with. I learned a lot about working with drivers and helping them with purchase the needed. The hardest part of the job was having to put up with drivers that would get rude to you about something that was not you fault.
good,"While working at Travel of America, my duties as a night shift worker were to clean, stock, night audit, as well as help customers. My nights started by taking an inventory of the tobacco products as well as movies, and then followed by night time cleaning. As working for travel of america gave me many benefits, there was not much I did not prefer about the company. I enjoyed my time here and took it as a valuable learning experience with customer service."
good,Working here was okay but unsteady. The hours were solid and the job itself was great. Management was unsteady because it kept changing almost monthly. I would work here again because they are fair and a safe work environment.
good,"The managers were great here, but full time was unavailable making it hard to make a living, but the hourly wage was decent considering it was cashier position."
good,Learned a lot from my customers with so many different background. There were only two employees including myself and enjoyed working with her every night. Hardest part of my job was leaving.  Most enjoyable was the regulars would be so happy to see me.
good,learned alot about trucks and trailers made good money hardest part was finding out the problem of truck and trailers and also was the good part about the job
good,"Everyday was mostly the same had a routine and a checklist I had to follow. I learned many skills over the 8 years I worked for the company, customer service, working with all types of personalities, and being a team player were some of the best skills I learned. My manager was very supportive and knew how to explain what he expected. I had great part timers who were eager to learn and had great attendants. At the beginning the hardest part was communicating with the managers but when they started to trust me we had a great relationship. I enjoyed helping out the employees knowing that I could answer their questions or concerns always made me feel accomplished."
good,"Travel Centers of America in Ontario East  now called Petro Stopping Centers. My day starts at 6am as I walk in checking the breakfast buffet making sure it's fully stocked and ready to serve our guest, checking temperatures and the quality of the food. Getting the crew ready for the day. Letting them know what specials we are having for the day and, what soups and what will be on the lunch buffet for the day. I walk around checking the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. I give the prep cooks there menu for the day and let them if there is anything special I need them to do for the day. I work with then on the floor till 2pm until the next manager comes in. Then I will start doing food orders, paying bills, inventories as required. Being organized and consistently getting things done in a timely manner, delegate and follow up is important. Since we have rebranded we have had 42% sales increases. Teamwork was the greatest part. everyone worked really well together. The hardest part was working 14 to 15 hours six days a week. No time to spend with my husband. But I loved my job and most of all getting to be creative. I did a lot of my own marketing flyers and created a local favorite menu item called the California Chicken Sandwich."
good,"clock in wash hands , see what has to be prepped , see if there is anything need right away and the cook on the line and clean as much as I could as I went along so wouldn't be a lot to do at the end of the shift."
good,"A typical day consisted of prepping food for your shift and the next shift after you. Preparing the days paperwork for submission to corporate headquarters, as well as cooking the customers orders. Interaction with the fellow co-workers was fun and light mannered. Management was fair and very involved with the everyday operations, which is what I expect of a manager. The hardest part of the job was leaving when your shift was done. I loved my job to the point that I didn't want to go home; it didn't feel like a job to me. The most enjoyable was interacting with the customers, as most of our customer base were truck drivers."
good,"Was a very good place to work but is very limited on what you can and cant do, work wise."
good,Everyday at TA can be challenge different Truck drivers everyday you really don't have a boring day
good,oversee repairs on tractor trailers good feature was dealing with the
good,Prep food for the line cook and do dishes. then i would help on the line sometimes when it gets busy at times. I learned how to prep food cook on the line. The management isn't the best around but for a truck stop its okay. The co-workers are good to work with everyone has there ups and downs. I rarely have a hard time at work. The most enjoyable part of my time is working at a fast pace and the day goes quick.
good,"I was the overnight server, so I worked 11pm-7am. During those hours I was in charge of everything because a manager was not on duty. The only person I worked with in the restaraunt was the cook and we got along really well and helped each other with our task. The hardest part of the job was when something came up that was way beyond my authority and I still had to find someway to resolve it. I loved being around the customers, it was what made work worthwhile I learned that everyone loves a smiling face."
good,It is not appropriate for me to add a comment here.  I have no idea how my comments will be used or where they will be posted.  As a result I should not be required to provide.
good,I like working there it's just to far from home. The drive is hard for me after working a long day. I need to find something closer to home. The staff is good but has a high turnover rate. I am always training someone. Then they quit in a month.
good,"Being a truck stop, most customers are truck drivers from all over the United States.  We greet customers from various locations in need of all kinds of service including anywhere from oil changes to new tires.  My favorite part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,Pay is good  hours can vary sometime under staff . Managers are visible on floor for customers needs .Location can throw customers traveling.95 very busy in sum time
good,While TA is a nice place to work it is difficult to advance. It is nice to be able to meet people from all over the country and interact with them. Unfortunately advancement opportunities and benefit package is limited.
good,"it was alright, i wish it paid better; even the GM agreed that corporate doesn't allow us to get paid enough. The work eventually leads into a tunnel vision like work mentality."
good,"It's an alright place to work.  The advancement is slow and the pay is poor. No overtime and if you do have overtime, the management will change your hours and you will loose the overtime hours."
good,Travel centers does not care about their employee I get to work with new people I like all my customer's. I like my work ethics. I have learned a lot from this company. Just looking for growth.
good,"For those that have never been around the trucking industry, it's a whole new world. TA does seem to care about its employees but the bottom line is the business! Also some managers can be cut throat."
good,It a good place to work if you like working with the public. The management was good a treated you fairly. Winter time was tougher when you had to work the outside jobs.
good,"I have an excellent manager, and that makes it very easy for me to enjoy my job. TA overall doesn't have great benefits especially when compared to local businesses and what they offer, but they do have decent benefits. The work/life balance is worth more than these benefits that they don't have, so you can enjoy your own personal time or time with family, that most jobs don't offer."
good,management was very flexible and easy to work with and for; job was some what stressful. requires many different skills with customer service number one
good,ok work place good health care ok pay typical work day (work work work)lol good management the hardest part of the job was dealing with the truck drivers cause the use to get upset with the tec like we made the prices
good,"I was employed there when it was just opening and stayed for four years.  I started as a hostess, when they didn't feel the need for hostesses anymore, they ask me to be a waitress.  Later, they asked me to be a manager but I couldn't do that job at that time.  When I did leave I it was to marry and start a family."
good,"I love my set schedule. Great employees great mgr. Great hrs. I just hate area. What to relocate, but that's impossible. I been there 3years and ready to start something new"
good,"Working at Travel Centers of America was a at times a roller-coaster ride, you rarely knew what expect on a daily basis. I learned many things in my time with the company, I would say the most valuable of all the things I learned is how to treat everyone with respect regardless of whom they were or what position they held. The management team at TA are a positive group of people that encourage growth and unity among coworkers and really are the backbone of the crew. My experience with the workplace culture is that of a team based culture that supports working together to accomplish the same goal. The hardest part of working at Travel Centers of America is the uncertainty of not knowing what your shift will hold for you that particular day, at times it is difficult to stay motivated knowing that you could face a lot of adversity without warning. The most enjoyable part of working at TA is the gratification of being a part of something bigger then yourself."
good,I cannot legally give you a review of this company.  I am bound by a contract that does not allow me to do so.  You should not force someone to do something that they cannot do..
good,Nice co-workers. Dirty but wasn't too bad. Didn't work with management too much because I worked nights. Different pace depending on the night and what happened.
good,"Assisting public, patients and understanding co-workers and manager were easy to work with, hard parts irate customers, great place to work."
good,"Pay wasn't great but most of the co-workers and customers kept me in good spirits. All in all, a decent place to work. And there are opportunities for advancement."
good,I worked an 40 hour week. Hours ranged from 6am to 6pm. Job detail varied day to day. The was based according to priority. Work with alot of deadlines and math. Beginning to ending task of each day depended on team work.
good,"Dealt with customers and co-workers from all over the country, and of many different origins. Learned and enjoyed many things during my employment. the management staff I worked with were fun to work with, as well as hard working.  For a fast paced company, it seemed at times to be a little or a lot too fast paced, depending on projects going on. The hardest part of my job was to deal with some employees needs, concerns and injury claims.  The rewards to me came from customers complimenting my site dept and my team reaching the goals set.  I had a great field manager that would go out of their way to help me aquire what was needed for my team and I to accomplish the financial and personal goals we had established for the site dept."
good,"I am amazed everyday at the respect and patience of your average driver. Hauling freight is not glamorous or really all that lucrative. It is fraught with loneliness, unreasonable deadlines, strict regulations, and people who don't understand the tight rope that all drivers are required to walk in order to maintain their livelihoods. So when I say that the customers make my job. I am speaking from the heart.To know that every-time I remember a drivers name and a little bit about his/her life makes them feel connected and respected makes my job feel worth while."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers' and the truck drivers'."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting different people every day.  We deal with a variety of different trucking companies and each one is unique in their own way.  I have learned what th pass the maximum weight capacity of a truck and trailer must be in order to pass the scale house.
good,"It's a great place to work if you like meeting people. It's a fun place to work for most part. When something goes wrong; I mean it goes wrong then it gets crazy around there. Management at store level is good. On a typical day I go in and make sure the store is clean and ready for my shift. I make sure that everything operates smooth as possible in order to satisfy the customer's needs. The hardest part is when you get a customer that's had a bad day and it seems like there is nothing you can do to make his day any better. Meeting different people on a daily basis, some really make your job worth while."
good,I got very lucky to be offered this job. Tho graveyard can be dull I always made the best of it.
good,"getting to know new people is the most exciting thing about being a service writer. I typical consists of a bunch of angry truck drivers, ready to get back on the road due to minor or major truck issues."
good,Cooked food served operated cash register cleaned and made freshed coffee. always was busy and always made sure my customers was pleased. Made sure my work area was clean and sanitary.
good,fast paced environment with a very structured job description
good,"typical day at work would be being on the computer most the time writing work orders, and communicating back and forth between companies. I learned to have way more customer experience. learned the how to work the programs on the computer. all my co-workers worked as a team i don't mind it. hardest part of the job was not a set scheduled. most enjoyable part was meeting and talking to new people everyday"
good,"A typical workday consist of counting down the cash drawer and being assigned a register. take orders in a timely manner and serve food in a timely manner, take the money and give correct change. you also had to run orders as well as take other servers orders if we got really busy. I learned how to multi-task..I learned to work the register. Management was not all that great alot of drama with in their circle which is why I left. I had great co-workers some who I became bestfriends with.Hardest part of the job was dealing with racism at times but I always over came any situation. The most enjoyable part of the job interacting with the kids and their parents...making people smile."
good,"Productive work place laid back, no require dress code, very tedious on you being on time, and your attendance. training on on going procedures are limited"
good,Cool people not so bad management lol if u stick with the company they will take care of u and work with your schedule North Las Vegas petro is the one I’m talking about haha
good,"TA Truck service is a great place to start your career. I've worked"
good,"A fun fast paced, exciting place to work. Lots of responsibility, varied duties, great coworkers, great customers.i liked getting up and going to work  i learned A lot in a short amount of time. I met some really great people"
good,It a job just like any other sure it has it faults but what job dosnt in the end of yhe day a job a job so we just have to live with it in the end of the day work is work
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure you keep up a good pace to make sure you can get all customers in and out...While also making sure all needs are met
good,The BK inside is where I worked and before we got the new manager it was wonderful. Only thing is you worked a lot and sometimes they didn't train you as well as they could have.
good,"It was a great place to work, we had different problems everyday. The customers took good care of us, by buying the employees on duty that day food and laughter."
good,Work is easy once u get a hang of things. You have to stay on your toes because if you mess up you can cost the company allot of money. They give yearly bonuses
good,it was a decent job thanks i trained people i enjoyed working with others managers were good i was ase certified and the hardest part of job was road service
good,"If you are looking to get into the truck service business this is a good place to start. You will learn about parts and their functions. The customers are awesome for the most part, management is understanding, and the staff is helpful."
good,Kees you busy at all times. Heavy lifting sometimes but when its all done its really worth it because it helps build your lower and upper body muscles. Then some customers are great to talk to they keep your day going good.
good,Good employees easy going able to move up in company pays decent also. Everyone is pretty fun and they try to help out. Will help with college but must stay at company for so long and only detain classes will they cover.
good,It's a very outstanding job to have and it's very close to home they have a very nice and clean environment and they also have very respectful and polite workers
good,"TA is a great place to work for in regards to keeping a job (full time) but giving a thank you to the employees is rarely seen. Other companies reward employees with small tokens, But TA lacks all that, nothing has been given to me as a gratitude in the past five years. As well employees are pressured to work multiple departments or positions with only one or two coworkers."
good,Help customers. Friendly atmosphere. Good for if you enjoy working with people. Can learn different areas of the job. Good teamwork. Does not have to be afraid to ask questions.
good,This company really sets employees up for success.  Their training program is thorough and extensive. There is great opportunity for advancement. They have great employees working in every department.
good,This was one of the best places I have worked. Customers became like family and over all I love being there and doing my job. Very stressful at times but everything was great.
good,"They had a good starting pay wage. They normally had a fast and friendly staff! They taught about food safety, storage, and prep. They were normally really good at giving days off that were requested."
good,normal day at work would consist of day to day operations for many things like employee safety. Daily inventory counting and verifying Tires. Keeping watch over service writers and detailed charges.
good,while working for ta the employees and customers were great easy going open to change I was made stir fry cook was allowed to do the prep my way sauces as well
good,"I love my job that’s why i’ve Been here for so long don’t plan on leaving  any time soon the customer grow on to you , the pay is good but could be better ."
good,"everything was good "
good,"I have been employed for 13 years with the company. I have encountered 11 managers that I have trained for my site. I am definitely under paid. My duties include service writer, Agm responsibilities, some Gm responsibilities, inventory control and payroll. I assist everyone from desk to mechanics in the shop. I have even act Gm until they found one."
good,"Great Job to work! you meet many people and awesome coworkers. working at TA is fun yet stressful at times. The work load is easy,  but hard on the body. Over all I enjoy working at TA."
good,"I enjoy working for TA, most days are pretty okay, although I work at a store which isn't very busy in the restaurant. I really like talking to the customers for the most part and everyone I work with. Everyone is pretty relaxed. Being in management is a little stressful sometimes, but that comes with managing a restaurant and it is becoming a great experience for me. This was the first full service restaurant I worked in, I started as a server and have worked my way up. I have learned so much in the 3 years I've been here. I'm planning on recieving my Manager certificate within a month or so."
good,Worked for TA 9 years. First management team was great. Bought out in 2005. People had no idea how to manage a travel center company at first. Eliminated all GM site positions
good,A normal day at the truck stop was basically setting drivers up with fuel and stocking products. i love meeting people from different countries and states and hearing about some drivers journeys. The hardest part of the job was having rude drivers who were very disrespectful
good,Great Company.It was very consistent.I think that is why i found it boring.If you like the punch in punch out job this is it.No room to be creative.But it was very fast pace.
good,TravelCenters of America was a wonderful company to work for. Always opportunity to grow and advance. They also provided great benefits and reasonable pay.
good,It was a calm and peaceful place to work. The most enjoyable part was giving the best customer service ever and getting a thumbs up for it. The employees get along very well.
good,The co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Management is good to work with. Hours are a pit hectic for part time workers.
good,"The employee discount is handy.  Most of the co-workers are nice and helpful.  But sometimes the management doesn't listen or understand, and it seems I don't get paid enough nor do I get enough appreciation."
good,"Travel Centers Of America is a good place to work at, it was fun meeting people and having something different to do every day."
good,Great place to work at a fast growing company. Co-workers friendly and business casual atmosphere. Westside location is a great way to avoid daily downtown traffic.
good,This was a big restaurant with minimal servers so there was always something to do to keep you busy and lots of ground to cover. i enjoyed my co-workers and my customers. I learned patience and working with and embracing the dynamic of lots of different personalities.
good,"I open most of the time making the daily schedule, doing our opening paperwork. My coworkers and I get along very well which makes the work place much easier to get my job done."
good,The work is fast place.The people are good people.The hours are not enough to pay my bills.Co works are hard worker.The hardist part of my job is keeping up with the food demands with  no help.
good,"My day started here by coming in to make sure that all the prep work for the salad bar was done and start making soups.  This would free up production to start expediting.  I would then prepare the rest of the shift by assigning duties to shift leads including cooling charts and server stations.  After the rush, I worked on ordering, inventory or scheduling,"
good,nice people to work with. met a lot of nice costumers. fast pace job. drivers and travelers all going to their destinations.
good,Company rushed into wireless and was not ready. They ended up closing stores. After properly looking at structure. They needed to rethink how to make it work.
good,"Decent if low pay, room for advancement if you work hard, management is great until you get above the field managers, great place to start in the service or heavy duty industry, says they will train you and they do."
good,"a typical day is helping customers, preparing orders, and interacting with the different people who come through. I learned great customer service skills and money management skills. The management there is very organized and professional, but easy-going also. My co-workers were great to be around."
good,"Daily safety walk around."
good,"Management is good and work environment is good."

good,"Meet new people from all over."
good,"okay place to work but too far of a drive and not worth the hours im being given, multiple managers within a time period means this place needs to get its head on straight."
good,"Review kept short, a great place to work. I have learned a lot. "
good,"Good benefits, great staff and working condiions. I learned alot about working with other's, their need's and training issues. i worked alot of hours to keep foodcost in line, make sure inventory was accurate."
good,I learned that the work we do and get paid for is very similar. I think that coming in you should be able to start out with something else higher.
good,"Life at TA as a tech is pretty good when business is good. Base pay is minimum wage, but you get paid commission from every job you do so you essentially control your paycheck. There's a saying in the shop that ""When you're eating its a feast, but when you're hungry you're starving"" The company pays to send you off for training plus per diem, which is nice. the bad is when work is slow you cant make trucks come into the shop."
good,"I enjoy being shift lead, and I love serving my customers and making them happy. I really enjoy the flexibility of my hours. I enjoy seeing new people everyday."
good,I love the work environment but you do have some difficult customers there is room for advancement so overall not a bad first job would have to be management to make ok money.
good,Through out these years I have been employed I have received decent benefits as well as paid vacations.  I am however looking for opportunities to advance.
good,"Nice place to work at friendly employees and close to highway"
good,Need more full time help. Very short staffed at times. At times I feel my day is too short to finish the all of the duties that I need to. Frequent manager turnover.
good,"good people to work for. "
good,"I loved working for TA, it thought me a lot more customer service skills that I didn’t previously have. Also patience, you need it when dealing with people from other countries who don’t understand out customs. There was also a lot of safety tips I learned when being out on the fuel island to keep a safe clean environment. Management was amazing, they are very understanding and work with you to their best ability. The hardest but also most enjoyable part of the job is to learn about other people’s lives. How hard or easy to is for them to do their job  and to come here from all around the world . They systems are pretty easy to pick up on and get a hang of it"
good,"I was a Lead Fuel Porter and a Diesel mechanic. I would clean the store, stop gas leaks,  clean oil leaks, and reserve trucks. When I became Diesel mechanic I learned to fix everything on a tractor except the engine.  This was a great experience."
good,"These managers are no nonsense they are straight forward and have NO TOLERANCE for excuses.Theres training test,Advancement in jobs,Extensive job training in Ohio.This job will help you grow and move up if your head is on advancement but if you think you are going to just get a check management isn’t having it you will work for that money.I am not there to make friends I am there to do my job.If I mess up I know I am going to be corrected.So I follow rules and go home.Been there 11 years."
good,My experience at travel centers of America was great when I first started working there but I was pregnant with my second baby boy and was really sick I had existed and the boss decided he wanted to fire me even with the excuses the doctor had put me off work and wrote the excuses for me to miss work and he still fired me but I really liked the job it's self and the people I worked with but the boss didn't like me very much because I was pregnant  and sick all the time but other then the boss I would recommend  this job to anyone.
good,"A good place to work. Chances for advancement made available. Health care is offered at a cost, but not extreme. Reviews and raises are done yearly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the General Manager and the help he provided to get me to where I am today."

good,"Respectable co-workers ,everyone working together ,great customer service.great management ,but the hardest part when a customer leave without being satified"
good,fast paced job plus the work orders changed frequently so you never got stuck doing the same things over and over. had to go and repair tractor trailers on the road which included replacing tires and othe issues the drivers had with their equipment.
good,poor mangament at the time I worked there that's the reason I left other than that I enjoyed working there and would like to go back they have since been bought out.
good,"everyone was part of a team, willing to help each other and making sure all needs were taken care of. great people and great customers and an all around positive work enviornment"
good,"TA, is a great work place, smiling faces, good management, and easy tasks. I never had an issue the whole time working there and i would recommend anyone to work there."
good,"work varies, sometimes it gets slow, but when there are lots of work orders and you feel confident you can do the work needed, there is lots of money to be made dependent on your commission split. Work safe, work hard and work fast and you can command your own income."
good,Safe work environment. Work/life balance depends on position. Multiple positions available within company. Pay doesn’t always match work performed. Many managers to report to.
good,Definitely an atmosphere I like any other. You will meet lots of people from all over. Patience is a must as you will deal with many tired truckers. Overall a good place to work
good,This job for me was only ever temporary. I got it out of high school that I could pay for college. My supervisor was a great person and was very helpful. The staff are nice but it can get a bit dramatic.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people every day. "
good,"It was a great place to work, never had a problem there had great mgmt team also. I had my goals and several things I enjoy doing while I was there and since I have a retail background it wasn't hard for me to get right into my duites."
good,"I loved working at TA fork in the road, on I-80, Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Being a truckstop it was hard work sometimes, there was a high turn over rate, and due to my experience in restaurants, and culinary arts, i was always able to come up with solutions, when problems would arise even though I was hired back as labeled a prep cook. It didn't take long to become Lead on the line, picking up the slack from being short handed so much helping management from the stress of being overwhelmed, I had to be quick with multi tasking in a persistent productive order with clear communication that complied to Corporate regulation. Honestly the hardest part was not getting so much overtime, i watched a high turn over rate in management the last year before they remodeled it into a store that they paid dearly for cause it flopped and they shut the restaurant down....The most enjoyable part was our loyal customers, and working in a team of a good crew."
good,It's the average place to work. It just depends on who's working I always liked the shift before me on the morning but never night shift. They just had no sense of a job.
good,TA is a company that is competitive and a fun place to work.   Fast paced environment. Have to be neat and dress in uniform provided by the company..  Advancement opportunities are available within time of working there

I would recommend this company to anyone that would like to gain exposure to a constructive team-oriented and professional environment."
good,Having the opportunity to meet great people from all over the united states. Is what I enjoy all day. The management is great. I'm able to set my days to give me the opportunity to be with my family. Management is very family friendly.
good,you know I really miss it their the people are great the pay was not ideal 11.00 in hour after training for that kind of work and you have to have at least $1000 in tools it's a bit ridiculous to be honest bill witch I worked with at TA exit 279 great place runs a tight crew I never really got to know anybody their as I started a new job after only 3 mouths they were cool techs
good,I enjoyed my employment at or for this company. I learned so much i now feel super super comfortable with any type of work they or anyone else asks me to do
good,I would recommend this place to anyone looking to be in thefield of mechanics they teach you and give you bonuses for every ASE you aquire it's definitely a place to stay for awhile
good,"Oversee other employees while receiving in orders from vendors, day end paperwork, being accountable for all cash in registers and safe. "

good,"A typical work day at Travel Centers of America was always family oriented. A great work atmosphere filled with positive vibes, and co-workers. My co-workers were team players, it was never a issue to get things done. We always worked in a persistent manner to do what we had to do while still enjoying our time there. My managers were great listeners, provided constructive criticism, patient, and overall a pleasure to work with. I've learned a lot from them, as in what to do in certain situations how to react to certain things/people, as well as different skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different people on a daily basis."
good,"great management, co-workers, and friendly customers. Has the all you can eat menu, and you can be sure to get treated right from all the employees that on shift."
good,"It was a busy environment but also rewarding."

good,"I was required to assist customers with problems they might have with their cell phone carrier."
good,"In a typical work day I would meet atleast 20 people of various backgrounds and engage them in conversation. I further learned how to operate cash registers and how to operate fuel dispensers. The co-workers were enjoyable, and overall an effective team. The hardest part of the job would have been trying to calm down an irate customer, while the most enjoyable part of the job would have been making someone's day with a joke or a compliment before they got back out on the road."
good,"Great knowledge learned from Travel Centers of America."
good,"taking care of guests and employees. Ordering food, posting invoices, balancing safe, checking emails. Enjoyed my staff and guests. Dedicated to teaching and training. Hardest part of job was terminating  employees after all coaching and training did not change behavior of the employee to improve."
good,"what can you say its a very fast paced environment, you have to be patient and open minded person to handle all different situations that can come up at a truck stop. They run there business equally."
good,loved my job with this company if i was 19 and no family i would go back to this place just not alot of job advancements with them
good,T/A had just opened a new expansion of their shop area when I arrived. This made for a pleasant experience. Too bad they had a MGMT shakeup and I was soon released.
good,Performed duties as Supervisor of the kitchen line cooks and prep cooks.  Scheduled staff hours and employee time to make sure all shifts were covered.  Assigned employee duties to ensure the restaurant functioned smoothly and efficiently.  Ensured daily employee tasks were completed correctly and efficiently.

good,very stressful and time challenging job..... alot of off the clock overtime i put in.....
good,"Work would be some what fast pace. All my fellow co workers were seasoned so they were willing to help with any questions. Management was fun and friendly and i was treated like a human not just a pawn. Hardest part of the job was with the tour busses we would get three times a day, because of the large language barrier. All in all the job was amazing."

good,"The workers there are wonderful, would have left there if i didnt have to. The manger is good and they are fair when it comes to work and days off. My most enjoyable part was working with the customers and co-workers."
good,while it has it difficulties it is overall a good place to work
good,TA is great place to work. Management team works well together with their employees to make our jobs a success; and also make our customers happy!
good,The most enjoyable part of job is meeting the new people that come in and out of truck stop.
good,"I only worked here temporarily but the time that I did I enjoyed. Had previous truck stop experience so learning everything was easy and quick. Learned the two systems for the registers, to clean and stock the coffee area for guests in between customers. Assisted with stocking the store and the cooler. The entire team was very warm and welcoming  and as long as you did your job the atmosphere was very relaxed and fun."
good,"This was a great company to work for. We had strong leadership that treated employees fairly and with respect. Great advancement opportunities and I did get the opportunity to travel quite a bit.  I loved my position of Site Accounting Representative Lead.  Although my direct supervisor was on site, I pretty much worked unsupervised due to my vast experience with the company and strong work ethic. For the first time ever in my career I had nights, weekends, and holidays off and had a flexible schedule.  "
good,"I worked there for the summer before school starts. The mangers there are supportive, and other members of the convenience store were willing to show me the ropes. I was able to pick up the pace thanks to their help and guidance."
good,"The company has great advancement opportunity, as long as you put the work in first. It is a very large and growing company, the ability to relocate, only increases your opportunity for advancement."
good,I really like my job but they are trying to cut overtime and that makes for a smaller check that I'm not used to and I cannot make ends meet. This is why I'm looking for something part time to fill in the void.
good,All department heads worked well together. They would help in other departments if needed and kept an eye on each others departments if the manager for that department was off. Customer service was top priority.
good,Great company to work for some bad DM in the effingham area but good corporate people great training and can move up if looking for long term or short term this would be a great job
good,I loved working there. I would have stayed if not for the incompetent management. The hours are long and the work is hard but overall its a satisfying workplace and it has a great staff.
good,"There were various amounts of tasks and maintenance duties. There were core jobs that needed to be kept up with, but when those were completed, you had the freedom to work on other different projects."
good,Work place culture. Open the store with that mind set close the store with that mind set. Teamwork builds off of the leaders. Feeling good leads to working good. Team moral is always present.

good,"•	Deal with reconciliation process for payment processors;"
good,"I have enjoyed my job at Travel Centers of America.  I moved up in management and ran several concepts for them.  They have opportunities for advancement and pay decent compared to many other restaurants around.  If you are looking for decent pay and room to move up, try this company!"
good,"management very understanding and willing to work with you, as far as your work day it depended on the day"
good,Meet new people daily (customers).  Collect money from four different operations and counting large sums of money daily was not the hardest but collecting it and transporting it was sometimes uncomfortable.  Co-workers were great and my employee was good in assisting and in attitude which made the atmosphere nice and enjoyable.
good,A typical day at work would include lots of things to do in a fast-paced upbeat atmosphere. I learned a lot at this job from making coffee to scheduling employees to taking inventory along with cross training inside the company. Management did a great job at leading us and being concerned with not only customers and sales but also us employees as well. My coworkers were also great we got along very well like a family and did a awesome job with the customers. The hardest part of the job was relocating and having to leave such a wonderful work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers and seeing the looks on their face after they take a drink of their perfectly made beverage.
good,"Customer service rep moderate to fast pace, multi tasker, taking a vast number of phone calls/transfer all calls to other departments. Learned the basic how to set up customer account, make reservations, direct bill. Handles large sum of cash, drop cash, keep a report of all failed transactions, call company's for payments to resolve all issues, fax documents"
good,"Pizza Hut Express is a part of the food service industry, so the tasks at work are oriented with customers and food prep. That involves food prep and cooking, taking orders, handling money and register, busing tables and cleaning, and so forth. The management aspect of the job involves interviewing, hiring, and orientating new employees; inventory tracking every week; ordering trucks twice per week; paying bills; making up schedules every week; communicating with other managers; and delegating tasks to employees, along with a few other small things. Low-volume store, but we do have buses a few times a month, so be prepared! Staffing is very small; at any point in time there are between four and six - seven at the very most - employees, including the shift lead and assistant manager. An easy job, especially when there are good and reliable employees working there."
good,"A typical day would be stocking the shelves and coffee stand and making sure everything is clean and ready for customers at all times, along with running the cash register. I learned a lot about the importance of customer service. The managment was pretty good and the co-workers were very nice."
good,It was a very exciting time at Travel Centre: your days at work would be unexpected mostly likely because you never no what to expect from one day to another always something different
good,"Company strives that ""We Care"" about our employees but the District Manager that I worked under did not care about me or my employees. I would ask for something from him like a promotion for one of my employees and it would never get done or even brought up again. Just showed me that he doesn't care about his employees, just if our sale's were going to help him get his bonus."
good,The atmosphere is energetic fast paced the management works with you as long as you communicate with them.  This company has a lot of room for growth from cashier I am now becoming an assistant manager relocating to TX since Travel Centers of America are all over the United States with in 2 years
good,"Clientele were great people! I worked the fuel Island on the midnight shift and loved it! Met new people all the time. Never a full moment!      "
good,Over all good job rough work and quick pace... not a job for a family man ... swiching hours is random.... ot reguarly all around ta is a great work place for on the go people
good,"Great atmosphere, customers can vary depending on location. Will keep you busy, work is easy to maintain.  Workers are friendly and helpful. Management is friendly"
good,Friendly staff flexible hours friendly customers always something to keep you busy challenging computers to learn but great once you get it learned good atmosphere
good,"go in set up  salad bar, cut all vegetable needed, make all salads as needed, make 2 soups  daily, keep clean and well stocked"
good,Working for a QSR at a truck stop you're always moving. The employees are great. The managers are great. I have no complaints about working here. I would say the hardest part of this job is being short staffed on a super busy day.
good,"I started here as a shift supervisor, worked my way up to department  Manager, then to a Bookkeeper."
good,"10-12 hour shifts, making sure customers are well taken care of. Duties can include waiting tables, running a cooks line, preparing for the buffet, preparation of food for buffets, making schedules, ordering product, employee reviews, and heading meetings."
good,"If you like working in a call center setting, being a road squad dispatcher is a great job. They have plenty of extra hours if you want overtime, and they're pretty flexible with scheduling."
good,"good work enviroment friendly people and team work,with some room to improve on schedules and work shifts rotations..."
good,Good place to work. Enjoyed the competitive atmosphere. The hours were good along with the pay. The previous management left a lot to be desired. Not a bad work place.
good,i learned a lot working here. hours can be long but depending on the job you can make it through the day or it can drag if it is slow. they are willing to send you out to school. but the hours can be harsh because they can put  you at some weird hours to work where it can mess with your sleeping schedule and life plans
good,"Travel Centers was a good place to learn how to work in a shop and work on trucks. As long as you have some knowledge then they can work with you. I was even able to work off tools they bought. Basic set and box. Still it greatly helped. "
good,What I like about the job is you didnt know what you would be walking into it was some thing different everyday.You had all of the resorces it you didnt know how to fix some thing.
good,I loved working with the people here. It was a nice compnay and the people were awesome and amazing as well. I wouldn't have ever left if I didnt have to move.
good,"It was really fun serving the truckers and making new friends from all over the country as they pass through. "
good,"The moral was for the most part pretty good amongst the employees. The management was great to me and always gave me the opportunities to move up in the company. When I started I was a regular tsa and was offered assistant manager within a 4 year period. The site I worked at was almost like a family, everyone was there to help each other. "
good,T.A was my first job right out of high school. Paid great. Offered great benefits and 401K. Worked with some great service technicians.  Didn't like smelly drivers.
good,I would go around getting the trash can empty and put in new bags .sweep sweeping sweeping parking lots around the trucks and wash tank and pressure washing the sidewalks and gas station cut grass unload trucks and clean showers and help with the bathrooms
good,TA is a great place to work with great employees. These awesome employees are often unseen by management forcing them to find better places to work. overworked and underpaid
good,"The rate of pay changes all the time . T/A hires on at $18.00 hourly "
good,"A typical day at work for me includes making meals for patrons, cashing guests out as needed, food prepping before the end of my shift while practicing Fifo and ensuring that each food component is as the right temperature. Also putting the food order away each Tuesday before the next crew comes in. What I have learned through TA is how to manage my time to keep up with business needs, how to be a team player, and how to be a leader. Management to me at my job in my opinion could do a better job they practice improper work place techniques and are unprofessional. workplace culture is hit and miss somedays are better than others. The hardest part of my job is being taken advantage of. To know I came to do my job an I always leave knowing I went above an beyond."
good,"with company many years just bad upper management and no room for advancement "
good,"A typical work day consist of cigarette count till / register / drawer count and money drops . Mondays are retail / merchandise days which included unloading a full truck of merchandise and stock if needed . "
good,"Company just changed leadership structure, eliminating over 50 leadership positions (including a lot of district managers).  Now DMs are spread too thin  and now Retail or Shop DMs are now overseeing QSR restaurants. Definitely outside their skill and knowledge base"
good,"The management is awesome and accordingly, so are all the co-workers.  The customers are mostly friendly with an occasional hard to handle person.  Overall, I wish I could work full-time but it is not available."
good,I started out as a server and left  as a manager. I enjoyed working with the customers and other employees. Management became an issue. I was relocated to Lafayette then laid off due to administrative reconstruction.
good,"Could have had better management. When asking for help in learning different machines such as western union, the manager made it very difficult to learn procedure."
good,not a bad place at all to work. love the field but had a discrepancy with another employee that was not resolved by management.
good,"Over 400 people in this 4 story office building."
good,If you like hands on work then being a diesel mechanic is for you. This is a good start up company if your looking for something bigger and better. The company has lots of room for advancements.
good,"It was an amazing work  experience and a learning ability. Working there really made me understand how trucks move in the world, that they are very dangerous.It was an amazing place to work, the people are friendly and are willing to teach you. The management is there to help you with anything you need and have an open door. The most hardest part about this job was, that at any giving day I could not come home to my family. It is a dangerous job but u will learn alot and have fun doing it."
good,not much i can say other then great company to work for with lots of benefits and great customer value no matter what i think by far the best gas station corporation ever.
good,"Ta is what it is. It's a ta. Training is great, and they have programs for getting certifications etc. Overall I guess it's decent if you are single with no family to take care of."
good,They are an extremely good company and work their hardest to please and help the truck drivers or any customers to leave feeling amazing I just felt I was a senior and I had to finish up and focus on some of my schooling and i had to focus on track because I had qualified for districts
good,"Wonderful job , from the people to the pay to the opportunity of advancement they offer. I loved the managers , supervisors and my fellow coworkers and even most of my recurring customers."
good,To much drama between the waitresses and favoritism also they fired me for someone else threatening bodily harm to me and they kept there job. I would not work there if i didnt have to.
good,"Very busy and high paced work environment. I started at the Fuel Desk and was promoted to Bookkeeping. I handled Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Payroll, etc."
good,Very heavy workload.  They hired approx. 30 temp positions to help.  Company acquired another location and business was very fast pace and busy.  Manager was excellent dealing with training us.
good,"Enjoyed working for TA. Energetic environment. got along with all co-workers. Having a buddy system really helped with other job duties. If I had the opportunity again, I would be happy to work for Travel Centers."
good,Management really values your opinion and what you have to say . They are very understanding if you have a strict schedule that limits you to what days you are available to work.
good,I truly enjoyed working for the company.  I learned something new every-day . I was able to become more of a customer service employee.  Love working with people.
good,Ta/ 88 Diner was a good place to work.  The staff works well with the three companies that share a kitchen.  This is a fast paced environment that caters to truckers
good,"They make cuts quickly to save money every quarter. The job was amazing, I love training. Unfortunately they closed the training department and I was let go."
good,Fun workplace and co-workers. The company tries to put fun activities in place to make the work day more enjoyable. the managers are easy to get along with and the atmosphere is very relaxed
good,"I have already given a review on this company and I stand by my previous statement. If I could have been able to stay at the company, I would have. Completely enjoyed working thee."
good,this location is a good location to work for. hey treat employees well and treat customers the same. I would highly recommend this location to any one interested.
good,This was a good experience for learning certain customer service skills as well as skills involving the trucking industry. Other than that it meh. Shifts could be over night depending on the week and the pay wasnt worth it at all. Granted I was young and in college during this time so it was ok. No overtime available and hard to get a promotion. Not worth the time.
good,"professional environment, knowledgeable staff, current technology "
good,"Worked one on one with my direct supervisor on creating a Performa,"
good,"Enjoy working for this company...Upscale work place,  many different departments to gain experience within the store. Friendly environment for truckersto call home."

good,this was my first job and i have been with the company going on four years i have learned alot with the company also the people i work with have become a second family my main reason for leaving is to better provide for my family and also take my skills learned here and apply them in another company where i could further advance my career which ta was not offering.
good,A typical day at this job was nice and easy going. I worked nights and I loved it I was a server/cashier. The management was awsome as well as the co-worker. There was no hard part abot this job. The most enjoyable part was listen to the customers and truck drivers tell story.
good,A great place to meet people from all over the world. As well as learn a great trade and aquire customer service skills.
good,"Travel Centers of America is a nice place to work. Now like all places, this will mostly depend on attitudes of your coworkers/managers. I was lucky enough to have been BLESSED with the most two awesome managers and coworkers. The only thing I will say, I do believe a job like this is okay if you’re in highschool, attending college, or retired. There is really no room for advancement besides becoming a lead cashier or manager but the pay difference really isn’t that much. If you like working with people in a fast paced environment, this could be for you!"
good,I enjoyed working their. Good relationship with the mechanics and customers.  Current manager was not employee oriented and somewhat un-educated with shop operations.  He was good at accounting but poor with employee relations.
good,"Pros:"
good,I love my job because im good at what i do i been there since the year of 2010 and im now a lead at the store so i run my own shift and opens and closes the store sometimes...
good,I loved my job the customers were great the management was good most of the time but it was all in all a wonderful place to work and if I could go back I would
good,Every day i get to work with fun and energetic people. i love preparing food for customers. I enjoy it when a customer tell me that they like what i have prepared for them. There is some cleaning and prep work that I do and that is fun also. There is never a dull day. The management team take time to listen to you when you have a concern.
good,"Quality and accuracy of work.Ability to meet established goals and deadlines."
good,"I don't think there is ever a typical day at a truck stop. You just never know what the shift will bring. I'm very comfortable working with the public, so my most enjoyable times were definitely return customers that were jokers. Unfortunately travelers are sometimes tired, especially truck drivers. Displaying kindness and empathy go a long way toward establishing successful encounters."
good,Hard work low pay but for a small town I was great full for t/a because they gave me a job when nobody else was hiring. The staff was nice and hard working a lot of lifers though.
good,"Fast paced, plenty of opportunity to advance and gain knowledge-education.  Always have a high demand for good quality people.  Opportunity to relocate."
good,"I like it but they will work the heck out of u and u get no breaks,it's been 4 months still have not got a raise. Don't let them lie to u. But the start pay rate is good. But where is the manager raise I come suppose to have"
good,"As a young 16 year old, I worked alongside several woman and a few men. I worked mostly Sundays (wich are the busiest of all) I found my feet hurt and legs ached, but the pay was good and my manager was good. I had a few kinks and faults, but things tended to stay the same. Everyone knows everyone so you can't get by just knowing a few people; you end up knowing everyone. Would for sure return."
good,I have been at this job for two and a half years and I like it the job is great the people are great and I love the managers the pay is great but I need a little bit more
good,I was a cashier at the diesel fuel desk so it was mostly customer service.  I got along with all my coworkers and all customers.
good,"Having a normal day at work would be a very good day including the enviornment and the customers and co-workers. i learned alot with leadership, responsiblility, understandance, patientience, and communication. the mannagement was poor we would go through managers more often than normal. it built up alot of frustration and stress. with the coworkers that i had thogh they mad it very easy to get through because we stuck together and stayed as a team no matter what came our way. the hardest part of the job was going trough so many managers and never having a constant manager that would be there to actually help everything grow and possibly become a better place. the best parts of working there was the co workers that i worked with and learned alot with they made everything easier with the postive energy and not trying to let stress take a major roll in the enviornment."
good,Working as Every potions in the Kitchen staff was very  life teaching to go form dish washing to prep cooking to buffet/caving and then come into line cooking.
good,"Being a technician was nice, they truly care about their customers and their employees. Once you get into management you don't get as many benefits and you lose a lot of your home time."
good,Corporate needs to invest money in updating the shop facilities to attract experienced Technicians before it’s no longer competitive in the Truck Service industry. They provide great training for employees who take the initiative. The truck service industry is hard to navigate but if you can it’s a good living.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job with them unfortunately I had some life issues come up which hindered me from making it to work but aside from the petty things that go on in anywhere place it was an overall enjoyable and upbeat place to work.
good,Travel Centers Of America is a good company to work for as a tech. There is a lot of chances to advance to management. Management positions are well trained and are a good advancement.
good,The hours were mostly inconsistent. I would work nights go home for a few hours and be back at 4pm that day. instead of midnight to 8am. They would switch from nights to days and afternoons all the time. It was a good paycheck
good,"It’s a laid back place to work, customers come in with a great amount of respect, and the managers are very awesome. They have flexible hours and give time off if needed."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. They worked with my schedule and rewarded my achievements. The job was very fun and the management made sure to be behind you if a customer was irate and treated me bad.
good,"A commission based job, the money is depending on your work speed and skill level. Awesome job to work for knowledge and resources. Very awesome benefits for the top techs in the company."
good,"Nothing too negative, over all a good experience. I have enjoyed all of the the experiences that I have had and wouldnt change it. Most Employees truly care for one another in a Dog eat Dog world these people realize it takes a team to make it happen."
good,I've worked for Ta for years and I feel like they ask more than they care about me as an employee as a human being I have no life but work I love my job just upper management in corporate doesn't care we work hard and all they do is bark at us
good,I had so much fun working at this job.If u do a good job.You get tips.I like my co workers.Its a fun loving environment.They job can be a little stress.When u don't have team work
good,"The job bores me, but it's a job. The customers can be a pain, but as a cashier, it is my job to attend to them and make sure they are 100% satisfied with TA and our speed at providing them with food."
good,"I come in and count my drawer out and begin my day in dealing with all of the many different names and faces that go into maintaining the fuel station at Travel Centers of America. You can guarantee that you will meet many new and interesting people with many different stories that sometimes touch your heart, and other times tickle your funny bones."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include:"
good,"Typical day working at the ta would be empty all trash cans first,wash all silver ware. Start on my plates,pots&pans then sweep and mop all floors. I've learned when your working hard indoors time just fly's. Came to really respect all of my co-workers they seem like great people. Thats a great question but my answer would be to clock back in from lunch,funny. Getting a 30 percent discount on my lunch at work."
good,boss does not like to give full time hours to full time employees.
good,"This was a great place yo work, employees are treated like family, hard working, honest and try to help their customers to the best of their abilities"
good,Managers need work but other than that it's a fun place to work meet new people every day and you get paid more than you would working as mini bar at a resort.
good,Travel Centers was different because the atmosphere was always productive. There were always opportunities for advancement within the company as long as you worked hard and showed some type of enjoyment for the job. I worked different types of customers to assure that their trucks were being worked on in a timely and orderly manner. It was always satisfying to see that customer happy and appreciative about the work that was being done.
good,Friendly customer service required...positive attitude required...must be able to multi-task.  Being on time is very good trait..lots of patiences because you talk to people from all nationalities..being able to handle cash is good
good,Staff was absolutly amazing to work with. Great bosses and easy work. It was a great working environment and easy to learn what was expected of you. Would love to work for them again
good,It is a competive fun place to work.I have a staff of 40 people that report to me and they are most important to our business and our success.. Customer Service is our focus.Also retention and training of team members is what we do.
good,"Enjoyed working there, met quite a few interesting people.  It can be high paced must be multi tasker.   Always will meet your 40 hours.  Great benefits"
good,"Prepared food for customers. Took orders from customers and payment. Maintained a high standard of customer service, adopted the attitude of ""the customer is always right""."
good,"liked it "
good,"A typical day at TA was i was a full time student at lincoln college of technology, i went to school 6:45 to 12:45. I worked days a week to 4 to 12 p.m. Working at TA was a blast i learned more at work than school. There was truck after truck coming into our shop, you were busy no matter what amd was a good thing because it made time go by. The best part about TA were the empoyees, if u were stuck on a project you could ask one worker for help and they would leave what they were working on and help you out. The worst part was leaving work at midnight or later than that if you went out on a roadcall, but other than that i loved it."
good,Doing all typs of repairs on a wide vareity of trucks and trailers and RV's. From tire repairs to Engine transmission overhauls. Learning all the differant types of truck makes and how they operated and the differant problems they had.. No comment on the mansgement..
good,"9-5 office job.. Daily deposits, data entry, filing, Accounts Payable.. I learned a lot of good skills at this job. The Management was good and easy to work along side. I met alot of good people and have many lasting friendships with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working 7 months straight. The enjoyable part was all the good experiences that I had being part of Travel Centers of America."
good,Very good company I would definitely recommend working here good management good employees good work environment it was a great summer job nothing really else to say
good,"Smooth place to work at, nobody is too far away to not get asked about pay, schedules, or a good place to get something to eat. "
good,"It is a fast pace job and lots to learn , and best believe you will apply what you learn on the job to your every day work experience ...I recommend you to apply if you have the skills and the patience to deal with customers"
good,I enjoy working for Travel Centers of America. Upper management cares about their employees and their customers. They try to provide a day make environment for both employees and customers while maintaining a business like atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company very much. I was forced to leave for something entirely my own fault. A typical day at work would be taking inbound calls to assist semi-drivers with their roadside breakdown. We would search to find the nearest shop to them to help get them up and running again. I learned a lot in my role as a Dispatcher, including how to rely on my resources to find what I need. The culture was great, we were rewarded a lot and praised for the great performance we gave. The hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with some of the rougher drivers but after awhile you learned how to soften them. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you helped someone who was stranded roadside"
good,"Many of the people I worked with stayed at TA for multiple years. The pay was steady and competitive. If you made it a fun experience, it was a pleasant place to work."
good,"everyday is the same except holidays, u can learn and lot when u level up to a different position the hard part of the job was getting there on time i ride the city bus"
good,"I only worked at TA for 4-5 months until I left very abruptly to no fault of the company.  "
good,Hard work everything deisil is extremely heavy but as long you use your head it can be done safe and easy. Everything will work out the way it should if you follow directions.
good,From the top to all the way down the management was great. They provide in-depth training and allow for advancement. You have the opportunity to transfer to just about anywhere in the country. Great company!
good,TravelCenters of America is a great company for its field. Employees are treated well and given opportunities for advancement. Pay and benefits could use some work.
good,A typical day at work was usually steady paced and it was a very laid back environment. Management was awesome. The company cared about their employees. The hardest part about my job was learning all of the little details. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people. There are a lot of regular customers who come in daily.
good,Customers came to enjoy fresh coffee and a hot breakfast with me.  Discussions were entertaining and enjoyable.  Always enjoyed going in or staying longer because the customers made my day.

good,"TA TravelCenters of America was actually the best job Ive had thus far, as far as a good, and friendly work environment, all of my co-workers were helpful and they all loved when I worked not only for my sunny personality, but my good work ethic, the managers there were more hands on and more likely to roll up there sleeves and jump in and help if it got busy or something went wrong then any other place I have ever worked, over all it was a great job and an experience Ill take with me to any other job I ever have."
good,Never had done bookkeeping prior to being hired for this job.  It was a challenging and I enjoyed the challenge of learning something new.  All site managers were extremely helpful.
good,"Customer service department at TA TravelCenter of America is an in-bound call center for truck drivers, customers and sited of TA / Petro. A work day consists of executing customer inquires regarding loyalty cards, customer complaints, assisting company locations, and data entry and correspondence. The management team is superbly awesome to work for. I have learned that shared knowledge and building relationships among co-workers goes extremely for in making a terrific work environment. The most difficult part of the job can be a difficult call, but each difficult call is out weighed by great interactions with co-workers and other great and interesting calls. The most interesting, enjoyable and best part of working at TA TravelCenters of America in the customer service department is the great team and family environment within the department."
good,I was used to coming in to work with a big smile and ready to work. I learned different things on the computer like how to prepare food orders and order work supplies. I loved my co-workers. There was really no hard part of the job I really enjoyed my job. I looked forward to seeing and meeting new people.
good,"The management at this location is wonderful. They work with their employees to provide flexible hours, a friendly work environment, and room for advancement."
good,"I loved this job, I am a people person and that's the best part is meeting new people. I always kept a clean store and made sure to be smiling and friendly"
good,I liked working at the TA. Almost everyone were really nice and very helpful when I didn’t know how to do some stuff. I made friends there and working there has also helped me learn how to become better at assisting customers.

good,"A wkend of working at the TA was exciting meeting new people and helping others. The management was great and very understanding. "
good,Travel centers of america furthered my path in becoming a mechanic. everyone in the shop was extremely helpful and would make sure you did things the right ways. if you didn’t have a specific tool to do the job someone usually would lend it to you.
good,Assisting drivers and other customers with their purchases were at times stressful both for the customer and the team member. Team members would help each other and on occasion the management staff would come and assist team members.
good,Excellent place to work and learn how to work in a safe and timely manner. Excellent people to work with and grow with as an employee. Great management.

good,Well-rounded good place to work treat customers well repeating customers much work treat their employees very well if I do look for another job I would love to work for them
good,Great environment to be around if wanting to know more about different people and cultures. Just and overall great job to have under your belt. Helps u understand people and talk to them in a calm manor
good,"I never had any complaints. Got along with everyone. Pay was great, hours were great. They were great about giving us breaks due to store being packed most of the time."
good,"Each location is different so I cannot speak of the company as a whole. The corporate office is forever changing and evolving so there is constant updates and training. I wouldnt talk somone out of working here but it is not for everyone. Its a challenging environment due to the customer base. Being yelled at by a customer for something out of your control is not uncommon.  However, there is room for advancement if you are willing to go out of your way to train. Staffing is challenging because full-time positions are few and far between and part-time positions typically work 29 hours or less. If you stick with it and desire to move up it can happen within 2 to 5 years."
good,It was always busy but I loved it.  Getting to interact with customers was great and kept me busy.  I tested myself a lot with caring curtain amount of plates and drinks on a tray. Management was great and on top of everything.

good,Been with this company for over ten years and wouldn't change anything. We've went through a lot of changes and growth and made it through some very hard times. But management always like to see growth in the employees and help you obtain your goals. If I could relocate with this company I would.
good,A great company that invested a lot into managers. Kept you learning new thing new challenges. Teach you ownership and skills to operate any business.
good,"Love meeting people and interacting with them. Travel Center of America was over all a typical work place, fun but work came first."
good,"TA was a busy fast passed, never stop moving kind of job. I loved it. Never a dull moment. Dealing with truck drivers was interesting. The pay was good, the people were good. Lots of training and re-training to make their associates the best they can be. I would love to go back."
good,"Fast paced and varied, customers and drivers eager to get back on the road. The training and experience were invaluable in my career."
good,"A great place to work. Customers have a wonderful sense of humor and patience. Coworkers were willing to lend a hand when needed. I learned that I work well in a fast paced, high pressured atmosphere alone and without fear to go to another department and ask for 15 minutes of help when a large crowd was present. There were no true hard parts of this job, except maybe boredom and a slow day, in which there is always a project to found, such as moving prep tables and cleaning under them and scrubbing walls. I enjoyed my employment very much and looked forward to going in everyday."
good,I had regular customers on a daily basis. Pay was wonderful. The only bad thing i can say aboout this company is there was a lot of gossip and favortism.
good,Good training opportunity learned alot job not that difficult needed to change due to family situation liked facility very flexible working conditions
good,"Travel Centers of America was an interesting place to work, mainly because it is a truck stop & dat makes it very busy, interesting, & exciting. You get to meet & greet all sorts of people from truck drivers, to everyday customers,& even sum fellow employees , I would definately work der again . Did I mention I worked at Popeyes Chicken which is located inside of Travel Centers of America."
good,"We got to meet different people everyday. Some of these people would be very rude, but we got the customer in a better mood by helping them with their problem. "
good,"A very fun place to work, you meet a lot of new people from out of state, plus they have an arcade! Easy work, laid back staff, everything you could hope for from a part time job."
good,"The company has many career advancement opportunities. They take care of their employees, and have good benefits.  They provide on the job training and off site training as welll that they pay for."
good,"Usually good attitudes on my shift, great site manager awesome co-workers and easy to attend customers and keep up with duties."
good,Had a great crew that I enjoyed working with. Very good company to work for. I learned a lot from this oppurtunity. The company let me advance as long as I worked hard.
good,I am a person that likes to multitask and this was the perfect place for it. I was with the best crew and support staff. I got to travel and see new places and always enjoyed the smiles on the employees faces. If I had the opportunity to go back to work for them I would.
good,This job requires an energetic out going person. You have to be on your game 100 percent of the time. Your number one priority is the customers needs and wants.
good,"I enjoy my job. Cant really think of anything negative about it. Our boss is a good guy and will do as much as he can to treat people fair and work with them if sick, or family emergencies, really anything. Just have to talk to him and keep him in the loop. The shop foreman is a great guy. Great teacher and patient with new comers to the trade. Overall good and great work environment."
good,"Good company to work with. The company is willing to pay for training and Certifications. The managers are really nice and understanding, my coworkers are a very tight team we all work well with each other everyone is willing to help you if your stuck or if you don’t know how to do something"

good,"Lots of room to advance in several career paths. Great support by management. Steady workevery week. Set schedules, know what shift you will be working every week. Regular paychecks, discounts on store items."
good,"Like most businesses, the restaurant industry is not different, the bottom line is all about the numbers. While TA is doing very well with their bottom line, they seem to take a step further by displaying a family culture with their employees. Upper management actually care about their people and in return, productivity is maximized. This is a rare and dying culture, yet the culture I will continue to proudly be a part of."
good,They try really to make sure that you are trained into your job. They are patient and very helpful in making sure you are trained. The management is easy going and easy to get along with.
good,I started at TA after being with a company for 5 years. They are dedicated to their employees and have some great benefits. I am super pumped to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement.
good,I have worked for Petro for 24 years in serval positions and departments. I have become family with many of the staff. I lead a positive office environment. It saddens me after 24 years my position is eventually being  phased out. I have hopes I can find another positive position somewhere else.
good,Productive and fun workplace for everyone. All employees i worked with were well trained and mannered. Everyone new what was expected of them and got the job done
good,TA is a great place to work. Very fast paced. Most days pass really quickly. It's great meeting people from different parts of the country. I enjoy working as a team and helping customers. It's very rewarding to put a smile on some ones face by being a DAYMAKER!
good,"work life here was amazing! management and co- workers on 2nd shift were fun to work with. I never felt like I was going to work, even though the job was difficult my team made it easier.  the hardest part of the job would have to be time management, people wanted their stuff complete on their time and that's not always possible."
good,my opinion is this job is for people who are very friendly and like to have fun...you like to meet new people and do not mind alot of walking and story telling u have to able to be multi tasking
good,"Daily interaction with strangers and the personalities is a given coping skill. Was well trained by management with careful instructions, in all departments of cleaning, cashiering, stocking, information of who to contact in case of an emergency, or problems."
good,"worked here for 10 yrs , being a service writer and doing the billing was my favorite to help them out . I got bonuses with parts and tires I sold to make extra money each week."
good,"Through working here I have learned to have more patience than normal.  A typical day for me is to come in either at 7:45am for an 8am shift or 3:45pm for a 4pm shift.  I clock in, count my cash drawer and ensure it is balanced at $1,000.  Once it is balanced i start helping customers.  Both managers are extremely friendly and helpful.  Schedules are always put out on time and are made according to our proper availability."
good,I was unable to continue to work third shift. No other shifts became available within the time I needed. Managers were understanding and compliant with my exit.
good,"-made sure you knew what you was trained to do"
good,"If your a hard worker and want to move up fast, then T/A is the company for you. I enjoyed working there and traveling the country side with them. But now my family needs a stable environment."
good,I was lead csr working from 4pm til midnight. this was my first retail job I started as a cashier and in 6 months was promoted to lead . I loved the busy fast pace of this job plus the variety of tasks that were to be performed
good,"loved my job here"
good,"A typical day at work is to come in and to consult with management on the job you will be doing that day in which there is a book time to complete that job .I learned a lot about about the units,their function,and how to install them as well as repair.Management was informational with helping somewhat if you did not know what to do.Co workers work on their own pretty much and did not mind answering any questions.Hardest part of the job is if sometimes you ran into a probelem depend on what supervisor help you will put pressure on you to hurry and complete the job or threaten your job security.The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things."
good,"This was a job where I really enjoyed going to work every day. Management was awesome, everyone worked together, and we all did our best to provide excellent customer service. I really enjoyed working there."

good,"Heavy Truck Technician pay is commission based and as such, depends largely on how hard you are willing to work. Your percentage level increases with the amount of in-house and ASE training you complete. Basically, it's up to the technician as to how far they can go in this position. This is my second time being employed by TA. 2005-07 2019...."
good,"Lots of opportunities. Different departments, several full service restaurants, fast food franchises, fuel, general stores and shop.  Locations throughout the states. Great advancement opportunities for self motivated people."

good,working at TA was a great experience for me . got to meet travelers all over. its very exciting working there everyone had postitve energy everyday at work the hardest part about working here was if you seen a customers stealing and having to catch them and have to be caution cause you could never know what would happen next. but you did something good for the company.

good,"I wish I had found this company 20 years earlier. They have better opportunities and benefits than almost any restaurant company because they are Travel Centers and make most of their money with gas and diesel.

My managers actually care about EVERY employee they have and go above and beyond what you'd expect from management. I know if I have an issue I can go to my manager at any time as he'll do whatever he can to help. The opportunity for advancement is there if you are willing to work for it. They actually recognise and appreciate everything you do for the company. I can't see myself working for another company

Management was very helpful and cared a great deal for their customers and employees. The hardest part of this job was one day when donuts were free with the purchase of a drink, but I handle the task of making several extra dozens of donuts efficiently. My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be creative in the decorating process and creating displays for the front floor."
good,Clock in and start washing dishes. I also swept and mopped the dinning area. The people that I worked with I enjoyed. They were all easy going and fun to be around.
