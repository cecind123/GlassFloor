bad,If you are looking for a company to start off and gain experience this is the place to be. Management only like to hire people that can benefit from(friends/buddy). Small chance they will hire someone they donâ€™t know.
bad,"If you enjoy being underpaid and told that you aren't Genesis is the place for you. Management varies from ineffectual to hostile. The company is on its way down, do not get on this sinking ship!"
bad,Local loads pay no more then $50 dollars a load not a place for a young man trying have something good equipment terrible pay for a hazmat driver dangerous chemicals very rude dispatchers
bad,The boats are great but the upper management is not what you would call a management. Just find ur self something that has grate management and others around u
bad,"Stay far away from this company!! While working here there was poor and contradicting directions from Supervision, coworkers who changed forms, SOPs, etc on their own so nothing worked right on the computers, not a single running toilet or sink at any location, coworkers who wanted to be the supervisor so bad that you couldn't talk to anyone or trust anyone to do anything. Management couldn't care less about you and trusted you even less. Each site had Supervisors with serious anger and bullying problems!! I could go on but I won't! I'm glad I quit when I did! Just stay away from this train wreck of a company!!"
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Poor place to work.  No path for advancement. Hard working individuals get more responsibility but no pay.  Egotistical manger and supervisors.  Always have to remind you of thir position due to insecurity.  Lies told to draw you in then nothing  given in return.  Promote ""rats"" and people willing to lie to get ahead."
bad,"The absolute worst management.  They lie from the beginning and make up policy or assume to have the power to change it as suits their needs.  More than willing to cheat the customer, ethics and integrity have no place here.  Haven't been here long.  Looking forward to leaving as soon as the opportunity arises."
bad,"- Nepotism within Genesis is more rampant than I have ever experienced.  "
bad,"I found this place difficult to work as they timed everything you did right down to your toilet breaks and on top of that, there was always a queue at the toilets which were unisex might I add, which of course added to the toilet break time..."
good,friendly staff management has favourites though so hard workers may be overlooked in favour of friends. best to keep to yourself as alot of people gossip
good,"As an Terminal Operator, I store and transfer petroleum oil. My co-worker and I spend time away from work playing basketball and doing other activities together."
good,"A typical day was sitting on the computers answer customer queries, I learned that being a call center representative was not the job for me, management were supportive in my decision to leave, even though I was doing well at the position, my co-workers were a happy fun team to work with, the hardest part of the job was the strict time constraints which applies to being in a call center along with no let up from the telephone, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the ladies I worked alongside."
good,"Never a dull moment, lots of learning about people, staff and management and how company corps think?"
good,"I worked at Scenic Station for eight months and I can honestly say that I've never worked at a job where my stress-level, morale, and drive to move ahead where compromised. My very first day in orientation, I was told that I will never get a raise by my bosses boss. I still gave my all but when I would notice facility supervisors bully certain workers for no reason, I begin to become stressed. And to see that calls employees made to HR would not bring change, I felt that all our jobs were threatened. This really has been the worst job I've ever had."
good,"A good place to work."
good,"Stressful enviroment.  "
good,"Genesis Energy was good to work for however I miss face to face customer interaction. "
good,good company to work for with great benefits and pay. liked working there until i got laid off due to oil prices dropping.
good,"load and unload trucks, drive tractor trailer, Get dispatched out on loads .  Go pick the load up and deliver.  For the most part home every night  just depends on where you have to deliver."
good,The company is a good place to work. I tried to start my days early so I could finish early.  I did learn about different chemicals and their properties.  Some managers lack of people skills made the work atmosphere trying at times and that made the job hard sometime.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom of starting my work day.
good,Strive to reach work place targets set at hand however if not prepared it can become stressful and overwhelming.
good,"Go to the stations and pick up paperwork and check with truck drivers about problems ar neede supplies, Attend meter provings when scheduled and work on stations as needed. Co-workers were good to work with and we helped each other when asked. Working on lacts and maintaining stations. Being around other people and working with the office personnel."

good,"Genesis has the potential to be an amazing place to work at. Their management is of poor quality, the pay and benefits there are amazing but they are ran poorly."
good,Flexible work schedule. Immediate boss was very knowledgeable and enjoyed working with him. Management is good. Learned new software products and energy industry.
good,"This has been an enjoyable job for me over the last 7 years, but the oilfield is slow, so hours and incentives are being cut."

good,I started working for Genesis Energy through Securitas. Its amazing to see how much the company has grown and still growing. They have great management and great workers. I liked it.
good,The work is fast paced but the benefits are great.  Good opportunity for graduate students. The key to success here is a willing to take on projects that you are not familiar with and get along with everyone.  They don't tolerate confrontation.

good,Only reason I left was because in 2016  the price of crude fell. If I would have been back in the area I would gladly go back. Good people to work with.
good,I learned how to use the computer systems in the truck and a typical day was a 12 to 14 hour shift. Christian management and co-workers was easy to work with and was understandable under any  circumstances and I would think the hardest part of the job was getting to know the computer system inside the truck. I loved that te quarterly safety bonus because it made us focus on safety. The drivers alert each month helped me learn a lot ongoing through the job
good,"I came across this amazing company by chance, and realized I have to work with this small but awesome company!"
