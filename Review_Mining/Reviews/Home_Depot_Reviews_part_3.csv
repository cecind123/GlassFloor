good,Good company to grow with great learning experience for me good insight from a merchendiser stand point
good,"First, let me say that Sr. Leadership in this corporation consists of excellent people who know their business, love what they do and love making connections with other associates. They have generous employee-focused benefits ranging from excellent healthcare plans, a daycare center, a gym and pharmacy located in the lobby and two cafeterias. They support diversity in words and deed with internal clubs for veterans, people of color, GLBT and college alumni."
good,"Check into my department, insure all is in order such as machines, safety checklist completed, all orders are met, and assist as needed. Complete a written review of contractors and new leads for upper management. Check with the Pro desk for any needs and fill any orders received. Communicating with the representatives for the different products sold in my department is as important as working with new and existing pro contractors. Meeting management's goals are a high priority. As the co-worker's arrive for the different shifts throughout the day it is important to include them in any earlier communications from either management, vendor's, or customer's that will affect their day and productivity. The most difficult part of the day is lifting the 50 - 80 lb. products. Sometimes up to 20 products weighing this much will be needed to lifted to fill an expedited order. The best part of the job is when a pro contractor will explain to us that he or she has passed multiple Home Depot's to come to ours because of the superior customer service and professionalism shown by myself and the other employees in our department."
good,walk into to work assist customers do some returns clean aisle wipe down tools apply security devices to tools.
good,I work part time and I am usually on my own except when I am assisting a customer. It is a good company that is very diversified.
good,Loved this job because company works with single parents and the schedule. Loved the people I worked with and loved the customers. Loved being around the plants and watering them. Very hard to deal with hours being drastically reduced in winter. New management very difficult to work for and with. Great deal of turn-over.
good,"Wonderful place to work. I have acquired an extensive amount of knowledge about maintaining a home. Works out well for an apartment with leaky windows. I did not like the hours. However there is no balance with work and live. The schedule dominates. No balance to plan a life. If you happen to have schedule restrictions, you automatically have a bullseye for those who do not. Management was not cooperative with a school schedule, even though the company supports it. Customers were wonderful. I have life long friends from my time there."
good,some days were good the people at home depot were great the cust were nice we were short staffed alot
good,Shifts would vary from day to evenings and always included weekend work. Learned to use more patience when dealing with the public. Good management team. Good workforce team as well. Hard to adjust to scheduling. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday and being tested on my knowledge of the products.
good,if you are looking for a good place to work this would be one to look at but some of the cons that go along with this includes poor pay poor hours especially hours and very poor managers. the pros are that the corporate portion is very good includes benefits.
good,"You have to be from here to get any help in this store. Hours are ok, but open too late with no customers in there."
good,"A typical day at work is following up on quotes touching bases with my customers placing special orders following up with vendors getting eta's making sure things are pulled and ready for pick up or scheduling deliveries assuring that the right products are going out, Answering phone directing phone calls. I also do in isle customer service, or designing doors windows decks garages ect..I have learned a lot from my time at Home Depot with time management, multi tasking, computer design programs, and customer service. I work with a great bunch of people it really has grown to be a family. We have had another management change (a few times in my 6 years) this time it really has taken its toll on moral this time, and made it feel like you have to be in fear of your job at all times, unable to just go talk to them if you need help and the lack of willingness to help. The hardest part of my job over the the last year has been that we are short handed and have such a turn over we don't seam to have the knowable team players, and not much of a team feeling. I have to say i enjoy the feeling of a job well done and the interaction with people."
good,Overall lack of mentorship and managerial guidance. Lack of consistent guidance and direction.
good,"stock and or restock merchandise located in the front end. Help customers check out. Smile and be curtious. Help customers locate things they are having trouble finding or find someone in that specific department to help them. Handle cash, credit and debit cards on regular bases. Count drawer before and after shift. clock in and remember password and username."
good,"greet and meet, learned about all products in our main area but also had a sense of where everything else is in the ware house. management was reliable, co-workers very friendly especially if you needed help on a product. hardest part of the job.... i dont find anything hard about working at the home depot, the enjoyable part has to be when we find customers and help them around the store during power hours."
good,Started as a cashier and was promoted to the Paint department. Worked mixing paint and stains and provided instructions and advice.
good,Co-workers and customers are great. Retail is retail. Hours and pay leave a lot to be desired.
good,"At the Home Depot I learned to be very outgoing. Everyday I worked with hundreds of people, engaging them in conversations and solving their problems. The fast pace and interactions with new people was very enjoyable because there was never a dull moment but the hardest part of the job was sometimes working upto six hours with no break.The management was great, always pushing you to do your best and acknowedging your efforts."
good,Busy with standing orders. Customer service issues. Learnd to manage time and personel.Not being able to solve a customers problem. Dealing with co workers. Finishing current orders.
good,"Acomodar mercancia de 7 am a 11 am todos lod dias y despues seguir con la atencion al cliente hasta cambio de turno muy buenos compañeros de trabajo hacian las jornadas laborales mas amenas la parte mas dificil era atender clientes molestos, aprender todo sobre instalaciones de diversos tipos y la enseñanza de como atender a los clientes"
good,"alot of work is expected for not much pay, but part-time employees are eligable for benefits"
good,"Very fun place to work, if you don't mind being stuck at the bottom and if you don't mind not having consistent hours. No discount for employee's but a great stepping stone to move on to Lowe's"
good,"In a typical day, there are usually palletized merchandise on the sales floor from those who have worked the over night shifts. Having these palletized merchandized on the sales floor during opening hours can pose a safety risk for especially customers but also associates. Whenever one arrives on the sales floor for the first time of any particular day one's first priority is to unload product/merchandise from the pallet to the shelves, whatever is left is stocked on the overhead."
good,"decent company to work for, but the pay isn't that great for the amount of work you do. Late nights and early mornings, tough with"
good,A typical day at work is pretty pleasant. What I have learned through-
good,Compensation too little for requirements. Otherwise OK. Need better IT systems
good,"I loved working at Home Depot. However, in down time expect only eight hours a week. If you to move up, you have to be interviewed and it's redundant."
good,"Bon emploi, mauvais salaire. "
good,"A typical day of work was going straight out into the parking lot dealing with oblivious customers as i try to push a long row of carts to the front until I'm called to help customers load heavy products into their vehicle. The schedule for how many of us lot techs was all over the place so there were days where when there was only three of us on duty throughout the entire day making is so there was one lot tech on duty for six hours and few days where there were five of us on duty at the same time. Management was always on our backs, but it was more depending on which manager was on duty. One in particular was so strict that she made sure we were always doing something to our absolute limit even when we were braking our backs. Do to how busy it got each day and how busy they managers made me I couldn't exactly get a feel for the work culture. The hardest part of the job was all the heavy lifting and how many other jobs I was made to do that required  training that I was never given. There were fun times too. The company would have parties for their employees every few months with games with gift card prizes."
good,"Aprendes muchas cosas que son utiles para tu vida, convives todo el dia con clientes"
good,Quality of job depends on current management.  Easy advancement for hard workers.  Prepare to work nights and weekends with no set schedule.   Great benefits.
good,"Ok place to work. Supervisors need more training in the areas of respect, professionalism. Supervisors show nepotism a great deal. Mangers don't provide correct replacement of the lead people."
good,Good people but low pay.Their was a lot of politics when it came to promotions. You often had to work on weekends and holidays. But it gave me a lot of customer service experience. I worked there for 4 years.
good,"In my time working here, I hardly talked to any managers. When i first got hired managers did not train me, nor did they expect to train me.Other coworkers had to train me on the computer systems and I had to learn many other things as well. After you get over that hurdle, the job becomes much more enjoyable."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the people, clients and colleagues, everyone becomes like family. If you don't mind punching a clock, the workplace culture is great!"
good,"Most of the staff (management and employees) are so nice and kind towards each other. You really feel part of a family. That is the best take away you will have, their culture. "
good,"first and for most, the most important thing is and are customer service. if I was doing something and a customer needed something, if I wasn't helping another person I would stop what I am doing and help them until they are completely satisfied! receiving loads via trucks was another big part of my job .. everyday and sometimes several times a day I would be summoned to the back of the store to unload a truck. so I would get in a (big) electric Toyota forklift and continue to unload the truck safely and evenly"
good,Work in different departments requiring significantly different levels of effort are paid the same rate. The hourly rate should reflect the amount of physical level of effort required.
good,The company offers virtually no advancement except through the supervisory career ladder.  There are a lot of extremely good non-supervisory personnel who don't get the recognition they deserve.
good,Good place to work if you like dealing with people. I enjoyed working there I just did not get along with management at that particular store. I did 13 years.
good,Worked on overnight freight. Not my immediate manager but higher up management were constantly blaming our shift for anything wrong even when the team had nothing to do with whatever situation was wrong that day. Co-workers and immediate managers were fantastic to work with.
good,"Requires stamina and patience because you spend all day on your feet helping customers, packing out products, stocking shelves and a myriad other chores. But the day goes fast and it's a very positive work environment."
good,There's not much opportunity to grow in the company and management doesn't take the time to get to know their employees. The culture can be very rewarding depending on who you work with.
good,"Great place to help employee and customer dreams come true. Community involvement is top notch. Hardest part of the job was the politics. "
good,"Unfair in their decisions on promotion to better positions. Positions given to the candidate that management wants to put in a position,  regardless if they're the best person and whom has been there the longest time and doing a good job for them. You are required to push credit cards on all customers and are reprimanded for failure to obtain credit cards. No rewards for obtaining credit cards."
good,"Its a pretty good place to work. "
good,"Great Company! Unfortunately, the management team is not always great at every store. The benefits are amazing! Full time associates are always guaranteed their 40 hours part time associates are not guaranteed hours (please keep that in mind when applying)"
good,"Finding your way can be hard, but finding the right people to help you makes it easier. Being in a department that you find fun and challenging can easily make your days fly by,"
good,"Would like to work there again its a very good olace to learn n grow your skills, meet different people absorb knowledge and learn to use tools and machines."
good,"This job was good for a first time worker like myself, i was still in high school doing night school and they were really flexible with my schedule, they allowed me to go in early in the morning and leave before school started so i could go home and shower and get ready"
good,I currently work at Home Depot and would not want any comment to hurt my current job.  The company is very well run and is a great place to gain experience.
good,They throw a lot of parties.  Feed the employees randomly.  Nice stock options and very nice store bonus.  Most dept managers were cool.  Good shift hours.
good,the culture at home depot is enjoyable for seasonal employee who are looking for a good job in having as a side gig all in all i would recommend that people who work there should be able to lift heavy objects
good,"good benefits"
good,Loved my job but poor upper management made it difficult to be successful. Very long hours and compensation was inconsistant and sometimes unfair. Company definetly focuses on customer service but has lost part of its care for associates
good,"Early mornings or evening is what I worked most days there at Home Depot. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, my co workers and the assistant managers. Has a family feel atmosphere , Best part of this job is my co workers , working together and bonding really made time pass by fast there. "
good,"The job itself was easy all you really have to do is help customers find items/materials, stock or front face shelves, and clean up you’re department before your shift is over."
good,"I was on the team that unloaded and sorted the loose trucks. After, we stocked shelves. I like to be busy and physical, and this job was perfect."
good,"I did love working at home depot when i first started. The management there was great and worked with you, really nice. Even gave you training in the departments you were working in.  "
good,Can be a fun and productive place with the right management. Great benefits.Great associates that really try to help each other and look out for each other
good,"store is very short staffed. management doesn't have a clue. was physically assaulted by co-worker and when i verbally got angry and said some things that maybe i shouldn't have, they fired me for language. Received 6 Homer Awards for ""Core Values"" within my first year there. Was always being complimented on my work. But they don't have you back if there are problems. Overnight manage is a joke. Walked away from my situation without trying to diffuse it."
good,It is a good job to have if you're looking to stay in position. Benefits are better than most companies so that is a perk of working there. Good environment for employees to get to know each other.
good,I loved my time at home depot just no hours most of your managers know what they are doing. If you work over over 30 hours in a week your next schedule will be reduced to 15 hours
good,I liked working at home Depot but there was to many managers standing around while we were over whelmed with customers.Theres not enough room in the place.In one year went though five department heads.
good,I love creating the relationships between the customers. Management will soon change. One of the hardest parts of work is having your co-workers not take such importance in their work as you.
good,"Enjoyed working there until management started changing. Also in the years I have worked there they eliminated positions and created new ones, but if your position was eliminated you were not automatically offered the new position."
good,"Great company culture, however poor management can bring your team down and can also affect your ability to advance. Great benefits and stock options."
good,The Home depot was an okay company to work for but the managers hardly ever agreed to accommodate your needs. The managers were the worst employees they had. I often wonder how they got to management when they were terrible at working with others.
good,Loved all my co workers except for the few backstabbers.  Impossible job task in the time allotted. They find a way to fire anyone who works for the company.
good,The Home Depot was the perfect job for a student who wanted to earn a little extra cash. They work with your schedule and management is very understanding that life can get in the way.
good,Not given chance to show talent. Constantly had some one watching over me in an otherwise loose management environment. Was fired form position for not showing for work.
good,The Management were really helpful and they worked hard right along with the workers. The pay was poor and this was a temporary Part-time job. The job was a lot of fun.
good,The company takes care of its employees in all fashions except pay. Promotion to supervisor positions takes time but is overall relatively easy. The next step is harder. Seems like they're lead on.
good,When I first started I had a great manager who took the time to get to know me and helped me grow into the job.  Then got a new manager and he did nothing to help me or the store.  He was always negative and rude.  So depending on what store you work at and what managers you have can make a huge difference in how you like the job.
good,"Leadership wasn’t all the way there could’ve been better. The hours were good though, worked a lot even if it was just part time. Have to learn how to deal with customers."
good,"Customer first philosophy and most all Associates work hard at making this a successful.  Second, there is strong focus to having a family atmosphere for employees.  The"
good,"Good Company to work for, but only if you need a part time job. Takes awhile to move up within the company. Not enough pay to live on. The raises barely cover the cost of living increase. Unless you are starting off as a manager or in corporate."
good,The best part of this job is the customers and peers. The worst part was management in positions they had no business being in. Heavy promotion from within and ever present boys club mentality.
good,All employees are encouraged to participate in the online training that is made available.  Working conditions are good and safety issues are constantly monitored.
good,Home Depot is a very relaxed place to work. The management does care about you. They didn’t however have full time offers often and part time wasn’t ideal hours.
good,"At The Home Depot, a typical work day included showing helping out customers with their needs, keeping the store clean, processing orders, and ensuring there was enough stock available on the shelves."
good,"Relatively easy job, but the fluctuating hours for the schedule really make it difficult to have a normal life. Main reason for wanting to leave the company."
good,"The Home Depot offers plenty of benefits, but doesn't pay very well. A typical day in this role would involve returning calls and updating files, following up on jobs in progress, prospecting for clients in the aisles, cleaning displays and filling samples, and assisting customers in the showrooms throughout the store."
good,"simple work area. go in go out. meet people, and they can turn out to be a best friend. all about work culture too, many different people from different background."
good,"I came to the Home Depot after leaving target and the atmosphere is way better. The target store I worked at, had terrible management and no care for employees. The homedepot, it's none stop smiles and laughing (depending on the day). We are a family!"
good,"If you want forklift experience so you can get into a warehouse or something it is a great place to start.  Worked with nice people, assistant managers were cool.  Hours were erratic and pay was low.  Don't try to pay a mortgage on this."
good,I like co worker  managers  everyone are friendly . Managment  very helpful. No one bothering. Any problem for call the manager they responds fast. They like my customers service. They make me month cof
good,Great pay and benefits. Overtime hours. Just do your job and stay away from other peoples business that may or may not hinder your work time and experience.
good,"it is a good environment to work but it is very hard to advance as a career, it has been a great experience but the demand is very high with little appreciation"
good,It's fast paste most of the time during the week around morning afternoon time. Nights during the week ( monday-wednesay) tend to be slower. Always work weekends less request it off.
good,Great company lots of knowledge potential fun times with company events some great staff members......................................................
good,"I worked there and idk if it was race related or me asking for my shift to be adjusted but they fired me without reason. Also take note of your hours because they will go into your personal time, even if you're a student."
good,"if they would hire full time it would be a great company, but they keep their employees down to the bare minimum at all times so they don't have to pay all the extra benefits. I worked for 4 years and I sounded like a broken record week after week. ""When am I going full time?"""
good,It's a well payed job but is not for everyone. Customer service is a priority but also expected to get done with what is needed at the moment. No overtime is given.
good,"I really liked this job.  It was fast pasted, loved my customers. Had great bennys , and paid sick days.  I worked there for 12 years, I learned alot, and got many awardes and cerificates."
good,Rate of pay not enough for the position I was in. The work was fast pace and sometimes hard to keep up with when customer demand was high. Online orders take precedent for will call except when working on a customer order. Really busy most of the time filling orders for pickup.
good,If you save money by hiring high school students that know basically nothing they it will tend to annoy customers.   I am an expert in many fields and often floated around helping customers.  The managment tended to go both ways. I had some I respected and some I did not.
good,"Employment with The Home Depot is a challenging position as customers are challenging and the work environment is different."
good,Flexible hours for students but low pay. Lot attendants work very hard in the summer and are barely needed in the winter months. Opportunity for advancement available.
good,"No option to use paid days off for illness or emergencies, which does not allow for a proper work/life balance. Shifts are 10+ hours, often longer without warning."
good,There is room for growth if u would like to advance your career. The process is long & very tidious . I would recommend this company to people who are young or students who are just starting out.
good,All in all a decent job. More geared around younger or older people. Lots of part time positions. But advancement isn't easy. Longest job I had. I'd say give it a chance I can think of worse jobs.
good,"The job was actually pretty fine. But there is no chance or foreseeable room for advancement. Those who work their butts off make the same as those who dodge work at every opportunity. By the end, I had to ask myself... ""self, why are you working harder than anyone else and making exactly the same?"" So I left."
good,People there are friendly and hard workers. I feel management dont make the right decisions. I feel for the work compensation should be better. As far as benifits I can they're expensive
good,"place was fast phased , and slow at times . learned how to rebuild tools and learned how all to use all tools . being able to explain how to use each and every tool"
good,Home Depot is a pleasant company to work for. Work days are steady. The management team really care about their teams and advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the caring and compassion of my teammates.
good,It's a job. The culture is nice but it will really depend on the ASM team on how much you will actually enjoy your position. Department Supervisor is a tough spot. Pay isn't great but the demands are high.
good,"Never a dull moment, always a customer or project to work on. On holidays we celebrate as a team, often with a BBQ. Fun work environment as long as your remember it’s a job. Can be flexible with your schedule but do not allow for extra/overtime hours."
good,Wasn’t the worst time but it wasn’t the best. The customers suck but the work is not hard. People really make you feel like a part of a family. Not too bad.
good,Home Depot has a tremendous amount of products on it's inventory and they are interesting to learn about for there extensive mechanical makeup. The store-wide employee meetings are fun and full with sporting games.
good,If i was opening i would set up all tills for the day. Make sure we have the cash drew ready for the day. Get schderal were set for the day. And ran my cashiers from it. I loved doing thing spical things for my cashiers like pizza partys. Cupcakes. They realy like that
good,Home Depot was miss managed up front...lot of time the front end manager was never around when you needed assistance. It was a friendly place to work with a lot of customers relationship/friendships made but a lot of chaos up front with the management.
good,I liked working here a lot. I mean my feet hurt after a long day but other than that it was good. I left when my grandmother died and I haven’t even returned to the store.
good,Good pay good benefits but once you max out on your possible pay increases for your position the price of benefits go up and your pay does not you began to bring home less money every pay period
good,"This company is wonderful when you first start out. After getting to know everyone, you start to see that, like every other big box store, you're just a number. Higher ups do not care about the associates on the front line. They get irritated when things don't go their way and then want to play the blame game and never take responsibility for their own shortcomings. I love the people I work with, but I strongly dislike the company, now that I've been there almost 4 years."
good,Fun place to work with lots of benefits for the associates such as dinners and games but very poor management. The on floor managers and head cashiers were always unpleasant and emotionless.
good,Didnt have advancement opportunities.excessive labor for the pay.alot of behind the back gossip to management.had to pick up slack for employees that wouldn't do their job
good,This was a temporary position during college.  I was actually promoted to Head Cashier without applying.  I had originally turned down the position so that I could focus on my studies and eventually started working at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Space Science and Engineering Center once rent was affordable.
good,"If you have the patience to work for a couple of years and excel in certain areas, you may get full time. My management was great, just not enough hours. Very busy on the weekends. Can get forklift certified at work. Deliveries and order pulling can get very busy. Be careful of hours you apply for. I was there weekends and during the week my hours were all over the place making it hard to find another part time job."
good,Good job if you are in school. Time flys. Management wasn't the best. Pay isn't great. Good company to work for though. A lot of easy work. Other coworkers are nice.
good,At The Home Depot I was required to stock shelves and organize products to Home Depot's specifications. The work was satisfying and the people I worked with were nice. The only problem with this specific job is the overnights.
good,for 5 years it was positive uplifting environment new management got hired on and it made a bad turn in six months they enough occurrences and were unwilling to fix the problems they on the computer.
good,The job itself was great I learned a lot and I gained a lot of knowledge on power tools and how to some home improvements which was great. It was a fast pace work environment and the hardest part of the job (at least for me) was trying to get credit for the company.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, they have great benefits for their associates. Like every company you have people that at times give Home Depot an not so good name, but over all, associates care for one another and look out for one another as well as Managment takes care of there people as well. I’m on the traveling night team so I travel to 5 different stores  and every store is different, some more close like a family than others. Over all it’s a great company to work for."
good,"Work hard and you will be rewarded.  Good opportunities for advancement.  "
good,"This was a challenge in executing my job functions. There were delays and customer issues. On-boarding new subcontractors was made nearly i,possible as the average national pay structure was to low for the metro Boston area."
good,It is a good place to work with good people. Advancement is a bit slow and interdepartmental communication needs work but overall a positive place to work
good,Not a bad place to work the people make it worth it but sometimes the job is to stressful and scheduling was always off many times left alone to run department by myself.
good,You need to know the tricks to advance and there is favortism. The pay is not enough unfortunately.  I loved  my work because I have a passion for paint and helping customers with color and projects but I just could not make ends meet. FT is not enough money to afford their benefits--I qualified for Medicaid.  The overall workday was great.  I enjoyed my customers and my co-workers and our store felt like a family.   Days fly by if you like to work because there is always plenty to do.  If I was making enough money I would stay there.  Personally I could not wait out the time for advancement
good,It was a decent part-time job. The pay was low. I had rare position only working weekdays on a fairly set schedule. I would work there again if needed to.
good,"Good place to work if you like variety and being interrupted, and some shifts understaffed (variety of reasons) so as you stop to help 1 customer, there’ll be other waiting for your assistance, and the questions can be very technical, so you better like training that HD provides, you’ll need it.  Hardest part: being interrupted by very impatient, entitled customers.  Best part: learning new things.  I can still tell you where things are in that store."
good,"Great place to grow, but it has changed over the last 3 years. My time there I was able to grain some great experience and made some amazing friends along the way. It use to be more family structured but it seems they have lost the true fundamentals of taking care of the associates,(more like taking care of management). Work life balance isn't there for ASMs. We work from 55 hrs (minimum) a week with no real cap of time. I have worked well over 75+ hrs a week. That is truly my only issue I have ever had with Depot besides the pay raises that are given the hourly associates. This is what makes the turn over rate so HIGH at HD."
good,Home depot has changed too the customers can be really really rude and test your patience at times.  But for the most part it was really cool. And i enjoyed being there.
good,"Learned how to maintain and service Register Systems and Computers"
good,My experience working in The Home Depot has tought me that not everyone has the same equal advancment opportunities. It was a great experience I learned how to operate the different kind of forklifts essential for warehouse work.
good,"Great environment, Fast pace, Great place to work, You learn alot, Home Depot offers Alot of training to you, Family oriented,Lot of resources for you to look over"
good,I really liked working for home Depot the people where great and understanding of every situation I had going on especially when I was pregnant at the time great very awesome experience wish I can go back.
good,"Working for Home Depot gave me opportunity to learn various departments and working array people from backgrounds. I was able to broaden my knowledge of plumbing,gardening,and other construction builds. The down side to working for Home Depot is they hire mostly part time so during off season you may only get 4 hours a week."
good,A great learning experience. You meet a lot of diverse people. Management was poor from a sales associate's perspective. But benefits were worth the minor annoyance. They promote a family friendly work environment but have a difficult time providing the help (befits) that they offer.
good,Its retail.  Hours and schedule constantly change along with company direction.  They do train you very well and a lot of other companies recruit from Home depot.
good,Not the best pay or raises. Hours are iffy for part time associates. Easy work mostly with occasional downtime. Management is okay. Sometimes have to pick up slack from other workers who want to hide during their shift.
good,Great place to work the employees are wonderful needs more communication with management and more recognition  for the employees slot gets un noticed with some people
good,"Working with customer is a time consuming Job, So days fun others very stressful, some management supportive others not, Cuulture labor intense, hardest part lifting and bending throughout the day."
good,Was a good job. It was a little stressful and fast paced. The only problem was the store manager at the time. He was rude and not people friendly. He would yell at employees right in front of customers.
good,Great if you stick to yourself and don't share personal life with others. Don't make any mistakes if you can help it. Honest mistakes won't help to keep your job.
good,"Was an Order Fulfillment Associate. Overall the job wasn't that bad. Could get very stressful at times if nobody communicated with each other. Had to run around the entire store whenever somebody needed a pallet down or a customer/truck needed loaded/unloaded because there were very few certified forklift/reach operators. Understaffed 80% of the time.  Store Manager would pull people away that were either the only person in their department or caught when they had a moment of free time, to do ""favors"" for him around the store, sometimes taking a majority of the shift."
good,"You're not going to make much at any level in THD, at least not until you get to the Store Manager level. Job can be physically tough depending on what you do. As an OFA I end up walking upwards of 8 miles per day sometimes (according to my phone's health tracker). Despite all this I've found it a kind of fun place to work. There's a lot to learn."
good,"busy as cashier you learn as you go, management is changing workplace culture is young kids, hardest part of job is meeting your metrics and meeting people who desire to work and have fun."
good,I ran the cash register and most days it was slow. My co-workers were great and always willing to help. I was involved in many volunteer projects. They're more willing to advance seniority rather than based on your work performance. They always are involved in helping the community and love doing this within the store for everyone.
good,"Yo entre como pormotor de una marca de pinturas llamada sherwin williams , no como asociado de la tienda"
good,The company encourages freshers for certain positions. this is a good place to start your career. Work wise good and fun. very supportive peers. and supervisors.
good,I loved working at Home Depot.  I moved quickly as a part timer to full time.  Once I found a better paying job they would not let me move back to part time as I was in HR.
good,Good company to work for and it does provide benefits also the workplace culture is good and inviting. Management was good and they provided paid training.
good,"Constantly from day 1 was being hit on. My butt has been grabbed. I was stared down when walking places. Huge favoritism issues. If you weren't part of their clique. You did not move up in the store. If you were part of the clique you were able to stay on your phone. If you were caught nothing but if you weren't part of it. You got written up. Same with breaks, other got away with a few minutes over their break. The managers some not all were very two faced."
good,"Prepared store registers for opening in the morning and prepared bank deposits for pick up by security company."
good,"not much room for advancement without long term working, doesn't pay for experiences. expected more from management to help in advancement of position. like the people not the politics."
good,I love working at Home Depot! It is just really hard to get full time there. I like being involved with the customers to help them have a better experience while shopping with us.
good,it a fast paced job when dealing with contractors and you need to know the products well or at least know where materials are located. When short staffed it can be stressful to meet customer needs.
good,"I worked at a smaller store that had low business in the summer.  Opened on Monday, closed on Wednesday, opened on Friday, opened on Saturday, and closed on Sunday.  Yes, I closed on Sunday and came back within 8 hours to open."
good,"Home depot does offer you several benefits, and they do help you learn all the necessary knowledge for any position, BUT they lack in compensation both associate and managerial."
good,"The Home Depot can be a very fun place to work. The customers are usually nice, sometimes they are not. Helping the customers find the products they needed was always fun"
good,"HD only hires part-time employees, after one year, it is my understanding, that you have the option of going full-time.  My personal opinion, this fosters a lack of commitment to the company."
good,Worked several different shifts. Almost every weekend. But over all not too bad. Worked indoors in air conditioning. met several good people that worked there
good,"My typical day at home depot would involve checking stock on shelves, product rotation, product placement, and unloading inbound trucks.  The hardest part of the job was working in hot weather in a box truck.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers such as changing heads on trimmers, helping with information on pest control and helping customer make informed choices."
good,"Great place to work but to much favoritism. I love to work there but I can do better! I started as an overnight employee and worked my way up, even got transferred to another HD"
good,"Ensured the store is stocked and ready for business every day; Loaded and unloaded trucks, moved material from the receiving area throughout the store; Operated forklifts and performed critical functions for maintaining proper on-hands and pricing for customers. Direct customer interaction and excellent customer service skills."
good,"Working for HD had good days and bad days.  Unfortunately due to the high turnover in staff and management, and the outside hiring of Dept Supervisors, it is very difficult to advance within the company unless you are willing to relocate to another store."
good,This is a challenging place to work the phones are not stop ringing.  The communication is terrible.  It has one of the worst staffing of any job I have ever had.  There is a tremendous amount of favoritism.  The new labor matrix is by far one of the worst I have ever seen.  Management are awesome people but good luck finding one to help a customer. The work life balance for leads and non management is horrible.  They took away our set days and constantly wanting everyone to work 6 to 12 days in a row without any overtime.
good,I started off as a garden sales associate and worked my to being a special services associate. I loved every bit of my job from my coworkers to my customers. Love how everyone would know to come to the service desk to fix an issue or get clarification on an order.
good,"Work environment was good. Work hours and days varied, and what you did depended on customers being there. Management was not supportive a lot of times and left decisions that should have been theirs to the sales associate. I'm not sure The Home Depot has a particular workplace culture. I enjoyed helping customers and working with my unit co-workers."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  The culture is very good, especially for students.  As a long time career, advancement is difficult.  Management tends to be reactive instead of proactive."
good,"There definitely isn’t  a wok, life balance in this position!  The expected hours for salaried managers is ridiculous!  The lack of training for managers and then holding them accountable is unreal."
good,"I worked for Home Depot in Northern California. At that Home Depot the Management team was awesome. I transferred to Southern California, and the team here is sub par"
good,"I have worked for the Home Depot for quite a few years now in various positions, both full and part time. I have great co-workers and the customers are so-so. Pray you are in a good store because management is either really good or really bad. HD is all about ""The Same Page"" but no one seems to be on the same page."
good,"things I learned were Listen, Listen,  Listen then speak "
good,I have enjoyed working for the Home Depot. Ready for a change.Customer Service and helping in other departments as required. I enjoy helping others out.
good,"Good stepping stone job that provides basic training in several fields, such as lift equipment training as well as office management type fields depending on which department you chose"
good,"Overall great company. One of the best in terms of retailers. However, on a store level, there is struggle. Some managers play favorites, some are just lazy.  Both play a factor in associate involvement throughout the store. The few managers trying to do right by the company are often seen as the bad guys for following SOP and, if that manager is a DH, they have to be afraid that their efforts may be contradicted by upper management. Very little support or guidance for DHs from upper management. "
good,"When I first started working here I knew exactly who’d I be close with and who I’d steer clear of. Favoritism is popular and weekends off are rare, labor law changed and so did the hours and atmosphere of the stores associates"
good,"The only thing i can say is that if your not ""friends"" with certain management there then you get no where. I have had some issues there and they said that they would get handled and it didn't"
good,"its an okay job to get on your feet, but if you have forklift license and everything you still get paid the same and are rquired to do a lot of work for low salary and very slow raise about a couple cents only for years."
good,"It’s a good job if you work on the floor depending on department . It’s a good job if you doesn’t live on your own, but if you are out on your own it doesn’t pay enough to live and have some to play with."
good,"managers were not qualified and at times biased. It was fast paced and a lot of stress at times but overall a good experience. Pay was fair, managers were my biggest issue."
good,"This company as a whole is a great one to work for. But the management where I'm at, lacks on so many levels. It's really sad, because the building has the potential to be great, but the supervisors are what's draining the moral in the building."
good,You work with great people but the pay isn't great and there is issues with Management. They have issues being on the same page and giving the same direction.
good,Lack of communication on leadership end.Different consideration towards others in same position.No concern for associates petsonal needs.Lack of encouragement towards building your career.
good,"Company-wide dependence on web based training so job and product skills and knowledge are 99% self taught without fair regard to normal duties assigned. "
good,"Great Place to develop personal skills, much training provided. Typical day involves greeting Customers, working sales quotes, solving customer issues, and shelf maintenance. Management varies from location to location with regard to style and how they will either work with you as a team or micro-manage their employees. Hardest part of the job - retail schedules, working early/late and all the weekends and holidays. Most enjoyable part of the job, the Home Depot Family, relationships that develop with the team you work with and frequent Customers."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at the Home Depot. I learned a wealth of information to provide the best service possible to my customers. I also learned a great deal to accelerate my personal career in the future. Unfortunately, the opportunity for growth was minimal in this particular location. I carry extensive years in management and posses leadership skills but I wasn't part of the cool kids club to achieve a faster opportunity for advancement. I sincerely thought after a year in I would be able to advance faster. Management had a tendency to push hard on it producing employees instead of developing the weak links to avoid burning out the ones that produce consistent numbers."
good,"It is a great place to work if you have another commitment in your life, like school or another part time job.  However, if you plan to stay long term it is harder to get a full time job without being buddies or come from the outside."
good,"Home Depot is a place that I cannot complain too much about because I did have some very good managers at my locations, however there were people there that would try to bring you down or not treat you fairly."
good,I didnt work in store. I have a technical position with outside services. I had to use my car for work and drive to potential customers houses. The type of work I was doing is not a job for everybody.
good,"If you want to work at the Home Depot. You better ready to work your butt off. They really don't like when you take time off, even if you're sick. You'll probably have a bad manager that doesn't speak very good English. They'll always make you feel bad and you are regularly competing at a cut-throat pace with the other stores."
good,"Neither absolutely terrible nor absolutely fantastic. Its a job with a lot of overturn, so there's always a position open and as long as you show up on time and everyday you're golden, pony-boy."
good,"Work is typically engaging, usually something to do. Often too busy to complete given tasks without multiple associates. "
good,It’s ok. They need to give a gas allowance. They also need to give a weekly draw. And better leads..  overall Home Depot is a good company I still holding out hope.
good,"Management and lack of unified direction were the biggest problems, company structure in the stores are split in two store associates and merchandising associates with entirely different goals and management this leads to most of the issues and disagreements with no real resolution."
good,It is not a bad company to work for when you reach management level it is only if you don’t care about your schedule. You are paid fairly but forget about your work/ life balance. You work all holidays besides thanksgiving and Christmas. You can manage your schedule and request days off though you get them only if you’ve been approved.  Regular associate starts from $11.  Supervisor higher though full flex schedule 5am-11pm.
good,"The Home Depot underlying mission and work ethic are excellent especially in comparison to many big Corps"
good,Good company to work for.  They provide helpful training and have great benefits.  They check in often to make sure things are going well and you have what you need.
good,great first job and years before full time.  low pay  not good raise.  not good health insurance . not enough hours and not will give full time out at all
good,"The job as a cashier could be demanding mentally and physically. The area I worked in had people that had a lot of money so they expected to have things done their way and in their time. But the customers and my coworkers, for me, were the best part of the job. I had regulars that would come find me in whatever section I was working that day to tell me about the progress of the projects they were working on and to ask my opinions on things."
good,you deal with slow traffic volume and seasonal hours. unless you are full-time the pay is low and there are no benefits. It's a great gap job while searching for another position because they'll work with you on scheduling
good,I very much enjoyed working in the garden area during the spring and summer because it is fun being around all the plants and flowers. The job is hard because you stand all day.
good,"The people there are amazing, the management on the other hand is a hit or a miss. They can be great at times and a disaster at other. They teach quite a few skills there but at the same time they don't have enough training to really teach everything."
good,"That was a barbecue day. when I first got there I improved myself to learn new skills. The home depot's standard is to put customers first."
good,"Advancement never really happened even after training was complete. "
good,"empresa con excelente ambiente de trabajo desarrollo y crecimiento durante mi estancia , comprometida socialmente durante mi estancia lo que mas me agrado fue los progaramas de apoyo  ala comunidad, excelente aprendisaje y conocimiento de productos y tencinas sobre aplicacion de materialesy productos"
good,"Working as a cashier I met a variety of people. Contractors, home owners, small business owners. Everyone I worked with were helpful and friendly. We worked together as a team and we had great customer service."
good,"The Depot prides it self of offering many products and long hours of operation, a clean store, and orderly. My job as a freight team member was working in the hardware department, 10,000 items. I would get anywhere from 8-to 12 pallets a night filled with new product. I would place items on shelves and the remainder I put a SKU # on and place in the overheard and trained new employees in my depart and others as well. On the rare time the delivery truck was late or didn't arrive I down stocked items to fill shelves. Team work is needed to accomplish big goals. Management was only two people but they rarely had to check on my work to know that it was done right the first time. The culture was different from what I was accustomed to because everyone was all over the store so there was no small talk except on your lunch and breaks. The beginning was the hard part of the job before I learned where everything was and until I got a license for a lift truck to place items in overhead. Even my supervisor was fired after 17 years with the company. When I got hired with 16 other people after six months I was the only one left. They are too ridged as a company."
good,The workplace atmosphere and attention to detail are very good reasons to work at Home Depot. I only wish I could work there on a full time basis. It is a overall good place to work.
good,"Great team atmosphere, fun people to work with. There has been great managers and not so great managers there. It was fun to learn about each department and how to help customers in all areas."
good,I loved the company and only left the company due to my Store Manager having substance abuse issues and when I tried to get him help he turned on me . This was a fight I knew I couldn't win so I moved on.
good,The company has a great concept however over the years too many changes with failed upper management. Hiring of managers was not as in-depth as it should be causing less than qualified candidates obtaining positions they are not experienced in.
good,"As a cashier, you don't count the money in cash register when you come in or leave. The Home Depot App makes it easy to locate the items for your costumers, it is a constant busy place but fun. The hardest part was standing for five hours even with the fifteen minutes brake that you are allowed. Everyone respects each other, it feels like a family environment working at the St. Augustine Home Depot."
good,"The benefits were great, and the pay was okay, considering the industry and city. However, there were safety issues I had with my job that were eventually rectified,."
good,"The store will close at 10pm but you would have to stay in 12am sometime a little longer, then come right back at 5am they say the computer do the time but thats not true because a manager would change it daily."
good,"Loved learning new things about products. Loved interacting with the customers. Helping customers solve problems. Interacting with vendors was always a learning experience. Met some great people working there over the years, customers and co-workers. Some I am still in contact with."
good,"this is a great company to start your career. I enjoyed and learned so much about customers, garden, and ect.. the managers and co-workers was very friendly."
good,"I enjoy my job, I mix paint colors, give great customer service and run registers if needed.  I have done inventory for 3 years. I have received 2 platinum awards for customer service. "
good,"The company Home Depot entity itself is amazing.  The company promotes good safety, awesome customer service based, and has an all around friendly atmosphere, when at the right store.  Not all individual stores are the same with their customer service and it may differ from each location."
good,"I was an appliance specialist at Home Depot, But I was trained in several other areas of the store. I also had some management duties including ordering items for showroom and implementing floor plan when it changed. "
good,"I adored the work I did, from arranging deliveries to pulling customer orders and especially providing customer service throughout the store. It gave me a great sense of accomplishment to help the customers and provided me with a great opportunity to learn from them as I provided assistance."
good,fun place to work if you dont mind working odd hours. closing one night and then opening the next morning is ridiculous. i know they are retail but a they should give regular schedules. even if they rotate.
good,"I was able to talk to coworkers. help customers. and do work. though the amount of work i did, like pushing a pallet weighing 2000lbs or 3000lbs, i wasnt paid enough."
good,have good co workers. there weren't any favorites. got along with everyone. customers was nice. managers listen to you. hoe depot was a good place to work. good customer service and a nice medium pace
good,"assisting customers, trained in three areas of the store, management good, workplace nice and friendly, not really a hard part, enjoy the associates looking different types of customers from the pros to the do it yourself, learning different types of plants and gardening, which fertilizer works best to which chemicals to use on your lawn and garden."
good,"The Home Depot was a good place to work the first few months because the managers seem eager to help you advance, but after that they don't really care about you anymore. They don't give pay raises to people that deserve them and they promote unqualified people. It's a good temporary job, but nothing one can handle for more than that."
good,Can not get many hours if you are part time. Promise when hired you might get up to 27 a week but does not happen. Most people that work there are nice. Big turn over in employees mainly because  dissatisfied with hours and favoritism in positions. Not enough hours to make it worth while to work. Some weeks you get 4 hours to  work. Something is very wrong with this picture.
good,The best parts of the company are working with customers from all walks of life. Also a very diverse combination of associates. Management is not always dependable to follow through.
good,It's a nice place to work aside from the fact that you don't get paid much and management and scheduling is alittle all over the place. But other than that the workers are nice and everybody gets along.
good,"Management was not good, the turn over of employees was and still is very bad."
good,This is a great job for high schoolers college students and senior citizens but that would be about it it is not a place for someone to try to raise a family on
good,Would have liked more training and more involved team work setting. I was in a area with no or little training on the merchandise.  I had to look up information on the products that were on the floor sales and shelf myself
good,the home depot is a great place to work everyday is different. I can go one day helping multiple customers to resetting 6 bays for Christmas. The home depot is very customer driven which i enjoy the different manger style and the expensive benefits are hard to deal with.
good,I felt that the associates suffered from a constant lack of communication. Merchandise was stocked differently by each associate. It seemed that a lot of associates took shortcuts to perform their daily tasks. The quantity of work always seemed to outweigh the quality of work. It was difficult to keep the department organized because the other associates did not follow through with upkeep throughout the rest of the day. There were too many people that just did not have interest in attracting more clients by keeping shelves stocked and areas clean. The displays were not tidy and it really was not a good representation of how a successful business should appear to the public. Too many of the associates just did not care enough to put in a solid work day. I do not know if it was laziness or carelessness that attributed to the deficiency in personnel.
good,The hardest part of the job is balancing keeping the customers happy while protecting the company's best interest. It is also part of this role to keep specialist on task and current with customer orders and projects without being a manager.  So it is difficult at times to be a peer leader.
good,"I couldn't do my job completely because there were never enough employees behind the counter to help customers, was forced to load and unload heavy equipment daily."
good,"The job was okay but the management was lost most of the time and it made the cashier look like bad, i would love to go but if the management is still the same, i want."
good,It's a great job if your not there all day.  The store I was in was rather slow.  As a cashier that was very boring.  I stayed out of the drama with cashiers and head cashiers.  I guess you get that in hourly paid jobs.
good,"Home Depot in Somersworth NH had a great team of people to work with, this was the best part of working there. The major setback for me was how it frequently changed the management team...In some situations this was a good thing but for the most part it was one of the most difficult things about this job."
good,"Great Pay... Great opportunity.. but restructures every year... Celebrates record sales while eliminating their infrastructure more and more... Headquarters brings in new directors with zero experience in that particular field and/or industry (in this case Loss Prevention)... New plays and strategies are forged...   If those strategies don't work the field infrastructure is reorganized and jobs are eliminated.  Director promotes and a new one is appointed... and it starts all over again.  You really never know whether you'll have a job. I experienced 6 reorgs in 7 years.  During ""record profits"""
good,I am working here and started as lot and cashier . It was good place to work in . Then they taught me departments and I started getting shifts but i was still on paper i was lot associate they were not able to find someone for lot so they kept on using me even when i was working as sales that was ok for me i love to work but at basic pay i dont think its worth it.
good,"Inconsistency with upper management, learned a ton about WM, culture was HR driven, there were still a few good associates and leaders in our building."
good,"If you do what you're supposed to do, then work will be okay. If you're lazy, sooner or later you get fired. Management sucks, good thing they move around so often"
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I have a different opinion on management. The Previous Home Depot location I worked at, no problems. The store manager at my new location cared more about the store than the employees, which I understand. I wish someone would teach management, In order to be a great manager you must be beneficial to the company and to your employees."
good,"Allways tried to stay busy, reviewing customer agreements, cancelling or processing orders, dealing with phone calls and the base for the business taking care of customers"
good,"I learned a lot of info working at the HD,The hardest part of the job sometimes is dealing with management too many boses everyone is telling you to do something different and when its not correct  they try and hold you accountable. The most part of the Job is around the Holidays example going to the annual Christmas Party. The Hardest part is dealing with managers and different views on things.Took the background check on all 3 jobs passed it with flying colors! The reason I'm seeking employment elsewhere is because I want to advance with a company and not worry about all the Drama and conflict."
good,Used to be a great company to work for. It still is a good company to work for however the company started to Micro manage a lot of aspects that used to be controlled by the stores making it more stressful because of that lack of control when trying to help customers.
good,"helping customers, learned a lot about different products, orders, and etc., managements were good, not enough hours, knowing my job and helping people with problems"
good,"i highly enjoyed my co-workers. they were the absolute best group of people with a nice teamwork energy. management, for the most part, is not available during the day unless there is a big event. "
good,"Typically at the call center, go in, take calls. I learned how messed up some of the policies are. Management is ok depending on who you have. The culture is awesome they want everyone to be happy, but I got constantly berated because running to the restroom counted as an additional break. Most enjoyable part was training, a month of training and it was a ton of fun."
good,Hours and pay sucks but it's a friendly and nice work environment. 401k is a good thing about theme but it's just one of those jobs where if you don't kiss butt you won't go far up the chain.
good,it’s a fun fast paced environment. a lot to do you will never have anything to do. flexible hours apply if you provide a school or other job schedule..
good,Mainly working as cashier and helping customers. Management was great. Family type work place. Helping people that is all there is to say. have a nive day
good,down fall is getting few shifts scheduled and still working 5 days because of short handed. but it felt that begging for shifts because if you did not ask you did not get the shifts even if you were needed.
good,Overall I had a great experience for 7 years of hard work. I also learned alot as Home Depot put a lot into training Associates and their management team. It do seam like the stores are not on the same process as stores in the home city of Atlanta. There is rogue districts and District Managers. The company do have opportunity to move forward until it come to salary positions. Then it gets very weird and cut throat. People start changing and creating teams.
good,"A great company where I did many experiences was happy to have these who might useful any warehouse I was happy worked there. "
good,"It's a lot like High School....very clique-ish . When a job posting internally came up, they already had a person picked, But they needed to show three interviews. it was insulting to say the least. When management lies to you, its very demeaning."
good,"It is retail so it is low wage with lots of work and dealing with customers that can be rude. It may not be for everyone, but if you apply just be ready to work your booty off."
good,"Poor management and advancement, I was stuck in the same position in sales because I produced great numbers but they refused to promote me into management because I was so good at sales and they hired people from outside retailers and not within."
good,All days are not same sometimes its good and i enjoy at work sometimes its really stressful because of improper scheduling. They try to get as much as possible work from one person.
good,"One of my three managers and myself butt heads often, and he decided it would be cool to change my inputs in the inventory system. Led to write ups and intimately my termination. Otherwise a pretty decent place to work."
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot I have encountered all variety of people and cultures. I have made new friends & expanded my skill base. "
good,Aprendes mucho en este trabajo. Los descansos son entre semana.
good,"The company overall has some wonderful values, a terrific culture, and generous benefits. That being said, associate's experiences vary greatly depending on individual workgroups and leadership within them. Senior level management and above within my group was comprised of smart people, but poor leaders."
good,"itll do for a job. however at my location the backroom politiking and things of that nature were off the charts. making it an odd work environment. take it or leave it,"
good,"Working at Home Depot is a stressful and political environment. If you are liked by the managers then it will be a pleasure to work there and you will advance easily, if not then it is an decent job for a college student or a retiree. If you can deal  with inventory, guidelines, and customer service well then it is a decent job."
good,"Hated the inconsistent schedules, no social life.  Full-timers flexed their schedules dependent on PT needs.  They worked with my school schedule.  Fair turn-over rate.  Community centered so they held lots of events for children and to teach DIY, which was nice."
good,"The Home Depot helped me learn many new things such as driving forklifts to knowledge of products in a variety of departments. At the same time, the amount of work that was asked of me/fellow associates wasn't valued."
good,This was not an in-store position. Outside sales consultants are paid commission only and the sales leads are weak. That is all I care to comment about this.
good,Jefes se an vuelto ciclicos no buscan el bienestar de la empresa solo cumplir un horario de trabajo se preocupan menos por las causas del problema
good,Enjoyed my experience with Home Depot. i left because my position was eliminated and store hours were cut and I was least senior employee in this role.
good,"The thing that makes working for The Home Depot enjoying is not necessary the job but the people who you do the job with. At some points in time, the job can be really overbearing. Either because there is a large flux of customers that suddenly filled the aisles, or because you are the only out in the aisles. But after talking a hit, it is my coworkers that pick me back up. I can say that at The Home Depot, it is really a team mentality structured store. We all watch out for one another."
good,"It is retail, so all the negatives of retail are in play. But we work with a lot of really great people and there are a lot of advancement opportunities"
good,Job is fast paced but training is lacking. Working alone after 3 days was difficult. There are many opportunities but would prefer somewhere closer than 45 minutes.
good,I veleve it would have taught a lot but I just did not get enough hours to stay people was great ther management was good as well overall a good place to except the hours
good,Always provide excellent customer service and keep busy. Be ready if someone needs you. I learned a lot about every department and became a back up cashier and went above and beyond to help satisfy customer and coworker needs.
good,"Completing store readiness check list and fixing any issues that were safety hazards. Completing department out of stock count, locating product filling in empty spots. Providing product knowledge to customers. Opening credit card accounts for customers."
good,Biggest negative is work schedule.  you could work 7-10 straight then get two off. Or close the store and have to reopen store the next morning.  Often difficult to get help in the store and loaders for heavy items. Often work holidays for double time.
good,Good job security if you do your job.  Sometimes hard work and sort staffed.  Be ready to work other departments you might not have knowledge or training in.
good,"Coming in as a fresh Kitchen Designer, The Home Depot will give you all the tools you need. The only issue for a family person are the hours. The Home Depot went to set hours, 8-4:30,11:30-8 and 1-9."
good,Typical day at work would be involved in customer and associate relations. Home Depot had a culture of putting customers first and taking care of their associates. Hardest part of the job was the amount of hours management worked. Enjoyable part of the job was seeing the rewards of a productive store operations.
good,"The mission of HD is great. The local management tends to put his/her goals ahead of the Corporate mission by degrading some employees and permitting other longer term employees/managers/ASM to bring underage drunk employees to a year end party.  Management has the latitude to treat employees in a manner that is horrible and untraceable with the support of the D.M. Hey other than the above do a good job, have the customers verify your proficiencies you are OK, however do  remember that should the Store manager have a philosophy of  ""do not confuse me with the facts permit me to have my own opinion""."
good,"This company overall is a great place for employment. It offers so much more than just a job. The people i work with are awesome, helpful as well as kind. There isnt a better company to work for THE HOME DEPOT"
good,You learn alot about things you would probably not learn about without having worked there. Christmas time is fun to work there with all of the christmas trees.
good,"As a delivery puller expect to do a lot of work pulling in orders, usually multiple at a time. The pay is great for retail and if you're ok with multiple managers telling you what to do it's an easy job. It can get tiring at times but there's also more downtime compared to customer service agents"
good,worked at the pro desk as a sales consultant for professional contractors.  we helped fill orders for customers and gave them knowledge for merchandise on sale or that could help do a better job for them.
good,"RGIS,LLC is a fast paced, customer driven company.  Developing skillful team members and retaining a base team is essential.  The most difficult part of the job is letting go of some of the control in inventories because we cannot count for every single mistake and error.  This job has taken me around the country and I love what I do. A decent quality of life is very hard to come by with the job though."
good,"Worked there for almost 4 years, on my last year I received a increase in salary from $9.45 to $10 an hour. Ends up the increase was a mandatory wage increase to the whole store so associates who were just hired for the same position received the same pay as a few others and I who have been there longer. "
good,I worked at The Home Depot for several years as I was going to school. They are really good at giving me hours around my school schedule and they wanted to see me succeed. A day at The Home Depot is typically fast-paced in the summer months and there is always something to do. Management is pretty good and the coworkers are always willing to help out if you need it.
good,I enjoyed the growth opportunity from Cashier to Head cashier. We also helped in the community with Team Depot. This helped the veterans within the local community.
good,"not a bad place, just ask for more to start, if you're starting in lumber or garden. The managers get things done, and the coworkers are good people!!"
good,"A typical day at work was very physical, and fast-paced. The management was very helpful almost all of the time, but the job expectations far exceeded the compensation and culture."
good,Fun place to work but need to make more money.  started as paet time and went full due to needing benefits.  I could advance here if I stay with them but even moving up does not pay much.
good,It a nice place to start of your work skills.there management need to be more improve more.  I know most work place people have there up and down .BUt most off all everyone is grown and old eoungh to know to leave there problem behind.
good,"To ensure all freight comes in the door, gets checked in and put on the shelves before the store opens."
good,Good starts. Slow rank climbing. Some managers are harder to deal with than others. Good part time job if you just need spending money. No real future
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for,  I learned the some great lesson while working there. I meet alot of wonderful people while employed,  very diversed company"
good,This is a great place to start for customer service.  You get the chance to get to talk and create a great relationship with customers and help them out while having fun.
good,It was a pleasure working with people who are passionate about the customer and community improvement. Coworkers are friendly and encouraging to learn and adapt to the company's daily requirements. Overall I'm happy I got to work at the homedeopt
good,Assisted guest with transactions at the cash register. Helped guests with special orders. Most co-workers were willing to help when needed. Enjoyed working in the lumber yard.
good,Great job for a college student.  Will give you plenty of hours.  Work distribution is not equal.  If your a hard worker they will exploit it.  Management knows who their hard workers are and will hardly compensate you for it.  Customers can range from difficult to down right impossible.  Be ready to bite your tongue a lot.
good,"It is a good place to work at. On a daily basis, the pace can vary between being slow to very fast. We worked as a team. Everyone was very easy to get along with. The management team was very sufficient in doing their part when and where we needed them. The hardest part was working with angry and dissatisfied customers. The enjoyable part was getting to learn things, about parts and tools, i didn't know."
good,Easy work just get a nice habit or routine going it will be easy. Management cant make it tough if you don't feel the support. You don't have any real power so if management does not support you things with subordinates can be stressing.
good,"working the cash register can be a challenge,great place to learn and grow with the company , superior training is provided and the chance to grow within the company is wonderful,the greatest pat of The Home Depot is the way they work with your schedule. The hardest part of my job I would say can be the customers , a big challenge"
good,"This is a good job if you are a semi retired contractor or tradesmen. The pace is reasonable, hours are ok, and they are located everywhere. Management is well trained."
good,"Home Depot is a great company overall. Based on the location you may encounter a spectrum of leadership. Learn from the great and the bad. Turnover is very high for the associate positions because of the high demand work for low pay, but if you want to make it a career and earn your way up it is potentially rewarding."
good,It was a fun place to work with good co-workers and most of the managers were good fun people to work with it definitely taught me some things but over all it wasn't the best work experience i have ever had but also wasn't the worst. i was told i was going to be freight unloading trucks then they put me in garden and then i was told that i was going to be making 13 an hour and i looked at my first pay stub and i was only making 12 an hour not an honest store manager.
good,"The work place is okay to work at, management at the moment isnt to great they seem to only care about themselves and not their employees. But the employees are great and help you when ever needed."
good,"If you don't mind doing the work of three people during your shift, for minimum pay, apply here. Lots of great friends, but turnover is very high since the pay is terrible and the work is very hard. Physically demanding, and the only female manager is kind of a bully."
good,"Lots of benefits and some great people to work with. Pay is not great, but benefits make up for it. Our team was great and very helpful. Our management was the only thing that made going to work a bit of an issue as they seemed to be driving the team appart and we lost a lot of good people throughout the time I was there. Good experiance overall."
good,It was a very very stressful place to work. They overlook those faithful few alot. Working at Home Depot taught me alot about home improvement and it also taught me about flooring tiles and carpet.
good,"I loved it there. the atmosphere was great, the pay was not great. hard to survive on that job alone, even with full time hours. If they had given me a raise, I would still be there."
good,"The job is okay. There is room for promotion, but sometimes the promise for the position isn't kept. The hours are not constant or stable they very from week to week if you are not full time. If you are full time you don't work the same days every week."
good,"I love working for The Home Depot, I am amazing at customer service and should really be a COS. The opportunity for growth is definitely at the store."
good,"A typical work day consists of checking my will calls and deliveries on the computer, processing phone orders (companies send workers to buy material and they pay over the phone), setting up will calls and deliveries per customer requests over the phone or in person, putting together quotes and sometimes calculating materials quantities for customer projects. There is lots of multitasking involved and can get disorienting at times but with enough focus it's a breeze."
good,"My fault, I quit, their fault I could not live off the short hours. I was told that if I quit, I would not be given a chance to be rehired. Even before I was hired. But the 17 to 22 hours a week were not enough to pay bills.  I tried finding a part time job to complement this one. I was offered full time for less per hour, but that made more per week."
good,"Loved working there and dealing with customers and solving issues they had, But management wasn't the best and supervisors were even worse. The nice part of working there were the hours."
good,"Managers keep you busy always something todo, great people to work with always getting done one time sometimes ahead of schedule, decent amount of breaks overall good place to work"
good,"Helped solve customer plumbing problems and offered a solution. Put in a valuable suggestion, which was adopted company-wide.  No recognition was given."
good,"Home Depot located in Fergus Falls, MN was an awesome employer and the co-workers were the best! There was some room for advancement as well as opportunities to be cross-trained in other areas. "
good,"Interact with customers, handle transactions and checked customers out. Pushed credit and surveys. Relieve other cashiers and use different registers."
good,I've been working at Home Depot for two months now and I'm enjoying it. My coworkers are like my family. Everyone is helpful. I get to talk to some of the most down to earth customers ever.
good,"typical retail setting - the only difference being the extreme importance on customer service (which I love). As an employee you have the support from management to take care of the customer."
good,Easy going job. Need good people skills to handle customers questions without having any issues. Schedule is very flexible schedule if you are a part times
good,"Working at Home Depot applies a dress code that is appealing to the public,including awards and patches that show your experience. Working with approx 150 employees a great group of people.Having the oppurtunity to work and serving the public,stocking merchandise and making store presentable for customers and providing excellent customer service ,getting a good results seeing customers smiling is a great personal experience ."
good,Working at Home Depot was a nice place to work at. It taught me a lot about different tools and help me learn about home repairs. The only thing I wished they did differently was to give me more hours a week.
good,"Great co workers, flexible shifts,room to advance,great benefits even for part time employees. discounts on many things such as travel, phones etc.  Paid sick,vacation and holidays."
good,"Good company if you are willing to give up your work life balance to be a part of a successful retail company. Paid well, but required you to work a lot of hours when in upper management."
good,"journée de travail variable,,"
good,"Home Depot works well as a part time employer, and is very flexible with my time off requests. I enjoy helping customers and this location puts a premium on customer service."
good,"Favorites are played, management favors those who play to their interests rather than to those who work hard."
good,"Learned general sales, how to sell a product to customers. Typical day is busy if the store is understaffed. Management generally tries their best to assist in any way possible. Work schedule is very flexible and they will work with you."
good,"Its a great environment to work in, even though its retail, its more like a warehouse job so for me who's looking for something more balanced, but still want that customer interaction, it works out well.  There are several opportunities to stand out and be a better associate, but there isn't much opportunity to get more money more than once a year."
good,"Great place to work for. Management has open door policy. Workplace is like working as a family. The hardest part about the job is standing on concrete, dust everywhere, no air conditioning."
good,"Although it was some what easy to request days off, the managers were very hard to work and coordinate with. I will also say my position as a lot associate had positive and negatives. If you enjoy being outside all year round its a great positio"
good,learned alot about home improvement also about garden management isnt all that great but u have some that work and some that dont hardest thing asbout the job is lack of coverage
good,it was alright. I wasnt getting enough out of it so I left. I needed a job that I can get more out of. I dont know what else to say so im just hgonna type random things until i get the amount of characters i need
good,The Home Depot is a good first job. It helps yo learn about the fundamentals of construction and etc. Raises are okay. Good if your balancing school and work.
good,i loved working with the customers and i loved being around the plants also i liked the parties and the pot luck give always. i just needed more pay because i having a big family.
good,"Everyone starts out as part-time with varying hours and days scheduled.  If you enjoy working with the public, handling cash and being the last experience a customer relates to when they shop at the store, this job can be very fulfilling."
good,"good part time job with benefits, just could get paid more since you must learn product knowledge on a vast amount of products and brands unlike other part time workplaces."
good,"I was able to learn a lot in this company, I loved the fact that they gave you classes on all departments so that you could be efficient in selling to customer"
good,"While I truly love what I do at Home Depot, this location has gone from having a very people oriented culture to being all about the numbers. After multiple changes within the management team in the past three months, the morale of the store has been shattered. Top sales specialists have left or are attempting to leave after being threatened with write ups despite exemplary performance. For this reason, I have chosen to leave the company at this time."
good,"Overall competitive work environment where I learned the day to day business and how to take care of my associates.  Generally a up beat vibrate workplace with a management team that tries to maintain that enthusiasm.  Physically the hardest job I've ever done, and the associates are the best of all."
good,"Pros: Diverse people and colleagues that will make you proud to work with you."
good,"The people here are awesome but the hours are inconsistent and difficult to cont on the hours. always based on sales. too much pressure to just sell credit cards and not towards customer service, not enough help in departments to support front end very frustrating. making us look stupid"
good,"People were great but no room for growth, Even with your work ethic and showing ambition they never really looked to advance people."
good,I've worked for The Home Depot for just under 3 years and I have enjoyed my time with the company. The work isn't too hard to complete and the people that I work with are nice.
good,"A good company to work for. They give you room to grow and change positions in the company. Fast paced, which I enjoy. The Home Depot app is very helpful and customers are nice."
good,"Waiting on Customer's"
good,"This is a very laid back environment, with smiling employees. They recognize that the employees in the stores are the front line of the business. I have only been with the company a few short weeks and absolutely love this place."
good,"good training in millwork dept. when I was there. I learned other departments and excelled at my job. I received  regional sales award In millwork dept. for top sales in the region. Management at the top level was difficult at times to work for as they had no interest in the employees. managers at the store, most were helpful and courteous. There was a lot of turn around at the store, mostly part time work, however I was one of the few full time. The most difficult part of the job was not enough employees that stayed long enough to learn all departments to help. I enjoyed the people I worked with and still have lasting friendships with some of them."
good,Great in store people to work with. Terrible management and mediocre pay. Great team aspect. You can count on them to come to your aid in completing a task or project.
good,"Good company to work for, the pay scale needs to be improved for people to support their families, upper management are well compensated. Benefits are very good."
good,"I worked as pack-down team in the early morning with a group of other early-risers who would do inventory and move down merchandise onto the shelves. "
good,Worked there for 8 years. I had wonderful co workers that felt like family. The pay was not to my satisfaction which is why I left. Other than that I would have stayed.
good,I find The Home Depot to be an adequate place to work.  They have found my work to be generally satisfactory.  This is despite the fact that I am not the most handy type of person.  I have learned much about stick frame construction since I was hired.  My coworkers are people that i enjoy working with.
good,"Se trabaja bajo presión pero aprendes a sobrellevarla  conforme pasas tiempo"
good,"Nice starting job if your straight out of High School and need to acquire some work experience. They offer a variety of skill sets from cashiers to sales and warehouse duties. You will also learn and gain experience in the culture of large, ""Coporate America"", where they love young, inexperienced but motivated people to munipulate and promote their business model and agenda. As for a working adult, they neither pay enough to support a family or give enough hours to take part in the great benefits that they offer. But, if your 18 and out of school, and can afford to invest in several years of doing the deeds that move you up the ladder, you can may be get to some type of management position, where you will then receive a decent wage."
good,Enjoy working with customers  Always eager to learn new products.  Multi tasked and provided the best plus 1 customer service.  Customers came back looking for my knowledge and for me.
good,"I have found Home Depot a decent place to work.  It is really flexible for scheduling around school etc. if you are part time.  There are decent benefits, such as holiday pay, success sharing, and some degree of health care.  Downsides include those to be expected in retail: monotony of work, limited career advancement.  There is the possibility of heavy lifting depending on your job.  There is the option for night shift.  Downsides might include malfunctioning equipment, lack of career advancement, and managerial styles.  Overall, it has been a decent work experience, and a source of stability, since I can schedule work around other schedules fairly easily.  I enjoy working with most of my coworkers and, given retail is retail, I have found it to be a decent job.  Even after many years of annual raises, it is still not a living wage on its own though, unless you are promoted to a more managerial level."
good,"Great company to work for but like most retail jobs, work life balance is tough! I liked the support as a team there. The homer funds help employees in time of need. It's really a great useful thing to have and at least know you can turn to. It's pretty hard to get the pay raise you want and at times that may lead you to feel over worked and under paid!"
good,"Listen, it's a great place to work but honestly you are nothing if you're hired as a part timer. You get an average of 24-28 hours during spring and summer but once you hit fall and winter, you average between 4 to 12 hours a week. That's how they get rid of people, especially for those who need a job to survive on and they realize that this place isn't helping them... so they end up quiting. You can obviously get a few more hours by cross training with other departments but that's never a guarantee in getting more than 20 hours... "
good,As a home depot lot associate you are the first and last team member customers see. It is your your duty to give customers a warm welcome as they enter the store. Other responsibilities include assisting customers with merchandise to their vehicles.
good,There was no sense of community or involvement. I was treated poorly constantly and was underpaid for my work. Not a friendly place to work or shop
good,I did enjoy my employment with Home Depot. The hours took some getting used to. Their inventory and restocking system was a nightmare. I had a lot of good co-workers and miss them all.
good,"The people I work with in my store are great and easy to get along with, in the 8 months I've been there I've had more power than I did at my last job (fast food). I can mark down items up to $50 without needing a manager approval. It's nice feeling like you have more power than just being a boring, powerless, cashier. I've learned where products are in the store by asking associates where they are, or using The Home Depot app and locating it on my phone to the exact location. I'd say there's a handful of people that don't like the ASM's/Department supervisors. I personally don't have anything against them. The hardest part of the job, being a cashier, is standing on the cement floor for what seems like hours. It's nice getting a short 15min break around every two hours."
good,I started at 6 AM and finished at 3 PM. It was a fast paced environment. Worked in the Lumber Department. Well organized and kept a clean work place. Most enjoyable part was being loved by the customers.
good,"I was an HR Manager in store.  We were required to perform as HR, Manager on Duty and Customer Support.  Walk, talk and train.  It was minimum 55 hours a week if you were salaried.  Great Co-workers. Stable Environment"
good,The job was easy and the company has many good aspects as well as great benefits. My only complaint in the unqualified management and lack of opportunity to move up in the company unless you are favored by a member of managment regardless of your work ethic
good,it was a good experience that afforded me the opportunity to learn a side of warehouse work that involved using computers.
good,"Overall The Home Depot is a great company, several opportunities were made available for company progression. Some department within the company were managed differently and less opportunities for advancement were available."
good,"i learned a lot at home depot."
good,"Fun place to work, I learned a lot about home improvements, dealing with customers, and customer service.  I didn't like the fact that I couldn't plan holidays, etc. until three weeks out unless I had clearned it months before."
good,A typical day at work would be clock in and get set for the day ahead of me. I learned a lot about electrical appliances and various do it yourself products. Best thing about the job is the relationships i was able to build with the customers.
good,"It was a nice place to work and meet people whom needed help in finding their items in the store.  It was important to be on time for"
good,Learning experience in respect to home improvement & ability to move up career-wise with limited experience; not suitable for those who cannot tolerate a high stress environment.
good,"Though the job can get boring at times, and the pay is lackluster at best, the job itself and benefits are good enough for an entry level job. The issue I have with the job is that I came to it with 5 years of experience in my field, and I was not given any form of pay raise for that experience, though I consistently outsell my quotas."
good,I feel like this company can offer a lot more then it does for associates. They cut hours and they treat part timers like nothing plus they over work us a lot!
good,"Working here was fun and definitely a go to teenage summer job."
good,"Excellent environment for college students and those wanting to venture into retail. However, the higher paying jobs are hard to come by and there are 100's of employees with decades of experience ahead of you. Typical day is directly dealing with all walks of life so be prepared to be very outgoing and focus on customer service."
good,I made Specialty orders/greet every customer that came in.also I did inventory management.audits/price changes and any ads that would drop down. Plus follow up with any late orders.I did this for 5 out of the 14yrs
good,"You can feel a sense of family while working. Management for the most part work together as a unit, they do however have a tendency  to neglect some of their important responsibilities and when it is addressed, the blame is usually passed on to another party."
good,"They give 1-2% raises normally, and it's difficult to move up.The culture is very lacking, and you basically work there to just be worked as much as they can get from you."
good,nice and helpful fellow workers. Management provided help when needed. Everyone made sure new employees felt welcome and not overwhelmed.
good,"Working in Home Depot is fun and sometimes friendly. The management at the store is very good, they are nice and understandable. I am a part time worker at home depot but I would like a better pay and a full time job. Home Depot is not enough for me financially."
good,Management. Also they do not show enough concern and drive for their employees. Team work lacks. Not enough recognition giving to all employees.
good,I took the Millwork Specialist position simply because the pay was much better. The job itself was alright for a paycheck.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers on daily basis .And I also learned a lot in putting customer first at all times.And as far my co workers it was always fun working together each and everyday and because of that the typical.day was busy but clam because of the chemistry amongst ourselves.
good,"Decent hours and pay. Only problem is if the managers don't like you, they do everything in their power to ruin your work shift!"
good,Company is great you can move up and become a store manager but just have to get to know the people. Company needs to improve not micro managing their workers and learn to trust them.
good,Fun workplace. Love helping out customers and learning. Managers all about numbers to me. Great relationhips with co workers. Everyday you learn something.
good,"I had managers doing schedule placing people in my department but not actually working the department. And they wondering why work is not getting done, managers expected me to do it all. I learned how to keep up with department numbers as well as how to merchandise the product for top sales. The hardest part was trying to do the job of four people."
good,"A typical day working at Home Depot would be Customer service all day. It's a great place to work at if you enjoy relating to the customer and sharing your experiences and knowledge of products to better help the customer. I've learned about so many products, what they do, how they work and different ways to fix things from on the job knowledge and with sharing opinions and asking questions with the customer. Although we have a new store manager and things are changing everyday, management is pretty good. The hardest part of the job is trying to get a full-time position or a more flexible schedule for parents. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet on a daily basis and the relationships you build with your customers."
good,"In my experience was good but people who had worked there for more then 5 years, had too much leeway such as leaving early or just taking random breaks. "
good,I liked working for The Home Depot because it was a fast pace work place to help customers find what they are looking for. It was also a good place to learn how to stock and pull orders for experience
good,Family like place to work if you get into a store with good management. Flexible work hours for students but only if you are part time. I've learned tons of home improvement techniques as well as tons of product knowledge. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management and their favoritism. Most enjoyable part of the job is the great customers.
good,"As a cahier I many rolls Customer service, returns desk, and Call center. I did the daily order management called on special orders nd helped out contract sales... etc"
good,The company overall is great it just depends on what store you are in and how the management is at that store. On a typical day you can expect to take lots of calls and be prepared to multitask like crazy however that makes the day go by quicker.
good,People were great and I loved interacting with all the people and dogs that came into the store. The diversity of hours in my schedule and the amount I was able to work were not great.  I would have stayed if I could have gotten full time work.
good,Its a fun place to work. Everyone is friendly. Willing to help out when needed. Meeting new people is nice also. My job is fun learning something new everyday.
good,"management does what they want with no repercussions from corporate. Fellow employees are great, and they provide meals sometimes, they do a great job trying to keep moral up."
good,it was fun place to work. they appreciated their employees. plenty of room to move up within the company. my favorite part of the job was being able ti fully assist the customers
good,"It was alright. I loved my boss, and the coworkers there. It was pretty fun at times. Lifted and moved some heavy things which was not too bad. Had to utilize a few power equipment at times. Then had to overlook some of the projects that were going on while the store was going through a major overnight renovation."
good,"Nice benefits, but hard  to have a family and be at work 14 plus hours. Hours for salaried are 9 to 14 hours more like 10 on average. "
good,The job was ok. The job was pretty simple and laid back. The compensation was not the best for the amount of work that needed to be  done on a daily basis. The company culture is wonderful.
good,"The management made it hard to enjoy a day at work. Negativity was always following him. He was not reasonable, or understanding."
good,"Not a bad job learned new things and met good people and learned a lot of new things."
good,"There is opportunity to move up for people who really understand customer service. Company does care about it's employees, decent health care plan coverage."
good,"The Home Depot has a very enthusiastic work environment. The management is very respectful and there is a lot of thought put into the basic clerk's contribution to the company. Success Sharing is an integral part of the income that each clerk receives, and part-time and full time employees both qualify for certain insurance coverage with Manulife."
good,"Positive and productive work place , a normal day of work goes by smooth it is easy to help costumers and get your job done because everyone is taking care of."
good,"Check and follow up on the previous days work list as well as check on low/out of stock products.  Making sure to match the number of items on shelves to the system to prevent shrink during inventory days.  Learned how to manage a team and hold accountable to their work.  Management was overall great, excluding some how abuse their power.  Co-workers were very friendly and became a second family to me.  Hardest part of the job was to get all the days task done in a timely manner.  Not only did we have to help customers there was plenty general tasking to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was very fast paced and meeting the most interesting customers."
good,"Crazy some days and good people that work there. Fast pace work environment, needs more staff in the evening work schedule."
good,"In store management need to be trained in people skills. Things have changed from 13 years ago, when raises made a difference and employees weren't treated as second class citizens."
good,I enjoyed the experience. My co-workers were from all walks of life. I had a great time learning and bonding. The benefits are great.
good,"A typical day would be stocking the shelves, helping plenty of customers, and daily inventory checks during the morning. I learned how to manage my time effectively and efficiently, as I literally didn't have much time to complete my many tasks. I was in the electrical department, and the HR manager would give us 1 person per shift. During peak hours, it was nearly impossible to help 100% of the customers in the department, while at the same time, trying to keep the shelves filled with product. The peak hours are from 10AM-2PM, and that's when the store will get swamped with all types of customers."
good,Sales cabinet refacing and counter tops to potential customers of Home Depot. I traveled the triad and triangle visiting with the customers helping them with their selections in remodeling their kitchen. One call close
good,"Over all good experience and a good place to get educated on the retail environment. "
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for if you start out in high school with them and plan to work all your life. If not, it's almost impossible for advancement."
good,Home Depot could save money if they had Lp at each store. the sale of items returned install of rtv. home depot has a big turnaround in the store I work for I have requested full time never heard from HR
good,Customers welcome your help management could be a little more open with employees. Working with the customers was the best part of this job because they new what they wanted and they welcomed the help they would receive
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. The worst part of the job was not being able to use the bathroom if there was no one there to take your place. I had good coworkers.
good,"Fast paced, great team work, drove machinery, noncompetitive  pay, bad hours, all in all great experience and built great relationships. Typically I had a list of items threw out the store that needed to be brought down from the over head and stocked, my job was to find them and put them in there place. After that was done I would drive an Order Picker putting up doors and bring down doors organizing it all, take down pallets then working them, putting the product on the shelves. I then needed to combine pallets wrapping or banding the product then putting it back up. I would work freight also putting up whatever didn't fit on the shelf back up in the over head. After that everyone would help clean up, sweeping breaking down boxes bringing back empty pallets. This job needed great time management, lunches were short and breaks were rare. During the day shifts I had a job of power packing down, taking everything out of the over head, putting all I can on the shelves then organizing the top stock. The people were great, the only thing is the low pay for working days and nights."
good,Overall pretty decent place to work. Only long term management minded folks will find a career here. Well diversified though. Does contribute to quite a few veterans projects.
good,home depot is a fast moving job and you have to keep up there are a lot of things to do and work that always need to be done to make the store look great and to help reach the day sell goal.
good,They should impove there hours for part time workers from 20 or 29 hours to 32 hours again and also give the part time worker back benefits again.
good,"Worked as a Cashier and basically greeted customers, totaled their purchases and took payments from them in various forms. I learned to Listen to others when dealing with difficult people, and that has helped me tremendously. I have learned to see things from others point of view. The most enjoyable part of my day was when customers would smile after checking out from my register. I know that when people feel good they will probably come back."
good,"Typical day at work is I clock in and work then clock out when finished. I learned that I shouldn't work at a place I wasn't happy working at. Management needs help. My co workers are so awesome but some of them, everyone hates. The hardest part of the job is clocking in. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i get to work with people i actually like."
good,"its a pretty good place to work at as a student but you will be ask to always work and close on weekends, on top of that you will always be ask to be packing down products and dealing with angry customers"
good,I enjoyed working here over the years. The ability to learn anything about the different departments and the encouragement to strive for advancement was refreshing.
good,fun place to work everyone works as a team to get the job done.nobody power trips.always have food or others things to enjoy by management..management is very cool
good,"All in all, it pays the bills. Store employees is paid below average for all that they must know.  Upper management makes the big bucks."
good,"Great place for young people who are in school..they will work around your schedule as much as possible, however advancement and opportunity are poor...it doesn't matter how hard you work they will only give you full-time or advance you if they like you or if you ""know"" someone."
good,I have so much going on in my life and although I give 100% of my time when i'm there to The Home Depot. It expects you to give 1000% even if it means disregarding your family
good,"I LOVED this job with all my heart.  It was very hard to leave.  Management was no longer keeping company promises though to me or customers on a regular basis.  It broke my heart to leave my customers and my coworkers, but I couldn't stay there any longer.  Communication breakdowns between installers the store and the customers led to money lost for all parties involved and no one happy on several occasions."
good,A very high paced environment with high demands to staff the store with over 150+ associates and train accordingly.  Scheduling associates as well as scheduling talent review sessions
good,I made sure the parking lot and garden center was in order and neat.  I was involved with the propane cylinder exchanging.
good,The home depot was a great learning experience as my second job. I learned how to interact with customers one on one and freshened up on my sales experience. The home depot was a great stepping stone along the way for me.
good,"Home Depot is not somewhere I would work to support my family. I don't think the pay is good enough for the work done. I feel like everyone is out to get each other and that's not how it should be. Home Depot's goal is to be the number one retail store in the world, but I don't think that can happen if the employees are always having internal conflicts with one another. No company can be as successful as Home Depot wants to be if the employees do not work together to make this happen."
good,"- meeting with customers "
good,"A typical day would start by unload trucks and pulling freight onto the sales floor using lift equipment.  Once all the freight was on the sales floor I would break down the pallets and distribute the freight to the assigned aisle using dollies and carts.  The next step in the process would be to stock the merchandise to the shelves.  In addition to my responsibilities as a freight team member I was the safety coordinator, who was responsible for going through the business and looking for possible safety violations.  I also coordinated departmental meetings to discuss the weekly safety topic coming from OSHA and the head quarters for Home Depot.  I was also responsible for turning in my walk through inspections and meeting notes to OSHA for review."
good,"The people at Home Depot are great. Due to me being a college student, I sometimes have issues with my scheduling. Due to recent events, I assume, the management system is slightly disorganized, which has an effect on the employees. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the heat, as well as other employees who are slacking with their duties. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a enjoyable atmosphere. The garden center is probably the best job to have, if you enjoy being outside and staying busy."
good,"There wasn't much learned other than getting forklift certified. Management had favorites, and didn't give others opportunities to grow. The most enjoyable part of the job with the community within my co-workers."
good,"nula oportunidad de crecimiento laboral, todo bajo condición y por por méritos laborales"
good,work hours vary dramatically from day to day 5 am to 11 pm on a daily basis which makes it difficult to do much else.  Great product knowledge program.
good,"I would start the night with stretches, then get work. You learn different things about the department you work in like what drill bits are best what drills are good and why there so many different sand papers."
good,"While on the work floor the customer is always the main focus, as it should be. Company also provides various perks and rewards for employees behind the scenes."
good,"This is a great large corporation to work for."
good,I learned a lot about the culture of the company which is yet amazing. The hours were difficult but the company is great. I wish the position was not temporary and it would have lasted longer.
good,"I would arrive at 10:00 PM and down stock soil, block ...etc in the outside garden area.  Clean the entire outside garden.  Do anything that was assigned by the Night Shift Supervisor.  "
good,Extensive cash handling and extensive customer service. I enjoyed learning new things about construction which is most of Home Depot's clientele. The most enjoyable and difficult part of the job is learning about all the products and how they are to be used.
good,"I would say the company, when I first started to work there, was a very good company to work for.  They really cared for the employees and the compensation was very good.  12 years into my employment with Home Depot, all upper management changed and things were no longer as smooth as in the beginning."
good,Fun place to work with many different cultures to interact with. A typical day at work would include dealing with different materials coming off the trucks and working in different areas of the warehouse. Enjoyed the weekends off to spend with family.
good,"The one I worked at was a good place for insurance, either full time or part time. I usually only worked night. The management team was ok, depending on who you are"
good,Not a lot of room for advancement and lots of head hunting from Lowe's Home Improvement.  This made things kind of hectic as people were always coming and going with little stability.
good,"The management at Home depot couldn't tell you the first thing about home improvement, nor do they care to learn. They don't value their hard working employees at all.  When i was working at this store, we were in the finals of all home depot stores for having the best shipping/receiving team, a part of the freight team that works overnight and during the day.  However when management decided to thank the staff for doing great work and giving the extra effort, the one team that was neglected was the one that actually did all the work."
good,"The community of worker are very friend, but the work load can sometime be very tiring. The time manage is very planned, and everyone have to relied on their other co- worker to show up and cover the floor."
good,"Everyday is different, that's what makes it fun.  You deal with different customer with different needs, therefor you have to be flexible when dealing with each customer. "
good,"typical low-wage, high-responsibility job.  Pay is minimum wage and they expect you to bust all night.  Its an overnight position.  I usually end up doing tasks for other associates who never seem to accomplish what they were supposed to at work.  Management holds nobody accountable for anything and the store is usually filthy, nobody id ever required to clean, nor have I ever seen anyone use a broom once, unless they worked on nights.  But supervisors typically do not micromanage you too much so cant complain about that."
good,I have learned much about merchandising from general service to full resets. I am now an expert at price changes and bay validations. A typical day as a merchandiser is full from start to finish. There is always something that needs to be done.
good,Spent most days doing things for customers outside of my department that I had no idea how to help because I was uneducated  in those departments.
good,"Unloading trucks , packing down , providing great customer relations with contractors . All about the do it yourself work shops , how to drive a forklift and Safety move merch . Great co workers along with management a chance to move up in the company or stay in your same postion for more pay."
good,"Great job if you like to travel. They pay a lot but I don't think it is worth it because of the traveling you do. You are under paid and the work is rigorous. I had to set the aisles to planograms given out but my supervisor. The job had its good and bad days but it paid the bills.I had to lift up to 200 pounds i had to drive an order picker, I also had o get extremely filthy."
good,as a cashier you mostly spend the day checking out and helping costumers with what ever they need.
good,"A typical day would be to meet new people everyday, I learn something new everyday, there is not a day that goes by that I haven't learned something new. My co~workers are the best, somebody is always there for you when you need that extra little push or help."
good,"A great place to work , offers some medical and financial benefits."
good,I love the fact that i got on with such a great company but to me they need to work on more team work skills.
good,This company is driven by core values that stress team and customer satisfaction. It can be challenging and fun. There is a sense of team striving for the growth of the company at the store level through goals geared to customer retention and satisfaction.
good,"Good work/home life balance"
good,"I review hundreds of resumes looking for candidates to meet the job criteria. I make and take both outbound and inbound calls. I prescreen both over the phone and in person to see if a person is the right candidate the company is looking for.  I then schedule them for a future face to face interview with a hiring manager.  "
good,My days were always crazy. I had a great supervisor. Management could have been better. At times I did not feel appreciated as I went above and beyond in my job. But I did learn a lot from my immediate supervisor.
good,Assist customers with plumbing & electrical issues/needs
good,You get to work out side and learn  about different flowers and be out side when it was nice
good,"Met Great co-workers now friends"
good,Nice place to work for but had to walk to 2nd floor to puch in and out for all breaks and was never told when you missed a puch until you looked at your pay stub online. never able to find H.R. person when needed.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and my fellow employees.
good,Meet alot of new people. Build relationships. Costumer care. Learn about people daily lives and what they was trying to do so they can get the best product for the job they was doing.
good,Typical day would involved me greeting all my customers and team members and see how they were doing and if they needed any help from me. I learned how to manage a multi-million dollar business. My co-workers were fun to work with and had great knowledge. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of my management team and how they ran the store. The most enjoyable part was working with my team helping customers and driving sales.
good,It was a hard working environment you had to do a lot of moving around and lifting which i have zero problems with that because i am a hands on guy.
good,"We rely on set appointments for individuals who interested a free quote from The Home Depot- at home services.  We presented very careful all needed information expecting to close right in the spot including contract fulfillment, applicable insurance information and materials to be used for the project in question."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work part-time while attending college. They wage is low, but the interactions with the customers as well as other employees is wonderful. Job security does not exist."
good,when i first started i finished my computer classes then they didnt explain the process afterwards so i was kinda lost at the beggining supervisor was not present s
good,I have learned many economical abilities working at the Home Depot under different managers and department heads.
good,"Most of the people I worked with were great. The change in assistant managers was often, but most of them were good. I started working at Home Depot while I was attending classes at Mesa College. In the beginning I was told I could have a schedule that would accommodate my class schedule. With a of change of store manager and he decided I could not have the schedule I needed. There was always work while I was there."
good,it was great but the pay and hours weren't as great. Other then it being privately owned there weren't too many perks about this job.
good,"great place to start and room for advancement, co-workers were cool and it was an enjoyable job"
good,"I learned about the many different grades of lumber, and how much is involved in home made products. One of the most difficult parts of my job was learning how to find products on the cash register so that I was able to ring them up. But after awhile it all began to come more easily. Management was always very helpful and understanding. I enjoyed working wit everyone there."
good,working at home depot was fun. the people were easy to get along with. If i had not of found a full time job i would still be there.
good,Although I love doing my job and giving customers the best service possible I am not pleased with the lack of workers and instability at this job. Having a family it is much easier to work a steady job with steady hours and pay. At this job the schedule is different everyday and the hours weekly are not steady so you cant budget on your income.
good,"Responsible for stocking merchandise onto shelves to achieve 100% in stock, organizing the sales floor to create a pleasant and safe shopping environment, and providing customer service as required by customer demand."
good,"A typical day at work for me is constant face to face and over the phone interaction with customers. During downtime periods, I try to keep the department clean, and organized. I am a people's person, so I have a good working and personal relationship with my coworkers. My managers and I have a mutual level of respect for one another, which enables me to have more free range to perform tasks assigned to me in creative ways than more typical traditional methods. The hardest part of the job for me is when customers leave before we can fully assist them. I've learned alot over the years from Home Depot such as people and communication skills, home improvement and maintenance knowledge, and became more business minded. –"
good,"Great relationships with coworkers, very hard work. Difficult to get ahead in company. Very political. Promotion based on personal relationship with management not on job performance."
good,"A typical day at work is okay, time goes by fast since I always try being pro-active to stay busy."
good,Managing the front end included assisting cashiers in any issues they may encounter. It also involved keeping a clean and safe work area for employees and customers. As a head cashier I was responsible for auditing the registers as well.
good,We had a great relationship with co-workers as well as customers.
good,Most of the associates are very knowledgeable and helpful.
good,I set up new accounts for direct tv customers over the phone solve customer issues
good,I started in October 2013 as a part time associate and in February I became a full time associate
good,"I've worked at two Home Depot different stores and despite being the same company, the stores had two very different environments. One store seemed more concerned with having happy customers, despite the fact that it has few customers. The other store seemed more concerned with having happy employees and customers. At one store, it's easy to find a head cashier or a MOD. The other one it's hard to find anyone to help a customer. "
good,interesting..meet a lot of customer that are satisfied with their kitchen /bath design and remolded projects...management is ok..learn to be a good kitchen designer
good,"Typical day at work is morning price changes and checking product to make sure it is in stock and pack down to shelf to sell. general service to product which is wiping down product, facing product, making sure product is in right position on shelf per vendor contract. "
good,"I Enjoy working at THD"
good,"The typical work day in the Home Depot is a busy one. After clocking in, it is right to the safety checklist to ensure that the department is in order and ready to shop. Customers are frequent and fun to deal with. From mixing paint to loading cars with reach trucks, my day is virtually nonstop and I usually have a half hour break in an 8 hour shift; it gets intense and I love dealing with customers and solving their issues. Management at the store seems misguided in a sense that they are putting people in power that shouldn't be and do not provide great service or help. The hardest part of my job is learning to delegate tasks because I love working and getting things done myself. But with a select few coworkers, it makes the trust and tasks get done. My favorite part about the job is working with a few certain associates but mainly interacting with customers."
good,Many good people to work with. Enjoyed helping customers with their individual projects.
good,It was a good place to work I learned all know about retail with them. I was able to advance from hourly associate to management over my time there.
good,"My day at work consists of creating special orders upon customer request, responsible for all B.O.P.I. S orders (buy online pick up in store), schedule deliveries, customer service at special service desk, heavy call volume, deal with many customers on a day to day basis satisfying all their needs. I have learned how to manage time more effectively and learned how to process managerial paperwork. I have a very good relationship with all Department Heads from every store especially my division. I have a good relationship with all my co-workers as well, I am an excellent team player and help everyone who is not as knowledgeable as me. The hardest part of my job is not being able to have a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have met all of the customers needs and that I did everything to be sure that they were happy and satisfied with their  shopping experience."
good,overall a good company to work for. a typical good would be doing customer service and shelf maintenance. management was good and fair. hardest part of my job was dealing with the customer when they were angry. most enjoyable part of my job was when the customer were friendly .
good,"Cashing out customers , doing refunds/exchanges , answering phone calls and answering customer questions was a typical day working at The Home Depot. I learned a lot about tools and construction materials, how to deal with upset customers and how to change a bad shopping experience into a pleasant one. It was great working with my co-workers always teaching each other new things and working together as a team. Hardest part of my job was telling a customer no or that we did not carry a specific product they were looking for. Most enjoyable part of my job was giving away free gifts and seeing customers leave the store happy and satisfied with the service I provided them with."
good,"Excellent opportunity to utilize knowledge of not only products, but also how to deal with an extremely diverse group of associates and customers.  This position allows me to utilize my many talents with problem resolution and customer satisfaction while maintaining company policy parameters. I enjoy working with peers and direct reports in order to complete daily tasks as well as planning for upcoming seasonal events.  The most difficult part of my job is the varying work schedule that has no consistency."
good,A typical day I would be a cashier or just walk the sales floor and assist customers with their needs. I learned how to talk to customers in a friendly respectful way. Management was great good people that want to teach. My co-workers were fun always energetic and eager to work. Hardest part of my job was preparing for inventory and most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,While working at Home Depot a typical day is being on register or at the phone lines and online orders.
good,"After signing in and greeting everyone, I proceed to checking emails for any updates or request and reply on such emails promptly. Then began by checking loads left by previous shift for 'Hot Rushes' (loads prioritized) to be processed first. Through out the day I liaise on with other team members, supervisors/ Managers and customer service with issues regarding loads."
good,Would recommend The Home Depot to those that have interest and knowledge in the home improvement field
good,I worked for home depot more then one time. I only had problems with one store . I got hurt on the job and they did not want to go by what the work Dr set for me.
good,"Home Depot is a demanding environment, but is well run and managed from an execution standpoint.  Expectations are always high and results are the word of the day both merchandising and financially."
good,a typical day was just helping customers and making sure there was always carts for the customers
good,"clock in talk to the fellow workers grab a walkie talkie make my way to the lot assigned. load carts, clean lot .when work got slow help inside in the diffrent departments were they needed help and make my way back to lot and helped out with customer service."
good,Helping people to find the right appliances for their home was a really fun task.
good,"Top management at the store level, do not care for the associates as they use to. Profit is all they care about. The Company level management cares and is making changes at the district and store levels to improve moral and customer service."
good,"being able to help the customers out with their projects. and on others explain to others a better way to do some of the projects, and other times on how to save them money on their projects."
good,It a high space working place and i deal with customers everyday
good,great place to work to start as an college student. Good staff to work around. Nice environment of customer satisfaction. Hardest thing about the job was the hours and work schedule. The most enjoyment part of the job were the workshops.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, physical, and hot because it was summer time. I spent a few shifts watering the greenhouses in the mornings, it took around four hours to fully water the lot. The majority of my shifts were spent loading timber, cement, and other heavy merchandise. I kept the lot clean of trash and free of loose carts. Management was fair, but I never could tell if I was in good standing."
good,"Home Depot is a great company that offers benefits and bonuses. Flexible work schedules are provided as well for those that work other jobs, are parents, or looking to bring in extra income. A typical day would be coming to work and looking at schedule to see where I might be for my shift. I was trained in different departments. One day I might be in Flooring/Decor, where I would be cutting carpet, setting up carpet measures, creating customer contracts, helping customers on the sales floor, packing out merchandise on the shelves, cutting blinds, or helping associates in other departments. I could also be scheduled at the customer service desk, where I would be calling customers about their online, special, or in-stock orders, answering phones, filing, creating customer contracts, opening credit applications, assisting with paperwork, processing sales and returns, training new employees, handling large amounts of money, working with other departments to provide excellent customer service. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. Especially the ones that I have been working with for years. The hardest part about the job was being short staffed and having to take on so much with very little resources. The most enjoyable part was meeting and interacting with the customers. I loved that."
good,This place is a good environment to work in and very nice and helpful co-workers.
good,home depot is not a bad place to work i work in the let department and i work with some very good guys
good,Home Depot had a good work environment and the associates had a good attitude and well to work with. The benefits plans are great. Management could work on giving out more positive work acknowledgement to employes and have a better plans to grow with the company.
good,"The management"
good,"Inicias siempre con la revisión de seguridad, mercaderías, cambios del día, proyección de la semana, revisión de plan de ventas, montajes, pendientes de embarques, surtido y revisión de personal."
good,"Alot to learn, but exciting."
good,"We would come in and have a meeting, then stretch, and cheer shortly after. I learned how to operate heavy equipment such as: Reach truck, electric pallet jack, and fork lift, cycle count, and also load a truck. I have trained a few people. The hardest part of my job is order picking. Must be in shape, that is truly why we stretched each morning. Home Depot had some incentives, we would get half body massages, we had a ping pong and fuse ball table. We had great Christmas parties."
good,"The company as a whole is fantastic, and most employees are great people, the problem comes to the management who care nothing about their underlings and only want to advance themselves in the company."
good,"Sold Flooring, Helped customers based on needs for flooring, Made recommendations and helped with estimating and custom ordering floor. would sign up for install. Try to sell Benefits and features rather than Cost."
good,Meeting new people and giving advice on beauty products to help enhance your hair care...
good,"Very customer oreintated."
good,Fast paced environment during season peeks. Great oppurtunity to meet lots of diferent people
good,The Home Depot  is able to set my work schedule around my school schedule.
good,Wish they would help you grow more with the company and help take care of their employees
good,"A typical day at work would just be to punch in and stand at your till until someone comes to your till. Then you would give your best customer service. You would ask questions such as;"
good,"My typical day at work starts out at midnight, i head to receiving separate freight and head to the floor. I place myself in the department that has the most freight and least amount of workers, my priority is to get all freight worked,overstock up and floor cleared before doors open at 6 am. After store looks grand opening ready i start walking aisles to check for ruined unreadable price tags, i change them to new ones using our first phones and start decontamination of bays. Placing product in its correct homes so customers wont get confused. This job taught me to prioritize and stay organized, working as a team and alone. My co workers and managers are great, there is equal communication amongst each other. The hardest part of the job is having to clock out when there is much more to do. I enjoy knowing that home depot supports veterens and the military, coming from a military family its great having a huge company cater and help means a lot to me."
good,"Meet and great customers help with any questions or concerns a customer has, with the best of customer service garden department keep up."
good,Great Place to work.  Schedules change constantly due to retail needs.
good,Worked at a fast pace constantly on my feet for many hours at a time. I learned new things everyday from new people everyday. The management was pretty ok. Most of my co-workers was nice and friendly and willing to answer any questions and help me with anything in need. The hardest part of my job was working at my everyday fast pace when summertime came and the warehouse is about 100 degrees.but the most enjoyable part of the job was that the people was very friendly and for the most paert it was always work to do.
good,"Holding the position of Regional Delivery Manager I was able to travel to all stores within NJ, NY and CT. I was abel to help train and develop associates."
good,"Being with a company 10 years gives you a security that is hard to obtain.  I worked inside and did schedules/minor HR duties and a year and a half ago I moved.  I have been in customer facing departments, first Paint and then Garden.  Daily you have to ensure it is a safe place for customers and associates to be.  You must make time to care for and feed the plants everyday.  Helping customers locate what they are looking for and assisting them to their car with said merchandise.  Part of the experience, want cusstomers to leave on a good note.  The hardest part of the job is getting everything done everyday.  There is freight, mark downs, downstocking, pack downs, loading, cleaning, pulling product in and out of the building at opening and closing.  Taking care of the live goods side of the business could be a full-time job alone."
good,Home Depot in 10 years as been a decent company to work for.  Pay scale is horrendous an if you get a bad mgmt team youre not in a good spot but ok nonetheless
good,Home Depot has Good Benefits for their employees but depending on the store management can be difficult to deal with because some stores won't allow you to get advancement like Sebastian but if you go to another store like Vero Beach its differen't story
good,"steady pace"
good,"-Work schedule is at random, you're not given a set schedule."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. They're all about customer service and putting customers first. They have a fund that helps employees in need. Tuition reimbursement for those who want to go back to school. "
good,"I work with a great group of people.  Everyone there is honest, and helpful. We strive for the betterment and well being of the company as well as each other,  I am seeking permanent full time.  I have had to supplement my lack of steady hours with other construction work, and I think it would be easier to get ahead and function better with one job, more hours, and less travel time per day."
good,Most the people are awesome.  Especially in my department.  We do try and make work fun.  It's pretty physical work.  Some days more than others.
good,"Enjoy Project Management, Sales, working with others. Community involvement. "
good,"Load lumber, hay, pinestraw and assist customers. Management couldn't keep a full staff."
good,"It was a nice place to work, good people, I could not deal with the swing shifts and working holidays"
good,I was a fun place to work liked to work with customers and help them with the projects they were working on..
good,Between running your register and making your customers happy. It was a fun yet unforgettable experience everyday. I learned that every customer and every situation was different. Not everyone was friendly so I had to learn how to accommodate to each customer to make them happy. The management team were usually always there for you. And very understanding. My fellow co-workers were all different. Everyone had their own way of getting things done. The hardest part of this Job was trying to make the most unsatisfied customer satisfied. The best part of the Job was meeting new people everyday and leaning new things.
good,"see Resume for typical day at work. Learned many computer programs related for specialty sales. Poor management, great co-workers, sometimes hard physical work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my Customer leaves happy with my service provided."
good,load and unload delivery and customer vehicles using hand methods and machinery . Stock shelves according to vendor plan. Solve Customer problems and encourage them to seek out professional services offered by the company.
good,I believe the company is very organized and helpful.
good,ok just to much politics management has no care for their employees they will not fight or try to help you
good,"Productive work place, goals were always clear. Unfortunatley not very much room for advancement."
good,"Greeting, and helping customers with anything and everything they needs. Cashier."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for but the scheduling is very difficult to balance your family life.
good,Limited time to clear stock off foor to shelves! worked hard but pulled together to get job done!
good,"I was a milwork specialist. My primary job was to sell customers all items they needed to do their projects. As Home Depot employees we also had to help customers in other departments when help there was needed. The store managers and assistant managers were good. I really enjoyed working with other employees, and established a friendship with many of them. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the correct item for the customer, and knowing they were going to do it right the first time!"
good,I've learned a lot about interacting with people as well as being part of a team. The hardest part about my job is the fact that I do have to go outside so it's rough when it is super hot or very cold out.
good,"I really enjoyed my job, I just didn't like how the company treated its employees. I had the best co-workers you could ask for. I ran the kids workshop once a month and I really enjoyed that, that was my favorite part of my job. Plus I loved my customers, they were the ones that kept me going back daily."
good,show up go to work
good,"Environment is overall good, it can be stressful under some management. Co-workers are friendly and helpful and are always willing to lend a hand."
good,I learned things about appliances that I had never known before. A very informative job and I had a lot of interaction with the public.
good,"The Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the industry. The corporate offices have done a wonderful job of ensuring their success. If you want a company that is essentially run from it's head-quarters, then Home Depot is good for you. Great benefits, and good people to work with. The downside is they do not hire outside the company often for managerial positions. This leads to a lot of incompetent floor managers."
good,it was a learning experience i gained alot of knowledge and customer service
good,customer service was first and foremost. I closed Garden for the busy season.
good,"Great job for students, learn a lot of real world applicable skills while you gain your degree working towards your career."
good,* shifts varied help customers with purchases
good,"Everyday was a different thing to do . I learned how to stock, how to be in receiving department, to even working in mainly all the departments."
good,Everyone seems pretty friendly there. They tend to be over the top when they have meetings and employee events as far as having food and games for employees. But it is very difficult to get a full-time position and there is no set scheduling. So your hours and shifts worked vary from week to week.
good,"Daily dealing with customers' needs and resolutions for their projects or complaints. I learned more about other departments and their products to explain their functions to the customers in the registers or in the floor. The management needed improvements for integration and communication to make better the workflow preventing work injuries to employees or customers. Also, the management needed to develop better compensation and benefits for 40 hours/part-time positions. The co-workers in my department were very helpful and with positive attitude to dealing with ""rush hour"" of customers under pressure. The hardest part of the job was when some employees called in sick or missed their shift and the company had a short number of employees overwhelmed to assist a large number of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was to develop know other departments and their associates. Also, it was to pass the goal of sales of the month or quarter in the district."
good,I would recomment Home Depot for someone looking for a part time job but not for a career choice. It is very hard to move up into management and the pay is low compared to similar stores.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. Retail can be stressful but because of training, and good management you can adapt."
good,My typical day at work is pushing merchandise.
good,"As soon as you come in to work you get all of your paperwork for the day. Then proceed with making sure your in stock,everything is on order and the sales associates have job tasks to do.Home Depot has taught me how to run a multi- million dollar business.Management showed me how to handle any job situation that occurs and becoming a good leader.I enjoyed working and learning from all my co-workers.The hardest part of my job was trying to balance paperwork and doing work on the sales floor.The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of the customer and them telling me how they appreciated my business."
good,"I worked as a pluming sales associate, selling and promoting the sales of the items sold in my department as well as other departments. My supervisor was training me to to be a assistant supervisor so I took on some of those responsibilities as well. While working for the Home Depot I was in charge of our moral committee and I had recieved several awards for excellent customer service."
good,I enjoyed working with co-workers and customers. I learned a lot about home improvements. The salary was adequate.
good,The pay is competitive but the way they are structured with 3 assistant managers that all have different objective tend to combat operational goals on a daily basis.
good,"My typical day of work was not difficult and I enjoyed it for the most part with the constant activity along with the customers but the management was far from business-like. There was a lot of threats of firing towards myself even when I had done the work, but never was brought to the side and told what I was doing wrong. My co-workers were great but some had been working there for a long time so they had no need to deal with a new person. The hardest part was power-washing for 7 hours straight a long with all the other things that needed to be done. I, however, did enjoy the job when it came to the people that I helped with unloading or asking questions about certain things in the garden."
good,Did part-time marketing for third party companies. Also worked as secret shopper to review customer interaction at store
good,Most days are very enjoyable. we start every meeting of gathering with a home depot cheer. I'v learned all of my warehouse experience from the home depot. I have also made many friends while working. They were almost like family to me. The hardest part of my job was trying to exceed the standard goals but in most cases I did. The most enjoyable part of my job was working everyday with my teamates to get the job done no matter how hard it was. We were always there for each other.
good,I like to make the work place as enjoyable as I can. As a manager i have learn the skill set to set the mood for the work palce for my associates as well as my peers.
good,"The Home Depots program are geared towards improvement of its employee retention and creating a favorable impression with customers, but the inconsistency of scheduled hours are a negative for single parents"
good,"I miss most of the people. Do not miss the corporate culture. Raises were annual but minimal. Home office taking more and more control away from individual stores, so losing the personal touch. Even as big as Home Depot is, there used to be a small business feel to working there. Not anymore. Just another big corporation that's losing touch with the world its employees have to live in."
good,-help customers
good,every day i helped customers and made shure all the shelves were stocked with the right items and never failed to do so.
good,customers and co workers are fabulous. Management can be trying.
good,"Poor management, great co-workers, learned about the amount of little things involved in working on your home. Enjoyed the work. Did not enjoy the poor management."
good,i enjoyed the one on one with customer and doing the inspections on the work being done.
good,I enjoyed interacting with Home Depot Employees/Management as I carried out my daily duties. I was given the freedom to be creative and place plants in many types of displays. I felt trusted and needed and very much appreciated.
good,Enjoyed the knowledge i gained and work experience. Was a great job during and right out of high school.
good,I loved helping people purchase the appliances my customers needed/wanted for their homes and rental properties. Hardest part of the job was working with a limited number of brands Home Depot carried.
good,A typical day at work for me at Home Depot would start at 6am with daily paperwork. While doing the paper work I would multitask and help customers over the phone or in person. I would direct them to the correct department or employee for their need. As well as be a cashier and also do returns when needed. I worked closely with customers all day setting up will calls and deliveries. Besides answering the main phone line I had to make outbound calls to customers and remind them that they had merchandise that was ready for pick up or that their special orders were ready for pick up. The special service desk also handled complaints and tried to resolve them as best to the customers need. I would also send out broken tools customers would bring in for repair. Also filing paperwork and maintain a clean safe working environment.
good,Overall a good company very good benefits. Too much favorttism by management
good,": I expedited the freight to the Sales floor in various departments. I operated the electric pallet jack, and the electric ladder. I also patrolled the safety zones for all material handling equipment during store hours. I learned that making sure an are is stocked ensures sales will be up next day. Management overlooks your supervisor when critiquing your work. Your team can make your day easy or hard when their work affects how much work you have for the shift. the hardest part was adjusting to overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part was teamwork."
good,"the job itself was great, workdays were fun and fast paced but the hr department was very inconsiderate."
good,"Had a great time working with everyone in Garden. They helped me to understand about plants all year round. However, anyone from dept supervisors and up are terrible. They never answer your calls, wouldn't come to the register if a customer asked for them, management treated cashiers like the dirt they walk on."
good,Always been able to find what I need there. Need to do a better job at and with their suppliers as to how the product is shipped to the warehouse. Lot of mechandise was broken or destoyed before we recieived it.
good,I loved my front end staff and they were commited to helping us out
good,I enjoy working there but dislike my schedule. You must be avaliable to work any shift any day of the week and sometimes you just might do that within the same week. The benefits are good and your only there 40 hours per week.
good,"nice place to work, the training was good and the management seemed to care about there workers."
good,Management staff varies from store to store. But overall this is a good company to work for
good,As a company THD is a pretty secure employer. Pretty hard to be terminated and great benefits. I worked there four years and enjoyed the first three. The store management wasn't the best and people really are stuck in the position you're in unless you change work locations which is hard if you don't own a car.
good,I was offered a very high profile position. I buit trust within the customer and vendor base and created repeat buisssness
good,Nothing of extreme importance to say. Each job is different for several reasons. Definitely a learning experience and a new level of respect for all employers.
good,"It was outside commission based sales in the Baltimore Branch. They decreased the program opportunity, lowered the ceiling on potential earnings, and increased the number of long distance day trips required for relatively meaningless training sessions. It started off well, but the opportunity to make money and perform well was constantly being hindered by the reduction in product offering and the lack of clear communication about our programs from higher ups. The company seems solid but the HDE/HDI side seems to be in a nose dive."
good,Good flexibility of schedule a good pay for a part time job. It is possible to advance in the company in my experience only after six or seven years though.
good,"I was a janitor, sweep floors and cleaned bathrooms. assisted co workers, Followed  a daily schedule.Enjoyed working at a fast pace . Also enjoyed respectful coworkers"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company until recently. They won’t allow me to advance and I want to move up. The coworkers are amazing to be around, management could definitely use some work"
good,this job was a challenge for me but I kept on pushing and learning cause this job all job is about is the management and that's something that changed my point of view to business
good,I worked at The Home Depot for less than a year. Management needs improvement in communication. Poor pay but great training. Their app on your phone is very helpful.
good,"There is a lot of room and ability to learn and gain a variety of work experience skills. It is a very work-family oriented environment that often hosts events, as well as, internal and external benefits."
good,"Good work environment  "
good,"The overall story at the Home Depot is higher level management is usually not great. There are certainly exceptions and you will come across very good managers, especially at the store level. The employees you will work with are for the most part hard working, and good people to make friends."
good,"Management can't be perfect, but there are many things that can easily be done to make the associate's lives easier. They have very poor scheduling. Sometimes there's an abundance of associates, most days there's a lack of them. During the end of the year they heavily cut down on part-timer's hours, so if you want a reliable and steady source of income you would need to be a full-time employee."
good,Long hours on a concrete floor is very had on the body. When busy helping customers is enjoyable and can get management support. Maintenance of product can be difficult.
good,"Management isn't very fair constantly find yourself calling human resources to resolve issues. No flexibility in schedule policy, rules not followed by mgmt"
good,Decent place to work. The people that work are good but you have a lot of problems with the management of the store. None of the managers are on the same page.
good,Honestly it is a great job too work at everyone there is nice I’m just looking for a full time job and we do not have any openings in the department I work in
good,"With an average of three Assistant store managers below one head store manager all wanting different things from associates, things can get very unorganized very fast."
good,"While working at the home depot I was placed in the paint department, while knowing nothing about paint. I was quickly taught the basics and encouraged to ask questions as needed."
good,Really Great place to work for. Awesome coworkers. Makes you feel good about yourself. You can really have a future at The Home Depot. Really great place to work for.
good,i loved working there. I worked the kids work shop on saturdays and it was the most rewarding part of my job. I enjoyed seeing the parents spending time with their kids.
good,I felt replaceable at a moments notice. Like i was not important enough to the company to be concerned with wether im there or not. Other than that a great company.
good,I learned a lot at my years there. Lots of room for advancement if you are willing to work hard and stay consistent. They like to promote within. Sometimes have a tendency to hire hot heads for managers. Sometimes there were too many managers in an area at once who wanted 3 different things from you. Overall the culture and the friends made though were worth it. Plus the customer service skills gained over the years.
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company but I had some personal issues that I had to resign from the job. Overall some of the management were a little on the tight side but other than that, it was a good experience"
good,Le empresa es buena el problema son los directivos gerentes generales y distritales
good,"What I enjoyed the most about working at HD was the pleasant conversations with customers who were open to discussion. That being said, the whole ""customer is always right"" ideology of HD often leads to selling customers what they want instead of what they actually need."
good,"Great place to work , Managers always willing to help. Their is a lot to do and a lot of opportunities to improve with you're skills . Managers are willing to help you out."
good,"un buen excelente de trabajo. capacitación,buen aprendizaje"
good,My job position was very labor intensive and customer oriented we had to get orders together and place materials logically so they wouldn't be damaged by weather or other outside forces when they're loaded onto the trucks.
good,"Good place to work, Management just okay."
good,"Management unclear whats going on,constant changes,general work ok,understaffed.one is moved about in the store often and scheduled time to work changes week to week."
good,I gained a lot of experience in some new areas of work and I enjoyed that very much. I'm always open to learning new things and Home Depot certainly provided that.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a great experience.  I learned about the company, customer service, and that everyone's job is important for the overall success of the company."
good,"	Sales Associate"
good,"Customer service improvements, teamwork improvements,organization improvements, flexibility in working in other departments helps with knowing more about products."
good,"I enjoyed working here and liked the people, loved helping the customers.  They reduced hours to 16 a week which no one can live on.  Otherwise I would have stayed here."
good,It was enjoyable to work at Home Depot just not as many hours are given. The team is great the managers are nice it’s very welcoming at my job. The only downside is the hours.
good,I really loved working for The Home Depot. My reasons for leaving the company were personal in nature and had nothing to do with the company. The hours could be long but that happens with most jobs.
good,"Most issues had to do with mass moving/retirement/quitting of management people at about 2 years in, then the quitting of most of my dept. for various job-related reasons. Then, they eventually stopped hiring people who actually cared about doing their job and doing it well. Personally, I would have liked the job more if there were consequences for laziness. Not bad for a first job, I learned a lot."
good,"Loved the job intell a kid from HR   "
good,Had a Very Good Experience working at Home Depot. The take care of their employees no matter what. Doing inventory on certain departments on the store
good,I didn’t really work here long but while I was there it was cool and relaxed. They work with you but one thing is that the Garden Loaders need to be able to accept tips fro the Customers.
good,Great people to work with.  I feel like this job always has something to keep our interest on a daily basis.  Customers are best part of The Home Depot.
good,"Fast pace company, great management team that will work around your school schedule. Employee culture was great. Dont recommend working as a lot associate because they dont move you up as fast."
good,"A lot of associate engagement.  There were opportunities to advance from the Contact Center to the Store Support Center, Marietta Tech Center or other sites."
good,Atypical day at Home Depot would be watering and helping customers load the plants or helping a customer in the store looking for something. Other than that id help stock the shelf. The hardest part of the job would be helping a customer look for something that wasn't in my general area.
good,"Great job for part-time work, but not too many advancements. Company will train you to drive fork lift, and reach truck. Great benefits for those who are in school."
good,"I loved working here because often times I was pushed to go the extra mile for customers, my department and co-workers. I felt like I was valuable but never recognized at all really, I am happy to have worked in a busy crazy store because it taught me that not all customers are nice but I always took pride in helping them and knowing I actually did good and gave them a smile."
good,Deal with thousands of customers daily. Job security not that great. Many managers & supervisors not on same page. Good opportunity for advancement. Schedule is up & down weekly. No personal life if your full time. Pay ok for management positions only. Not great for associates in non-mgmt slots.
good,This is not at all a bad company to work for it all really comes down to what you are looking for (i.e growth and stability) and it appears all departments do have a positive work environment.
good,"Moral is good , with a bit of micromanagement, pay is fair , benefits are great , profit sharing is good , overall the Home Depot is a great company to work for they treat staff well"
good,It has a great company culture. I work hard so I have freedom without having someone over my shoulder all the time. I work with great people. Very understandable management.
good,"I have only been here a short time, but love the overall feel so far. Staff is friendly and helpful when needed. Management jumps in to assist without making you feel like you are an intrusion. The overall work environment is never boring and there is always something to do."
good,"When I wanted to be rehire, no one answered my calls or at least helped me get place at a different place. I did everything I could and was praised by my coworkers for my work ethic and how efficient I was."
good,"I would come to work early sometimes, put on my apron, then I go to the floor to get started after punching in. I work for however much hours then get a break for 15 minutes. I get two breaks and depending on my hours I get lunch time as well. My days are pretty mellow, sometimes nudy, other times not so hectic."
good,"I an currently looking for other employment . It is a good company to  work for but they are not very flexible  with their hours. I have been very happy there in the past 3 years however now that I cannot work nights my hours have been cut drastically"
good,"Great starter job, promotes from within, trains associates, good benefits, takes care of their people, all about the customer experience, fun and enjoyable"
good,"Positive workplace setting, overall team was truly cohesive, very supportive management team, monthly staff development, and would highly recommend this position."
good,Currently I work as an overnight lumber associate and I am a certified forklift operator. The night shift is busy and I assist in other areas where needed.
good,"Flat stack, pack down, and cull damaged lumber. Unload trucks and operate lifts. Sweep and stock all merchandise. Have department looking clean and full for customers to shop. I learned the different types of lumber, and building materials. I learned to operate new heavy equipment that I had not previously operated before. Management was constantly changing. Company culture, they genuinely stood by customers and associates being an important part of what they stand for. They had a lot of programs in place that actually helped their employees. Hardest part of the job was doing most of the work load alone. There wasn't much of a team work mentality in the department. I really did enjoy learning about lumber and building materials. Conversing with contractors and customers, and hearing about projects they were doing or completed. I was able to operate the forklift which I enjoy doing. Also learning the new machinery!"
good,Part time position in paint various  hours are scheduled and work every weekend for the most part during the holiday season great job for college students
good,Overall good work environment. Being a retail and deliveries position the job sometimes requires to work at a fast pace and manage multiple tasks at a time.
good,Great working environment with many opportunities to grow and expand your knowledge but also open doors for a better future opportunity. Great co workers and team players.
good,Home depot was a great experience for me met a lot of good people there that I'm still friends with I miss working there sometimes maybe I'll go back who knows
good,Working at Home Depot was a great work experience. It felt like working with a family not just employees. Easygoing work place and the managers have all there ducks in a row.
good,Fast paced but good environment and friendly staff room to move up if wanted. Management is willing to help with personal issues if needed and are fair
good,"I was given flexible hours and found myself part of a stable and clean environment. Everyone was professional, friendly and welcoming. I recommend this company"
good,"Sometimes the store get busy but apart from that, it`s fun working there. Good hours are given to part-time. and co-works are really helpfully i will like working there."
good,It’s ok it’s my main job but this store I’m in is based on favorites it pays ok for a beginner adult sometimes they take care of their people but most of the time it’s just favorites
good,My day would start with cleaning down All the appliances in the showroom. After I was done I would than check my shelves; to make sure they were fully stocked. If I wasn’t attending to my customers in the back I was up front helping cashier.
good,"I learned valuable information while working at the Home Depot, it was interesting interacting with multiple personalities daily and did my best to provide them with the items/services they needed."
good,Working at Home Depot was fine I liked the job and everyone there I just didn't want to work only 8 hours a week early in the morning with another job
good,It is a good place to work. Management is really tough on following rules. Make sure you greet customers and walk them to the product. Make sure you aren't late or work overtime.
good,"Options to cross train in departments to learn the whole store and become something bigger in the company. Play your cards right and you could become a department supervisor, ASM, or even a store manager one day."
good,This job offers opportunities to grow. The work environment is nice because most of the coworkers take care of each other. The managers cheer you up and encourage you to help you make your job as smooth as required as you can. The work availability is great and job recognition is fantastic.
good,"The place is a good place to work as employees are well taken care of and all kinds of safety precautions are available in many ways.  Management is dependent on who is the manager at the time, some ties good and some times not. Good place to work if you are a teenager or in your early 20's."
good,Home Depot is a great company I recommend it to anyone looking to work in a fun environment staff was cool outside of my supervisor but for the most part I enjoyed everyday getting up going to work
good,"If you're a part time associate you're not going to get a whole lot out of the company. You get bad hours in the ""off season"" (fall & winter), you don't get a whole lot of benefits other than 401K. The management could be better, and they could take more things into consideration. I will say the other associates are amazing and its very easy to make friends out of coworkers. If you decide to get a job at The Home Depot, I highly suggest to push for a full time position. You'll be treated more fair, and get a lot more benefits."
good,"For the most part it is very exhausting to work in a fast pace job, but here i learned lots of things like shipping and helping the supervisor to relocate objects, working in the computer and on the floor palletizing products."
good,"Good company and they focus on customer satisfaction and keeping people happy. The pay is not great but for retirement or for a first job or summer job they are excellent. You'll learn new skills, and you'll feel like part of a team."
good,Like most big companies it has it perks and down falls.. overall content with the setup of the company... Needs to concentrate on the service and not the Dollar.
good,En términos generales se podría llegar a la conclusión de ser una empresa buena.
good,good place to work. moving up is based on your work ethic and desire. I give it a good rating based on closeness to my residence and only working three days a week to achieve full time status
good,"The days go by pretty slow, but the people you work with make up for that. Management are very nice, and they know what they are doing, it makes you feel good knowing you are part of a well-run team."
good,"Home Depot wasn't a bad place to work. I liked my coworkers, and my management wasn't bad. It was ok. What more can I say? Definitely worse jobs out there."
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. The benefits are great. People are great that you work with lots of recognition for employees and awards.
good,"Laid back work environment with alright pay..  Great for home owners, college students, handymen!! Hardest part of the job is the pay wish they I earned more here."
good,It’s not a bad job for a high schooler or kid who is in college. Met a lot of good people and they made you feel like a family. Very good first job to have.
good,"Working at Home Depot SSC is very fast paced. There is a lot of growth opportunities, especially for analysts. Days start at 8am and go to 5pm, although many work more."
good,"Of course they don't really care about you, but it's actually a pretty good company to work for. Decent benefits, and they pay their employees ""success sharing"" check if the company has a good six months. Overall good work environment!"
good,"Great job security as long as you're willing to work. Best retail job I've had."
good,"Was great place to work team oriented and helpful,always customer freindly.got great work hours and overtime never had no work that could not be handled"
good,The people I work with are enjoyable to work with and the work is fairly easy and simple to learn. Also there is room to grow in the store if you are wanting to go to different departments.
good,"I won't say it's perfect, but better than most places I've been. I work overnight which may not be most people's cup of tea, but it's worked out for me. Opportunities are there depending on what you want to do. Management is pretty good and I like the peace at night when you don't have to deal with customers as much as opposed to day shift. If you like doing customer service then day shift might be good for you. Sometimes we're overloaded with freight and short handed on help, but we get through it. We have a pretty good night crew and we all work well together."
good,"a typical day is a least 1500-2000 piece truck, very fast past but fun at the same time small group good friends "
good,"when i first started, the department was wel kept and the associates were all really welcoming and helpful,though theres imes where the pay doesnt add up t the work, theres nothing you can really do for that. but the people is was maks he job a great place."
good,"There are no limits to what an associate can become at THD. It is fun, competitive, challenging, and very rewarding helping customers with issues and encouraging associates to perform to their potential."
good,"Good job for those who don’t need many work hours "
good,"while working there it was easy work not very hard or stressful, jut a lot to learn but easy as time went by. eventually it gets easier but if you ask for help the people there will help guide you to success."
good,Working with The Home Depot helped me handle customers better and also helped me better handle money with care and quickness. The Home Depot is a great work place with great culture and a enthusiastic place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at HD.  I met some good people and learned from them.  If you do not like customer service, then this job is not for you.  I thought it was great working here though."
good,"A decent place to work if your looking for a job, with hard work you can climb the ladder quite high. Plenty of different position and knowledge available if your willing to learn."
good,"I enjoyed and learnt a lot working here. Once in a year employee sale offer but H1B were not hired."
good,"Working for Home Depot was not a task I could not handle, especially  after experiencing the military life. Home Depot is a great place for people and they do have the elements of a family home."
good,généralement charger comme routine de travail mais très bien partagé dans un département ce qui facilite le boulot.
good,greet customers and handle transactions accurately and quickly and keep area clean and keep an eye out for any recoveries assist customers when needed
good,"Fun, fast-paced but relaxed place to work. Plenty of other employees in the store at the same time to seek for help/assistance. Periodic rewards for good behavior involving a monetary bonus per number of rewards."
good,I enjoyed working and building relationships with customers. There were long term employees who were ill tempered and were never adequately disciplined by management.
good,"Customer service is its priority because customer service drives sales and sales drive profitability to oversimplify, no ifs ands or buts about it. Your day requires a lot of walking, so don't expect to be able to sit down if you are not physically gifted with endurance. Culture is customer service but  hard work is usually what customers task you with.  Pay scales to retain quality of associates changed to the modernized pay scale while offering good benefits that became unreachable to the part timer while taking a sizable chunk out of a full time employees check. The majority of customers are quite amazing yet the small percentage of them are the most challenging part of the job while they also can be the most satisfying part of the job."
good,"El salario es bueno a comparación de otras empresas de rentail, el ambiente laboral es bueno, lo único malo es que malente cuidan mucho a la gente que no le gusta trabajar haciendo más pesado el trabajo de equipo a demás que no apoyan si un empleado no tiene un buen desempeño para buscar la forma de que trabaje o en su defecto darlo de baja y a pesar de las evidencias siempre hacen responsables a los lideres de que la gente no quiere trabajar"
good,It was ok. It wasnt my favorite job. The employees where nice and mangers did they job. I didnt like waking up at 6 in the morning  but nights where fun.
good,Great company to work for very pleased great people treated me as a cashier wonderful team work on the front end very happy with the company I would highly recommend the home depot
good,"Great perks with success sharing bonus,  employee stock purchase plan, etc... no work life balance unless part time. Demanding but can be rewarding.  If you want to be recognized be flexible and stay on management good side.."
good,The Georgetown Home Depot is a very busy store. The employees are kind for the most part. Well paying job however the cost of living in the area is very pricey. Also the schedule is very inconsistent and there’s not much opportunity for full time.
good,"A day at Home Depot is a day among friends, where everyone is happy to lend a hand when asked. Always a chance to learn something new every day, just pick an item or department and ask away."
good,It was a prettu cool place and enviorment to work for but the managment sucked couldnt work with my school schedule and is was a very hostile work enviorment.
good,"Enjoyed offering people excellent customer service.  You can learn just about anything you want, by applying yourself to grow the business and as and individual."
good,"nice place to work , co- workers are really nice and helpful always ready to help, good deal on health benefits and stock buying opportunities,"
good,"A great place to work, and has great benefits for students. I worked in the lumber department and spent many days learning about construction techniques."
good,"I enjoyed being apart of the freight team, it was a job I felt fit for. My avareage day was receiving a shipment and distributing it out within then store."
good,great place to work with new management. nice fast paced environment. the customers that come in are usually friendly so are your co-workers. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"The garden department is the best department.  My boss is awesome. He doesn't micromanage at all. "
good,"Beaucoup de formation "
good,Home Depot was one of the hardest jobs but paid good working in the garden showed me how to communicate with customers and being comfortable with getting my hands dirty.
good,"Home depot does offer much full time. You're either hired on or you earn it after moving up or obtaining a rare full time position. Overall, its customer service retail type of job, so it has its pros and cons. But it's nothing like a Walmart type of retail job, so it's very laid back and chill. 1 hour breaks are nice too!"
good,the team i worked with was amazing. They were very considerate to others and we were all willing to help each other out to acheive the tasks that needed to be completed for the store to open every morning.
good,Management there sucks and only care about moving up and getting a bigger check. Will never congratulate you or support you. Only care abut their pockets.
good,"Working at The Home Depot would keep you busy at times, and sometimes not. Weekends and mornings are usually packed. It is hard to move up in the company. Pay is decent for the kind of jobs they offer."
good,"Nice place to work, gained retail experience, management was great. Work place culture was vibrant. Hardest part is trying to gain knowledge of everything in the store."
good,"Too many bosses. Several of their long time employees would get away with doing almost nothing while the others, like myself, were working their tails off!"
good,Home Depot is a really nice company but some of the things associates have to endure are really unfortunate. Management themselves can really bring down morale with unfair terminations. Tasks are regularly dispensed with little manpower to complete said task. Hours for part timers are cut during austere parts of the year (between Labor day and Thanksgiving/Black Friday and Christmas to Easter).
good,"Great coworkers, good training opportunities, positive work environment, approachable management with positive attitudes and great product  knowledge and company policy information."
good,I love working there because I have meet good people but it's a whole of the associates who tries to boss other people around and then I'm not getting enough hours.
good,"A typical day at work is helping costumers, stocking shelves, and always working safely. I've learned how to operate the reach truck and forklift. Management is good. The hardest part of the job is multitasking when your working and you also have to help costumers so it gets a bit overwhelmed and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people that work there, they are all really cool and friendly."
good,"a typical day at work is dealing with several upset customers"
good,"perfect place to begin your career, their pay is not that good as a sales associate but as you keep moving forward and getting more experience your pay will be increased."
good,"When I first started, I loved the culture of working there, but then management got slack, and it started going downhill. I still liked the job, but it just became too stressful."
good,"Overall, most employees at the Homedepot are have good work ethic and good customer service. Employees enrolling for machinery licenses at Homedepot should be trained way better and shown how to control and handle the machines safer."
good,Very fast paced environment. You need to be customer service oriented to work there. Management often wouldn’t listen to employees about issues they are having in the workplace. Be prepared to be moved to a different department without being asked if you could first.
good,Good company to work for if you're looking for part-time. There is good times and good benefits for an employee and if there are some concerns they are able to go to management
good,I worked there and had a great experience working with fellow coworkers and others to provide the best costumers experience for people walking into the store
good,working here was a good opportunity and they have great long term opportunities too. it was a little stressful with scheduling and knowing my shifts but that might have been my specific location. If given the chance to work there again I would.
good,"As with most businesses the necessity to do more with less leaves the stores frequently understaffed increasing the need to increase personal production at all levels. The staff and management are generally personable and caring of employees and customers alike. The ""Homer Fund"" which is a collection from employees matched by the company to benefit employees in distress is one of the unique features of the company. Excellent opportunities for advancement."
good,Working at the plainwell home depot was fun. And used my past construction knowledge and gardening knowledge. Culture was abit like high school but that is typical of most retail jobs
good,"Es una buena empresa, a excepción del salario, es muy bajo para las actividades que hay que realizar y pues la actitud de los clientes que hay que aguantar. Aunado a el hecho de que las prestaciones son casi nulas, ni transporte ni cafetería"
good,"I was hired for garden department; where I wanted to work.  It's not just helping customers pick out plants.  Involves hardscape, soils etc.  Sometimes difficult to get help with loading. Physically demanding but rewarding!  Actually have an interview at my new location this week!"
good,"Goede baan. Hectisch werk, maar altijd een uitdaging en altijd iets te doen. Vooral de plantenafdeling was leuk."
good,"Take care of all customers, make sure all customers are satisfied and well taken care of. Put all returns back on shelves once getting closer to closing time"
good,"Administer the order fulfillment process, delivery scheduling, inventory management, financial records and various other task activities. Assist customers and sales teams in documenting and organizing daily activities.. Coordinate with the corporate based sales teams to process just in time orders for delivery."
good,"Enjoyed working with other in a fast paced, Upbeat work environment. Leaders took care of each other for the most part. Understanding Managers that look to take care of the Associates."
good,"The other Associates were great! There were some that were ""cliquey"" but I guess its like that at every work site.  They make sure to include lunches for an hour in your schedule. The company odes alot of benefits for veterans and the homeless.  They also have a plan for Associates."
good,I’ve been working at the Home Depot for Almost 2 year. I like it at first but things changed in the company. I did get promoted so there is room for promotion.
good,It good for a part time job pays $10 an hour for cashier starting. It’ll be okay as long as you have a good head cashier and manager. They’re good about giving you paid time off even working part time and they’re understanding of student schedules
good,"the day would start out with the managers giving us updates and safety issues.  Great managers who would listen to any concerns that I would have regarding my current position, as well as co-workers.  The work was fast and steady and everyone watched out for one another.  Most difficult part of the job was using the reach and/or forklift.  Safety is key at the warehouse. At the end of my shift I was glad that all went well without any injuries."
good,I really enjoy working for the home depot. I think that they are a good company to work for and they mostly care about their employees. Very fast pace. They have great associates with great customer service.
good,Vary educational for home owners and dys people..vary safe condition especially with the larg lumber and other havey items. Fair pay but easy to get notice for your customer service
good,"I really enjoyed  working there, I would work there again if offered another job. Wish there were more working hours, fulltime instead of part time hours."
good,Here at the Home Depot we are all about safety team work and respecting our fellow peers. Working here I have created bonds with associates and customers alike.
good,Home Depot is a great place to learn abt new merchandise. Great place to work an awesome employees who are always smiling and are helpful to all customers.
good,"It is a good job full of amazing coworkers. It's more or less management I had issues with, they definitely like to pick favorites and if you aren't a favorite you will be pushed to the side. My only major issue was the reason I left. So I do work a seasonal job and they said they would work with the schedule, then all of a sudden they changed their minds. Also while I was working here my grandmother passed. I took 2 days off and when I came back my depth manager kept harassing me about it asking if I like my job there every 2 seconds and management did nothing to stop it"
good,This company taught me fundamental skills in the areas I have listed on my resume. I experienced the utmost importance of working with a team firsthand but also that being able to properly function and navigate work life on your own is also just as important and vital a skill and ability necessary for job success.
good,You will work a lot and you will be tired everyday. I work over night so Indian lot of heavy work and have trouble keepin a social life with the hours I work.
good,"Order Fulfillment, moving a lot of roofing materials and lumber. Picking and pulling products for internet orders all day. Part time workers get all of the shifts that no one else wants."
good,Store manager...great guy! Office staff...great! ASMs...pretty decent. Associates...great bunch! The only issue I have/had working here is there is no ability to get set hours. But it is retail so can't really expect to.
good,"I spent my time over worked and under paid for the duty's of multiple employees with managers expecting more form one person."
good,"It was ok when I first started, but the morning crew and night crew seemed to be on bad terms. They would blame each other for issues with the store. One of the overnight managers played favorites quite a bit and didn't stop bullying when it happened. I switched to a traveling MET team and it was a bit stressful when I started because I didn't feel like I was trained properly. Associates at some of the stores we traveled to had issues with us and sometimes we were treated rudely. I eventually got better at the job. I switched to mornings at a specific store and everything was ok when I first began, but there were issues between the MET team and the rest of the store. Different parts of the store played the blame game and that just made working there stressful. I would only recommend The Home Depot if you really need a job."
good,"It was my 2nd job they did not keep there end of the deal.we made about my hours."
good,"Greet customers with a smile "
good,I've lived in the area all my life so I was able to see a lot of my acquaintances and Friends and people I knew. The staff was pretty friendly but there was always a large turnover.
good,"Es buena empresa para trabajar a corto plazo ,pero para crecer hay mucho favoritismo"
good,"Not the best place for developing a career, this location favors to those who are liked by management, fun coworkers, customers can be rude and even harass you."
good,Working at home depot could be better if the pay was better been with the company for 17 years should be getting paid more than what I'm getting I have machine license for all machines in the store I stock and fill shelves through out the day and help customers
good,The atmosphere when I worked there was positive and supportive. I enjoyed working and learning new skills while there. My position could be physically demanding but they would accommodate all abilities.
good,all of my co workers were amazing people to talk to and you would meet so many cool customers but the hours could go from 20 a week to not even 12 a week
good,"Had some fun working at Home Depot. Met some people, learned some things needed for the future like things needed for homes, names of tools, and at least where things are in their stores departments. Skills needed for future."
good,"Fast pace work environment. "
good,"Customers can be rude and threaten to go elsewhere. There is almost always something to do, but pay is poor. Managers are overall very nice and cooperative."
good,"Everyday meeting and interacting with customers, is very enjoyable and and my time working there goes very fast without feeling bored. Friendly and motivating team."
good,It was an ok experience everyone i worked with was nice and friendly. The company had alot of benefits. And they did holiday parties. It was nice place to work but there recognition system was bogus.
good,A good company that treats employees well. Never had a problem with anyone who worked there. Just show up do your work and there won't be any drama. Good people.
good,"This company is fine as a first job, but the manager is an idiot.He completely disregards any important details. He constantly demotes associates and cuts pay"
good,I've been treated well at working for the home depot and it pays the bills. After almost five years I'm ready to get back out there and do something I'm passionate about.
good,I’ve worked at Home Depot on two separate occasions. Both in the outside garden which was great but it does get cold in the winter time.   My second time there I worked in the kitchen department which was cool.     The folks that work at Home Depot are really good people I highly recommend working there
good,"The managers make the place bad, the micromanaging and the stress they give you is basically not worth the pay. Aside from that, the co-workers, the trainings, and the people you see are awesome."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. It’s just the store I worked at had poor management and a lot of stress. The pay is okay but the benefits are amazing, and that makes up for the okay pay."
good,"The biggest problem was the double standard when it came to how hard an employee was to be working. Anyone working the front end was expected to keep working nonstop and constantly keep themselves busy, even after they'd completed everything they can do. Meanwhile, many department workers spent their shifts doing absolutely no work, sitting in the back, and talking, and it was encouraged by management."
good,"I had a really good knowledgeable and reasonable supervisor so learning about the job wasn't as hard as it could've been, I also liked that he had our backs as well. We were a pretty tight knit group which made the job experience unique. He consistently had ex employees come in to visit since he was such a good person. It was a job I had to learn way more information then any other job I ever had but since I had the right leadership and co-workers around me I took what I learned from the job to another level. Home Depot does Pot Lucks every month. Best company I've ever worked for to be honest. Store managers who steal from the company and are given the power to try to fire you for dumb reasons is a stressful thing to deal with when your homeless...other then that just show up on time and do what you need to and you'll be alright I promise you."
good,I do not have a written review. I enjoyed working there the only problem was the lack of hours after the winter season came.  Hours where great in the winter.
good,"I worked in one of the busiest stores and so the needs of the customer were often allowed to cut into safety and store priorities. In order to get better customer service our managers would have all hands on deck to tackle small problems. Keeping everything in stock often ran contrary to the needs of the managers, such as not showing the loss of products to save face, and instead turning away customers. In other Home Depots I hear things are more slow-paced and personal, but my Home Depot was a place managers graduated from."
good,"it is ok,  however there are no opportunity to advancement. The cost of living is too hight to have just one job. communication between management ,and suoervisor to the associate needs to improve."
good,"It is a pretty good place to work except in the winter time. Because it’s a warehouse it gets extremely cold. It can get extremely busy during this summer time and the holidays. The atmosphere is really nice if you love customer service, working at the Home Depot will be great for you."
good,Great workplace everyone friendly (staff) and work as a team. Fast paced with all the contractors and such. Pay is decent for entry level job. Would recommend for a first job or just to pay the bills.
good,It is a overall good work environment. Everybody is fair and there are many job improving opportunities. You can move different departments and transfer to other location if you have to relocate or you are not satisfied in the area you are currently in.
good,"great place to work, everyone is very nice. The work is hard manual labor but its very relaxed. The best part of the job would have to be, either, the benefits or how nice everyone is too each other."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, majority of management was fair and easy to work with.  Pay was average.  Advancement was often slow.  Excellent place to work as a first job or a part-time job.  Good opportunities for women."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot and I enjoyed my time there very much. Would have been 5 stars if they could figure out a better system of loading and unloading product, the receiving side of the job was a bit demanding and didn't work that well."
good,Good hours. Overnight crew is small could use more assoicates. Decent pay. Friendly management and associates that help you out when needed. Would recommend
good,"The management team shows a lot of favoritism, they don’t listen to many people and sometimes they let stuff slide that they shouldn’t, the employees are great to work with aside from that."
good,"bon employeur,bien organise, securitaire programme d apprentissage bien fait"
good,Homedepot is a great place to work if you are a college student or high school and just trying to get quick money with not alot of experience. Advancement is fairly difficult if you don't have the greatest management team over you. But it is still a good place to work.
good,"Really great environment, the head cashiers and managers are really nice and humble. They never belittle you and there's plenty of guidance and opportunities. Only thing I don't necessarily agree with is how low the hours can be at times."
good,"Home Depot expects a lot from their workers. It can be fast paced and stressful at times. But if the management team is helpful as they should be, working there isn't bad. There are ways to keep moving your way up in the company."
good,"High paced and busy. I learned so many things about how to fix or change things in the home. Very valuable tools.  Management is mixed.  Some were great, others not so much.  Find the managers willing to mentor you and really learn from them.  The hardest part of my job  (my personal situation) was that my manager should not have been in that position.  When my manager is the absolute last resources I use and even they don't know the answer, that is not a good thing.  I really enjoyed my position, I was confident that I did pretty well; I was respected and my associates worked for (and with) me.  I never had to pull teeth to get things accomplished.  I learned a lot of valuable lessons throughout the duration of my time with The Home Depot."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, a place where there is morals, respect and cooperation.  Lots of benefits including health, dental and eye plus discounts as a staff. But part-time is not just recommended for me now. Need a full-time job."
good,"Home Depot was a highlight in my career due to the other associates and THD customers! I left due to the improper, unfair treatment of the staff. Senior Management would find anything in order to write up the employees! Taking the spotlight for lack of management off of themselves. Several times I witness employees crying because they could not understand were they fell short of said duties when everything humanly possible was done to insure the completion of said duties and the customers were taking care of. They were always short staff because of the contentment held for Senior Management. Many transferred to other Home Depot locations!"
good,"I enjoy working at the Home Depot.  The associates are friendly and very helpful. Management has room for improvement but I think that is everywhere almost.  I enjoy helping customers with their DIY projects. Most full time store associates have fixed timed schedules but their days are flexible. Merchandisers work Monday through Friday 6 am -3 pm with major holidays off. The only sad thing about working at The Home Depot is the hourly wages. They need to get with the program. Everyone else is up or going up including our competitors.  Home Depot is a great place to work, if they want to keep great people, they need to have better wages."
good,nice place to work the people are friendly and the pay is great. would recommend this position to someone who like to talk on the phone.  The hours could be better.
good,"For a young person this is a great start. HD offers a Stock Plan that gives 20% discount and can be sold 6 months later. After 4 years of mostly part time work I left with $9K in my stock plan. "
good,"They really take care of their customers. "
good,"Associates were treated well and recognized regularly for accomplishments. Flexible schedule, training in other areas, quarterly bonuses. The company goes out and volunteers for different things in the community, they even help thir own when someone is in a hard situation."
good,"I had a great time working at Home Depot, there were many friendly people and coworkers. You learn a lot about tools and the kind of jobs there are from working at Home Depot."
good,Working as a kitchen designer at the Home Depot was a great place to learn the trade. The difficult part of being a kitchen designer at The Home Depot was that you were also required to work in other departments.
good,"I worked there for almost a year, I really liked it there because I was comfortable at my work place and it was an easy part time job while you’re young. I was able to learn new things working there, the managers were good at promoting, and there was opportunities to move up. You would get a raise every year. And the managers really do care about the employers to an extent, but I remember I started coming in late, and got to many absences so I wasn’t able to stay. Over all it’s a great company to work for with lots of benefits."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consisted of a quick group meeting before being assigned a number of projects to be completed throughout the shift.  As far as home improvement and store operations, each day provided an opportunity to gather new information and grow as an employee and as a person.  Teamwork and communication were of the highest importance as many of the projects success depended on multiple tasks being completed independently and interdependently.  At times as a team we found ourselves a bit short staffed which presented a challenge but we usually pulled together and got the job done.  I really enjoyed learning about the home improvement business and working with a great group of people."
good,Home Depot is actually a good place to work cause you can grow in the company but the manager I had at the time had poor management skills he goes off what other people tells him not what he saw for his self
good,"most of the time a fun place to work.  always team work . fun activities and"
good,"The home depot is a overall good company, it's just the managers have poor management skills. There is favoritism among managers and they treat the graveyard shift worker unfairly when it comes to the day shifters."
good,Everyone knew what to do when they got there so it was straight to business. They fed us at meetings made sure we came first and they always preached safety.
good,Home Depot is a good company to work at the pending what city or state you are in great benefits you get to meet different people everyday they definitely have good training for the job
good,"Hard to get a full-time spot anymore.  Shifts can be unpredictable. Takes a bit to learn the store, but time passes quickly. Pay was above minimum...."
good,Home Depot is a fine place to work if you understand how retail jobs are. You are going to work inconsistent hours and days. You are going to work on Holidays and planning a life with your family is going to prove difficult. The company means well and does what they can within the means of a retail environment. They will tell you that work-life balance is important and I think that the genuinely mean it but can't give people the schedules they want and meet the needs of the business. The people that I worked with are awesome and it truly is a family environment. One of the best work cultures that I have experienced.
good,Fast pace environment that is constantly evolving....... Management was great and always helpful and developing associates.... Sometime family and work balance is difficult
good,"I enjoy going in on most days I work. They are very good at keeping to your schedule and only giving you the hours that you ask for. There are some days that are chill, but weekends prepare to be going the whole time you are there."
good,"Nice people, if you enjoy that type of work its a good place. Management is cool, and they work well with you on scheduling. Nothing bad to say, but the pay isn't very good."
good,"Home Depot is a big company with big company process.  It is a great place to learn and be challenged in the field of retail management.  The company puts far to much power in the hands of HR, who are non-productive employees that do not understand the operations of a store."
good,The Home Depot is very demanding of it's employees but it also lacks in providing the tools needed to do the job. Home Depot only buys safety items and materials when funding is available and not when the products are needed. Home Depot had some serious safety issues that they ignore.  In my time at home Depot I strived to improve any situation I was in and trained other in the proper process of working. I was looked at as a team leader.
good,"I expected to learn more about home improvement when I started working, but the position turned out to be primarily customer-service on the front-end/outside of the store. The workload would vary depending on what holiday/sales were going on, but every shift helped develop my work ethic (as well as improve my lifting technique and teach me the value of staying hydrated). Coworkers were always friendly and willing to teach their department or lend a hand."
good,"Working hours are inconsistent and hard to plan your life around.  They offer perks to the stores to compensate their employees with extras, not financially."
good,I worked all summer on very hot days often alone pulling in carts from the parking lot. It was often very busy when I worked and got little to bo help from my peers. This was also my first job and was trated badly by the management(no training).
good,A lot of different skills were used during the time working at The Home Depot which helped me gain more experience towards skills that I would use in the future.
good,quick paced and good for people who did not go to college. allows you to work hard and provides complementary awards for doing so and allows you to move up.
good,"Working there to some may be monotonous given that it's the same thing every day, but for the most part your work isn't being heavily monitored as long as you're proactive and on task. Anyone can do the job, but only a certain few choose to be good at it and if you do so you won't regret it."
good,Though faced paced most of the time there are many employees willing to help one another to complete tasks and get merchandise for customers. The hardest part of the job is ensuring you make each individual feel special and unique.
good,"I started at home depot as a part-time freight associate, days would be unload truck, pack out and down pack product depending on how busy the trucks were. We weren't a huge store so we didn't have but maybe a truck every other day and weekends off. I didn't make much so I asked to be promoted to full-time as a order fulfillment associate and I got it pretty quickly. Started out nice but towards the beginning of the year I was given really weird hours like 5 am when I was a closer, was late a couple times because of the hourly issues of working til 10 pm and having to work at 5 am. This got frustrating and as things were getting better workload wise, I'd end up having to do other peoples jobs because nobody was scheduled in certain areas and then I'd fall behind in my zone because I was too busy in another zone. Luckily I had other co-workers that would help on the occasion but sometimes you can't help others when your department is swamped already... Also being the only machinery driver at times was annoying due to having to help other departments constantly..."
good,"There is always something productive to do when you are at work, there is no time to stand around. Keeps employees in shape by lifting boxes, and also give fair knowledge of the products in the store."
good,It's a good place to work sometimes it's fast paced. Co workers are easy to get along with. You build relationships with customers by knowing them by name.
good,No issues here. Good job but schedule didn't meet my family life and career goals. Staff friendly and helpful. Management flexible with time off required.
good,"Good atmosphere most of the time, customer service is priority."
good,"Home Depot is an excellent place to work and grow if you love the fast paced retail environment. Under the right store manager and right leaders, your growth potential is honestly endless. I held a rather difficult position for 5 years and although there were no pressing issues because I was not interested in remaining in the retail environment or moving up to become an assistant store manager. It was time for me to move on. There are many people that have been working there for 20+ years which speaks to the integrity of the company and the desire to take care of the associates, but again, it depends on your management team and I was fortunate to work with an excellent team. Pay is actually great compared to other retail store and benefits are decent as well. You will work hard and its retail so you may have to put up with more than you would like but if retail is your thing and helping customers is your desire this is the place to work."
good,"I enjoy working for The Home Depot. Just like other businesses they do have some things that they need to improve on, like pay etc but, Overall it’s a pretty good company to work for."
good,requesting off is very hard to do and the work was very boring when there were no customers bc u couldn’t leave the register but when there were customers time flew by.
good,Mon Thur Friday the morning shift which normally started at 5 am was a quiet shift just cause the store don't open till 6 am so you have the opportunity to work without customers destroying the shelves or asking alot of question. But overall it was a great job
good,it was nothing special i feel as if it is just like ant other job do what you expected to do then you leave happy knowing your going to get paid for your hard work
good,I would stay at Home Depot but I was only hired for part time and now they are not giving me enough hours so now I’m looking for a another job that can cooperate with my schedule
good,From college to The Home Depot started in a managerial training position in which I learned everything I know about retail. Good company to work for but culture has changed.
good,"I had a pretty good time, decent management and good co-workers. High traffic with customers making it stressful at time and lots of heavy stuff. Highly recommend for young people."
good,"this place was cool, no uniforms, only an apron and whatever you wear to work, shorts, jeans, etc. lots of training mods due at the most inopportune times, customers are awesome, management is friendly sometimes."
good,"The Home Depot has moved to more of a part time company, However it was a great place to work. I looked forward to going to work every day until we started to work split shifts and over nights."
good,"I learned a lot working at HD, some of it on the computer (but most training is better done hands on with the contractors and other employees in the aisles). I got the opportunity to branch out in my departmental training, becoming certified to work very many different departments and specialty positions. Working there showed me what I was really good at and what interested me, simply because of the sheer variety of trades I got to learn about. I worked at two different stores and there were welcoming work environments in both, but the second store had a lot of employees that were the ""run away and hide"" type when a customer needed help. 401k benefits are decent, so are the medical insurance options and the disability insurance, but only if you plan on sticking around for several years."
good,"I started in the garden to make extra money for  medical expenses, and really liked the people and culture, and working with the plants to relieve stress.  Then I saw what the designers did, and convinced my boss to give me a chance training for the position. It is hard work, with alot of responsibility, but I love doing it. I design kitchens for some great people, and work with a team that really cares about each other. With very few exceptions, people are treated with respect, and encouraged in their efforts."
good,"There are a lot of good things about working for The Home Depot. Great benefits and retirement plan, good and safe working environment, Nice recognition programs and they will help associates in need with their Homer Fund programs. The negatives are relatively low pay according to cost of living rates which limit your ability to take advantage of their benefits packages because your check would be reduced to rubble. Also, it's very clickish and promotions seem to come easier if you shine the right boots if you know what I mean. I actually lost my job their because I wasn't part of a certain click involving a fellow associate of mine who was promoted to supervisor because of the boots she polished. If theses areas get taken care of it could be a career destination worthy of investing your time and energy in. Unless you're a highly decorated executive you kind of have to play the game to get anywhere with any significance. Overall I did love working there up until the hire of my new supervisor and actually was depressed when I lost my job there. Did not want to leave."
good,Typical days as a cashier are filled with a lot of standing and waiting for customers. Cashiers are not allowed to leave their register unless on break.
good,I don't want to write a review but its making me and the part that sucks the most is it has to be a 150 character minimum and the this is it doesn't show that space counts but it does
good,As a single parent the company doesn't pay well enough to survive and they change your schedule on a regular basis unless you're an employee grandfathered in. You can work as a morning employee have a day off and the next day you're on a late shift. It's inconsistent but thankful I have a job.
good,"The amount of services they offer for employees is crazy! I cant believe everything they do.  Loved the environment, people stay working there for 10 plus years."
good,"I start the day at 5:30 am, scanning product that's been returned, broken and needing repaired, or salvaged and needing to be resold as is. I place it in a container and it goes to the department labeled in the sticker i had placed on it. The work culture is great! We hire anyone from different cultures here and everyone works together to make Home Depot successful in what we do. The hard part of working here is getting up super early to be there in the morning. But, in doing this, you get off from work at 2pm. The people here are fun to work with. We have fundraisers for people in need and have special event days and cook outs to make the work place enjoyable."
good,"At home depot I worked in the receiving and garden department. Although it was challenging working in the wintertime, I enjoyed the experiencing. I also loved my boss."
good,"A unique working experience. You can learn a lot different things from coworkers, supervisors, & even customers. Management worked pretty well with employees"
good,"During my short stint at Home Depot, I was given the opportunity to be successful as a department manager. The store manager there was a great mentor. Just too short, only 3 months long. I left because I was recalled by the Marine Corps"
good,"This job was great at first. For a young guy at the ge of 18 just trying to have some money for himself it was a good job. But as I aged, the money just wasn’t good enough after I wanted to get a car/insurance and still have money left over as well. Many times I asked did full time and was never offered it Or given it. I had a want to advance and to succeed but now I am no longer seeing the point if staying with the company."
good,"With no real cashiering experience, the coaches, other cashiers, head cashiers, and even management were kind, patient, very helpful and supportive as long as I was actually trying. I've now made some new lifelong friends! Investing time to learn product locations makes a big difference!"
good,"management was a little behind the curve. a lot of the staff is not fully trained, easy job. a lot of time spent on your feet, working night shift wasn't my favorite."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work and learn about the retail business."
good,"My typical day at work is interactive, learned new processes that makes  delivery efficient, great team, highly diversify, waking up every morning, supporting other department to meet their goal."
good,"great place to work"
good,The Home Depot s a great place to work if you are interested in the construction field. I learned so much about the tools and materials required for the set job. a typical day at the home depot is by doing returns throughout the day while assisting customers in various different ways.
good,"We we're very busy.  People were nice to work with.  We had meeting they gave prizes out on answer the question correctly.  Work hard with keeping the parking lot clear from carts, trash and help other people with there items to there vehicle.  Also help co-workers inside the store."
good,"For retail it's pretty good.  Paid time off, holiday pay, sick time etc.  Unfortunately though it's still retail.  And retail sucks. No one gets paid enough to be harrassed by people who have power over them, and unfortunately that is what many customers do."
good,"Every day is always the same, clock-in, put on your apron, and then start doing your task. Every day is always something new, learning newer things from department to department. The vibe of the store is always up-lifting and random through customers. Yet, the hardest part of the job is time. You either have no time to finish your task or you have the time to complete the task, again every day is always the same depending on how the day flows. The fun part about working this job is by learning new things around the store with over 40,000 products that we all use in our living spaces and property!"
good,"not for those looking for work life balance , but great culture great training,  somewhere where you can make a career and build your self even if you have no experience"
good,It was a great place to work. A lot of the people are cool but the management seems to be lacking at the store I worked at. Overall good job. i would recommend if someone was looking.
good,"Was not much to reply to on this survey, nothing to report, it was overall a typical retail experience, long hours, random scheduling preventing any life with family, and manager that did not care."
good,Home Depot was cool they work with ur schedule working there was fun made good friends the bad thing about it was they don’t offer full time and don’t give raises to part time workers
good,The job was straight forward after receiving training. Everyone in the workplace had the same goals and were very friendly. Scheduling and rude customers were the hardest part of the job.
good,The workday is hectic at times with some customers having an attitude when they attempt to have the associate provide service against company policy. Standards and procedures are followed but some customers want returns or sales that are not allowed. The time frame for working is 6 am to 10 pm without same days off nor same hours worked daily.
good,"Slow paced, but good employees. Didn't work there very long, but everyone was nice including managers. Tasks were easy to complete, needed more to do. Got paid min. wage, which is only CON."
good,"-Friendly Staff"
good,This job requires a lot of customer service and interactions. The garden requires a tremendous amount of tending to in the spring and the summer. The hardest part about this job is the clean up in the garden throughout the day in the heat.
good,Very fast place to work but its very comfortable in the fact that its so diversified. I get along well with my co workers.. Sometimes the supervisors can be a little rough
good,"The job was fun at first but it soon lost it's charm due to the low wages, inconsistent schedules, and somewhat biased managers. A personal example would be that certain coworkers got away with clocking in late more often than those who were not friends of the managers."
good,"Overall fine, I worked there for a good amount of time and is was enjoyable. I liked the people there. Had to move on in life is why I decided to leave."
good,A typical day for me would be dealing with customers and making sure their orders are pulled. The company lacks great communication skills and do not know how to properly schedule their employees.
good,I had a pretty good experience working there. Great people wonderful customers (most of the time). I liked the co workers and the time spent there. Would defiantly recommend.
good,"This was a great experience to learn about many different trade jobs, and how to better take care of a home. Many Co-workers were very helpful and polite. Over a 2 year period my location went through 10 different managers/assistant managers and I only thought two were acceptable leaders."
good,"Learn a lot"
good,"Just as any day working in retail, the dynamic of the day changes quickly from peaceful to five alarm fire. "
good,Home Depot can be a great place to work if you can handle upset customers and frazzled managers. There are 2 kinds of customers: the grateful and the self entitled. The first is wonderful to work with but very rare. The last exceedingly common and horrible to work with.
good,A typical day at work at Home Depot was routine. I learned the importance of organization. Seeing that I worked primarily in the Gardening section of the store it was critical that the area was organized. The entire store was managed very well. The culture of the workplace was very friendly and I personally never felt unsafe. The most difficult part of the job was working during the weekends where a heavy flow of people would come in and out of the store. My favorite part of the job was helping all of the customers with their floral needs.
good,"It wasn't a BAD place to work... But some people in management positions, used their power to much. And some supervisors were just flat out rude! The customers were iffy, but if you have thick skin you can handle it!"
good,I worked at home depot during my pregnancy..I was treated with the upmost respect a d care ..I was sick alot a d always allowed to go home ..never was written up for it . I was also late sometimes due to dr appts ..they never said a thing.  I brought in dr notes ..but thye never demanded them ..
good,Overall a good place to work with good benefits. Flexible schedule with good people working around you. Very fast pace environment that will keep you busy.
good,empresa muy demandante por su giro y se deben revisar tabulador dw sueldos
good,Busy and friendly location to work. Worked many 4/hrs shifts and traveled to and from via public transit.  Coworkers looked after each other and customers.
good,Pretty laid back. Take care of the customers your are pretty much left alone. Most people who work at Home Depot are nice. Most people in the evening are either moonlighters or college students.
good,"4-8 work hour days"
good,Home depot is a great company to work for. There is lot of encouragement of technology and folks who are tech-oriented. At the same time the company faces same problems as any big corporation.
good,"As an associate, my duty was to assist customers with whichever questions they had or provide enough information to get them closer to their answers. Learned and became fluent with all manual operating machines. Bookkeeping; keeping accurate balance of the money within the vault and cash registers, reporting missing currency and dealing with daily cashier transactions."
good,Expo is a Home Depot company that sold high end products for the building industry. I worked in the Kitchen Showroom selling counter tops and cabinetry.
good,benefits were great management was terrible pay should've been way better we were paid in the middle we werent paid like most warehouses changed management every 4 months
good,I actually somewhat enjoyed working at Home Depot. Doing random tasks was enjoyable from me and there was rarely a manager breathing down my neck. The reason I left is because I wasn’t getting paid enough to live. Your start at $11 and don’t get a raise till a year in. Plus they have 80% part timers so getting a full time position is difficult
good,"It's all in who you know and unfortunately, who likes you.  If a manager doesn't like you then you have to watch your back!  If you get in someones good graces, you have it made.,"
good,"a normal day at home depot is fast paced and you learn something different everyday, no matter how long you've worked there. I learned that I am a leader  and I'm quick to understand what needs to be done and how to get others to understand there problems as well"
good,Relocation has been hard due to the cost of moving and rent around monroe. Just don't make enough to relocate. Friendly people and managers. I like how they try to work with you as much as they can. Unfortunately with how far it is and the hours i barely got sleep so i couldn't stay.
good,"It is a really great place to work and the management there was really great, had a great time working there, I just wish I got more hours and if I did I would have stay there"
good,"Fast pace environment, not that flexible and the work group is of the older generation. Hard for millennials to break in and move up through the ranks to succeed."
good,It’s hard to work at a place if you don’t get paid I mean come on I got paid every two weeks and it was about $350 that’s not enough to live off of come on Home Depot step up your game
good,The only reason I left was because I got a better job offer. It fell through right as I left(I got lied to) and my position filled as I left. I would return.
good,"I really enjoyed working at the home depot. My co-workers were very pleasant to work with, and didnt mind sharing information that would help me in my career. I learned a lot, hands on doing different projects, and workshops."
good,"Home Depot provides great training. Management tries, but in the end all companies have a bottom line and upper management makes decisions no one likes"
good,"It’s alright, if your management team actually does their job and uses their head. But other than that the generally idea that corporate has is nice, again only if management follows with it"
good,Lots of work to do and like everywhere else not enough people to get all the work done. You don't have enough time to attend to detail and personnel training is lacking.
good,The day is always different. Great team effort with positive colleagues and competitive wages. Great actively-healthy program for each district to help employees stay fit and healthy.
good,Learned a lot in a new field for me and was able to renew my fork lift certification.  I also learned to operate an electric Ballymore.  Very much enjoyed the interaction with customers.  My only negative was the requirement to work evening shifts.
good,A challenging job that requires a lot of quick thinking and persistence. Entering into this environment only looking to give the bare minimum will only result in your own failure.
good,"Very good place to work. Great for gaining customer service experience. For a cashier, a typical day consists of doing returns, passing customers at the cash, opening credit cards, greeting customers, etc."
good,"I never had a complaint while working at Home Depot. I loved the leaders and strived to be greater because of them. I was able to learn and grow in my knowledge and in turn was able to assist customers that much better. While you would occasionally run into a frustrated customer, your leadership would always back you up and help you out."
good,"Loved working in the garden department despite some awful customers, but that's just retail. Breaks are frequent - 10 minutes every 2 hours and 30-60 minutes for lunch. The pay wasn't too bad, and raises are available for permanent employees. Some managers were good and made it a lot better to work there. General manager was trash and seemed to be actively looking for a way to fire me. HR wasn't good either - they failed to communicate important information to me on multiple occasions. Overall, still enjoyed my time there and would work there again. I had the best hours of any job I've had, although I was capped at 28-30 for a seasonal employee."
good,"The work environment was always positive, very few hectic days."
good,Working here I learned a lot about home maintenance and improvement. It also helped with my customer service skills and helped me communicate better with customers.
good,Good place to start out after high school.  People are great to work with.  Lack of good management skills in dealing with problems associated with safety.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. Work is always performed at a high pace and sometimes stressful but in general it is satisfactory. The benefits are great but costly if you are at the lower spectrum of the salary scale.
good,I enjoy working here. Management tries to do the best they can to work with their employees. Home Depot has been a part time Job of mine for nearly 10 years and they have worked with me with short schedule changes because of my primary job on more than one occasion.
good,A very enjoyable workplace. Management was respectful and available. Safety was always a key element. Customers were for the most part a pleasure to deal with. Shiftwork could be challenging.
good,"I would have continued to love this job except for I could not get enough hours to support myself although they promised continuously to up my number of hours. Sometimes I worked 12 - 15 hrs a week, but rarely more than 25 - 30. I needed full time, but after over a year of promises I had to look elsewhere."
good,"Good People, Good Company. For me I was only part time and they didn't have any full time opportunities that were at the pay rate I was looking for at the time."
good,"It was good work environment. I don't want to review this because I'm not sure why it's required. However, I do not bash any company I've ever worked for and won't."
good,"Management was great at Home Depot Mishawaka with a few quirks here and there, but who doesn't have those quirks? Work day is pretty normal and answering questions is something you must be good at if you work at a service based store such as the Home Depot"
good,"The environment is very collaborative. Many worked hand in hand to process employee requests whether it is a return, exchange, or new DIY project. Customers were always first."
good,"Gained a lot of experience by working in a difficult, but rewarding retail environment renting tools.  Tool rentals operates autonomously and requires a lot of training.  "
good,"THD is more organized than other large companies out there. "
good,"Home depot is a trap, once you are there it is hard to leave. This should not be your first option for a career, for it is very hard to advance and most of it goes off of who can brown nose the best."
good,"I liked the early hours, most people hate 5am -2 pm but I loved being done that early. The job was definitely physical, in summer time I was sweating pretty bad by my lunch break but that was actually nice because I had no time for the gym as a single mom! My main boss was great, but one manager was an absolute witch who said I was crazy and needed professional help when I was upset over literally every manager ignoring me during a really frantic and crazy rush that I handled completely alone. BUT other than that, the pay was great and if you can adapt to a warehouse environment, you'll be surprised to how fun it is."
good,"Excellent customer service, and provides great benefits. The company is geared towards building the communities they service, and believes in promoting within."
good,This is the typical retail setting. One of the best parts of the job was you didn't have a uniform just the orange home depot apron. The Lewiston location has a nice break room.
good,During the busy season there is a lot of work to do but it slows down significantly towards the end of summer and there isn't much to do. However you are still expected to be busy.
good,Transferred from the Northern division to the Southern division thinking their customer service would be impeccable being closer to Headquarters in Atlanta. Total opposite.
good,You have to work to prove yourself to get a full time position. They hire on part time only. Once you're full time then you begin to feel like you are more part of a team.
good,"customer service  helping people with their projects, store appearance mainly locating products that customers need or need more information to make the best choices."
good,"Home depot is a great opportunity for those looking for a summer job or even those looking for a full time long term position. The team dynamic is very personable, and it definitely makes going to work every day more exciting!"
good,The Home Depot was a great experience for a first job had some fun with coworkers just hours and pay should be fixed but over all good place to work for a first time.
good,"It isn't a very hard job, once you get the hang of it, you're good on your own. Management is very understanding. Everyone is very friendly and helpful."
good,the most enjoyable part about working the home depot is the people and customers that you see and talk to everyday staff and management is very supportive
good,good company good benefits and decent pay based on experience. work life balance is tuff as hours are long and very demanding of its managers. Still for retail its one of the better companies around.
good,"No culture very little diversity, a little management that tries to intimidate staff or sets employees up to fail. I’m sure the original CEO would be in disbelief of how his or the company’s vision and mission statement is on display at this location"
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo es que siendo montacarguista tengas que buscar en todo el cedis quien te pueda prestar un equipo, porque no hay"
good,"The consistency and organization were strong, but there was not enough focus on employees. It's important to let people know they make a difference. The work environment was somewhat dirty but not unsanitary."
good,working at Home Depot was enjoyable but it is best to know your math when it comes to measuring windows or carpet.  Some days it could be stressful when there isnt enough salespeople on the floor
good,When I started working at The Home Depot I always looked forward going into work. I enjoyed most of my fellow colleagues. You had the chance to move to a different department throughout the months. The store manager that used to be there was fun and always had a smile on his face. Then things changed after a year unfortunately.
good,"Typical day would to check schedules, counsel staff about any issues, fast paced, workplace culture was comfortable, learned new skills and customer service improvement."
good,"Good short term job to get experience, not somewhere that you can make a career out of. Limited pay, warehouse and retail environment in one good two way experience"
good,"The store is one of the highest volume contractor stores around, which means LOTS of lumber, concrete, drywall, etc. Restocking those areas is a constant job."
good,"Customers come first which makes it very rewarding. I learned to lean on my coworkers to get the customers needs taken care of. When there is a shift change, it is crucial to hand off any critical items that need tending to."
good,"I worked the flooring department and handled blinds, carpet, tile etc. The management was excellent and constantly checked to make sure you were comfortable with your position. You had to have great customer service skills and you were constantly having to deal with customers thru out your shift. The hardest part of the position was keeping up with your isles and handling customers questions or concerns. You were bound to learn about every department because customers would ask you about any location in the store, not just your department."
good,Working at The Home Depot was fun. My co workers were helpful and welcoming. Managers were understanding. It was quick paced. Learned a lot about the store and the different products that were in stock.
good,At Home-depot the hours were not the greatest but it is better than some jobs that I have had over the last few years. working at Walmart they will put you any ware they want even if it is not part of your job.
good,"Concevoir des plans de cuisine et salle de bain"
good,"Home Depot is a great retail store to start to your career to enhance and engage towards customers."
good,"-Coaching cashiers to create a great shopping experience for customers"
good,It's a safe place to work. In ever 30 day if there no accident they will have a drawing for $300 dollars. Won that drawing two times.I was loading and Unloading trucks and train's.
good,"Home Depot in Ottawa offers a variety of locations, with stores having individual identities and character. "
good,"I had three different positions while working here at the company."
good,Job was meant part time at least 20hrs a week but then it went bad. Only cleared 8 hours for the last two weeks worked. It wasn’t enough to even pay for gas. Had to leave.
good,"There for opening electrical associate and worked till late night crew comes on.  No overtime.  learned a lot about wire types and uses for the wires home depot sell.  Management likes to be in their own little world.  I have worked with way better people.  culture there is a retail type culture. The most enjoyable part is to meet and help solve customers problems and giving advise when asked that might help."
good,The people at Home Depot were all very nice and willing to help when needed. I enjoyed working there part time. I especially enjoyed the Christmas Parties that were held for the employees and their families.
good,The company was a average company to work for in a field i enjoyed and could advance in and move up. i enjoyed most of my employees that i worked with and the diversity i liked helping others with tools and assisting anyway possible
good,"The store I worked in had an outstanding culture that was helped by the quality managers. They taught the associates along the way and shared their knowledge of the store, retail marketing, and customer service. You can actually learn to be helpful to the customer and don't get in trouble if you spend a couple extra minutes with them. "
good,Home Depot is a good place to work.  I love that it is a hands on job with constant movement.  My Co-workers are great.  I would recommend this job to friends and family.
good,Over the 6 year I have worked at The Home Depot. I have met a lot of interesting people. I have learned  lot of different areas of the business and had opportunities to grow.
good,"Good place to work if in college with no responsibilities, little room to move upward. Schedules are flexible and co-workers are fun. Management periodically has your back. Pay is not suitable, little pay for the amount of responsibilities."
good,If you're looking for a good job to start your working career with then the Home Depot is a good stepping stone. However I would only recommend 2-3 years max before looking for other career opportunities.
good,I was hired as a part time worker and that was fine with me the only thing I  did not like about this job was I was hired as a lot attendant but the managers had me in the back unloading the truck but paid me and a lot loader which was to help the people load whatever they purchased and to keep the baskets put up
good,My job cuts was to over see a staff of about 12 to 20 employees  where they where giving certain  tasks to complete  in a certain time frame with an effective  standard which was of the highest form. I Scheduled  employee's  a over see there needs
good,"I worked for a MET that was a lot of fun to be around despite the simplistic nature of the tasks. They helped the work day fly by and made coming to work sometime exciting. It did teach me about communication with customers who often did not know what they wanted. This would lead to problem solving skills to figure it out,"
good,"Good company to work for, plenty of advancements, different areas to work in, great learning experience, fun learning about the different plants and housing items"
good,"I left based on the fact that the retail manager scheduling was too erratic and was not supporting of a new family that I was just beginning. Wanted me as a number, not a person."
good,Relatively easy and friendly place to work. Staffing is tough sometimes and pay could be better. Decent benefits and health coverage. Lots of company parties.
good,This job was fast paced but it was relaxed at the same time. My only downfall with this job is the it was overnight so i wasnt movi g as fast as i neede to due to lack of sleep. I loved the work environment it was a good job just not for me.
good,The management was very nice but the teams on the overnight shift  were short staffed. I was doing the work of a whole team within 10 hours at night. There was alot of pressure to unload pallets off of trucks and have them stocked for the next business day.
good,"The bottom line is that it's a retail environment that is difficult to manage a healthy work/life balance due to shifts and scheduling.  The store culture varies by store, depending on the management in place within the store."
good,this is a good job to have. the people here are very nice and willing to train you for your position. they are very flexible with there hours as well as there sick time.
good,"Home Depot can be a very physically demanding job based on what department you are put in upon applying for the job. With any retail job dealing with customer service, customers range from very friendly to belligerent when suggesting a product. It's all dependent on overall attitude towards the customer and their situation."
good,Some of the managers were rude. And when u needed them sometimes you couldn't find them. Shifts were awkward. The job is fast paced sometimes and slow other times
good,"Used to be a good company to work for.  Little to no advancement opportunities now.  Senior leadership behind the times and are too comfortable with their positions.  "
good,I learned a lot  like how to  fixed if something when off or damage in my house instead of calling a maintenance I can do it myself save a lot of money.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot as a lot associate is hard work in the summer its non stop action, you don't look for a task, it finds you. Most of the day your outside pushing carts or loading up trucks at the lumber doors or helping a someone load up mulch or grass by the garden gates Also a big part is helping out your fellow co workers with a task that can range from a little helping hand to guiding a Fork Lift through the store to get something of the top rack."
good,"assist contractors with what they needed for their job site ensure that their ordered were fulfilled really enjoyed working with customers, management could use some work"
good,its a fun job when your younger but management is awful and inconsistent schedule sucks. i would not recommend trying to make a career out of home depot.
good,"Having a job at Home Depot as both, cashier and being on the frieight team was fun and i liked that i had to work quick. Working with my some of my fellow employees was awesome."
good,"I loved working at home depot just not enough room to grow."
good,"working at home depot in Bracebridge is fun and friendly most of the time.they really appreciate a job well done. and have a social committee that brings more fun into it"
good,Its great that people try to work together as one to complete the work faster than making it harder for one. its great that everyone get perfectly along with everyone
good,"Cashier, fun job and easy to learn, department heads are always so nice and understanding. Flexible hours and can adjust your schedule preferences easily online."
good,"Good environment. Keeps you busy physically and mentally. Great place to learn customer service. there is a lot of customer interaction. The pay could be better, but it could also be worse."
good,A typical day was busy at times but at night it got pretty slow. Opportunities for other positions were available and encouraged. Coworkers were always very helpful and friendly.
good,Co-workers are somewhat decent to work with. Customers are very glad to hear your opinions and suggestions about products and are appreciative of your help.
good,"Fast pace environment, however with the right mentality and hard work it's possible to move up within the company. Time management is crucial to be able to succeed"
good,"The best part about home depot is the friends you make with your coworkers. The work may be difficult at times and you can be treated unfairly by customers where management doesnt often take your side, but its decent pay for tough work. Scheduling would need to be consistent and the pay should be increased if you have licenses for the machines to operate."
good,great company to work for but requires a different way of advancement that can be improved. Culture is great and respect for all associates. Home Depot has developed me to get were i am and has developed skill to help me in the future.
good,The Burlington store is a very busy store. Lots too learn through the many departments. Lots of hand on training with all the managers from all the departments.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, they was understanding, friendly, and the management was just the same. I had a situation where I missed A lot of work and the management understood."
good,"Not many people in most days, busy during lunch hours. Many positions to learn. Managers are great and fun to be around. Hardest part of the day is when you are busy and there's no help around. The best part of the day is when customers thank you."
good,"Assist customers with their indoor gardening needs. Responsibilities included inventory control and product knowledge and presentation."
good,"most of my time with the home depot was positive, until the end. management never communicated and expected you to know everything. other than that there was just a bit of drama within some departments."
good,Overll was a good place to work. There is always something for you to learn. I love the fact that they give back to the community. They also help veterans. They also offer their customers to learn how to do  projects for their homes
good,Most positions are part-time. 15-20 hours a week. Very few full-time positions.  Full-time positions are held by associates and or management.  Paid only 4 hours of holiday pay.  You are expected to do more with less hours and less personnel on the floor. Can be stressful.
good,"When I started I was scheduled to work 7p.m. to 1 p.m. but everyone's hours were cut back so then I was scheduled for 9 p.m. to 1 p.m. but if a truck delivery didn't come in, no one worked that day, and some days it was a short delivery so we only worked 2 hours instead of 4"
good,My overall experience could be different than at other stores.  Department training was incomplete.  Sometimes training needs to be hands on per store .  Everything can't be trained appropriately by video tapes.
good,Great job for people who are very strong  they  have to shift morning at 6am and sexo d shift at 3.30  every  month they give us a free lunch  is very fun to work for homedepot
good,"+Fast paced when busy"
good,It was a great place for my first job but it wasn't a place I could see myself grow. I was one of the few girls to work the graveyard freight shift. It was a steady job with decent pay.
good,I learned how to deal with rude costumers. I have to meet sales goals. I learned how to be better as a sales associate or customer service associate. Associates are fun to work with.
good,"Home Depot is good for part timer, you can get flexible hours according your needs,also they give bonus twice a year according success share,"
good,Great place to work. Company has opportunities for advancement but the pay is not equivalent or enough for the cost of living in South Florida. Would recommend only if you have patience and are willing to go the extra mile in order to be promoted.
good,Home Depot is a great company. I have worked with HD for 10 years. I have met wonderful and amazing people. Home Depot also offers various classes and resources to help your career development.
good,"Management level (salaried) is not a good choice for those with families. 11+ hours a day at work, not including travel time. Group texts, while at home, that require your attention. 6 or more workdays in a week."
good,Fast paced company with decent benefits.  Demanding work schedule with inconsistencies and long hours.  Annual base pay too low for job expectations.  Good bonus and 401k package
good,as part of a department manager it is my responsibility that all aspects of the dept is run smoothly and shrink plans are completed and associates are completing there daily assignments in keeping all shelves stocked and shoppable for the customer.
good,"The job allowed me to have a work/life balance working part-time to take care of needs of my elderly parents."
good,Anyone would like it . Especially if you are a people person. We were responsible if customers didn’t sign up for their credit cards . We got discipline or fired . I feel that’s not fair because it’s outside of our control.
good,Company is great you don’t have many companies that give their employees benefits like they do that you don’t have to paid a lot for. Fast paced place where there is always something to do.
good,Working at The Home Depot is a great foot in the corporate world. You get a chance to meet awesome people and learn about Home improvement and contracting.
good,the most that I enjoyed was being able to go to work and be able to see coworkers that I got along with. management had to be more involved with there departments
good,"A good part time job. Learned different type of skills."
good,It's ok but they do need to accept workers that are willing to train for other spots. Need to have more lot associates on weekends (especially on Saturdays).
good,"I enjoy what I do here, as my shifts go by fast.  However, some of the management team, do not not correctly handle problems."
good,I never know how my shift on any given day is going to go until I clock in to work and am able to look through my to-do list. One of the important parts about this position (Back Office Associate) that I have learned is organization.
good,Felt that they did not support their employees. When I was a head cashier my management above me were not there for my team. They seemed too busy to take the time to support us.
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, the people, the management, etc. It wasn't an easy job, but it was a good one! If I didn't relocate I'd still be there! They were a bit strict, but fair. Had a few sexual misconduct issues with management that they swept under the rug, even after the man admitted he grouped me. This ultimately led me to my departure. The work isn't too hard as most warehouses, but the hours were long some days. Overall, they worked well as a team to get the job done!"
good,Good entry level job in a busy environment. The company was nice in that they were willing to work with you on a schedule that best for your life. Management was helpful and professional.
good,if you like to help others in your community its a great place to work. Has a lot of benefits for those who are less fortunate and those who just simply need a job.
good,"Typically, I clock in and report to the front end for my shift.  I am given an assignment:  log on to a register, or go relieve another associate for break or lunch.  "
good,"After reading what others said, i agree with the fact that you negotiate schedules due to family obligations and if management changes they dont respect previous arraingments.  Also, even if you do make arraingments for certain days you cant work they really dont care.  They schedule you anyway and lrave you to find someone to cover that shift.  Once i had to take my mom to a outpatient surgery, i got someone to cover and they called me because i wasnt there and i explained and they made me go in because they had the replacement associate to work in a different department."
good,You have to like what you do really strong in customer service. like any job it has its good and bad days. one of the best is the kids workshop  they do very well.
good,This company is a decent company except for the fact that only getting paid 9$ an hour for an entry level position working 20 hours a week isnt enough to support anyone on.
good,Fun and casual atmosphere helping customers and employees. I looked forward to going to work every day. Lots of camaraderie.  My job was eliminated and I was able to apply for another position in the company and was selected. It was a lateral move and my pay remained the same.  I only left when the assistant store manager from a different store was reprimanded and forced to work at my store thereby taking my hours and moving me to the closing shift that was not conducive to my life balance.
good,"The management was pretty cut-throat. The coworkers were fun but the management is too strict, and only based on numbers from a survey to  see how their cashiers work. I got written up for my numbers not being where they needed to be and not given a chance to explain myself."
good,"Cool place to work. Bad pay though, and rarely got more than 16 hours a week. Overall the people are pretty cool, so that isn't too bad. Just wish there were more hours to give."
good,The people here are great to work with but we have a new HR person who doesn't listen to the employees and is changing schedules that are not working for some employees including myself.
good,"8  hour shift. reset product as needed. organized shelves, worked with customers. paid holidays, mon. to Friday shift. overtime when available. great team work."
good,Minimum opportunity to advance or increase earnings.  My experience was the graveyard shift so it was difficult to adjust to the hours.  The team leader was a great guy.
good,Home Depot is a home and hardware store . Hours a re flexible if your lokkkg to seasonal or part time work . Only two shifts available unless your working fright .
good,"a fun and relaxed work environment. good management that is willing to hear you out and work with you and your needs."
good,fast pace work environment must be able to deal with the elements of warehouse work lots of bending and pulling merchandise thru the warehouse. must be able to meet your production goals for the day moving fast and safely thru out the day
good,I was hired as a Millwork specialist to work by designing windows and doors for contractors and customers. I also performed inventory cases as well by ordering stock for the shelves. I became the manager of the department which required me to make schedules and work with other department to improve the overall store.
good,"Working for Home Depot has it's good and bad sides like every job Generally speaking you get what you put into it. You will not last long if you come to work with an expectation that it will be easy."
good,"I like working at the Home Depot. But I have a hard time stocking shelves because my arms are short and I'm not very strong. "
good,"This is a great place to work, if your looking for only part time work it is available, also full time.  The company is a like an extended family, they have a homer Fund if your in need of financial help, and they have perks for employees who do well, and give rewards.  This is a great place to work for."
good,I liked my positions there and the pay was very satisfactory.  My managers were good and I got along well with all of the other employees.  I left only because I had my daughter and wanted to stay home with her until she could start preschool.
good,"They take the time to really know you, they are very flexible to students. I learned to have patience, and care for costumers. Costumers come first is invoked a lot"
good,"It was a great job for building experience. I liked working here, but the manager and one of the ASM were very catty. Also, they were very unprofessional and unreasonable."
good,Home depot was the first real company that I had the pleasure of worked for. I taught me a lot about time management and building lasting relationships with my co-workers.
good,I love working for Home Depot but I wish we could have fulltime. Overall its not the fault of the company. but those of us who work hard should be rewarded w fulltime
good,This is a good place to work. Everyone is very nice all the managers and customers. The pay is reasonable. They do offer overtime sometimes. All the position are part time till a full time position comes.
good,It was a good place to work and I got certified as a fork lift driver there.  It was a good experience but I needed more hours/compensation. Also again the hours were not the same every week.  It was a difficult schedule.
good,at the home depot on a typical day you can look forward to little to no communication between mangers and employees. can also be held to high standards as soon as you step foot in the door
good,"Flexible part-time schedule, good working with relationship with co-workers, supervisors were very helpful and job training was excellent. Lots of variety with regards to departments to work in."
good,I liked this job it was a relaxed but nice job sometimes it's faster pace but that gives you lots to do. The management wasent consistent. It's also a competitive environment for sure.
good,Home Depot at Sun Set Hills has Sales Associate Department.  The employees are very knowledgeable and have great customer service.  Home Depot offers opportunities to make a successful career.
good,A typical day there was usually quick paced. Not to much down time except for in the mornings and at night. Management is very friendly and they work with you when you are in need of anything. Working at The Home Depot is a good job for everyone. Whether it is your first job or it's your last job. It has a wonderful work friendly environment and just a joy to be there.
good,I really didnt get enough hours or day to work.I needed something more and want to change to fulltime. I loved working as a cashier and loved helping customers.
good,"Solid, well known company which Is nice to work for. Not a whole lot of opportunity to advance. They offer excellent benefits 401k and stock purchase options."
good,"Knowledge on products is a good thing to know and customer service is a must, must be able to work on computers and lift at least 40 lbs., and some benefits and offered."
good,"For the most part, I enjoy working for Home Depot.  Its what you make out of it.  They hardly pay you anything.  Most customers are pleasant however working the customer service desk is stressful.  Customers get nasty.  Training is done all on the computer."
good,"Lots of moving parts at Home Depot. You need to be action oriented and nimble to be successful at Home Depot. "
good,Corporate culture. Call center was treated slightly different. Referred to as the hourly workers. Onsite gym and cafeteria made things convenient. Call center no longer in that building so now those perks are gone.
good,I would recommend this job to others. They have great benefits and great pay and room for advancement. The only thing I did not like the over night hours.
good,"Not something I would enjoy long term, not very flexible with hours, sometimes younger employees are not treated the same as elder employees, But for a student in high school it could be a good part time job"
good,"In a typical work day at Home Depot Tool Rental I will rent to customers, turn the tools, put tags back on them, put them up, & change chains on chainsaws. I have learned why some of our tools quit working & can tell customers what it could be before they put it in the system. I even learned how to determine what tool to rent to a customer."
good,I would have not left if they did not mess with my hours. I was on a dedicated shift. Then one day out of the blue said they were going to put me on a rotating shift.
good,"There wasn't anything that was troubling there. I enjoyed working with the public and the fast paced work days. I like hard work, I don't like working somewhere and not having anything to do."
good,Overall I like the environment at Home Depot. Management and associates  our support of both at the company and outside of business. Management from the top down is very supportive and encouraging. They were also flexible at times when I needed to adjust my shift time. They were also very supportive for folks at Home Depot they were going through a rough time whether it was emotional financial or physical.
good,"its okay, can be better, management doesnt take initiative at times. work is stressful, they always want you to do something even if its not your job to do so."
good,This company is very committed to its employees. They love to say they bleed orange and they really kind of do. Very interesting place to work and very happy too.
good,"The job was pretty easy. Good for a self starter who likes people. I enjoyed the hands on work the most. And made some cool new work friends."
good,It is great for people looking for a part time position. It will take a lot of time and effort to reach a wage that would support a person on their own.
good,Home Depot is just to slow and bored but the benefits and management are great. They have events for us when we get our bonus checks with food and music.
good,"Really, it depends on the store and ""its"" culture. I've heard of stores that really sucks to work at and some (like mine) that is really great! I'd disagree. Depending on your role, you may be doing a lot more or less than work then your coworkers."
good,A great place to work until you encounter a ride customer. Home depot needs to get rid of the customer is always right slogan...more like the customer's always rude.
good,Although I grow up at home depot I ventured to other companies for financial growth. Home depot does not take well to those who have left to competitors.
good,"i worked overnight, it was not for me personally, i had ok pay, the work was sometimes too much for the pay i received, managers were good to work with"
good,It’s a retail store some aspects of your he job can be difficult for some but if your willing to work it can be quite easy. Customer service is priority.
good,"After clocking you had to go straight to work, I learned a lot about the building industry while I was there."
good,"It was an opportunity to meet new people, put my best efforts forward, learn product and placement, provide a great attitude for my peers, and work overnight to allow my daytime free."
good,Can be a fun place to work when not run like the military or a prison. We have our opening and closing processes. Help customers throughout our shift. Do training courses to improve in our departments. All the pretty usual stuff.
good,i was a cashier and the pace was fast. i worked the holidays and the returns department was chaos. there is lots of stress when people exceed the number of returns.
good,I learned a lot working at the Home Depot Like how to be a part of a team and how to help motivate the team  to do the best that we can.the atmosphere with management was not the greatest  but overall I had a pretty good experience working there
good,"HD is a good company with room to advance.  You won't make much, but you will get good benefits and usually a decent work environment.  "
good,"A pretty nice place to work however your advancement can be limited or subject to the whim of others. Most customers are great to work with, then there are the rest of them."
good,Home Depot has been a good stable job for me.  It has worked with my full time job schedule and days I needed off.  The raises have always been good and fair.
good,"I got the chance to work and visit all stores within the district. Every store is different it all depends on your supervisors/Manager and how they run things. Definitely can move up if you are willing to put in the effort and learn, they depend on people that have more knowledge because you can cover for call outs or understaffed days. Also experienced a lot of favoritism around the store, some associates can get away with doing little to nothing (favorites/part-time associates) and experienced associates can often get stuck making up for it. That's in some stores more than others. Again it all depends on how supervisors run your assigned department. You can definitely make it here if you talk to the right people. I enjoyed it for the most part."
good,Mangement was okay but overall you're on your feet all day helping customers find the needed items and helping with check out. Shifts can get tedious if not prepared.
good,"give back to employees, flexible hours.  Home Depot is always willing to educate management.  Train on new company polices and follow up on existing to assure you are informed"
good,"Salaried management position offers long, inconsistent hours, and politics that weigh in heavily. Job stability is good with a large number of stores across the United States."
good,The Home Depot is an Amazing Company to work for....in whole....but it truly depends on the location!! A well run location helped me become all that i could dream of with the company but when i transferred; it was nothing of the sort and trashy management. Feel them out for yourself. Good luck!
good,"They have good benefits.  I worked graveyard shift so it was a little different work environment.  Overall good company to work for.  Enjoyed my experience there."
good,The company culture is amazing at the corporate level but it is not effectively translated to individual stores. Accountability is lacking greatly but a recent management change will hopefully change that.
good,"the MET position was fun. Did floor and planagrams reset, worked as a team, "
good,"Buena empresa cuidan al asociado, ambiente de trabajo agradable, seguridad para el cliente y asociados, aprendes de sus valores para tu vida diaria laboral y personal, te capacitan, si hay oportunidad de crecimiento solo que a  veces las oportunidades de crecer son muy pocas y tardias, el aumento por promoción es muy bajo"
good,"Working at the home depot can be fast pace, its competitive among the employees and from store to store. the days can be long at times. but it goes by fast if you stay busy. there is always something to do."
good,They are excellent with dealing with employees with personal issues. They have helped me by working with me during some recent medical issues. Management was extremely helpful.
good,Between helping customers to preparing the department for the next workday this job can be demanding. You can really learn some interesting home development ideas.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot. The people are very nice, the hours were good and flexible to my schedule. The management wasn't the greatest, tended to show a lot of favoritism."
good,"Good company to work for but it has its flaws. No ac during the summer, managers will not take ownership nor back you up even when following the polices. They make you look like an idiot in front of customers."
good,"My normal day as a salary manager always begins with a walk around entire store assess any particular departments that need to be addressed. Then i look at schedules see where i might be short staffed and address that. After we open i deal with customer issues, refund issues, contractor issues, employee issues, operational issues, and even any merchandising issues. As a salary manager we are also in charge in holding our people accountable, and also giving them praise when need be. We also make our schedules for us and our associates.At the end of my shift I end it with a final walk and still address what needs to be addressed. ASM's pretty much do it all at The Home Depot."
good,I learnt so much from my boos and co wokers and it was very nice experince working with alot of people Learning new things and satefly rules  and regulation in the environment i am working.
good,"Busy on weekends, constantly assisting customers and employees, exposed to hot/cold elements, More work for less pay, Management need improvement on communication."
good,"As a part time order fulfillment associate you are responsible picking customer online orders within 2 hours of receipt of order, while also picking delivery orders to be delivered via flat bed, box trucks and vans. The delivery orders must be ready to be transported when these trucks arrive at the store. The trucks are also load by the associate using fork lifts."
good,It was fun to get to interact with customers and coworkers. People are generally very nice and there is a good company culture here. There are also opportunities for frequent raises and promotions if you perform well. The only bad thing is that like many other large retailers they want you to push those ridiculous credit cards on customers even though they are not really beneficial for customers.
good,Clock into work pick up assignments for the day. Learned to be organized and helpful . The workplace culture is fast pace. Enjoyed all the team players.
good,"I was the only individual in the department who could lift heavy item and wasnt given help when I asked management. "
good,Home Depot has a bad reputation but if you work hard you can move up. The biggest problem I had was lazy people who didn't want to work. They also don't have enough people per department. There were times when I would be watching after 3 departments. They give raises every year but you were lucky if you got 50 cents. Most associates got 25-30 cent raises.
good,Great place to work. Kind management and associates. The hours are given to those who want them and you will rarely be denied them. Lot of walking around so wear comfortable shoes.
good,is  a fun job an d they make  you fell like  a familly and   give  you rewards  for  doing you best  also competitive  and  helfull if  you are  going through bad  situation
good,"Work was pretty easy, the only bad things about the job are the lazy coworkers and rude customers. Coworkers would call in sick frequently, so shifts would have to be worked alone sometimes. Customers expect to items right away, so they lose patients if you have to get a lift truck because it takes time."
good,they have a fixed schedule offer over time and really do a lot with coaching employees. the job is stable and easy once you get the hang of it but its repetitive.
good,"The Home Depot is a decent company to work for. Good benefits and good culture. Only problem is the lack of advancement and raises are minimal, very minimal."
good,"Made a lot of good friends and saw a good portion of the US and Canada working for HD. As with any company, there are good leaders and there are poor ones. In most cases you can out last the poor ones by living the values and doing a good job. Overall great company."
good,I would have stayed if I hadn't felt like I was being discriminated against.  My time there was alright with some of my co-workers but overall management was lacking.
good,"Decent place to work, there’s the chance to love on yo with good work and the ability to gain pay raises every 6months to a year. The job pace is steady, and they provide great benefits for employees."
good,Poor management in some departments. Not paid enough for what the amount of work have to do. Hours aren’t good. Does offer 401k and stock plan which is only real benefit.
good,"the customers were the most enjoyable part of my day. it makes you feel good to know that people come in there looking for you to assist them because you are kind, friendly and always wearing a smile that they want to see. And being appreciated is the greatest feeling"
good,If you want to work somewhere that you can be varied in tasks this is a place for you. The people are very friendly and understanding. The hours are reasonable and the wages are good.
good,"When I arrived at work I would already be scheduled to work certain hours in a specific department, usually my home department.  But I never could be sure what I would actually be doing because if the plants needed watering, or cashiers called out sick, or special holiday jobs for any department needed to be completed (and started), I could easily end up working anywhere in the store for my whole shift and not spend one minute in my home department where I was scheduled and I already knew we had work that needed to be done by me but I couldn't do it because I was working elsewhere.  A lot of computer video training occurred, but no actual on the floor training ever happened.  You had to figure out your new job yourself because no one can remember what actually was on those videos.  I enjoyed the freedom each employee was given to give discounts to customers without asking permission."
good,The company is overall great because they offer so many benefits to even the part time employees. As long as I stayed to myself and worked hard Home Depot was an nice place to work. Now I'm looking into working for the Corporate Office.
good,Good place to work. Especially starting out in the real world. Learned a lot about home living. But management could take care of the workers better especially when dealing with bad customers
good,"but the manager was a d head and made me not want to work there anymore.  i think it was a ginger thing, but what do i know.  all i know is they have no soul and often eat others."
good,"They’re a great company to work for, so good to employees. The only negative thing I could say is they don’t often offer full time, which would be better pay wise but still overall great company,"
good,"There was not a ""work together as a team"" mentality. As i new hire I felt I did not get enough training before working on my own.  Not a great way to start a job"
good,Le deberian de dar el mismo interés a todos los emoleados. No son igualitarios teniendo un nivel superior
good,"Overall the culture of home depot is great. People there are generally friendly and are willing to help one another out. Work pace is fast and very demanding. At times it feels like you have no room to catch a breath as you have a work list on top of customers asking questions. It all depends on how management assesses these situations. If done well, these stressful situations can be managed but if management does not handle the situation well it often feels like you are stuck alone on an island to fend for yourself."
good,very co-operative with my schedule while husband was sick before he passed very flexible when i needed transferred to and from florida and kept my full time status
good,"Management was very involved in the day to day goings on. They were very easy to talk to, and they were very focused on helping you expand your career within the company."
good,"I started at The Home Depot as a part-time employee, Cashier. I loved working there interacting with the customers, I then was promoted to the Service Desk. And then offered a full-time position. I enjoyed that as well. Over the years as an Home Depot employee I received multiple several excellent Customer Service badges, Employee of the moth etc. Great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Silver Spring Home Depot. The people were friendly, and never minded teaching you something new. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you're standing on a concrete floor which can cause pain when you're first getting used to it."
good,"I found it a great place to start working, my co-workers were nice to work with and my supervisors and managers gave their best, however I'm looking forward to gain experience in things that align more with my career choice which is criminal justice."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job would have been me cutting lumber for customers and getting to know them. Management was very understanding and helpful.
good,I love working at Home Depot and it’s an great job to have and to make as an career . The customers that came in that door was awesome they made you feel like you posed of been at work everyday .
good,Home Depot is exactly as it seems.  More enjoyable if you know about the products they sell and carry.  Good with training and promotion in job.  Would have stayed if pay was better.
good,"I learned a lot working there. I was able to use my personal experience. I worked in the plumbing department selling all types of plumbing equipment. Sprinklers, water heaters PVC etc."
good,"Home Depot is a very friendly environment to work in.They give at least two weeks of training and will try to give you as much time as you need to get comfortable with the job. In my experience the co-workers are continuously assisting each other to help get jobs done efficiently and with care;however, the management was less likely to help with small needs and would tend to neglect some employees leading to mistakes which may have been avoided if addressed earlier (however, it is easy for me criticize as I was not in their position)."
good,"If you are looking for a place in retail or customer service, The Home Depot is not a bad place to work. They treat their employees relatively fairly and the customers are the worst part."
good,"Your day will go fast, as with most companies they tend to stay under staffed. However, it is a good place to work. The compensation is not at the level of the expectations of the work load."
good,"great place for a young person to learn, grow, and be educated.  Can advance with hard work. Decent starting pay, expensive health insurance for a company of that size."
good,I worked overnight. The job was slow paced but beneficial. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Management had their ups and downs regarding other people making complaints about promotions.
good,"Was a good place to land and enhance my experience, grateful for my colleagues, friends and ability to hone my previous academic experience in IT security field"
good,"Chaque jour, on travaille sur les 4 volets nécessaire du commerce du détaille: RH-SERVICE-OPÉRATION- VENTE"
good,"This job entailed a lot of physical unloading of heavy merchandise.  It was enjoyable, but the opportunity for advancement was limited. Management was largely supportive."
good,I've moved onand it's in my rear-viewmirror. i have a good position at the Hilton Hotel and i look forward to my next promotion.I don't have any axe to grind or desire to throw anyone under the bus
good,"For the most part, I enjoy working here but I would not want to make it a lifelong career.  It is tough to get full time. It is a typical retail job. The customers overall are pleasant to deal with.  Management is willing to work with you on issues for the most part.  The pay is a little above minimum wage which is nice. They give you options for stocks and 401k."
good,This was my absolute favorite job ever. i worked with an amazing  team of co workers and learned so much. the managers that run the store are some of the worst i have ever come across. they have no sense of family or team.
good,great place to work meet great friends and great customers as well.Some of the management to not help me grow as a great supervisor poor asm could no.
good,"The five years that I worked for Home Depot I was Certified in Flooring, Garden, Electrical, Plumbing, Hardware and as a cashier. We worked closely with Contractors and the general public."
good,Great benefits. I was lucky enough to not have split shifts. It was nice to be the ones to make the store look great for customers. Taking out the old and bringing in the new always felt fresh.
good,Management understands work life balance is. Career advancement is challenging. Coworkers are supportive. The company is family oriented. Management believes in diverse skills sets.
good,"Had a great 6 years at Home Depot, entire management team was changed and that meant my time was up. Would do it again though! Great benefits and the associates there are awesome!"
good,"THD has tremendous senior leadership.  They are a huge company at $100 Billion in sales and approximately 400,000 associates. "
good,"No need, it was a decent place to work even though the management could use a little work. Hours are pretty set in stone as well, had a hard time getting them to help work around personal life issues."
good,Nice place to work for.  Enjoyed my time at the home depot for many years.  sales was the most enjoyable part of my job.  the most difficult was hiring qualified part time help.
good,Its been pleasure working with an organization. I got challenging environment and opportunities to learn. It is difficult to maintain balance between work and personal life but it overall a comfortable place to work.
good,Faced passed work placed. To fast past without thinking of the customer. Upper managers tried to increase money numbers without helping current customers. The store thinks only of proffits and not employees.
good,A great place to build longtime customer relations. Must be available to do shifts. Variable scheduled hours. Weekend work. Ability to move between departments is a great learning experience.
good,"It was overall okay work experience, however they do pick and choose their favourites. Management, sometimes needs another checking in to not all managers are meant to be managers."
good,They worked great with my availability. They have a very diverse work environment that makes working there very comfortable and they teach great customer service skills.
good,"Great place to work, and really engage with your customers. I learned the true meaning of customer service. And really have that one on one with customer and build relationships forever."
good,"Great place to start off for first time job.They provide a couch to new employees who help them get training completed, walks around store to meet and great and answer an questions they may have.Great part time to pay off credit cards or make a career."
good,"The spirit is shown very clearly not only to the customer but among the associate. We care for each other, help each other out in everyday task and constantly learning from one another"
good,Great name recognition. Not competitive on pricing. Poor lead generation. Has definite silos that imped ability to succeed. Expected better work environment.
good,"At The Home Depot, all are treated very respectfully. The culture is very good and enjoyable. My day at the Home Depot starts with full energy to work on pending and resolve the issues. I have learnt many different methods of working, as have many managers are changed while I was on the same role. Workplace culture very respectful. The hardest part of the job, is sometimes transactions are stuck due to technical and IT issues. Clients and rendering them the best customer service by resolving their problems with the happy solutions are my most enjoyable part of the job. It would be more better, if company focus on internal hiring than the out sourcing and external candidates."
good,"I worked part time for maybe 6 weeks in the hardware/tool department it was fun helping customers with their projects. "
good,"Not a bad place to work. Management was decent. Hours were okay, just did not adjust my hours with school, which they said they would do when I was getting hired."
good,"Great place to work and build up, be strong because managers wont be there for you or even know how to do the job you yourself is doing and that's sad."
good,Learned a lot of DIY stuff from painting to flooring. I liked learning about those things to help customers. I also liked the management at the store I worked for.
good,Not much room for growth and the pay was not the best. Great working environment and great coworkers. Not the best scheduling. But it was a nice place if looking to make extra income.
good,its an okay job if you are part-time or retired. not for hard workers or people who want money. management could be better. can be enjoyable if you lack goals
good,"No union shop so you can get terminated on the spot. Some of the Supervisors were great to work with, Others you learned to stay clear from. Co-workers were always helpful."
good,"Fast -paced, chaotic, unfair job. Enjoyed coworkers but head cashiers are horrible. Management is mediocre and they only care about numbers and credit applications. No positive work ethic ever since new management took over."
good,This job is okay if you love houses. The mangers there are great and the the pay is great. The shifts are very long like 3-11 and 2-11. your always busy
good,I enjoyed working there but when I was involved in an incident the way it was handled really ticked me off! I was offered full-time multiple times. Many opportunities here
good,Worked here and you can easily get stuck at a job like this. Sometimes your able to move up the ranks. No benefits for cashiers when I worked there either.
good,"Most people who work there have been there for multiple years, making a nice workplace culture. There's a lot of hands on customer service experience to be had."
good,"I loved the people, but the management was lacking. The hours were ok, however I wish I would have had more opportunity to progress. The management made it hard to progress."
good,I learned many great skills which includes all of the machinery. I really enjoyed helping customers. The workplace here is more like a family. They treat you like you are part of the team even when you just start.
good,I was able to learn customer service through cashier experience and special ordering customer service as a desk associate. They worked with my school schedule and gave flexible hours.
good,Enjoy working with the general public. Have learned new skills with various computer applications. Like problem solving and helping customers. The hardest part of the job is handing the volume of customers with limited staff.
good,"Some days are busier than other but when it gets busy, its very busy. Customers aren't always the best but you learn to deal with it and you learn tactics for how to handle difficult customers."
good,"good place to work, very flexible, great co workers, and a fun environment, not so good on salary and not so good benefits but it was a good first job to go back to after moving here"
good,If you are an energetic and responsible individual with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn new tasks you can grow with this company. It's a good company for starting or finishing a career.
good,Old management were resigning. & new management came in with new experience. had to do with lack of communication. never a manger around when needed assistance.
good,"My was very good in contacting potential hires for phone interview very relaxed environment. I was work on assignment for Dom Patci Management Solutions Temp agency, at Home Depot Human Resource dept.."
good,Great place to work. Pay sucks unless you're in management. Get very few holidays off. Working as a PASA is the best gig. Guaranteed schedule Monday-Friday.
good,a typical day at work as a cashier is so much fun and the people were very friendly and when u do get an upset person remember the customer is always right  so you have to do whatever it take to satisfy the customer  i learned how to move at a fast pace it is a challange but i love a challange   the hardest part of my job  lets see there really wasnt nothing hard about this job and the most enjoyable part of working at that job would be everything co workers was the best part
good,It was a very productive enviornment. I enjoyed the culture. I worked for a third party company so there was no room for advancement or pay increase. I would have loved to work for home depot directly.
good,"A well-established work environment, with excellent managing communication skills with Home Depot associates and bringing great customer service to their customers."
good,"As a lot associate you stay extremely busy, between someone grabbing you for a loadout, and the radio calling for you to do another one, across the whole store. Little to no overlap between lot associates, so often you're looked as the only person to do most. But, it keeps you in shape and management wasn't difficult."
good,stock product in accurate and timely fashion. use in store location device. use forklift to put pallets of overstock merchandise into overhead racking in a safe manner.
good,I got the job at The Home Depot as an entry to my education. I'm currently an architectural student. The best discussion I made! I made great friends and learned alot about my future industry. I definitely recommend working here especially if you are a student like me in anything architecture/construction related.
good,"I truly loved my job at Home Depot.  I was hired for 10-20 hours per week, which was perfect as I already had a fulltime job too. Working in the cash office in the back room, I wasn't bothered by anyone, I could work at my own pace, as long as everything was done by the end of the night. If the store was busy, I was busy. Cashiers would call back if they needed more cash, or more change, or if they had an excessive amount of cash in their drawer for me to pick up. If it was a slow day, my work was often done and then I would have to occupy myself or wait until I was needed by the front end.  I worked 1 weeknight and all day on Sunday."
good,"They offer a lot of training if you want to be a Kitchen Designer. You don't have to have prior experience, which is why the pay isn't great. It is nice helping people's dreams come true when redoing a kitchen."
good,This is a good job for someone new to the working world or someone that is looking to find a job for a short time or to find something better the people are really nice Management is nice.The job is really easy nothing hard about it you get paid every two weeks that is a pain but a good place to work.
good,I have learned a lot. I have the skills to be a successful HR representative. Everyone is treated like family. I really enjoy working for this company.
good,If you are looking for a part time job I would recommend this place. I would only recommend for full time if you are interested in a manager position.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work everyday, I look for new product so I can sell it, Management wasn't good, they would hire a person for supervisor with no experiment, I have a lot of experiments, but they never hire me they say I know to much. I worked all departments, there was not anything hard about the job. the most enjoyable part of my job was to help the customers found what they need ."
good,"As a freight associate, I start out in the Receiving department of the store. I assist a team in unloading trucks, organizing merchandise for the various departments throughout the store, and work my way around the entire retail facility. My objectives are to maintain an organized shopping environment, and ensure customers are able to easily access the numerous types of home-improvement products that The Home Depot has to offer."
good,Home Depot has been a gret place to work over the last few years. My coworkers and customers has made the job  pleasurable experience and i would recommend this company to my closest friends.
good,Home Depot was an equal opportunity employer with good benefits. 
good,The work environment and company culture was enjoyable but the management culture was more towards helping those whom benefitted them in developing ( ie step on whom you can to move up) they also tend to create and environment of always working understaffed and abuse those whom work hard gaining very little to compensate
good,"The merchandising execution teams have a wide variety of work that they perform.  Display set up, general service of the bays in stores that are shopped by customers."
good,"super busy environment and the customers are hard to deal with.  Lots of pro customers and elderly people.   The employees makes it a fun atmosphere, otherwise it would be a tough place to work."
good,It's a great entry level job with room to move up. The pay is alright and the workers are helpful and friendly. They work with a school schedule and are very accommodating with hours.
good,"I loved the hours and not having to work on weekends.  Downfall was not enough organization.  The projects were always unclear and the organization of incoming supplies/fixtures was comical.  There wasn't any coordination between receiving and the merchandising team.  The manager was not any help in getting issues resolved and was always trying to stir up trouble between the associates. "
good,liked it wanted to move up was never allowed the company did offer so many tbings as benefits. the managers could have colaborated more with associates to help them advance if they want to
good,"Nothing at this time. I do not wish to comment on my past employer for reasons of my own. I will say that overall, Home Depot is a great place to work. Just depends on the store you get into and the culture within it."
good,A quick pace job that expects a lot from you while assisting customers and getting stuff done while working alone. Would be easier if had extra coverage.
good,"A DIY environment that requires broad knowledge of a variety of construction and repair tasks to effectively assist customers in making their home/work projects a success. While some training is provided, most knowledge is derived from previous personal experience and especially from discussing project details with customers (especially trade workers). Enjoyable coworkers, low stress environment."
good,"Great culture. Lots of smart motivated people. Challenging, meaningful work. Gym and daycare. Significant stock compensation through grants and ESPP!!"
good,"Home Depot has been a great company, but I need a FT position able to help me pay off school loans. My degree is in a different area, thus I'm looking for something in government where my political science degree and decades of business management experience, plus my business degree could prove useful."
good,It was normally quiet and I was on my own early in the morning. The heat could get really bad at times. I learned about different plants. Management was good. The other employees would great you but kept to their areas. The hardest part was how some of the tools I needed to do my job would be damaged and wouldn't get fixed. But I did enjoy the sun rises.
good,"I love working at home Depot because they offer a flexible schedule. "
good,"Strong positive culture, very much on company values.  I worked at headquarters, also known as Store Support and we supported the needs of the store and field associates.  Change is constant in this very fast pace environment.  Challenges with work/life balance, but benefits are good."
good,"Night shift is often on the margin in this company, but my team and me managed to overcome that... "
good,"Home Depot is a good ""starter job"", for those who want to utilize the information gained through day to day roles throughout the store. Then taking those skills and knowledge with you to other places in life."
good,Sales based operation focusing on customer satisfaction and team work. Designers needed to have full knowledge of store to assist in many other departments to cover manpower needs.
good,"Management worked with CSA  and very knowledgeable.   Most CSA'S really wanted to help new hires succeed at Home Depot,  only 3 in the entire store were not respectful with teaching others. Customers appreciated our help and if we were able to help you had return customers looking just for you.  Training before hitting the sales floor.  Always allows CSA'S to cross training in other departments."
good,"Interacting with the customers and other employees is very rewarding, but management of orders and pulling down merchandise off the risers is very uncoordinated. People would also ""disappear"" quietly into the break room and spend unnecessary amounts of time their when not allowed to. Very frustrating during busy power hours."
good,Advanced my skills and moved upward into Logistics Manager position.  There are many departments at the Home Depot and a person gains exposure to a lot of different specialties.  One can move to what interests them.
good,Good company with many chances to learn.  Home Depot is a large corporation and has many different departments and functions.  A person can gain exposure to many different facets of business and see what works for them.
good,Home Depot was a good place to work and taught me a lot of things I would of never imaged I would learn about home improvement. The workplace culture was stressful at times. You dealt with home owners and contractors. The best part of the job was giving back to the communities.
good,NA as I worked as Contractor typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job most enjyaoble part of the job
good,"The company is not the same now as when I left. When I left, managers were required to work 50+ hours a week with single days off. Weekends off were rare, or non-existent, especially during spring through fall. Family life definitely suffered."
good,"Customer service was the highest priority. As a do-it-yourself type of store, the atmosphere provided you with ample opportunity to cultivate an employee customer relationships which is very self satisfying to both you and your customers."
good,"The Home Depot is a pretty good place to work, especially for people who need a flexible schedule. The benefits are great, however, the hourly pay isn't that great compared to Walmart. I have taken advantage of their tuition reimbursement, which is a really nice perk."
good,"I took apart 20+ pallets of freight every night and stocked the shelves as fully as possible. I had to learn how to manage overstock in a very limited amount of space. The managers were helpful and co-workers were mostly cheerful, which made for good teamwork. The hardest part of the job was trying to squeeze everything into the limited space available, and finding ways to do so, every day, was the most satisfying part of the job."
good,I was a cashier at home depot. I enjoyed helping customers and I liked the flexablility with hours but the position was temporary so it did give the 40 hours a week that I really was have wanted.
good,"Work days were 11 hours.  They were continuously providing product knowledge and you could learn about any department in the store.  The managers seem to be looking more and more for yes men.  Generally a good sense of teamwork. The most difficult part, yet most rewarding, was dealing with customer complaints.  Finding a way to make both sides feel they got a fair deal."
good,"Home depot can either be fast paced or very slow depending on the day.  Management was ok, some of the managers are hard workers, but for the most part they sit around on their phones.  Most people who work there leave after a few months so a lot of times you're working with new recruits which means that you will have to cover multiple departments.  They do offer good benefits for things like tuition reimbursement and 401k."
good,"Over the years there were a number of store managers some good some bad, the bad ones made the job streuseful the good made it fun. The company culture is great."
good,The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) manual is the global reference for shipping dangerous goods by air and the only standard recognized by airlines. Training . The 58th edition includes a proposal by the ICAO Dangerous Panel to adopt a Competency-Based Approach for dangerous goods training. See Appendix H .
good,Very friendly work place you work together and get a lot done in small amounts of time. Managers were easy to communicate with and very understanding and flexible with your schedule.
good,All depends on management. Lack of employees makes it difficult to be effective at everything. I really enjoyed working there but new management makes it very difficult for all.
good,A very fast-paced environment with friendly employees and great career advancement opportunities. Management is wonderful and daily activities can constantly be improved with active training which is offered on-site. Many great benefits to working here and perks/discounts too.
good,I worked this job while I was going thru college.It worked perfectly for what I needed it for. I had a late night schedule so I could go to school. I met a lot of cool people there but older managers all seemed burnt out.
good,"es una empresa donde se tiene un buen ambiente laboral , con las prestaciones por encima de la ley"
good,"It can be a fast paced environment, and is a mixture of warehouse and retail environment. I was able to hone my construction knowledge. Management was at times understanding of personal problems"
good,I loved working here at this  job! The people here were very helpful and gained so much from working here. The hardest part of the job was walking around to the different cashiers.
good,this company worked every day at making the customer and the associates feel important.  District managers knew your name and greeted you when they were in your store.  Managers treated people fairly.  They expected a lot and recognized your hard work.
good,"Educational environment"
good,"The hardest part would be standing there if no customers. But then you just have to find something to do not far from your register which was easy, re-organizing shelves."
good,The people you work with are some of the best you'll ever meet. Managers talk to you with respect and listen. Free food on the holidays. Opportunities to advance
good,"I love working with different  culture. My strengths  are team player and enthusiastic.  Love to create excitement to motivate the team. "
good,Learn lots of new skills I didn't think I'd ever know. Made new friends with employees and still talk to customers even though I'm no longer there!!!!!
good,"It was a good place to work. Some days it was crazy because they did not have enough employees working, however, we were able to stay strong and positive and make it through the day."
good,"nice management"
good,"I enjoyed the seasonal job at Home Depot. I learned a lot about plants, their types, the climates best suited for them, the PH level of their soil requirements, and so much more.  The only downside of the job was how very dirty it was inside and outside, as well as the communication levels of management being less communicative than needed."
good,job is not that hard it gets hard at times but over all its a easy job to do.there are busy seasons but if you like to work its not a bad gig. The hours arent that great if your a supervisor up but reg employees get set schedules.
good,"Helping customers in a retail setting, with the plus of being at the Special Services Desk, there was always something different to accomplish."
good,"Very fun to work out, always stuff to do, staff very fun, managers very good, always are willing to help and are their to help with any problems, exciting job"
good,"The job was great,pay was fair, coworkers were easy to get along with and helped when I needed it. The supervisor of the team was the complete opposite, he got let go a few months after I did."
good,"The Home Depot is a retail big box merchant.  Sales are first and foremost.  I do like their philosophy of putting customer service as their highest goal, because customers will return to a place where they can get help when they need it."
good,"typical day at work you sometimes offload trucks. i learned how to use the parlet jack and the bally-more. management wasn't that good they schedule most of my colleagues off on weekends so work was stressful during weekends. workplace culture is good."
good,"Nice facility, management was fun/interactive. Shift preference was available. Got the opportunity to learn new technology used in current warehouses."
good,"I enjoyed working for the Home Depot on the chat side, however, after coming out of training I felt you didn't have the support from you supervisor on certain problems and were left to figure them out. If they were wrong you were ""talked to""."
good,It's retail and face it you know what you are getting in to. So you a person how thinks retail will be Monday - Friday 8am to 5pm this is not a place for you.
good,"This job required a very specific skill set, however when I was hired they taught me everything I needed to know but the hours involved were very early in the morning to me."
good,"A typical day at work would include proper dress attire, strong incentive towards customer satisfaction and always meeting or exceeding the daily quota. I have learned stocking/inventory and logging skills with this Job. The management was always at-hand to aid in questions the employee base had at any time however the workplace culture was sub-par as there was a lack of interpersonal one-on-one leadership. The hardest part of the job was the constant movement of very heavy equipment/product. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in hours worked overall."
good,"enjoyed my work there . helped people fix problems . hardest part of the job is when they decide to rotate people to other department s which you have no knowledge of or desire to know about. "
good,I was employed with Home Depot many years ago. I was a happy employee working for this company. I ended up getting injured on a night shift rotation and ended up leaving because of a disability.
good,You get the to interact with many different kinds of people who are working on many different projects.  I really enjoy helping customers figure out creative solutions for their projects.
good,Good job with decent benefits. Good coworkers and good work environment. Had to work pretty much every weekend which got old after a while but did enjoy the job.
good,"As someone who takes pride in working well with customers, I found this job fun and fulfilling. I was capable of helping a wide variety of people in many different departments."
good,"Arrive to work, get ready, clock in and start my day. Walk outside to assist every customer i possible can with the biggest smile on my face. After thank them."
good,"I have kidney disease and worked part time. Corporate culture was a bit taxing. Folks I worked with were all eager and willing to learn."
good,"The Homedepot is a pretty good place to work. The work very well with school schedules and they give everyone paid vacation and sick time. The full timers get more then the part timers but that's to be expected. The Homedepot also has good benifits even for part timers. Part timers can get discounts for movies, food and cell phones. The can also get tuition re-imbursement. The biggest down side was that the customes were often rude. Also I had to work every weekend. HR was often slow to accept or decline days requested off. Cashiers were given two 15 min breaks and a lunch if they worked a full shift."
good,"Inconsistent hours, NO OVERTIME EVER (BAD CREDIT)... can be quite a drag with trying to fight for hours, and very rarely is there any role advancement or lateral movement allowed"
good,"Most of the time, job training is more customer/ co worker interaction than online or books. Great place to work if you're looking to get more knowledge on everyday life problems. Overall, it is fun to work there. Best part of the job was getting customers what they needed in a timely matter and them leaving with a little more knowledge than they came in with."
good,Home depot is a great place to start yourself in the work field. The management is very welcoming and co workers are friendly and help you in any way they can whenever you have questions.
good,"1. review appointment "
good,great place to work however people with more than 15 years at the company sort of take control there in touchable. there not talented just were able to hold onto their positions.
good,Elle m'a permis a prendre plus de responsabilité. Les personnes avec qui je travaillais étaient très gentil alors je me sentais bien.
good,"The atmosphere between associates is generally a high-school drama situation, which managers too often feed into. Not to mention a corrupt higher-management which can affect everything below in a trickle down effect."
good,I loved my job at Home Depot and wish they had not shut the warehouse down. We had new management come in and went from 7 day 24 hour a day warehouse to 5 days a week and couldn’t keep up poor management. I enjoyed working 36 hours in 3 days and having 4 days off it gave me time to spend at school while my daughter was growing up. I would have never left if they had remained opened.
good,"Really like the people, but do not think the salary is commensurate with the work at the customer service desk.  Also the fact they do not give any discount for as large as they are is disappointing."
good,"It was easy and simple depending on your position,As a lot associate its very fast paced and the heat sometimes get to you, but as a lumber associate you rely more on strength and stamina."
good,"Just a job, collect your check and move on. some people treat it like a career and thats great. I just cant limmit myself to opportunities like that.."
good,"Based upon over three years as a MEA, MET associate, not store operations, it is an easy job with very basic pay, minimum wage. Not very great in the realm of raises even if one goes above and beyond. A good starting job, layover job while finishing school, or for retirees."
good,"Nice people, always someone around willing to help if you have questions. They offer a decent benefits package, including medical and a 401k option. Overall enjoyable, though some of the policies can be a bit confusing."
good,"There are so many ways to get the information you need to do your job right and succeed. However, scheduling the computer time for it is difficult. Felt bad having to go to the back for computer training."
good,"Hardest part of the job, was to not inadvertently break their rules....."
good,"It was a fun place to work, management was always helpful and the employees were friendly. There were allot of incentives for you to achive different levels of training."
good,not the best pay for someone with a degree but its great for someone who want to grow to be a manager i recommend HD in behalf of their benefits their great
good,the home depot is a great place to work if you are full time. you only get benefits if you are full time and you can only work a regular 40 hr week if you are full time.
good,"This job varies from some days being busy, while other times it is slow and can get a little boring. It is a great job to have as a college student. For a part-time, it has great benefits who pay holidays."
good,"great job if you're looking for extra money.  work mostly nights and weekends but the company has great benefits, and I've gained a lot of experience in my time there"
good,Management has not been great there for a while now. Pay rate and raises are not competitive! They do however have wonderful benefits and time off policy for full-time employees.
good,"Home Depot is a pretty good place to work if you are in one of two positions. First if you are able to get a full-time position. Second if you are a student. They work with students and their school schedules as much as possible. This is where I would recommend Home Depot to a friend. Full-time positions seem to be quite rare in the region I'm in. They do give full-time 40 hours a week which I think would be adequate. If you are looking for a retail job or your are in school, Home Depot is generally a pretty good place to work."
good,This is a good company that expects alot but also gives alot in return. Days can be very fast paced. Management is normally lax as long as you are doing your job.
good,"Working at Home Depot was very interesting, it was a fast pace job and very competitive with long hours. But people that I work with was great. They were willing to help out anytime I asked and was willing to teach me anything I need it take excel in this job. All though sometimes were somewhat stressful the environment was fun. The pay was fair, although they were no benefits given or incentives. There was availability to work overtime. On a typical day there was a lot a heavy lifting and problem solving. If they put you in a certain area and you could not complete the task or keep up with the people you worked with for that job. They would move your round to other areas before letting you go. Though it was a fast pace job they gave more than enough brakes for you to rest. Home Depot always kept it fun and challenging so you never got bored with the work."
good,Managers didnt get along. Too many associate managers and department managers and head cashiers to know who would be the one to ask for advice or help.
good,"typical day as an Home Depot associate is when you first clock in, your're picking up the mess after the associate before you. constant calls over the store requesting help from all departments and rarely any help. everyone was over worked and few received favoritism"
good,"again, i was a prime order filler but this time they had a legit basketball goal there. Ball is life. lol. I didn't know that many people there but I had basketball. lol."
good,"Not A bad the place to work but not great pay unless you're a manager, they only give you a raise once a year and its usually only about 30 cent so it will take years to make decent money"
good,I enjoy working here.  Very nice co-workers and excellent management team. Training is well organized and thought out.  The pay seems fair and there are many opportunities to employees who wish to work hard and move up in the company.
good,I learned a lot. I transfered three x. I liked the other associates that I worked with. I designed kitchens and baths. I loved it. I learned a lot about how to fix and build anything.
good,The home depot is a very good job to start out. it is also very hard to work your way up the company. the raises they give are very low and it would be very hard to support a family on the income.
good,"At The Home Depot, I would come into work in the morning, and provide customer service for most of my shift. This included cutting wood for customers, and loading their carts with heavy things they couldn't lift such as cement. A typical day working at The Home Depot, helping people who needed my help on a daily basis was by far, the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,The overall company is a great company. They provide training but you need to be a self starter to apply what you learn on the computer to the actual on the floor experience. The work environment depends totally on the current management staff at each store. They provide a bonus for even part-time employees every six months based on how well the store did in their district.
good,Ce qui est bien chez HD est le fait d'avoir l'horaire pour les trois semaines suivantes. On peut changer nos disponibilités et demander des congés à l'avance. Ils sont très compréhensibles et ont beaucoup de considération vis-à-vis à l'employé.
good,I found this to be a good company for someone working part-time and retired.  I loved my co-workers and management was very good.  The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time on cement floors.
good,Job with some opportunities if you are well like.  I honestly only worked there as a summer job.  I am only writing this cause this site is making me do it.
good,"its a good place to work and with good people, you learn alot depending on your department, can be stressful and fast paced at times and they offer great benefits"
good,"Home Depot isn't the worse place.  It comes with a lot of benefits, but I feel like it just wasn't for me.  It was very stressful and competitive with position and demand.  They say they're a team looking out for each other and I felt like I was back in high school."
good,"Was a good job to have at the time, but did not see a career advancement for myself there. Employees were friendly and helpful especially when i was starting off and in training. Not a bad place to work just wasn't for me."
good,the work environment can be stressful as you deal with various rude  customers and not so pleasant employees. The benefits are nice compared to other companies
good,"I love working at home depot because I love working with people but this job isn't a family type environment and this is what was said at the time of hiring, It is a lot of favoritism and your not really recognize for your job performance. Your hours are terrible when part time."
good,Good place to work for college students looking for part-time. Flexible hours. Staff is understanding and willing to work with personal schedule. Good place to start and learn.
good,Taking care of the associates and customers. They believe in development and strong leadership. They take time to make sure every role is trained and given the tools necessary and empower people to do their jobs efficiently and effectively.
good,"A majority of the associates made Home Depot enjoyable and kept motivated. Sadly a few, mainly management, did not hold themselves and few Favorited others to the same standards as one would hope."
good,"Some days I worked 6 am to 3 pm and other days I worked 1pm to 10 pm. I rung up customers, wiped down the registers, swept, and vacuumed the floors and when they needed me I helped straighten up the different aisles of the store."
good,"quick paced, low salary starting off once in upper level management pay gets better. working on the store side you can advance rather quickly granted the right people like you. and you are excellent at what your doing."
good,"good support from management team"
good,freight team dosent get paid enough for the bs they have to put up with. lazy full time workers that work during the store during the day onle talk with customers and dosent take care of their departments. the freight team isn't supposed to but we clean up after them and get chewed out for stuff the day shift could have handled.
good,Enjoyed helping customers as well as other employees . Daily job duties was no prob every one was very helpful would definitely recommend anyone great place to work
good,"I only worked there for 6 months but I worked two different sections and two different types of hours. On the night shift the manager was easily irritated and didn't listen to those under him. However, he had his moments were he was understanding and didn't blame people for things that weren't their fault. In constrast, my garden manager was very liad back and helped me any time I needed assistance with a customer. The HR department was rather lacking but I blame that on the person that ran that department. Customners are typical for any place tha serves customers. Some days were long and difficult, others flew by."
good,"Con mucho esfuerzo es posible crecer dentro de la compañía, mas sin embargo constantemente  la compañía cambia de sus lideres a lo cual surgen cambios estructurales y de operación importantes, ocasionando una constante en la rotación  de personal."
good,This job was an ok place to work you kinda work at your own pace so you didn't really have anyone looking over your shoulder so a ok place to work could have paid more tho
good,"Receiving Team Counted, measured and weighed articles to verify contents of shipment Against Bills of Landing. UPS, FEDEX software; Managed store inventory, invoices and storage receipts Responsible for getting store ready for opening every day Stocking shelves, organizing aisles, overheads, building end- caps and promotions. Inventory, stored, priced and restocked merchandise displays in store Provide excellent customer service."
good,when i worked for the met team i worked 4 to 6 hours daily start at 5:30am leave at 9 to 10ish had a fun team i was working with very laid back easy work.
good,"I grew up with this company. They helped me develop my passion to be an HR manager. daily tasks include scheduling, benefit administration, training and career advancement game plans for employees."
good,"It is a Good company to work for."
good,"It's a nice and relaxed place to work, You can tell they care about their workers and customers. Even when it gets stressful it doesn't feel like it becuase you can always count on your co-workers."
good,"The Home Depot offers a great work environment for entry level professionals. If you need work experience on your resume, I highly recommend this company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot except for the early hours. I had to be there at 5:00am and  it was hard getting there one time.  "
good,"Always a adventure. Some people love a routine for work... Well you can find that here but to really enjoy and embrace working at Home Depot yo need to be willing to follow where your tasks take you, You could start out in the Lumber Aisle and end up in Plumbing or Electrical a hour later all with the same customer."
good,"it was retail so it wasn't the best job, however the management team was fantastic, and everyone seemed happy to be there. working freight wasn't that great because of the hours, but if you can get past that it wasn't bad."
good,The Home Depot Co. would be ideal for any college student its fast-paced but the work is not hard the managers are wonderful and there culture is diverse.
good,It is one of the better corporations to work for.  They done employ enough people to really do customer service.  Wages are too low for the work that is expected of associates.  The Hr services are excellent.
good,What I liked most about working at The Home Depot was the professional attitude of the employees and the willingness of the management to explain in detail how things were supposed to happen. I went into The Home Depot knowing very little about carpentry but learned so much that I would feel confident building just about anything.
good,good place to work management are really nice and on top of things throughout the store. the hardest part about my job is the slightly heavy lifting being that its nothing in my department under 20 pounds. the most enjoyable part about my job are my team they're great and make our job a lot less stressful
good,It is a really good gig. Set hours during weekdays of 10 to 2 and only weekend day to work. Can get really boring and can be hard on you physically to stand in one spot especially if you have foot problems. Otherwise no complaints.
good,Customer support center was extremely challenging with something new each day. The management team was always very supportive and wanting to help. The role of resolution expeditor taught me patience and leadership skills without much effort because you have to be able to take charge of issues and resolve.
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot is spent rounding up shopping carts and helping costumers loading wood and appliances. The hardest part of my job is the continues walking, but I enjoy the walking and being active. The most enjoyable part of my job is being physically active and the people I work with are easy to get along with."
good,Home Depot was an okay place to work at I learned a lot about the company. Unfortunately I didn't get much hours so I had to leave the company. I would reccomand this job to a friend.
good,Doesn't really pay a living wage. Get a $.25 raise once a year. Time off is rare and requested time off in advance may be denied. Very strict about arriving a few minutes late.
good,"Buena actividad laboral "
good,home depot is a challenging place for minority to work as there is little or no room for growth. co workers are very tunnel visioned and lack understanding and are prejudice
good,Home depot is a very fast paced retail environment that can take you in and make you feel like family or it can also make you feel like an outsider depending on the upper management that currently resides in thee store.
good,All the employees were very kind and welcoming. I was properly trained for things I was not sure how to do. Hours were flexible according to me school schedule.
good,Great place to work with a lot of opportunities to advance. If you are into home improvement this is a great place to work. The hours aren't long the management is great and the environment is awesome.
good,"Extremely long days for managers and if you break down salary per hour you probably make less than an associate however you get better ""perks"" as a manager.  This is a great job for a single individual who does not need to worry about work/life balance.  There are many opportunities for advancement and you can pretty much relocate any where in the world."
good,Part time job and is good place to work. Stock my area and keep it clean. Help customers on plumbing questions and do it yourself ideas. Work with in company guidelines. Need more people on floor and have to cover other dept.
good,I was referred to this job by a family member. I started in February 2016 and then left in May of that year because I decided to attend culinary school.
good,"Customer service is the goal of this company, But the store does not always put the customer first!  I believe in one main thing...TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!!"
good,it was a good place to work but my position was part time. I got along with my coworkers for the most part.  The customers were relatively easy going.
good,"Special services was a bit stressful especially when orders came in wrong. Daily routine paperwork, pulling orders, ordering special orders, followup and taking payments. Balanced till at the end of shift. Workplace had nice people and if you did good customer service you awarded a badge that had a monetary value. Hardest part of job was dealing with unhappy customers"
good,"Quick changing, busy job. Alot of good customer service experiences, classes teach you alot about your department. Management will work with you. Sometimes team members are hard to rely on."
good,IT pays well... as a manager... but it will suck out your soul.  scheduled 55 hours a week and paid for 40 but if you have to take time off then you better be missing an arm.  There is a great base of enthusiastic associates but they get beaten down by poor management.  If you can swing the system and get the team behind you its a good gig... if not you will sink and die.
good,"It is what you make of it. If you want to work hard, you can, but if you don't there are ways around it. This experience has taught me lessons about integrity and work ethic."
good,Typical corporation atmosphere. Not a place for a part time person to really get ahead. Pay is low and scheduling inconsistent. Great place to meet new people and help them solve their problems.
good,"The work experience at Home Depot depends on the store manager.  I have worked with great managers and others that were not. Overall, I am thankful for being employed."
good,"Overall, I'm grateful I have this job, but I think the company could make some major improvements in the job culture and management styles. "
good,Great place for people or even college students who need money to work. Career advancement isn't really possible hear but there are some people who have been there for 20+ years.
good,Typical office environment with friendly colleagues. Support for internal promotion and growth vertically and horizontally. Overall decent beginning for early career.
good,"THD is a good company, but store management is average at best.  Lack of attention to the needs of it's associates most of the time & the pay is very low. Having said that I met & worked with some great people. I also learned a new skill set that I knew nothing about before joining the company."
good,"the work environment is stressful, but your co-workers are there for you when things get tough. if you are truly looking for a part time job, that would be the place."
good,"I love working at the home depot I met a lot of friends there that now still my friends. There were some drama going on, but as long you do not get involved, it will not affect you in your job performs."
good,my Job is very stressful but I enjoy it for the most part. I believe their is unfair wages throughout each department but that is a working issue . Good for the most part.
good,"Environment was good. Managers and employees are respectful. Hardest part of the job would be the customers, enjoyed the laid back atmosphere the most."
good,"Superb place to work, but you have to be there 2 years so you could possibly be a full time employee. But you don't get to choose where you're going to work full time, they tell you where you will be needed. People are great there, haven't had a better place for friends or coworkers. Hardest part of the job was trying to find someone to help out a customer when it was needed for certain departments. Also pay wasn't high, doesn't matter if you're bilingual or not."
good,Worked with great people but unfortunately there was too many managers and one second you were told one thing and the next would be told something completely different and it is extremely hard to get full time.
good,"A typical day working at Home Depot, Working in a professional environment dealing with customers on a daily basis and giving outstanding customer service skills."
good,Home Depot wasn't all that great as a company to work for maybe it was because of the management. If you don't mind being at work by 4am then this is the job for you.
good,The starts and ends with unloading inventory and stocking the inventory into each store departments as needed.Each department has to be restock for the next day sales cycle.
good,This is annoying. I don't want to write this. I worked at Home Depot for a bit. This summary is more annoying than my entire time there. I need 15 more characters bam
good,"Retail, with all the pros and cons of such. A steep learning curve due to the amount of knowledge required, e.g. company computer programs, policies and procedures, dos and don'ts etc. A casual work environment, generally friendly overall. Managers and supervisors are reasonable and decent to work for."
good,this was a seasonal job for me it was an ok place to work. dont really have to many complaints about working here. it was awhile back and the other workers were nice to work with
good,"productive work space."
good,"Flexible hours and LOA for school are very nice for students. Work can be busy especially during the holidays, but it provides an opportunity to learn sales skills. Some customers can be difficult to deal with but overall it is great company to work for."
good,"I worked in the lawn and garden department."
good,Receive evening stock truck. Unload product and sort to proper departments. Learnt the receiving side of the company. Organized special order for customers. Hardest part not enough employees. Most enjoyable part were the co-workers I got to work with. Everyone willing to help each other.
good,Started PT in the garden department and then after 2 months they promoted me to FT in the paint department. After 2 months I moved back into the Garden department. Very busy place to work but had a lot of fun while learning a ton about the Home Depot way of life.
good,Home Depot was a friendly place to work.  It was enjoyable learning about the different departments and products. The schedules were given two weeks in advance which was helpful.
good,"I clocked in and opened the garden, rain, cold or the tx heat!  I loved working at the HD.  I still keep in touch with my friends after I moved back to my home town HB."
good,"Not my favorite place to work, but fun. It was fun because of the people I was working with. The managers where okay. They tend to give awards to those who kissed theirs butts. Easy gig, okay place to work."
good,it was a fun fast paced to work I got to meet new people on a day to day and help customers find what they needed or were looking for which was hands on
good,They don't teach you until you make a mistake. There is no mileage for job that require you driving your personal car. Appointment center is hit or miss when you call them.
good,Okay place to work if you want to work retail. You can advance if you want to move up. You start off part time and you have to work for a while to become full time.
good,"I enjoy working with people and helping them anyway that I can. It's fun seeing new faces come in the door and greeting them. "
good,"First shift starts 1 hour before store opens, arrive at work walk your department.  Assist night crew with any freight left from truck delivery."
good,"I do not really want to review this place, I do feel I was given unfair treatment, I was blamed for a safety violation that I didn't cause, I feel that they felt I was overpaid and I needed terminated"
good,"Provides flexible hours that work well with attending school full-time. It is a good part-time job that pays well, offers sick days immediately, and vacation days after one year of employment."
good,ok interesting varied shifts various roles good leadership good opportunity was only there part time able to  pick up new shifts once in a while over all
good,The structure of the company was great. I'm sure it would have been a lot more different if I wasn't just a temp. The pay was very little and no benefits.
good,a usual work day at the home depot is typically very chaotic. It will become usual but if you are just stepping into the job it can be a bit overwhelming. The Home Depot is a warehouse and a weeks worth of computer training will not do you justice. You will be thrown on the floor after computer training and you basically just learn as you go. The day never really goes as scheduled and you have be very resourceful and pull anyone you can to get the job done.
good,"while scheduling could be a little chaotic and biased, everything would pan out ok.   work was good if you like dealing with customers. patience goes a long way"
good,Employment at The Home Depot is not the best but it is acceptable. There is usually issues with management and supervisors. Favoritism is a very common issue
good,Good as a second job. Enjoy helping customers and making recommendations for their projects and purchase. Good flexibility of scheduling. Profit sharing available.
good,Enjoyable atmosphere and get to interact with and assist customers with their decorative choices on a regular basis. Pay is good and paid weekly.Room for advancement.
good,"This was a fun job even though it was high pressure and fast paced. Everyone did a good job working together, you would get recognized for doing a good job and rewarded for perfect attentdence and safety."
good,Manager travis is a great leader and the work ethic people have there are great. Just learning about fixing thing and helping people find rhe right product to assist in thier projects
good,Very difficult to get a full-time position.  Advancement can be difficult. Good culture nationally but locally can vary.  Hours vary too greatly.  One day close next day open.
good,"I've worked at two locations and the management was completely different in regards to work ethic, professionalism and making you feel welcomed.  The hours are flexible and the people are usually friendly though."
good,A typical day of work included helping customers find items for their projects. Often explaining in detail how to resolve issues with their projects. Stocking shelves.
good,I don't have a full time job. Looking for a full-time job with more salary with good benefits. I want the minimum salary at least 16 dollars an hour. I am a dedicated and people person who always like to learn new things. I like to work as a team.
good,I learned many new skill sets and a lot of product knowledge for the home. The workplace culture is tight. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and being able to help the customers.
good,"Spent days helping customers, stocking shelves and ordering product. Lots of standing and walking throughout the day. This job was fun and was always changing."
good,Loved the cashier position in the garden! Customers were great and so was management. Loved the outdoor garden environment. Learned a lot about plants and DIY projects. Great team and attitude
good,"I enjoyed working here for a while, but I saw no room for advancement. The hours are all over based on your availability, and they do not offer full time even if you apply for it. They would rather someone of a certain... ethnicity (it seems to me) be their full time associates"
good,"I started as a vault associate and moved to Cross Merchandiser.  I fully enjoyed this position as I had to be very creative, well organized, and at times very challenging.  This position was eliminated due to a fulfillment team coming into play."
good,"when you clock in and report yourself to the immediate supervisor you will learn where you will be helping customers for the next couple of hours, it will never be the same place or position, just all around the store, maybe that's why your customers can not find you sometimes, it's fun being around people and being able to help and getting to know people and different cultures  from around the world, I really wish they could change some politics around there so we could be more comfortable, it is my believe that a happy associate can make customers happy as well."
good,"did not like the hours, 9:00pm to 1:00am was not ideal - laid back environment with an emphasis on safety - good training - not much interaction with customers"
good,"I love working for home depot, but rules were never set so management would tell you one thing then another set of management would tell you something way different."
good,i was a cashier and worked in the return area. i had to restock the end caps and make sure that area was clean. i had to provide customer service to the customers.
good,"They really need to work on putting people out on the floor that actually have knowledge in that area, so many times I would be swamped with customers because no one else had the knowledge to help them."
good,i personally  like the job because i learn a lot about home improvement home repairs outside work i also enjoyed working in a fast pace environment the people i worked wit were great what i don't like is the hours were OK i just  wish they offer full
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"My job consisted of handling sales, refunds, exchanges, monitoring and releasing online, special and will call orders.  I worked with customers resolving complaints, issues, etc.  Management wanted associates to attempt to resolve all issues before they would get involved.  The hardest part of the job was when all options were exhausted and you could not resolve customers' issues or complaints.  Many times management would get involved and give the customer what they wanted.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when a customer was left the store, satisfied because their issues/complaints were resolved.  Most customers are truly grateful when you go that extra step."
good,You don't have to get stuck doing one thing. There's always opportunity to move around in dept. A lot of diversity. Decent benefits if you're there for long enough.
good,"Great place to work dealing with the public. I had many of happy clients who loved my work and our ethics. Employees were friendly but had their click; they had their tight knit community. I left a manager, I did not leave The Home Depot."
good,"Overall was a good experience however, when I was transferred to a different department I had a very rude and borderline verbally abusive manager. Overall the company as a whole is good."
good,"Many of the employees were very friendly and always willing to help customers. Pay wasn't too bad for working part-time, and in time you could work your way up and become manager. I had a friend who started as a cashier in high school, within a few years he started working in the blinds department, and now (10 years later) he became store manager and will soon be starting as regional manager. The only downside of working at Home Depot is that if you don't know much about the products then you're completely lost. I was hired for the merchandising execution team and when a customer asked me about certain products, I couldn't help them because I had no idea about tools and different types of electrical equipment and such."
good,"It's alright. It is so alright, that it's alright. For the almost year i was there, it was alright and enjoyably alright. definitely work at this alright place."
good,"it is a good place to work morning is slow, then ramps up until about 4 or 5 o'clock. the management is good most of the time but some of the managers are a bit iffy. the workplace is very friendly and supportive. hardest part of the job is the stationary work on a concrete floor with little to no padding. my favorite part of working there was my co'workers"
good,It was fun but the hours and family life balance sucks. No set schedule. But I learned a lot and they are always training. You could be yourself and they accepted you that way. Definitely laid back but professional.
good,"Overall, my experience was good. The management team was not receptive to employee input. I learned new and exciting skills such as merchandising, forklift operation and overall store inventory."
good,great place to work wish they would give benefits to part timers but they took them away due to obamcare.. once you get hurt on the job they treat you differently. as well if you do suck up to the management you wont get moved to a better positon.
good,Not a bad place to work. It is a strict place with the rules but is good. There is a place for everything so it is very organize. This is a plus for everyone. The building is always clean and the associates are treated well. They want to listen to what you have to say about ways to change the place for the better.
good,"Home Depot does a lot for its associates to help with the mediocre pay for duties. Home Depot has great benefits and some good people in the company , they offer advancement if your willing to work hard for it."
good,"The Home Depot , mission statement speaks for its-self. However, I learn alot from working there it just the people you work with and the favoritism that goes on in the work place. Home-Depot is a great company to work for, but unfortunately the store I was at didn't want me to grow in the business."
good,You must have a very flexible schedule......Good Benefits.........Good Work Environment.........Good Staffing.......Compensation could be better.......................
good,"They give great benefits, but the work hours are usually very spread out for part timers and if you are full time be expected to work every weekend. Advancement is there but then you will be expected to stay until 2 am sometimes and then return in the morning."
good,"Customer Service is always #1 at Home Depot.  Seldom, does a customer enter the store without at least one Home Depot Retail Associate asking that customer how they may be helped.  This is the fun part of working for Home Depot."
good,work was very fun. very nice and kind people. They were always very lenient nad gave you a lot of speeches never really any sanctions. the customer might have been a little nasty but apart from that ver good.
good,Great place for part time work. Management is kind and understanding. Schedules are prepared enough in advance to be able to plan doctors or dentist appointments. Full time staff is a pleasure to work with.
good,Assisting customers in their day to day shopping needs. Restocking sections as needed. Intake of deliveries. Inventory. Janitor work as needed and as always smiling.
good,I was a cashier for the most part and then I was moved out into the garden dept and was in charge of caring for the plants and watering them during the summer months. Then the winter months came and the hours slowed down quite a bit and then I got hired to do care giving the following fall.
good,"Good company to work overall. Some management problems, but this varies from store to store."
good,I liked working at home depot it was a good job but bad location costumers didn't know when to stop opening products or stealing items from the open boxes. The staff is fun and welcoming to any new comers. Management is fun and understanding to any problem you have.
good,"I learned a lot about hardware, rekeying locks, helping customers, working a cash register. I also helped out in training new associates and working over night when the store would take the yearly inventory."
good,"Nobody is happy and everybody wants more money. Over all though enjoyable experience.  As with most retail, customer service is the biggest challenge."
good,"Relaxed place to work, managers were nice and helpful.  Enjoyed my job but had to leave due to major illness.  Would go back if it paid more or offered more hours"
good,I would go back. I did not work for them long enough to see the type of circus that I saw elsewhere. They did have us come in to work when the city mayor told us to stay home.
good,"Ok place to work, always busy with contractors. Early shirts were the best 5am til 2 and you still had time to enjoy your day overall I like working there"
good,"I have developed a typical routine for the week which includes meeting my goals and providing superior customer satisfaction.  This is an easy job for me but does not let me utilize my full skill set and/or  potential.  Great benefits.  Overall, a positive work culture."
good,I love this place. I give this company a thumbs up. I would recommend anyone to work here. I would work here again. If you have call center experience apply for here
good,Assistant managers could have over an hour commute when promoted and work 60 hours a week mostly nights and weekends. assistant peers make schedules and are very biased to themselves.  As an associate they are very flexible and team oriented.
good,"I like working at The Home Depot. The customers, employees and management are nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to memorize over 50,000 items that are in the store to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part is making sure that the customer always leaves satisfied and has enjoyable experience. That is always a gratifying feeling for me to have."
good,"Alright job, nothing special but it does give consistent pay and hours. No real special benefits and incentive to stay and there isn't too much room for advancement unless you want to get into management."
good,Work is hard and pay isn't as good as it should be for the amount of work unless you are management. Most employees are friendly and open. The best part of the job is the satisfaction received from helping a customer.
good,"il y a beaucoup de choses a planifier le matin, un bon travail en n équipe"
good,Fast paced.  Pay rates are much lower then when I started.   Most employees start as temps without benefits.  You earn your way to full time.  On your feet much of the day.
good,If you like working with people and learning new things everyday then this is the job for you. You will get to know your neighborhood real quick. Locals come in sometimes 10 times a day.
good,I had a good experience at Home Depot except when dealing with some of the Store Managers and Management team.  Home depot has a strong culture and they didn't even come close the the level of service expected.
good,"Day in and day out THD is a great place to work. How customers are able to treat associates is degrading to say the least.  For the pressure they place on the supervisors, they are very under paid."
good,"Getting in contact with the managers was hard, especially when dealing with a rude customer who insists to see the manager. other than that i enjoyed being a cashier at The Home Depot. I would asked to be filled in for the lot associates often, that was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Pretty fair training programs, ongoing learning. Good camaraderie within the ranks. Focus on employee safety and customer service."
good,"Home Depot is focused on being the #1 Home Improvement Retailer in the World. Typical day can go into multiple areas of the business. It can be difficult to go into a routine, but determination and focus keeps a person driven."
good,"The upper management team is fractured and discriminatory in its promotional process.  (They play favorites)  They prefer passive personalities and syncophants.  They are threatened by passionate, innovative thinkers.  Operational managers were terrific, although none of them have been there more than a year due to high turnover of the operation's managers.  The company is good to work for and the people I worked with were great."
good,Enjoyed most aspects of peer culture.  Management & leadership could use some connectivity development to understand policy impact to all levels of staff.
good,The Home Depot is a good organization that focuses on it people.  All eight of it core values are associate related.  The hardest part of the job is development of a team of associates who want to work together as a team.
good,"A typical work day, for a full time associate, can start anywhere from 5am to 1pm and ends anywhere from 3pm - 10pm.  Early folks do prep for a busy selling day, final clean up, stocking shelves, etc.  The bulk of the day is focused on customer service, greeting all customers, offering and giving assistance, making suggestions, anything to make their shopping experience a pleasant one.  The later shift associates move into recovery mode, Checking for stock and getting the shelves refilled and clean up from the day."
good,Working for Home Depot was very interesting. I enjoyed working in the construction field. It was enjoyable being able to assist the customers and listen to their ideas as well as offer some ideas that might improve their projects.
good,My experience at the home depot was fair to say yje least the people were freindly but there was one associate manager that was just always in a bad mood and punished you for nothing sometimes.
good,"-Good work environment"
good,"THD is a wonderful place to work. It provides a flexible schedule for everyone. Learning about all the home improvements through classes, co-workers, and customers make THD a very positive place to work."
good,"Un dia tipico es llegar saludar a los demas reportarme con gerencia"
good,always heard employees complaining about each other make and who made more than who and how long someone been here longer and didn't get paid this much managers was all over the place not helping or assisting disappointed customers. etc
good,"If you are terminated,,can you work for The Again? I loved my job, but was terminated for a personal reasons. That manager is at a different the now but my old store is hurting. I want to know if I can ever get rehired at the home Depot."
good,"if a face paced enviroment is your thing then home depot is for you. they are great with hours and giving paid time off, they just expect alot from you for the small job that you have."
good,"working at HD is very challenging most of the time.  there are not a lot of associates on the floor so you get called on to do pretty much everything during your shift.  once you learn more than others they call you constantly for help and its rewarding but also hard to get your own work finished.  the management can be great but can also not be so great.  advancement is possible but you better get on board with upper management and become one of their ""favorites"" or you can stay stagnant and never move up while you watch others move and move.  frustrating."
good,Very busy. however helped me develop great customer service skills. scheduling help in departments was the worse. but it  made you a strong associate. pay was okay. however I was being underpaid and did not know it. managers let it go without acknowledging. met great people. and great customers.
good,Can to Home Depot with little knowledge of home improvement and left with a lot more than I thought I would ever have without trying trying to learn.  Fellow employees were very helpful and made the work environment more enjoyable.
good,Excellent Opportunity to make significant income. A reputable company with excellent management that support their team and make it possible to perform at your highest level. The culture is constructed around team work. Great job
good,"Store readiness is the priority to make sure that the employees and customers are safe. Replenish any items that are not on the shelf. Assist customers with their projects. The management, in my view, is not up to par with working with property management companies for 30 plus years. Home Depot lacks the professionalism I was used to and that is primarily the reason i am seeking a new position. Helping customers is the best part of the job where I provide insight from my 30 plus years."
good,"Its good place to work as a team andnew technology, busy schedule in working, continuous change in work structure and management.Recently added lot of fun activity within the campus, which helps to relax for few minutes and it helps to improve our efficiency."
good,"As a past employee with Home Depot I would strongly recommend working for the company as they treat their associates like family and, make everyone such as employees as well as customers feel welcome. A great opportunity for a job/career."
good,"Home Depot is Fun! So much to learn and people are good. Managers are most of the time good. But, there are times they are just condescending towards other people."
good,"I wished we had better communication and people who actually wanted to work.  But for those of us who did and actually got stuff done, it was a great place to work.  I was kept busy, I had people I could go to if there was a problem, I got along with my team and we had most of the tools we needed for the job and where we didn't we improvized just fine.  I learned how to work with a team of both genders and how to communicate with multiple parties, I got to work hard and got liscened for Slip Sheet and Forklift in my short time there.  Hardest part about the job was that some people in authority didn't care about certain problems and others loved watching other people struggle and made some non-work appropraite comments.  Overall though, I loved my job.  Would go back if I could."
good,"From a cashiers point of view, typical day of work consists of checking out customers and assisting customers with finding products in the store, or answering their concerns."
good,"Customer service is very important. You've got to be willing to go above and beyond to insure customer happiness. It is tough sometimes, as some customers can be very difficult.  Management is there to help and are responsive to issues. Its like a big family."
good,"I like the fact that you do not have a specific uniform. A pair of jeans, sneakers ,t-shirt and an apron was what we wore. It gets busy during and summer which was good  otherwise, when it is slow is really boring. Leadership wasn't so bad and people are friendly."
good,Home Depot is good place to work for. I worked for the company for almost 10 years. The benefits are good. It is a retail job so the hours one works are all over the place which is to be expected.
good,This is not a challenging place to work as long as you know your stuff. Buy a new pair of walking shoes for the concrete and assisting customers locating items.
good,I learned so much working here. Im no expert in any one field but i learned haw to fix just about anything on my house. I had a good time working here and would recommend to anyone wanting an entry level retail job
good,"Was a good place employees were great the customer at the store were "
good,A good first job to do. The pay could be better especially after the experience you acquire over the years. Getting paid a little over minimum wage is not good pay especially for the work that you do.
good,"Good training if you can get on the computer to do it."
good,Good work environment. They start employees out as part-time to see if you are a good fit for the company. If you want full-time be willing to pick up extra shifts.
good,Home Depot is a great place to invest in a long term career. It has its flaws but what company doesn't. When I'm talking to a young person about the future or careers I always suggest Home Depot. I would still be there if I hadn't found something I loved a little more.
good,Can be a great job for student or retired person. The company seems to have a tendency to hire inexperienced assistant store managers who managed by rote learning and mimicking some training materials.
good,"Everyone at Home Depot are super nice. they're patient and understanding, and willing to help, always. If something happens and you need to call out they are willing to work with you."
good,i worked a seasonal position for the garden area stocking the shelves overnight and that was a experience for sure ive never done a overnight position until this one and dont think i will again
good,"The Home depot is one of the most recognized retailer in the us, this is great and also gives each employee a chance to meet other people and race while building their people skills."
good,"As a sales associates with The Home Depot typically provided customer service, including directing customers to  the store products, answering questions about goods, or assisting in any purchase decisions. as a Home Depot sales associates I  performed stocking, organizing, and cleaning duties at the request of the management team."
good,"Great opportunities given, not a fan if pushing priducts to make sales goals but busy environment. Must be motivated and hard working to keep up. Choice oflunch length is nice. Request for time off is challenging and if not reminded of can be overlooked."
good,"This job was competitive. We had a quota to sustain every month. The objective was to get minium or maximum people to sign up for the home Depot credit card. I quickly memorized my department bin# , so that I could direct customers in finding products. "
good,They work with whatever schedule you need. They have great management. They care for my health. Over all a great working experience. Great employees to work with.
good,"not a bad place to work, but the management wasn't up to par in my store.  I enjoyed the customers and staff."
good,The call center has a broad opportunity for experience and variations in services.   A very stable and predictable culture of performance. This is a first rate call center experience or opportunity.
good,"Hard working individuals need apply only."
good,Home depot is a great stepping stone for people to go into a company and learn how to navigate corporate world. There is room for advancement and growth.
good,I currently work at home depot and I have been there for over 4 years. I like the people I work with. I moved up in the company a few times over my years
good,Job was fun and there was time taken to simply develop social interaction among fellow workers. Good benefits and personable management staff. Advancement also available.
good,"generally a good place to work, come in, do your job and no one will mess with you.  as far as the managers go they do ok at not micromanaging but it happens. compensation could be better."
good,"Leads are set by store associates who know little to nothing about outside operations.  Store associates are required to create outside leads, and will reuse prospect info repeatedly."
good,Fun place to learn about new product and how to develop customer service skills. I learned new ideas everyday through customers and associates. With full dedication you can reach a better position with the company and more.
good,"In the summer I worked in the Garden Department having fun with customers helping them learn about different flowers and plants, helping them with problems in their garden and more."
good,"Enjoyed working there, always fun never really hard. They made learning fun. Always did cookouts and had fun days with gifts for employees as well as customers all the time"
good,"Responsibilities include maintaining customer orders, maintaining special order inventory.  Ringing up customer orders, processing refund transactions.  Flexible hours."
good,I learnt new things from this company. Its an great platform to learn. I would congratulate to whole team and entire management who supported me a lot.
good,"The people I worked with were really good, for the most part.  They're also really good about making sure you get your breaks/lunches (at least in California).  Most of the time, if you have to change your availability or request a day off, they'll approve it.  Overall, I enjoyed the customers (with a few exceptions but..that's any job).  You also do get sick time, and, after a year, vacation time."
good,"I enjoyed working here because the customers were great. And management really acknowledged their employees more then any other employer I've worked for. Also, the was room for quick advancement."
good,"Hectic at times, but generally a good place to work. Management style leaves much to be desired as corporate policy can be at odds with logic and common sense."
good,"Responsibilities include maintaining stock, overseeing daily department operations, overseeing 6 associates, working closely with upper management to develop goals and discuss results, reading and understanding department metrics, controlling budget, and taking care of advanced customer care issues for unique custom and special order.  Also responsible for communicating small tasks to associates in order to achieve larger goal and meticulously check orders for mistakes before they become critical."
good,"You get to learn as much as you want and move to different departments, pretty good pay as long as you show up and prove to be a good worker. I would consider this a starter job unless you have a specific skill set and become a department lead."
good,It was a fine place to work. Managers were nice. Employees all got along well. Managers stood behind you when customers were difficult. (there was a problem with theft and people returning the items for cash)
good,Management need little better training working with Associates to better the company as a whole would enjoy working for them again under the right circumstances as I had work for them for 10 years I've seen too many people come and go as management does not treat the associates very well the pay scale has a little to be acquired also there are many good things about this company as well as not so good
good,"This was a short time position, I enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the holidays I would like to be able to expand on this again at some point. It was a very professional place to work."
good,This is a great place to work! They offer a great Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Managers also earn bonuses depending on the profitability of their stores. There is also room for growth.
good,"Untrained management was probably the biggest downfall, i learned many things, especially how to deal with unruly customers and how to pass on knowledge i had learned at the job."
good,"It was usually a steady routine in the shipping area back of the store."
good,"If retail is your forte, than Home Depot is a good place to work.  The pay is low but they usually take care of each other.  The best part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"Good company to work for with decent pay."
good,It was a really fun experience working for home depot. You learn a little bit of everything about construction. The managers are willing to work with the employes.
good,"Dealing with customers and developing bonds with fellow coworkers made this job worthwhile. Management was lacking at times due to the pettiness of employee treatment. As far as college jobs go, I could recommend this to any student."
good,"Good workplace for a company of its size. Hard to make a difference at the lower levels, but that is to be expected. Good work-life balance at the lower levels. Could use more progressive policies."
good,"great company relaxed dress code, and decent pay however company is set up to micro manage to the extreme.  loved my assistant always responsive to and questions or concerns."
good,Most people that work there are very friendly and helpful to each other and customers. Management is fair for the most part and have some fun with employees.
good,"Was a great working environment for the most part. I had a great relationship with my customers , had good knowledge of products which company supplied the training for. Hours were reasonable and suited my life style."
good,"wonderful work place. help customers seeking help on how material were rated, helping customers to get all their needs to comply with task. bad pay increase ten cents after becoming three time employee of the month."
good,"Although I liked working in the Garden Center, it was hard for me because I knew very little about all the products in that section of the store. It was a learn as you go and when customers had questions I couldn’t aways answer."
good,Flexible hours and a decent staff makes for an OK environment. Management however are less than optimal for job. Occasionally provide BBQ and Lunches. HR is very good and flexible with working hours.
good,I loved this job! The customers were great as well as the staff. I was able to learn about all the products in the store. Hardest part of the job was standing still for long periods of time.
good,Can be very busy at times. I've learned a lot with this company and I hope to one day be able to advance within corporate. Management is okay. Overall a great work environment.
good,"I started as a lot associate and quickly learned how fast paced the retail business is. I got offered a full time position in 6 months cause of my strong work ethic that they noticed which felt good. I felt a little bad cause some people have been there for years and still didn't get a full time position. Everything for the most part about working at Home Depot has been great except when my shift got changed to a fixed closing schedule and I have been going to night college classes since I started there. The only option I was given was to step back down to part-time, I and many others didn't feel that was fare but life goes on."
good,As long as the management is great you will have no problem working here. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are unwilling to understand your roles as an employee and what you are legally allowed to perform task wise.
good,"It is a good company, but too many cliques and no equal opportunity. They don,t deal with issues properly and most things are swept under the rug....."
good,"This company had variable hours. Although this allowed for easier planning for appointments and days needed off, the hours/income was an unreliable, varying amounts. They had good leadership and friendly, approachable employees."
good,The people at Home Depot were very nice and accepting of new employees.  They do all they can to help make sure the customers are the most important person in the store.
good,"Hard work, but fun place. Management comes and goes. Hours can be bad - they're open most holidays all weekends and evenings. They do train you well. Changed since I worked there."
good,"As a cashier they stress you a lot about credit cards and VOCs and it gets to the point that it annoys you to your really soul but if you can look past that then you'll really enjoy it because there's always an event like pizza day or smoothie day, ice cream Sunday day and the employees are great they work with you"
good,the job is a fun place to get a learning experience and you meet pretty cool people to work with. the job also comes with benefits and 401k where you can save retirement money
good,"La empresa es muy buena con muchos planes a futuro con los asociados y ellos, aparte de un gran apoyo, solo que quienes dirigen son los que no eran tan humanos, con ideologías de dictadura"
good,Loved working here just did not like the fact that I could not transfer  other stores just  gave me the run around. was told they were hiring and then told not hiring.
good,Scheduling really stinks if you have a busy life schedule so i wouldn't recommend. you learn a lot about all home improvement not just your department. hardest part is working with customers and knowing ALL the product locations. best part is its an open workspace that can be fun
good,Home Depot offers its employees enough autonomy to make decisions that lend to accomplishing goals. Leadership is extremely inclusive and promotes thinking and ownership of work.
good,It was a really great experience working with the team I've learned so much I will forever take the education with me in life wherever I go to help me with the things in life
good,My life at the home depot was supposed to be a two year stepping stone. The love of the people held me there for ten years. I started as a technician for the tool rental for 5 years.  Transferred to receiving for a year as the day delivery receiver. Transferred back to rental as the trainer for the technician. Then promoted to department manager.
good,Its ok to work here if your full time but for part timer make sure you have a 2nd job because with 8hrs a week wont pay the bills and put food in your mouth
good,"I did not work for The Home Depot. I worked for SolarCity inside Home Depot. I enjoyed being in the retail store and I have acquired a great skill because of the things i had to do. Engaging someone about something they didn't even know they needed or want, of coarse thats after we took care of their need for the store"
good,"I was hired on only as a part time associate with not much chance in getting full time, but their training is superb. They make sure that you do get breaks and they are very into customer service and satisfaction."
good,it is a good company to shop at but when it comes to respect for employees there seems to be unfairness and bias involved and because like most large companies the stores are capable of getting away with many things even if it is reported
good,"Work is sometimes challenging.  Managers are hard to get a hold of for help when needed.  Workplace culture is great, lots of wonderful employees of varied backgrounds and ages.  Part-time employees are rewarded and treated much better than the full time vested employees.  After becoming full time, not many awards given out.  Scheduling is a nightmare.  Schedules are made four weeks in advance.  Virtually impossible to be at any family or school events with this schedule.  Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people."
good,"I micro managed and worked with associates, supervised and worked all shifts, licensed forklift and reach operator ; shipping & receiving store merchandise and customer orders. continuous heavy lifting  of 50 plus pounds of construction/Lumber and building materials. customer service and assistance in product knowledge.i assisted in store and customer projects."
good,"The Home Depot has served  its purpose for me as a flexible and decently paying job to get through college. The workplace culture is very community oriented and I enjoy the associates I work with which is the biggest reason I stay in that position. The hardest part of the job is probably the constant change of management with new ASM's or SM's switching around, and their leadership style to adjust to is challenging."
good,Working at the home depot is like working with family.  99% of the customers are great and keep coming back. This place really takes care of their employees as well. Great benefits as well.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you like a solid schedule and an organized workplace. Good pay and room to advance. The store manager was young and a bit inexperienced but the supervising staff was great.
good,I've learned how to work quickly in a fast paced environment and have learned hot to go beyond multitasking. This has been a good learning experience for me I'm grateful to have worked here.
good,"I enjoyed working with the paint and lawn and garden department,  it was fun and challenging.  My customers were very friendly.  Trying for my job was very effective to do my job in a balanced and timely manner."
good,Home Depot was a nice place to work.  I enjoyed working there and the people I worked with. The job was hard at times however it was enjoyable place to work.
good,"I worked part time. I loved the dress code (or lack thereof) and the fellow employees were good people. Management was -usually- prompt and quick when you needed help. I was the cashier out in Garden center, and it was fun out there. You got to move around and point things out for people, do other things aside from standing behind the register."
good,"This place was good to me for 6 years, but the Management went down hill about 2 years ago. Would go back to work for the company, but not that store."
good,"When you're at work everything seems okay, but you really need to be able to stay on your toes because change comes fast. "
good,"Do NOT expect to be paid well. Expect to work what ever hours they want or need you to work. "
good,"Seemed to always be short staffed when I arrived to work.  I greeted customers and helped them with any sort of tool rental.  Rented trucks.  Took in all rented equipment, cleaned and tagged it for a new rental"
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. The work can be difficult especially if you land in the garden department. It is hot and requires a strong back and lots of lifting and loading. Other than that the company is a great place to work with room to grow. I understand that in recent years pay has improved for its associates. Terrible employee discounts, there don't allow employee discounts."
good,I really enjoy working with my team and the costumers are nice too. Its a good job to have especially while going to school. I'm in the process of getting my bachelors.
good,I was a 2nd shift lumber associate. I enjoyed working with the customers and solving unique problems for people. After the store closed I stocked the lumber racks.
good,"Unload the truck,Place merchandise on pallets and carts, Take the pallets, carts out to the floor and Stock merchandise..Occasionally customers asks questions during store hours. Pretty Simple. Night shifts and working alone, This job is pretty much that. At the end of the shift my body is tired but survivable. I hope this is straight forward, hope it helps somehow."
good,"First job. Learned a lot, laid foundation for customer service, coworkers were helpful and friendly. They really care about their employees and it shows."
good,Fast paced at times....enjoyed helping customers and working along side coworkers. Management celebrates most holidays with a great food spread for the employees
good,"Most associates are great to work with, management sucks. You only get to move up if you are close to managers and they are only stricken on certain people"
good,"a high traffic store that saw many customers, it required a strong work ethic and good people skills. those disinclined to get cement dust on themselves need not apply."
good,It wasn't very professional. Very unorganized and was sketchy about the manager. Never had the correct payroll so my paycheck was always messed up. The manager moved and changed the name of his company
good,"Its a nice place to work,everyone seems helpful and friendly. Ive only just started so theres not much i cans say about this job yet. So far my hours are good though."
good,"I have the privilege of welcoming all customers to Home Depot, ask if I may assist them in finding anything and direct them to the products they are look for with a smile on their face."
good,"a lot of advancement opportunities, if you are committed"
good,Its a good but you tend to learn things on your own.in order for you to get help you have to ask the right people. the associates are pretty hard workers and everyone is easy to get along with.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and time at work. They make you feel like family. Flexible schedules and many positions and opportunity to advance if you desire.
good,"Home Depot as a company has been very good to it's associates, they are always looking for ways to better their stores as well as make an awesome experience for the customers."
good,Working here was a good learning experience.  I gained valuable knowledge that I will be able to apply in future career opportunities.  Merchandising technics learned can and will be applied in future career experiences.
good,productive workplace they have a lot of great perks like 401k and options to buy stock in the company as well as bonuses ever six months they have benefit packages as well.
good,Management was help and supportive of what was to be achieved with the position. Senior leadership was very good at showing appreciation to the department as a whole.
good,Working with the Home Depot brought me new experiences and skill sets newly learned to my life. I recommend this place for steady job and lifestyle to get by.
good,"The Home Depot was a good place to work for a college student such as myself. I worked the freight team, my task was to take incoming freight and put it on the shelves. The work could be stressful at times, but overall I enjoyed working there for the two summers that I did."
good,They were able to work around my college classes and change my availability every quarter as my classes changed. They just didn't have the positions available that I was looking to move into after graduation.
good,Lots of room to have fun and get close to coworkers. Great way to stay active and make money at the same time. Flexible scheduling. Learned a lot of things.
good,Great culture in Tempe Call Center. Very customer focused. Limited opportunity for advancement. Great amenities for employees. Would recommend for entry level employees but maybe not management level employees.
good,"Good place to work, great bunch of people to work with. Enjoy meeting all different types of customers and helping them fix there household problems.."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you are going to school and need some money on the side. They work with you and give you a schedule that will work with your schools. I would not recommend staying long term if you are not into home improvement or gardening.  If you are than the Home Depot will be great and you will meet individuals with the same love for construction and gardening as you.
good,A typical day at work was about 6-7 hours. Management was very relaxed; a little too relaxed for me. Typical cashier job. My coworkers were so friendly!
good,Being a lot associate is fun and you get to be outside so you do face the elements. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you out. There are volunteer events you can do to help out the community.
good,"My duties as a service desk associate included assisting customers with returns, exchanges and work orders. I also provided excellent customer service with concern for customer needs. This job taught me how to provide satisfaction through excellent customer service and my knowledge of store policy and products. The workplace here was excellent but could be very fast paced."
good,Lots of room for advancement but the management needed a big change. If you are not getting along with managers then they give you a hard time. Other than that I liked going to work and seeing my daily customers .
good,A typical day would start with a store meeting then helping customers. I learned that landscaping is a big industry. The management was okay . The culture is alright as well everyone seems well informed in their departments.
good,"Company was limited to advancing within company. Company had a lot of product knowledge within company. Hours of operation were nice with set schedule,"
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the shift, counting down the cash drawer, making sure that you have all of your materials needed for the day. "
good,"Pay increases were not consistent with reviews. Customers are placed before employees, in most all situations. No holiday gifts,or, anything to relect appreciation, in a trustworthy way."
good,Help customers with orders based on their needs. Offer suggestions as to what would better help them. Took part in any training offered to better understand product so I could better help customers with their needs
good,"It is a very fun place to work with friendly people. There are always new thing to learn. also, one of my favorite parts of the job is dealing with the customers."
good,"working here was fun i had training in literally all of the departments the only thing i couldn't do was be a key carrier, that being said they will job snipe you and make you sit in your position forever.never really going anywhere in the company."
good,"The Job is a lot of work, especially as a Lumber Associate. Heavy lifting and knowledge of Construction is a big help. Although, the co-workers are nice, and it was fast-paced, but also balanced pace."
good,"Responsibilities included handling complaints, assisting customers, ensuring department was fully packed down and in stock at all times, and coaching and training associates."
good,"Great Work Environment. Opportunities to advance. I had fun working here. However, being a part time associate is not the best position if you want steady income. Had to try very hard to gain extra hours when they were available. Paycheck was unpredictable"
good,I enjoyed working for Home Depot. This position allowed me learn so much about Help Desk functions and allowed me to support and assist users of interior design software
good,"used to be a very good place to work. overall had good floor level associates and a general positive work environment. Salaried management seemed more a detriment than an asset. Focus shifted away from recruiting and retaining skilled and competent employees with proper compensation to low skilled, low payed temporary or part time workers."
good,"Really friendly people, quiet, helpful people. I would highly recommend this place to work. I think the only thing I would change is the break time, to long for the hrs you work."
good,Original staff that opened Hooksett Store.  A great work environment.  I worked Customer Service and interacted extensively with both customers and store personnel. I enjoyed my work thoroughly because it gave me a way to be of full service to my customers.
good,Had a lot of fun working here. slow paced job bt very exciting because theyre was always something new going on so everyday was basically a surprise which makes work exciting.
good,"It's a good place for high school kids or someone looking for a part time job. money not that great. Not really flexible with hours either, very hard to get full time"
good,"should train employees to advance within the company, the people there are amazing. helping the customers made the job fly by. there is too mush favoritism."
good,I worked each day to support the home depot dot come website.  This was a great opportunity to learn what to do and what not to do when building an enterprise ecommerce website.
good,Overall not a bad job. They could pay employees more for their work and time spent at the Home Depot. Stores need better management and work life balance
good,"The people I work with area great, we all get along and help each other out to complete tasks on hand. Have learned a lot about customer service. "
good,"my co workers are helpful,caring,team players ,good attitude my supervisor keeps me updated and does my reviews on time."
good,Being a cashier at The Home Depot was very fun and the shifts went by in a blink of an eye. I really enjoyed the fast paced environment and the friendly co-workers most of all. Home Depot is busy 24/7 so I was ringing up customers for most of my shift. On downtime I had to clean my cash wrap area and restock on supplies needed.
good,"good paying by hour, hour long lunch, nice people, some what good management, hardest part of job was learning everything, most enjoyable was working with co workers"
good,"There's always something to learn at The Home Depot. You'll learn simple basics around the house knowledge which will help you in your own home, for example on how to use the right adhesive on different surfaces, the right paint. How to use power tools and hand tools the correct safe and proper way etc. The Home Depot is a place where customers comes first at all times,  greeted politely and professionally. The most enjoyable parts of the job is finishing your given task in a timely manner and being able to move on to a next project. The hardest part of the job sometimes is the work hours (graveyard) and lifting heavy marchandises. At Home Depot we work as a team to achieve the goals of the company, our managers sets goals and gives projects to supervisors which passes down the information to crew members. Store Managers does your review and awards you for your great work."
good,The employees were held accountable and were driven to do the best they could for the customers. They provided training and knowledge for the employees in order to offer excellent customer service. They also were flexible with my college courses.
good,While working at Home Depot a typical work day can range anywhere from making a key from a customer to helping a customer plan for his or her garden. The spring is a busy time of year for Home Depot and for me as well since i work in the garden department. Customers value the suggestions of our associates and most welcome any assistance or input we can give in helping to make their vision a reality.
good,"My days were mainly stocking shelves and customer service. I learned how to drive two types of forklifts, the sit down forklift and the open reach forklift. Management were pretty nice there. they were actually on the floor helping employees complete tasks and helping customers find what they needed. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the hours. Most of the days in the week were as low as 4 hours. I enjoyed driving the forklifts and working with the employees. The employees were friendly and understanding"
good,I learned a lot here about  interacting with various teams and external clients. Also this position opened up many doors as far as reporting and developing my analytical skill-set.
good,I was a lot attendant. I picked up carts from the parking lot and helped people load there vehicles. I also worked in the store from time to time. great part time job
good,"Good management and great learning experience."
good,"The people made this job worth it. The management was great on a ""per manager"" basis, but the top of management did not effectively communicate with each other, causing a lack of a distinct plan for lower management. Much of upper management was only concerned with metrics, and much of lower management was only concerned with people. A better balance of concern for people AND metrics would benefit at least the store I worked in. Many problems were ""solved"" with a write-up, leaving much to be desired in regards to helping associates realize potential. Certain salaried managers treated people as a resource rather than an investment, and preferred the replacement method over the training/growth method. I left when the temperament of the store changed from positive to negative. The associates do genuinely care for the customers, however, and this still puts them above other similar retailers."
good,Breakdown pallets of products and place on shelf at customer level. Place remaining products in overhead shelf. Keep area clean and free of debris. Help customers
good,It's a good job nothing really changes and you usually do the same stuff everyday. the people are nice. Everybody usually does their own thing and you don't have to worry about the boss always being there.
good,"Self created leads through the Home Depot store for Window, Siding and Roofing install quote. Meet with homeowner's at their residence to measure and inspect for Home Depot installations."
good,"I enjoyed working outside and getting help people solve their problems.  Retail is challenging, and the random work hours were hard."
good,"The people you work with day-to-day are awesome, and typically very friendly and helpful. The work is rewarding, if sometimes repetitive."
good,"	1. Certified for three styles of forklift equipment "
good,"It is a good place to work the management personal are friendly and helpful. The employees are helpful and will help you learn your job."
good,Good People Poor Managerial Expectiations of Night Crew. Coworkers and Supervisiors for Night are great people. Deliveries and lack of inventory control lead to lack of space.
good,I really enjoy working with The Home Depot as a part-time employee. It's a great company to work for and the company offers great benefits to their employees.
good,"company has a great training program for sales associates, but good training isn't enough at the management level which is why some people have a bad experiences at the company. I have to say that most of my days have been enjoyable. I spend most of my time helping customers which is rewarding. next I spend time stocking and cleaning the shelves, as well as giving feed back to managers on how to improve customer service and work conditions."
good,"typical day at Home Depot is very busy and heavy. Assisting customers left and right, sometimes multiple people at once. But always insuring that the consumer gets what they need and has and overall satisfaction that I intend to give. One of the most important lessons that i learned here was Patients. I've been yelled at, had products rip, spilled, and thrown at me but have never lost ""my cool,"" I've always direct my customers with respect and well mannered persistence. I'd say what my biggest challenge would have to be being the only one in my department that has to many jobs at once, or having to cover for my fellow co workers. In all the thing i enjoyed at this place was the great people, or more like friends i had the pleasure of working with and till this day we keep in touch."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work and learn about the industry. It has changed a lot over the years and is a pretty good place to work. It supported for me a growing family and I was able to move on to better things.
good,"I liked the 3rd shift and this is where i began all my skills on different fork lifts, cherry pickers, and ect. Freight was well organized and the training was readily available."
good,Awesome place to work. Nice schedule. great understanding people as well. been here for almost 6 years and its pretty cool.
good,"I had no problems with management, they care about their employees. It is a fast paced environment and as long as you do your work you should not have a problem."
good,Good Company. Good pay. Good people to work with. Can be difficult at times but worth the knowledge and experience.Lots of fun!
good,"I was given the opportunity to learn many new skills with great training and seminars over my 10 years with HD. "
good,"great company to work for. the pay is decent. the people are friendly."
good,Home depot is always shorted staffed.  They can't seem to hire enough employees for their stores.  Some associates are well trained and can always answer customers questions.  The new associates struggle with this.
good,Very nice environment but they only offer part time jobs. Is a great job for a minimum income. They should give employees bonus for credit card sales.
good,"Home Depot is an excellent company if your just starting out. But it will take you years and years of excellence to obtain any real growth.  I enjoy my current job and the people I work with, but the fact is that I have been with the company almost 10 years and do not make 14$ an hour"
good,it was fun at first and a good place to work . They focused more on there numbers than there employees and they changed upper management alot.
good,This place i can say that i learned a lot of technical stuff in .Net Coding. Entire team was helping nature and my manager was a super cool personality..
good,"Great pace to grown and learn Greeted customer and make sure customer were taken care of. Cut lumber and  worked in the garden section. "
good,overall a good place to work I feel the pay was good and the people were fun to work with. I wish there was a little more communication with the management team
good,I worked the front desk. I checked in visitors and signed in delivery packages. I also patrolled the floors every hour. My manage was very easy going.
good,it was an ok job unless you worked in the lot. lot was one of those positions you would have hated to ever work unless you enjoyed the workout
good,"I left to pursue a better job with better pay. I enjoyed the job itself, the customers I dealt with, and all of my fellow employees and managers. I would not mind working here again."
good,Learn communications skills and working with other people. Customer service skills. Learn more about the department you are in. Wear an orange vest. Okay.
good,"This store is a good place to work. The management has always been fair, and friendly with me. The work itself is simple, yet also fulfilling knowing it will help someone make their home better."
good,A typical day at work will consist of customers complaints some laughter. I learned a lot about paint. Management was okay. The workplace culture was fun i made a few friends.The hardest part of the job working outside in lawn and garden during the winter.The most enjoyable was taking a hour lunch break.
good,I have worked here for a couple of years and its chill place to work. Just do your work and listen to what your supervisor says sometimes. Overall they want you to figure stuff out and get the job clean and neatly. Management will not bother you unless a customer complains about your service or your job performance is lacking. Keep it simple and handle what you can. Don't let customers overrule who are as a person. They will look down at you but that should not let that get to you. Just keep pushing and make your money. They will give you more hours if you are the best person in your department. You will get promoted faster if you keep doing something management likes.
good,"great co workers, decent management, however not a lot of opportunity's for advancement. small location but everyone works together and does their part."
good,"A very secure job place."
good,Home Depot gives you all the tools you need to do your job. Company values are great as long as they are adhered to. Sometimes hard working individuals are not properly recognized.
good,Daily routines included customer service on the floor and doing inventory in the back which of course entailed unloading trucks and stocking merchandise.
good,Worked for the company for 20 years. Started as a part time associate and worked my way up to being a Store Manager. I met many great people who have become like family. Teaching and growing associates and helping customers were the best part of my job.
good,"Good atmosphere, company values and associate recognition. Great customer service and values, but promotions in some area of the business can be difficult."
good,"The training at Home Depot is extensive and paid, but the best way to learn is on the sales floor. The work can often be stressful, but the workplace culture is generally pleasant and makes it easier to help customers with excellence. Management offers help and advice but delegates a lot of tasks, and there is very little promotion from within the company. Pay does not increase with minimum wage, so seniority does not mean best pay, in fact it's the opposite."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Has flexible schedule. Most employees are pretty nice and helpful. Recomend Tool Rental, seperate business within Home Depot."
good,"Very good place to learn, and grow in a IT setting.  Great place to work , overall great experience.. This was a wonderful first job."
good,It was fun working here. A little biased toward workers and as well immature employees. They also don't teach you the nessacsary skills you need for the job. They do compensate for hard work and reward you for it.
good,this job is a day to day kind of thing some days are great and others are ones where you just wish you could go home just like any other. for the most part working here is great the people I work with are the reason I have stayed for as long as I have and could not as for better co-works to go see everyday.
good,the schedule a few hours not enough to make some money by weekly. for being a sales associate and increasing the sales for home and garden department there were not profit or commission at all. no motivation and not incentives for sales. especially in lawn mowers and other equipments.
good,"Since I got promoted to the Special Services Desk, I mainly answer phone calls and direct callers and customers to the sales department of choice.  I release orders and check out customers."
good,"A typical day with the home depot is very fast paced. Leaving little room for mistakes, we are on the go as soon as our aprons were tied. I learned many things with this company and about myself while employed here, such as; new inventive ways to get the new credit accounts, how important building relationships with our customers is for the company and the improvement of customer satisfaction. We as Dept. Supervisors were always on the floor and available for customer assistance. The salaried management team is where the issues came in for myself. Being new to retail management, I found it difficult to find any support from my superiors on many occasions. This motivating me to move forward and become self-efficient, I excelled in my dept. The culture of this workplace was impressive. Everyone was consider family. The hardest part of my job was having to walk away from it. Other than that, i loved everything about The Home Depot. The most enjoyable part had to be building strong relationships with our customers each day. Getting to know them on a first name basis and learning about their families and other areas. We definitely prided ourselves on providing world class customer service."
good,"Good work environment, Good employees, and good customers. It is a great place to work and be apart of a work family. The store definitely has a family dynamic to it."
good,"I worked on the Met Team, that is different then working for the Home Depot. We worked for the vendors. You kept busy all the time, but there was always room for fun. Easy to make a career there."
good,"HD Pointe-Claire was a very fine job for me that I held for a few months. Unfortunately there were problems with the management in how they divided work amongst themselves (they would do all the work together, which seemed ineffective). It was a good experience dealing with customers and dealing with their needs. Great atmosphere and freat co-workers. Have to be on your feet all shift-long, but the feeling of helping clients made up for it."
good,"Was between jobs, and they hired and trained me quickly. Sooo many employees, but you quickly can find new friends and knowledgeable people. Typical frustrations of any retail job"
good,good opportunity for an entry level job. gives opportunities to move up. works with your schedule. if you're part time they let you pick up hours. sometimes scheduling is unfavorable.
good,"For me, the most enjoyable part was always working with customers and putting forth maximum effort to help them complete their desired projects, along with answering any questions regarding any of the products Home Depot stocked."
good,"Home Depot is awesome at putting it's customers first, but their employees are definitely at a close second. I learned a lot about home improvement techniques and products. Working at Home Depot was also a dynamic experience. I began as a cashier, and eventually taught DIY classes for women and children among other endeavors."
good,Its an good place to work they have a lot of fun events for associates and is generally a nice place to work. I personally like many of the people i work with there.
good,Working at Home Depot was a fun job. It was a great place to work as a cashier. Everyone at Home Depot was helpful and would teach you new things. I liked dealing with the customers on a daily bases.
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot, I just would have liked to get more hours per week.The environment was friendly and nice. I have nothing bad to say about them."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot would start off with a small meeting. then head to your assigned divert. Wait till the merchandises come down the conveyor belt and build the pallets from 6-8 feet tall."
good,it was an ok job there. nice co workers. boss was so-so. I would recommend for par time work. the store itself was understaff so u really had to learn as u go and sometimes no help at all due to all the customers. it was hard with dealing with all the people but the peole u worked with made it nice
good,"Customer service in store and over the phone, work your department, help other associates with there department, online training in store, learn slot of trades plus meet slot of business ppl"
good,it was fine working here alot of room to grow they where pretty generous with there bonuses when the store was doing good christmas partys and stuff we had to pay for our selfs
good,"Developed time management skills"
good,Knowledge building and fun work environment. Wages are fair but slowly increase. Advancement opportunities are minimum. An opportunity where you can learn and apply those things to your daily life outside of work.
good,"Working there was okay, but they wouldn't promote me due to a condition I have. Most of the people I worked with were kind, caring people, but there were quite a few that let their position in the company go to their heads. If you weren't seen as important, you didn't get treated with respect."
good,Don't give any benefits for part time workers. The atmosphere is nice. Customers are well behaved. The one thing bad is your hours jump all over the place.
good,Fun Place to work. Coworkers are friendly... Customers very pleasant Good company to work for. Home Depot management made working for the company easy..
good,"My typical day at The Home Depot was working an 8-hour shift.  I was either opening or closing the store and my main focus was customer service. My managers were understanding and cooperative and my co-workers were team players and very helpful. While the hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers, the highlight of my job was meeting new and friendly customers daily."
good,The home depot is a great environment for someone who wants to grow in their social skills and warehouse knowledge. Working for the company is a good experience because you gain in a various amount of skills
good,"This was a great part-time job.  The Home Depot is an overall good company but as a part time employee, you never knew from one week to the next what you schedule was going to be."
good,A typical day was tougher than others depending upon what day of the month it was. I learned a lot about time management and how to multi-task. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers gain more knowledge about banking and finance.
good,"Busy environment, consistently helping customers, Finding solutions to the customers needs, improvising, team work, taking on different task. Reaching daily sales goals."
good,"i liked working at home depot, the people were nice and had a friendly atmosphere but unfortunately, in my position anyways, it tended to be a little slow and then i had to leave due to personal reasons"
good,i was balancing 15 units while in school and 30+ hours which was kind of difficult with the late nights. my coworkers were people my age so it was a nice place to work but management wasn't really involved with anyone but heads of each department
good,"it was a very good experience"
good,Title says it all. Job was great. Management was aloof. Never really understood what they asked us to do our how we did it then set unreasonable expectations.
good,"At this location it is always something to do, I work in the paint department. I have learned to better work with different character types. Management is OK but I believe things could be worst but i am grateful the opportunity to work. My co-workers are good at times but i always make it duty to speak when i see them. For the most part my job only becomes hard I cannot satisfy the customer and the best about my job is just working with people."
good,I unload the freight from the truck and place them on carts that go to certain departments. If there is no truck then I go out on the floor and help customers where ever I am needed.
good,Nice to work for hire good people floor leads good upper management not so good don't have interest with hourly personal
good,"its a good company that believes customers are number one, but keep in mind that its important to know what you are selling and how to approach each cutomers needs accordingly, which takes time. ask questions and get familiar with the store operations as fast as you can comprehend. give it your all and stay positive. its very easy to get down if you are not led by the right leaders."
good,"Although the management and the way the Home Depot lets it's employees grow within the company needs some work, you still are able to meet and build relationships with people of many different backgrounds."
good,I typically work 4 hours during the week and 6 to 8 hours on the weekend. My coworkers are super friendly and make the day enjoyable. We have regular customers that like to come in just to see the same cashier checking them out.
good,"This is not a career place to work. Very few can make it as a ""career"". However it pays the bills and isn't a horrible place to work. There are perks through there employee discount program. And there is free wadder!!"
good,The best people I have ever worked with! I could not get a fulltime position and that's a big problem here. Pay is low and part-time is all they will work you.
good,"Every day you work hard to maintain your department to the high standards The Home Depot requires by attending to customers' needs, and by keeping the department clean and fully stocked. The management team treats their associates with respect and expects nothing but the best from them. Working there is fun and enjoyable, but sometimes you do get overwhelmed by the amount of work that is expected to be done."
good,The Home Depot is a good retail place to work.  They have an extensive training program.  Movement within the company is relatively easy.  They have better than average benefits.
good,I had a good experience of the company in the short time that I was there.  I learned a lot about different aspects of home improvement projects and had a wonderful opportunity to learn form contractors that frequented the department/store and helpful management.
good,"I learned a lot working there, only place where your management lead by example. Home Depot treats their employees good. We got extr bonus also did thanksgiving and Christmas parties for the employees."
good,I enjoyed this job and my co-workers and the customers unfortunately my health was getting to bad for me to continue to work there.  It was a part-time position to supplement my income due to my being a single parent.
good,Great company to work for had plenty of chances to learn.  Took care of employees with their benefits if an employee chose to take advantage of them at all.
good,Great people with a lot of knowledge in all different categories of home improvement. I enjoyed working with customers to solve all of their home improvement needs.
good,"All sorts of wonderful things for the home and yard improvement.  If it isn't in their store it is online. Many items coming in and out, be sure to watch for the advertisements."
good,"it was alright, it was also a great experience and there was a lot more work to do then people think. Also gave the opportunity to grow."
good,"Typical day consists of building and nurturing relations with contractors, to better understand their needs.  Recommendations on materials and processes are always welcomed."
good,Was a great experience to share and be part of the Home Depot team. Got along well with the overnight crew. Learnt on how Home Depot operates after closed hours.
good,"did a very good job with no training. i was top sales person over the average of other associates in my position. i took on projects, while trying to train myself. was let go due to jelousy."
good,"Love this place I had great coworkers and good friends working with me and had no problems with anyone, supervisor was awesome to me and the team overall a great experience"

good,Had lots of supportive employees. some of the customers were a joy to serve and I learned how to interact with difficult customers which lead to gaining some new skills.
good,I really enjoyed working for home depot. I just had moved and didn't have the transportation at the time. But I have transportation now and I'm very dependable.
good,Attending to customers and working as a team with your co workers. best part are the people you work with and the worst is the pay and dealing with angry or difficult customers.
good,"Applied my whole life to work for Home Depot and it finally paid off. I had fun going to work we did not have uniforms under our apron so it was very free cultured, and the people were friendly."
good,I enjoyed working for this company while I was I had a less flexible school schedule.  The room for advancement would occupy a large amount of personal time.
good,Colleagues are easy-going and are fun to work with. You can make great connections there due to the vast pool and different type of customers.
good,"Home depot is a wide spread company that has a lot of benefits  and is very friendly to its worker and cares four its employees"
good,The Home Depot cares for its associates in a way different than most retailers. They regularly take care of associates and customers in need. The ability to grow and learn is encouraged and praised.
good,"Its annoyingly disorganized, but management does its best to take care of employees. The stores focus mainly on hiring part time. They attempt to give you opportunities to move up."
good,I will recommended this job for anyone that is looking for a second job and extra cash. It is really flexible and definitely work with your time. very easy and great setting.
good,Good Place to work.  Crazy at times.  Difficult on the work life balance.  Communication needs work.  Lots of outside hires.  D
good,Every night I came in with my coworkers and our managers discussed our assignments for the night. It was a great job because of my coworkers and the teamwork they displayed with each other. The hardest thing to do there was just some of the objects to lift besides that everything else made the job enjoyable for me.
good,it's a job that for most I wouldn't see being a career unless you want to move up into management. not so easy to climb this corporate ladder.
good,Great family-like atmosphere with coworkers. frequent breaks and long lunches. Management was an issue if you were not a favorite in their eyes.
good,"Days at The Home Depot are enjoyable. A typical day at work is usually a smooth one. Put on that apron, clock in and hit the floor. I've learned that patience is key especially dealing with customer service and making sure people get exactly what they need is a number one priority. Management could be a little more helpful but are usually fun people to be around. Co-workers are great people as well, never an ordinary day that's for sure. The hardest part of the job is pay. I feel like promotions & rewards should be more frequent. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. From the Co-workers to the customers, the people I interact with everyday make it enjoyable."
good,The company is a good company to work for. Lots of compensations. I enjoy interacting with the customers and associates as well. The company does take care of it's associates.
good,It was our job to keep product where it needed to be in the store according to corporate guidelines. We would help customers if needed.
good,"good people, good pay and a low stress place to work. Supervisor is fair and great to work for. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs a job."
good,"Start early as the opening shift, would down stock the garden products and fill their home. Had an opportunity to work with some fun and genuine people."
good,For a part-time position is was fine.  Pay was a little on the low side and the required hours (24) was a little difficult with a full time job.  Advancement was achievable.  Work environment was very enjoyable.
good,"Geniunely felt like they cared at this place. Nice family vibe to thall the management. If the pay was higher, i could see my self stayin longer than i did."
good,"Enjoy working with people who work there, customers.  Have learned a lot and continue to about the retail world working here.   "
good,The home depot is a good place to work as long as you are not in lot if you are in lot you will work in the blazing hot sun all day wile lifting very heavy objects and be treated like garbage the whole time.
good,"A good place to work with room for advancement.  Management for the most part is fair and understanding.  Compensation for the job is not great, but overall it was a good experience."
good,It has great hours. Great pay. Great benefits. It was a great place to work around some very nice people. Customers were pleasant as well. Management was great.
good,provided excellent customer service and assisted all customers daily with household repair or remodeling needs. Gave positive feedback on daily sales and discounted products throughout the store.
good,very good environment for working at except for the usual people around that ruin it but other than that great place and chance to learn more to improve down the road
good,I liked working there because it was reliable i knew what my job would be to do everyday and it payed well. I liked that i was able to just do my work.
good,"Great work environment.  Teams worked together like family.  Good organization with wonderful benefits. Opportunity to grow and be promoted,"
good,I have enjoyed working at the Home Depot. The head cashiers are awesome and very helpful. The employees are kind and helpful.
good,I love to meet different people everyday. I learned about tools and stuff. Co workers are very helpful. Especially you don't know about tools. The hardest part is standing or dealing with rude customers.
good,Ok place to work at long at you dont jump into a new role and further your career. They ask why to much as a night supervisor and dont really let you run your crew like it needs to be.
good,"I was a cashier its the most basic job, pay is obviously minimum wage in Connecticut standards, the people at my location are great can't speak for the whole company itself."
good,they change your hours constantly and change policies too frequent add work loads with additional  compensation the cons out weigh the pros they want u to create a relationship with the customer to provide want product the cust. wants but rarely come through making u look like the idiot
good,"Good working atmosphere with colleagues and management."
good,"Most nights, by the time I arrive at work, the freight has already been unloaded and staged on the sales floor. The team and I work together to get all product stocked, organized, and all overstock is placed into the overheads."
good,Worked at Home Depot part time in hardware for almost a year making $8.00 an hour. It was alright and they treated me fine but would have like to make a little bit more for the job that I was doing. Would have like to make $10.00 an hour.
good,A typical day at work is very productive and busy. I love building displays and resetting bays and certain things that allows me to show my skills and learn new things.It also allows me to perform as a leader by showing my team members what it takes to perform professionally.Their is really nothing hard about me doing merchandising i enjoy doing it.Getting it done without having any complications that's what makes it enjoyable.
good,I have been w this company for almost 6 years. I love my coworkers and the job security here. My only issue is the pay raises and the lack of communication between management and the hourly associates.
good,"Very helpful and understand of career advancements, understood that I did not plan on spending a long time with them and were not unset when I gave them my two weeks."
good,Simple task would be to help customers check out. Help customers open credit cards if may needed. Hardest part of the job would be to stand in the same spot for hours and hours and your feet start to hurt. Co-workers are good and funny people I've met.
good,"Home Depot was a fun place to work because the people were great and if you were in a department you loved, it was fun. I loved working in the Garden Centre, you were always learning and nurturing."
good,"The hours here were not great, but I was busy most of the nine hours I was there. If i was to ever work at Home Depot again,  I would definitely want a day shift."
good,"Fast passed work "
good,"I would definitely recommend working at the Home Depot for several reasons. They have benefits, incentives to flourish, room to grow with the company, tuition assistance, as well as others. Management is great, pay isn't the best, however the customers make up for that. Would definitely go back."
good,home depot was a really cool job to work at. it was one of the most well balanced stores ive ever seen. everyone was so helpful in each dept..
good,Running around trying to keep up with customers and the department phone. Helping a customer create or recreate their dream to the best of you abilities.
good,"The employees were absolutely delightful, as it being retail, you will experience that one day. But the other days out of the month were great"
good,"I arrive to work at 5 am, and I pack down down the shelves to ensure what our customers needs are on the shelf. I learned how to reset shelves, shelf maintenance, and cashiering. The Home Depot have a great management team; furthermore, they are willing to go  the extra mile to help you grow in the company. My co-worker are great and that are an asset to the team. There is nothing hard or difficult about the job. the most enjoyable part is seeing the smiles on the customer face once they and completed their DIY project."
good,"overall good company with a family like culture, not much room for growth, management team is supportive. fun and laid back workplace"
good,typical day at work is being very busy I learned a lot of customers service skills hardest part of the job was not being to help others when needed most enjoyable part was helping customers
good,great place to work. great culture and environment. the pay isn't all that good considering its a multi billion dollar company but overall great place for a young worker to grow.
good,"Merchandised product sets. Set store to plan-o-gram. Setup/build product displays. Stacked warehouse items via forklift, transported products in shipping terminals. I learned different construction trades. Nice coworkers. most enjoyable was learning new things"
good,"They are great at customer service.  The employees are underpaid, but are well respected.  I advanced three times in the first year, but the pay was a little less than adequate."
good,"depending upon department and supervisor a overall fine work and fair work environment. though providing an at best erratic schedule, provides understanding and flexible managers and supervisors with a guaranteed part time job for years to come given that employee works honestly and consistently."
good,loading.lumber.and.driving.forklift.assisting.customers.with.large.purchases.stocking.shelves.greeting.customers.with.afriendly.smile.letting.customers.know.what.items.we're.on.sale.
good,"Advancement is possible in The Home Depot, you just have to vocalize what departments are interesting to you and keep upon the consistent work. Training is a high priority and it is a comfortable work environment."
good,Good work place. Good people. I stay busy for the most part. Very flexible with schedules and supervisors are very understanding and reasonable. Good career.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to collaborate with management and give your opinion on how to resolve issues. Things I learned there were how to properly use hand tools and heavy machinery to complete various tasks.
good,"It generally tends to be a bit boring. I love everyone I work with, even though sometimes when I call lumber to get me a SKU on a piece of wood without a sticker the man who answers is usually pretty grumpy. The customers are usually really nice, but, as it is retail, there are some not so nice customers. My favorite part of the job definitely has to be interacting with the customers. When checking customers out, they usually tell me about their projects, such as a new bed frame and furniture for their son who just grew out of his racecar bed (this man comes in a lot so he keeps me updated on his progress and I met his son, who is adorable)."
good,"I learned how to work with a multitude of people.  I learned conflict resolution and how to have great customer service.  I enjoyed working with these customers to find a solution that satisfied them but was still within policy and procedures.  I did find some customers were difficult to deal with and rectifying situations were sometimes more difficult that expected.  I did, however, enjoy making customers happy and sharing knowledge that I myself had learned there."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is a nice part time job to have while in school. The workload is relatively easy, my coworkers are nice people and there are occasional perks like free lunches. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,Work environment is an excellent public relations training ground as customer first is a corporate requirement.  Courteous and treatment of co-workers with dignity is also a must.
good,Home Depot was a very good place to work and all of the teams I worked with were fantastic.  It is a very collaborative environment.  There was also a lot of opportunity for growth if you were dedicated and willing to work hard.
good,The Place was a good place to work all the people there were good some way better than others other then that ok place to work.
good,Fast paced demanding distribution environment that require on your feet thinking and adjustments to support overall continuous improvement.
good,"We would start our days working in the bays with the product, checking the planograms, down stocking, cleaning, decontaminating, and organizing the overheads.  My co workers are very nice and we all work well together as a team."
good,Co-workers were always willing to help you. Supervisors and managers were pretty understanding. Able to work what hours you can monday - thrusday.
good,Show up to the work site and check in with my manager to see what needed to be done for the day and go on to complete my tasks. I was only there for a short while because i was looking for part time work and once the work slowed down i was let go.
good,"The Home Depot is a successful company that continues to change with the trends. Change frequently has an adverse affect on the employees - with restructures often comes job eliminations. "
good,"A typical day at work is nothing usual. Management is all good. Hardest part of the job is travelling and go home late. Most enjoyable part is nothing usual. Co-worker are fine. However, the supervisors should see the sacrifices of their employees in order to motivate them to work and performed well."
good,I enjoyed my time here and was over the front end (operations). I enjoyed the co-workers who had good work ethic. Management focused on the customers and their satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was supervising different personalities. I was able to adapt to the environment well and adjust to the different personalities. I enjoyed helping the customers find what they were looking for and providing great customer services.
good,Excellent employee benefits and opportunities for advancement. Flexible work schedules and a focus on employee well-being. Opportunity to advance from part-time to full-time and on to Specialist positions and team leadership opportunities
good,"I didn't work for home depot for to long, so I cant really give a full on review but what I do remember is the focus being on great customer service and depending on what brand you where working with, it being more or less tedious."
good,A typical day involved multiple scenarios with customers and employees alike. I especially enjoyed the interaction with customers. I learned the in and outs of appliances. I operated the equipment and tools to retrieve product and to help the customers.
good,Worked in flooring department great people had a great time enjoyed going to work . If anyone is looking for a great job with benifets !
good,it was an busy atmosphere and i enjoyed working for that company.Its a friendly workplace to to be in.Nice enviorment to be around.Its always busy and very full of tasks day to day.
good,The Home Depot as a company is a great place to work for. Upon employment you have to make sure that your system is clean because they do a drug test and start you off at a pay rate of $9.75. You will receive a bonus at the end of the year according to your store sales.
good,"good place to learn about marketing, also to hone you customer service skills. Employee turn over is huge. As an hourly employee the schedule will vary and weekends are required in most positions."
good,Working at the Home Depot has been amazing. The management really cares about you. Some times the work can be tough but rewarding.
good,Colleagues were pleasant. On site training provided the hires to be well versed in a multitude of <do it yourself> projects.
good,"I would consider this my first real world work experience, it was a very enjoyable workplace in which I felt I had the ability to build a career that I could be proud of. I seemed to be on the fast track to the top within this company, receiving several promotions and awards within the three years at the company, My reason for leaving was that I felt my management staff at the time did not have my best interests in mind, Also I thought that a better employment opportunity had presented itself."
good,Fast paced environment. Highly motivated and self-managed individuals will thrive. Great opportunity to grow and advance with the company.
good,"Atención personalizada a clientes profesionales, constructores, contratista y mayorista en modulo y/o sus instalaciones."
good,Everyone helps each other out. Customer service is #1. You can gain knowledge by training in other departments to help the customers and the associates.
good,Management is very respectful. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of customer needs. The hardest part of the job is working outside in the heat and standing on concrete for 8 hours.
good,"I loved my time at Home Depot. The managers were pretty flexible with my schedule because I  was also working at LA Fitness at the time. I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them find the supplies they needed. I was in the gardening section so, I learned a great deal about improving your garden and keeping your flowers and vegetables healthy. My co workers were very cool and helpful when ever you needed it. I just didn't like I was working in the sun but other then it was a joy working there. The pay was alright since I had two jobs wasn't too concerned with that but I still got good hours."
good,Breaks was short but constantly on your feet. Benefits was great. Get paid every Thursday. Long hours with little breaks.
good,"A day as a sales associate is demand but engaging. It requires walking at least 3 miles a day, climbing ladders and using pallet jacks, cleaning, merchandising and of course, helping customers. Because each department is so specialized and one cannot guarantee being in one's own department at all times, it's important to be able to think quickly on your feet and rapidly absorb information. There are a multitude of policies and procedures to remember and they change constantly. It does make it hard to be on the same page as your superiors. Another negative is the pay. The policies have changed recently making it harder to get to a living wage position. The benefits are often small but widespread covering everything from dental to pet insurance. Sick and vacation pay is offered to part-timers."
good,The working conditions were mainly really hot but the customer and coworker interaction is what made the job most enjoyable. Heavy lifting was definitely a requirement.
good,I am very good with customer service and money management skills. I am a very hard worker and get along with my co workers. I enjoy working with customers and I'm very good in math skills.
good,"On a daily routine at the Home Depot, I would come in and greet the associates. See what is new for the day. Head to the Service Desk. See how things are going. Find out that reports are done. Calls are made and if we have any issues that I need to take care of ASAP. I would then get into the system and see what is on the agenda for the day. Of course any customer that comes up to the desk takes priority. I would make sure my team is on the right track to get the credits we need and Pro-xtra that is asked for. Then I make sure to go over any metrics. This is all taken place while helping customers all ready been in the store and purchased  product and incoming customers. I would make sure deliveries are set into place and no issues are to be made. I have to direct my employees. Once that is accomplished I come out from behind the desk and greet and help customer achieve what they came in for. Each quarter I have to write reviews and give reviews. I have learned to manage multiple people and multiple tasks all through out the day. The most enjoyable part of what I do is working with a great team that truly is a team. We do our best up at the Service Desk to help customers and one another."
good,not a high paying job but has a good work environment and good benefits for full time employees. good if you'r between jobs or looking for part time job.
good,A business day consists of maintaining bays and assisting customers. Trying to do the work is like juggling multiple tasks at once and expected to complete them all by the end of the shift.
good,Days are usually long and very busy. Some days you have the nice and happy customers and other days you have the rude and unhappy customers. Management helps out as best as they can.
good,I enjoy working at the Home Depot because all of the associates and managers are supportive and willing to assist you in any way.
good,"working for home depot i would have to say was one of my best jobs. learning how to put down floor tiles, floor carpet or putting up wall tiles was a great skill to learn and being able to show other people how simple it was."
good,People wanted to keep pushing and no congratulations when I received a award. Not that much help! Supervisors took credit for ideas that were given but overall I enjoyed my years I heard I was not paid good.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work. The company maintains a high level of employee satisfaction, and provides top-notch service/products to its customers."
good,"Only negative thing I can say is that the company was very,very numbers driven, which prompted employees to cut corners to get their numbers."
good,I worked with this company for almost a year and found it to be a very flexible company to work for.  During my employment I learned a vast variety of new knowledge in the construction field.  There were a wide demographic of employees and had fair management.  The hardest part of the job was gaining the appropriate amount of knowledge to be helpful to the customers and in the long term found this also to be most enjoyable when I was able to apply the knowledge learned to assist customers with their needs.
good,"A typical work day was dealing with customer requests and complaints.  Good managers.  Co-workers friendly.  Hardest part of my job was having to work so many hours.  I was part time, but often giver over 30 hours a week, sometimes 40.   I am retired and looking for 20 hours at the most."
good,"Going to work is an adventure every day.  You just never know what to expect. Retail is very fast paced, although enjoyable because of the vast differences in people in general. There's nothing more gratifying than being able to help a frustrated customer and turn their frown into a smile!  I enjoy my co-workers and management team.

good,"Great company to work for."
good,"This was always a clean warehouse, top of the line equipment, thorough training. The building is so massive that there was always work to be done, opportunities to learn, and the climate was reasonably controlled in winter and summer months."
good,Work environment is always welcoming by the employees. Management is always there to assist us if needed when there's certain situations with customers.

good,"The pay is great, but the max hours you can get working Part-Time is 25 hours. There doesn't seem to be a lot of room for advancement"
good,A typical day at work starts by clocking in heading back to receiving to unload the truck from about 7pm-9pm. From 9-9:30pm is break time. 10pm we head to our departments to unpack the freight and stock the shelves. At times I'll Key Rec and document vendor paperwork.

good,Good job to have very demanding and its always work to get done. Management and coworkers are good people to be around. I've learned team work gets you far and that's a plus. Hardest part of the job is finishing on time. Most enjoyable part of the job is there is no weekend work.
good,its a great place to work and experience new things. the management team is awesome and willing to help and assist on anything you need

good,"constantly learning new cashier's responsibilities, coworkers and customers friendly."
good,"Home Depot was your typical cashier job, employees were always fun to be around. I got a lot of more experience working with a cash register and handling money, especially handling it at a faster pace. Can definitely say I benefitted from it."

good,"Good Company"
good,"learned different types of wood uses and forklift safety and driving skills,   "
good,"Early mornings begin with loading storage vehicle with multiple windows of various sizes from a warehouse. Upon arrival to customer's home, steps were taken to ensure efficient demolition with minimal untidiness. Most or all windows are installed throughout the shift, with few breaks in between. Shift ends with loading old demolished windows and frames into storage vehicle, which is disposed on the following day."
good,"enjoyed working for the company, they did lots of activities for there employees... fun, fun, fun... plenty to eat at store BBQs"
good,"Typically I start an hour before customers show up and get started on tacks management deems necessary followed by cleaning the aisles and bay to make the store presentable. Currently I am being trained in the process of electrical wire handling and the installation and disassembly of all electrical parts and products for displays."

good,"Typical day was working on a register and handling money, while helping customers get what they want.The management and workers are easy to get along with and everyone there was very friendly."
good,watering/cleaning. didn't really learn much. management was all over the place. everyone was nice. I wanted to help customers but it distracted me from my watering tasks (according to manager). I liked helping the customers.
good,"You're typically busy, managers will help you out on that. There are a lot of back up cashiers, customers are nice. Coworkers are great. A typical day is not very hard, just keeping yourself busy. The best part of working for Home Depot is they have cook outs and rewards for employees."
good,Came in once store was closed. Unloaded the overnight trucks. Broke down the pallets and then stocked shelves with merchandise.
good,"Management very supportive, and helpful. New experience in the retail sector. Hardest part of the job was working weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job was operating in a consultative role with and providing product knowledge to homeowners. Received many e-mails, from homeowners, extolling my services."
good,I was able to go from cashier to garden center to flooring and at each transition I was able to see a different need from the customer. This gave me a full understanding of the buying process each customer encounters as they shop.
good,Working at Home Depot I kept busy in every department.  Home Depot is a great company to work for and the people were great.
good,"The overall store in all departments is a very good place to work,most of the employees are helpful with customers and each other."
good,Home Depot wa a good experience. I learned a a lot about hardware because I worked in mostly the hardware section. For some time I worked overnight which was not the easier but I ended up enjoying the job because of the amount I learned.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. They will work with your schedule but you will be expected to work weekends. They usually start out at 10 an hour. They usually will hire part-time only.
good,"Leared about all the required equipment,material and tools needed to use in the construction field. A very big part plus to having this job. I was able to ride my bike to work to save money being so close to my home."
good,Home dépôt est un endroit agréable a travailler mais l'avancement est dure a se procuré car peut de poste ne sont pas plafonné donc si se n'était que le fait que je veuille grandir et m'épanouir dans une compagnie je resterais a cette endroit mais du a mon ambition je dois changer d'endroit dans le but dans faire une carrière.
good,This is a good company to work for. They are open for more then 12 hours of the day so there are plenty of hours. You are always encouraged to learn more. The only limitation in advancement in this company is your willingness to learn. The best way to go into this job is to be a sponge. Absorb everything. Not just your job duties but learn about as much as your can. Many of the seasoned associates love to share their knowledge so take advantage of it. You will be a Do-It-Yourself-er in no time.

good,"It was a decent job. The managers and the other employees just need to respect every possible worker, by that i mean lot associates."

good,L'entreprise donne beaucoup de formation qui peut être utile pour le poste occupé et dans la vie personnel
good,The home depot is very excellent company that helps their employees both in personal life and work life. their number one prioty isthere people and saftey. its always enjoyable to come to work when it feels like a family and everyone works as one and towards the same goals to move up and to help customers.
good,"starts off with morning meetings about the days goals ahead. "
good,"the work day went good everyday and how it was supposed to. although i was told that the manager was tough on his cashiers that didn't put me down, but instead encouraged me to try to impress him everyday. Granted the fact that i would probably only see him 4 times a week."
good,"I learned a great deal about managing time and people, there ahs to be a balance. Most challenging part of the job was tough conversations with associates. Most enjoyable, was working the such a great group of individuals."
good,Strong Corporate Values for a large organization.  Senior leaders are ususally very strong while middle management needs to polish social skills
good,"Productive and enjoy working for customers and being of service, being able to sale credit applications and knowing that I have help."
good,challengeing and sometimes overbearing it was fun interacting with the public. some of the product was heavy and hard to handle
good,Was a good environment to be in while I was in college and enjoyed the people I was working with. I learned a lot about myself through this job and what potential I have when pushed to higher levels.
good,"Its a very Customer driven company and i always appreciated that. The company really cared about their employees, many beneficial programs and supplied the necessary training and tools."
good,Great co-workers but not at all flexable about the hours. you must be willing to learn about all the departments and the products they offer.
good,Home Depot is a very supportive company that genuinely cares about its employees.  Management does whatever it can to help out at work and to accommodate the personal lives of the people that work there.
good,the people i work with are pretty cool and knowledgeable but the management usually are nowhere to be found. Regular customers know us by name.
good,"Satisfactory Management, excellent staff and an appreciation of the job being done. Not many full time positions available despite the hard and dedicated work shown."
good,"overall good flexibility"
good,"I worked in the tool rental department where I Would perform per-maintenance check and service on all machinery, electric concrete hammers, carper cleaners, augers, electric drills / nail guns / staplers, etc."
good,Benefits and pay were wonderful. Building had a habit of hiring supervisors with little understanding of the job they were to supervise. Each work day was interesting and provided a challenge to training and knowledge.
good,The job was exciting. Didn't pay to well but was very upbeat. Allowed me to learn different cultures and people. Was fun making orders and call customers.
good,It was a fairly decent job. I worked overnight.  My coworkers were alright for the most part.  hardest part of the job was the amount of time projects took.  Most enjoyable part was finishing them.
good,"Typical day includes setting up work area to receive incoming freight."
good,As I stated  before I enjoy working for Home Depot.I believe I have obtained enough knowledge to provide great customer service in the Retail Industry.
good,"Management was politically motivated and not willing to provide the proper support necessary. "
good,"Fast pace environment ,great co workers alot of team effort. During the slow months the hours are cut to the bare minimum. Hard to move up in the company"
good,"People are great, hours were good. I enjoyed my time there. Lots of customer service and learning about the things that are sold."
good,I would receive incoming freight and materials. Stocking was required to do mostly at night. Freight had to be identified and staged  at the proper location. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was accurate. It was great when all things checked out.
good,"There is always something to do at The Home Depot, never a dull moment. Overall, there are a lot of good hard working Associates that drive that business on a daily bases from the corporate exec's to the Apron's on the floor."
good,"Cashier"
good,excellent customer service as each associate will make sure that each customer that enters the store leaves happy and will return.
good,"Never a dull day. The most enjoyable part of the day is just being able to help the customer and put a smile on their face. One day I just walked up to a gentleman, who was frowning up, and I just said, ""Hi, how are you doing today?"" He suddenly smiled and stated that he was doing just fine. He is a regular customer now. Every time we see each other we make sure we acknowledge ones presence."
good,"Flexible scheduling, good benefits for part time employment, good co-worker relationships.  Supervisor is fair and reasonable and always willing to listen and very helpful."
good,"very fast paced atmosphere that really encourages creativity to problem solving. Not only is it asked, but it is expected to work long/weekend/late shifts in order to acheive goals."
good,"The home depot is a great place to start when getting job experience. unfortunately, the management is not consisted at times. not a very well organized cohesive unit. My day at work was fun, but monotonous. My coworkers were great. the hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day. the most enjoyable was the cashier appreciation."
good,"Managers have there pick and tend to over look the hard workers. Its very hard to balance nights, weekends and family whit the late hrs."
good,The Home Depot Supply Chain has a great culture and core values.  Benefits are expensive and growth is limited within the supply chain network only.
good,good place to work with supportive management. a lot about the numbers but will help you grow and develop. Just work hard and don't worry about the other person.
good,"Interactive place to be around others, was a diverse atmosphere, only thing was that management was not so supportive at times"
good,I like this job and the people nice but I really wish they would pay more money. the benefits are great and job work/life balance is good.
good,I like everything about home depot  from the staff to job itself. Everyone is motivated and family oriented. they also have a lot of perks and benefits that really don't pertain to them but beneficial to your everyday life in general. their support system is stellar.
good,"A typical day in Home Depot included everything from helping a variety of costumers, to stocking a variety of products. I learned how to treat costumers right, how to manage my time, how to set up my priorities and the importance of teamwork."
good,"Hardest, physically, job I ever had and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. However, the most rewarding aspect of working at Home Depot is instant customer satisfaction. An employee process is based on the last customer served, and I have received many praises and thanks from 99% of my customers."
good,"This is a fast paced environment with a lot to do.  There are always orders that have to be filled, and constant up keep of the inventory at hand."
good,"Excellent workplace with supportive management, Great benefits and opportunities. I became a manager at The Home Depot, 5  years ago and I have learned many traits and skills that have prepared me for my future in leadership, the hardest part of my job was not being able to motivate 100% of the associates to be successful in their career. The most enjoyable part was providing outstanding customer service."
good,Overall good company. Working with the customers was rewarding and challenging. Working at the center can be challenging as you are in a desk taking calls for the most part of the day.
good,"Home Depot was a great environment with people always trying to assist one another, assuring that the customer's experience would be positive"
good,"Enjoyed working with customer, challenging and lots to learn. Like to learn about other departments, so I could help out in all departments."
good,"I liked working at Home depot but it seems like business is better when the economy is better. If people aren't building then business is slow, like in the winter months."
good,Great work atmosphere. It is a very upbeat positive work environment. Upper management is outstanding and they seem to really care about their employees.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at The Home Depot and learned skills that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. It all comes down to the store manager, which can change at any time. I had managers who were all about the business and talked and taught GMROI, inventory turns, merchandising strategies and the like. Others were all about the human interaction and everyone got an award at every meeting and get-together along with all the sweets you can eat. My last manager was all about being a cheerleader and wanted we department heads to have theme songs, department cheers and high fives for every associate. In all cases the company had moved more and more to a 'lets try this' strategy of management. Rather than developing and mastering the skills that most drove sales, we were constantly implementing new policies and procedures, more often to the detriment of the business than causing any improvement. At which point we were told it was the way we implemented their policy that caused the down turn rather than the policy itself being less than a good idea. No policy was ever revered, it was just replaced with another new policy rather than admitting the original way was the best. Frustrating for someone like me with more than 25 years of operations experience who knew a bad idea when he heard it (i.e. A 50 foot trailer loaded nose to tail and floor to ceiling with individual loose boxes rather than on pallets to save freight costs was to start coming 3-5 times per week. There's a reason they invented forklifts and pallets and there's a reason the trucking industry generally only"
good,I had a great time working for the home depot. they foster a comfortable work environment and encourage associates to get to know one another on a personal level. there is a lot of opportunity to advance in the company if one so wishes.
good,It was a job. I definitely would say everyone helped make it a productive workplace. I was looking for something more stable and long term.
good,"It's fun working at The Home Depot. When I first started working here, I didn't know what to expect. Four years in and I still can't believe how far I have come as a person. I never use to like talking to random people, but being a cashier forces you to do that. Talking to strangers and having a full out conversation about nothing is amazing! Knowing that you are giving your 100% best to the customer and making sure they are satisfied before they leave the store is what I love best about working here!"
good,was able to get to know people on a first name basis. The contractors that came in every day to purchase odds and end things.
good,"Home Depot is a largest and most successful home improvement company in world for good reasons. Emphasis is always placed on the customers and the Home Depot associate take pride in providing great customer service. There is allot of room to grow your career at the Home Depot, and both part time and full time associate receive numerous employment benefits. The home Depot is an all round round great company and it provides associate with a great work experience everyday."
good,"Great Company to work for. Great Benefits for part time associates, company is not as flexible as it seems but my manager was willing to accommodate me with my scheduling"
good,"The job currently has heavy demands, resulting from company staffing, and pay restrictions, and high work load demands with an emphasis on negative documentations for performance versus positive reinforcement."
good,forklift on this job was a habbit everyday i use the fork 4 5 times a day moving crates and things around the warehouse i enjoyed it
good,"Strong, solid company with multiple benefits for employees.  Supportive learning environment. Networking with other departments encouraged. Great community outreach programs."
good,"Working with a verity of machines and programs."
good,"assist customers on a daily basis with product questions, great place to work because there is room for growth.  Hardest part of this job is that you have no down time."
good,"Fast-paced customer service environment. Coworkers are very supportive of each other, but management keeps adding more responsibilities outside of the job description."
good,"Approach customers and identify their needs. "
good,A typical day working as a merchandiser consists of resetting bays full of merchandise to effectively sell them to consumers. Sometimes your work is undone by store associates making it a bit frustrating. The hardest part of the job was the constant heavy lifting and resetting of bays. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with coming together as a team to accomplish big resets.
good,I really like the job it is very informative and I learn something new everyday. I drive the forklift for most of my shift and its great just putting things up but don't get me wrong the job can be pretty strenuous at times.
good,Home Depot was a fun work environment while the store was open. It was always exciting to meet new people and help them with the projects that they were attempting to do. It could sometimes be a challenge to assist and explain what they needed to do their projects. You sometimes needed to have knowledge of various products and what they would do but management was always very helpful in providing the training.
good,It was a fun experience working for Home Depot. I enjoyed most of my coworkers. They were always smiling and having a good time. Home Depot did a lot of volunteer work for Retired Veterans which I was able to participate in and loved. The work place overall was great. The only issue I had with them was not being recognized for everything each employee did to help better the work place and help the company. I saw so many employees who worked there for many many years. Some even started working there when the store first opened that never once received credit for doing amazing things for the store. They also made it very difficult to advance in the work place. There was a huge lack of self development for employees. Overall though it was one of the best jobs I had. Working one on one with customers was a great experience for me.
good,Home Depot is a great company. The benefits are great. But there is a very little chance of going up in the company on the MET side of Home Depot.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, my only issue was it was only part time (and I am a single mom of 2 kids). There is so much there to learn about and management was always happy to find out something for a customer, and they were always out on the floor just like any other associate. I liked the busy aspect and the fact there was always something to do like restock shelves, sweep the floor, load or unload tile or any other type of flooring or blinds. Just like any other job it could be very stressful, when it was busy or a customer was rude no mater what you said or did, but it always worked itself out."
good,"Nice people to work with. "
good,Great place to learn about home improvement and building materials. Customer service is a most and it is a fun work environment.
good,"It was exciting being in contact with diverse customers working in different projects, and learning something new everyday."
good,Fun and fast pace work environment.  Interfaced with customers directly.  Learned most of the software for processing special and online orders.  Depended on co-workers for help when software processing problems were encountered.  The hardest part of the job was getting associates in other departments to answer the phone when customers called and I could not answer their questions because they were very specific to their department.  The best part of the job was helping and getting to know the customers.
good,This was a fun place to work. Loved working with people and hearing of projects. Management always having parties to show employee appreciation.
good,"Working at the special services desk meant you were back up to other departments, like returns and front end cashiers, as well as processing orders for special order products."
good,working within this location has advanced my knowledge and patience and understanding. It has allowed me to develop a rapport with many customers that frequent my place of work.
good,"My main daily position was a lead generator, which was a coach to fellow employees to gain leads for projects and jobs for the store. I also worked all areas of the store, electrical, hardware, lumber, kitchen and bath design, paint, pretty much all aspects of a home improvement store."
good,Home Depot prides itself on customer service and they give excellent customer service.  The customer always comes first.
good,I find The Home Depot very exciting and would have loved to remain if they could avoid some politics and favouritism which is more pronounced at 47th Western  Blvd and the idea preferring temporary workers.
good,company is very team based in relation of all the departments that they control. in addition each of the supervisor will try to improve your skills and your knowledge as time progresses on.
good,"*hours 6:00AM -10:00 AM and one weekend day. Opening safety check list each day."
good,"Good place to work. Nice management people re nice helping out customers. Hardest part difficult customers, enjoyable knowing t customer got what they came for"
good,I help customers in properly choosing the correct product for their needs.  my coworkers are really easy to work with along with the Mgmt staff.
good,"Excellent job opportunity, that gives employees the chance to familiarize themselves with working at a fast-paced business. I was able to attain knowledge on customer problem solving, department maintenance, and forklift operation. All in all good experience."
good,An okay company to work for. some benefits. Yearly bonus non existent. Retail company that only cares about the money that comes in.
good,I gained a lot of job experience working in the tool rental department.  Training opportunities and the ability to work on small engines was a plus.
good,i really enjoyed interacting with different customers and assisting them with the things they were looking for. I worked in different parts of the start where they needed me.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits. strong higher level leadership. great place to grow if you starting off. endless opportunities."
good,"I would come in unload trucks, stock boxes and drive lift equipment. They underpay in my opinion for people who are lift equipment certified."
good,"Everything about this job fun, enjoyed working with different people from different cultures. we would have icebreaker activities that will allow a lot of us to interact."
good,"nice company, they care for their employees."
good,As a Night Crew Manager I learned to much thing and they certified me as a Forklifts operator. Also they gave me a very good salary and commissions.
good,Hard to move up unless you relocate but overall it was a great place.I had a very positive time there just left for a promotion with another company.
good,There was a clear focus of hierarchy in this store. You always knew that there were favorites in every department which had the choosing of what work they did if any. The managers just seemed to over look this fact.
good,"The overall job is enjoyable.  You get to meet so many wonderful people, and as a designer you get to work on project with a giant range of budgets."
good,They were very understanding of my college schedule and I enjoyed the work that I did over the four years that I worked there.
good,"Great company to work for.  Definitely an environment that is fast paced and decisions have to be made at any given point to impact whether or not the building will be successful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, they make it worth coming in."
good,Home Depot is a good company with a good environment and enforcement on Customer Service. The atmosphere is a friendly one the take care of their employees and customers.
good,The Home Depot is a good company with good benefits. Though the stores themselves are varied to work for. Nearly everything from hiring to the lighting of the stores and heating and cooling. This can cause some issues and disconnections for the employees and customers.
good,"Great fast paced work environment, Get to solve customer issues and save the day. Upper management was smiles to your face but different behind your back. Company is not longer the loyal, truly customers first store that it once was."
good,"customer associate,alot about new tools .good management,co-workers very helpful .nothing hard about the job,cook outs every other week only during your lunch break !"
good,Dealing day to day differently because no two days are the same.  Unloading a truck or pulling down a pallet.  Volunteering at a VFW for a veteran in need.
good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
good,"Management and leadership staff were very supportive. Promotions were encouraged through management and staff. There was cross training available to associates. However, pay was not the greatest."
good,"Hours change each week, trades experience encouraged, evening hours regularly scheduled. Can be a very physical place to work."
good,Nice place to work and the people are ;like family. You learn a lot each and every day. you learn as you go in all department.
good,"Working at home depot provided me with life skills i will use forever as long as i am a home owner.  The training i recieved for the products they sold helped me make choices in my own life about quality and value for my own needs when comparing products. "
good,"you have to watch out politics will bite you and no will help"
good,A job with high pay for retail meaning they can treat people terribly. Very bad management and the effort to educate is stripped down to the bare essentials.
good,i would go in for my shift and I would bring in carts and load what customers purchased. management was good. my co-workers were helpful with the exception of a few. the hardest part of the job was when I needed help from co-workers but they would refuse and not want to work as a team. the most enjoyable part was when we all worked together as a team to complete a job.
good,Fast paced company where you can work in several departments which provided job variety. On the job training was provided which was a great motivator. Very flexible with shifts as this was a second job for me.
good,"The people are cool and there is always room for promotions.  Always work to be done, not hard to obtain management. roijglerhlkjfnkb rgoihoerighge ehqerognjkfdnk afoerfnfg aojgjggoprepjoj"
good,"i work as a team, stock, help customers, answer phone calls, and resolve problems."
good,Straight forward directions of what needed to be done and reasonable deadlines. Great environment and great people too.
good,I like the environment just would like more hours and enjoy my time while at work. At the present time they are not looking to hire any full at the present time.
good,"When ever I worked at Home Depot I enjoyed myself. the customers were always nice with me and I with them. Never once got a complaint from a customer. Management was cool. The hardest part of the job was operating the forklift, which I got use to quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was cutting lumber for customers. Overall this was one of the best jobs I ever had."
good,"Fast growing company. "
good,"Fast pace work place,trained, cashier,computer,money handling,schedules,many more job duties.Enjoyed customers and co-workers.I like staying busy knowing there is always something to do and learn."
good,Overall a Good Company to work for. Room for growth and development. I worked for only one year but the company afforded very good accomodations and training to Employee
good,Home Depot was a fun place to work. Assisting customers is priority along with keeping the store at top appearances. Management was very helpful and good with its employees. Co-workers seemed happy with the company as a whole. Availability to work in different department of the store.
good,"Good place to work with supportive management . Very customer service friendly work environment. Good benefits, health care plans"
good,"Great place, great people, but not everyone can give 100% all the time. Not home depot as a company fault they give you all the training you need but the human error that is done is what sets it down."
good,"Ring up sales, maintain knowledge of most products and services offered by company, provide excellent customer service"
good,Great environment to learn and advance.  The company gives you the resources and teaches you the necessary skills to give great customer service.  All associates learn many great skills while being employed at Home Depot.  Family type culture and decent benefits to FT associates.
good,They will accommodate your schedule but compensation is not appropriate for the work they want you to do. Management plays favoritism at times.
good,I like the work place it was like working at c and s but i would pick orders. The Management knew what they were doing and the employees also
good,"* fast pace"
good,"Interesting business model. Based on promotion from within for the most part. Double edged sword there as any business owner will know."
good,"Great, awesome! The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the Human Resources Department. The owner of the site is awesome!"
good,"In all honesty, I really liked my co-workers there. The down side is that the management plays favorites and doesn't give you much opportunity to progress unless you're friends with management."
good,Typical day at work would consist of me keeping aisles neat and clean for customers to have an easy going shopping experience.
good,"When my employment began at The Home Depot, I was intrigued by the foundation this company expressed as a way of life.  Its Value for its people and sincerity was appealing to me.  Although this still may remained as important to the company I slowly realized that each different store had different practices that may not be acceptable to people in general.  I enjoyed most of all working with co-workers and customers as I genuinely cared about the needs of people."
good,Working at Home Depot taught me how to communicate and to have patience with others . My days were usually pleasant and I got alone with all of my co-workers . I would have to say the hardest part of my job was learning the material and where things belonged but after I got in the hang of that it mad my job much easier .
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work at. However, at the particular location I am at, I do not feel there is fair promoting. I work my butt off and I need to be on the sales floor."
good,"Fast pace work, its a big company so they are definitely about their numbers, I learned a lot from this company was able to excel and use my skills to make job easier."
good,working is dictated by the surrounding weather conditions which can reduce the effectiveness of your performance. the team is very effective and cooperative providing necessary support when needed.
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. Benefits are fantastic. Associates are given every opportunity to advance their careers.
good,"Very good company, unfortunately there is too much politics in the stores. Its very hard to get promoted, you need to work hard but you have the opportunity to be creative building displays, endcaps and other situations such as Holidays, Clearance events etc."
good,"A very decent place to work for in terms of Retail, there is a consensus of care for workers and at the same time care for customers."
good,"Pouring concrete in the heat for 13-14 hours a day can be a wear physically. Other than that, not a stressful job at all. We all worked as a team to keep our spirits up on those long days."

good,like early shift good place to work good training system people fun to work with truck days were long some days but good keeps you busy

good,great place to work. you learn a lot. you know a lot people and share experience. its fun. and the company its like a family.
good,"A regular day is a day that has its moments of ups and downs. It is filled with stres and then someday are very low key. I have learned that people are the same anywhere you work and by it being a service oriented industry that humans will be humans and they are only there for a moment. When the management is working together, the store runs like a well oiled machine, but when they do not, it is ran by everyones own agenda. The hardest part can be testy customers but I understand they just want a service performed. M co-workers make it worth while."
good,"Home Depot is a great company - the co-workers are a wonderful bunch of people and there is constant room to meet more. I have made some wonderful friends and some great memories. Home Depot has shown me what I want to do in life as a career and that is Human Resources. It has been 13 years with them and I have learned a great deal about life, work experience and retail in general. It is a great place if you are a student looking to get through school or also for someone who is retired and looking to keep busy."
good,"If you've worked retail before then you know how it is. A lot of customer interaction. Some departments require heavy lifting, some departments are customer service heavy. The one thing I noticed with our store was that I can go weeks on end without seeing a salaried member of management and this is not an exaggeration. However, I am a self starter and I require very little supervision plus the job is not exactly rocket science or anything close to it. But on the other end of the spectrum, there will always be those that take advantage of the management style or the lack thereof. Pay is at par with other retailers. Workload is also at par. Benefits are on the downside. Part-timers only work 29 hours. The thing I love about Home Depot (at least our store) is that they work with your schedule."
good,"I could always count on a good number of hours and a helpful staff of managers. The work place was always kept at a fast-moving space, but was reliable and consistent."
good,Customers was good employees worked hard and mangagment had an eye out for those who can grow there. but not much hours were given out.
good,"First job as a young adult worked hard. great experience, enjoyed everyone i worked with. only problem only scheduled about 15-20 hours week.."
good,"This was my favorite position in retail since leaving the Marine Corps. Just weeks after starting in my position, I had to take a few weeks off for a family emergency and the store manager was very easy to work with on it. I would do this job for Home Depot again if it still existed."
good,"Fun at times, very fast pace, customer oriented.  "
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and my employees. I learned almost every department in the store and could almost do anything in the store. We all worked together as a team. I helped customers, placed orders for product via computer, did inventory, and stocked shelves mostly. But I was continuously learning new things every day about other departments."
good,I was in a fast paced phone center.  I learned how to look up all prices and calculate home improvement projects.  I was part of an exclusive team that supported all sales departments by alleviating most phone questions by looking up the answer myself to provide instant customer satisfaction.
good,"Drive the floor cleaner around on the warehouse floor and pick the trash cans and eaty in the compater . How to oporator fork truck, pallet jacks, and seserlitf."
good,"Loved coming into work and having a smooth day with coworkers and customers. Come in and set up cash register, and helped customer with their transactions and refunding their product. Love to see all the happy faces walk through the front door."
good,"Crazy! Every day was different. Somedays I would spend most time loading peoples vehicles with a forklift, others I would be assisting customers with projects they had questions about, and sometimes I would just be ringing people merchandise up. Just depended what they needed at the time being. Management was all over the place. Originally management was great, knew how to get a job done and knew how to market things and wasn't afraid to try knew things or hear an employees idea. After management went to bigger stores we got stuck with demoted managers from higher volume stores that did not know how to market, or try knew things and it hurt sales. The coworkers were great for the most part. Everyone helped each other out, it was a team effort working there. The hardest part was being the middle man between customers and managers. A customer would have a problem, the manager would either try to solve it or leave you to hang and deal with the customer. Didn't happen often but when it did you were generally stuck resolving a problem a manager did not want to deal with. Being able to walk around freely and assist customers with their projects and see them next week or even the next day just to tell you how the project went. It felt great knowing you helped someone."
good,"Home Depot is a respected place to engage in employment, it has opportunities for growth and there is some satiability at the company."
good,I learned a lot.  I worked various departments.  Training was not the best.  Management has favorite cliques.  Favoritism runs rampant.  No one wants to drive the machines which is a required part of the job.
good,"Great company with great benefits. management is great and if in school, they can be very flexible . Also, a lot of room to grow within the company."

good,"Working the 3rd shift is very zombie like when you have a family of five. Its great to have a set schedule though, its a great company to work for."
good,Home Depot was overall a great place to work while I was in college. I was able to balance work and school pretty easily and I liked my coworkers.
good,I am a new Associate  and wish I had the complete training prior to assuming responsibility of cashier. The Front End Supervisors or Head cashiers are at times brash to the cashiers and are not willing to do on the spot training (Some) effectively.
good,"This is a good company. I have learned how to operate a forklift and I've learned the ins and outs of retail. My co-workers and I are positive driven people. It is a fast paced environment involving customer service, online orders and working closely with management."
good,It was a very fun environment to be in. Everyone was always willing to help. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was pushing credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing what people were building.

good,"customer service, learned more about electrical department, decent communication with management, loved my co-workers they became more life a family. hardest part would have to be the stubborn men who believed women shouldn't be sales floor associates.

good,"A lot of political games. Certain managers tend to favor those who brown nose and do not bother to do the full extent of their job while others who are doing their job and not brown nosing get into trouble and do not advance., If these managers were taken out of the situation it would be one of the best companies to work for in this field."

Helping a customer complete a project they are working on is the focus much of the time. To ensure that the customers' projects get completed, they need the correct tool to do this.

good,"A typical day at work was fast paced. First thing i would do is check for notes in the home depot system to see if there is anything that needs addressed immediately.  If there was any kitchens that needed worked on I would work on those and prepare for others to be sold. I would also assist walk in customer with their needs. if an item needed to be pulled down ( i would use a forklift, reach truck, order picker, etc.) I would assist on getting it down for them, if the needed advice i would provide that for them, and help them load if needed.

Best part was when a customer tells you they love their new kitchen."

good,"Most of the day was customer based, I learned about electricity, plumbing and that the customer is always right.  Management at this store left a lot to be desired for the most part, there were too many chiefs and not enough indians so to speak.  The managers themselves were good it was the way they managed. There weren't any real hard parts to the positions and the most enjoyable part was the interaction with customers."

good,Enjoy working here.  Small company atmosphere.  Very technical work to perform daily. Less then 100 employees and close to home

good,"I loved working at The Home Depot."
good,The overall company is a great company but the particular branch I work at could use some serious adjustments. Co workers are great and benefits are decent as well. Upper management needs some remaking
good,A typical day at the home depot consisted of finding customers and helping them in anyway that you could.  Co-workers were helpful if there was knowledge that you may not know.
good,"My work could be any day at any time, it was an individual work. Had different managers. I just learned what it had to do with my function as a cashier."
good,"I absolutely loved working at this store. I worked at the Home Depot in Richardson, TX. It's just like working at Lowe's but for some reason I just loved this store much better. I worked in the electrical department half the time and the other half I was helping assist the HR with scheduling and hiring new people. The only reason I had to leave was because I couldn't get full time and only made 9.75 an hour, and unfortunately I couldn't keep paying my bills and rent will making this much. But Home Depot is a great company to work for."
good,"This is a nice place to work, but just be prepared to deal with alot of different managers here. You must be on time all the time. They dont and will not tolerate any tardiness, and dont really care about turnover in their comapny. Which creates an environment of frustration between people who care about their jobs and those who are just passing through"
good,"its was okay working here, I couldn't do everything I could because I was pregnant and everything that I had to lift was heavy. The manager was really nice. Co-workers was okay."
good,Same as Garden for this is the same company. Great place to work for because you never do the same thing twice.Big difference in doing this that this branch was acustom to
good,"What I believed to be a permanent position, turned out to be a temporary one, however I loved working here simply because of the surroundings and the opportunities that were potentially there. I honestly never worked at a place where I did the same thing everyday, but at the same time felt different each day. I can say, without hesitation, that I was disappointed to see the position eliminated."
good,Love the people i work with however there are a lot of inconsistencies in management rules and guidelines and the pay for the positions is low.
good,this was one of the few construction jobs that I had and this is where I found my love of working with my hands. I also learned how to do wood work and work with plaster.
good,Its a great place for students who are seeking a part time job
good,"I did not work as a full time employee with THD, but from my time there I could sense a form of unity and bond subculture within the company.  The corporate structure is rigid and as you would expect from a large ""brick and mortar"" company."
good,"Very friendly environment, friendly employees. Enjoyable."
good,"Great company to work for. Great people, consider everyone one big family. They take care of their associates. One of the only companies I know of that has a fundraising program set up for associates."
good,"I was there for 15 years and had numerous opportunities to move around to different positions, and I did. I learned every department, and sales, how the company runs, profit and loss, employee retention, and training.  I lived the Home Depot culture, but I think this was lost over time as a company.  I miss the old Home Depot, where 'doing the right thing"" really mattered."
good,"Operate forklift, Electronic Pallet Jack, Double Reach and single reach truck, pacer truck. Package and transport warehouse items to and from trailers."
good,"I've enjoyed working there the last 5 years; however, I am searching to get back into the medical field, preferably in the Clinical Research industry."
good,"Good family feel between senior work members, quick turnover as with any retail, management is okay . . .1 or 2 good ones, and then the annoying and rude managers. Pay is okay, you have to work there for a while before it adds up; annual raises are not impressive."
good,"Home depot allows one to gain knowledge in any field associated with their department. In my case, working in an electrical department, home depot provided me with knowledge about electrical installations above what i've learned in college."
good,"Day-to-day tasks involve a multitude of personalities from co-workers to customers of all types of ethnicity and backrounds, so get ready to be on your feet for problems in returns or a cashier who does not know how to process a check. Its "" the good, the bad and the real ugly"" wink wink, clint eastwood movie refrences; when dealing as a head cashier at The Home Depot.  Shoppers are in constant need discounts, store credits and catering to their every need because a product fell on the floor or its dusty and they dont want to pick it up. But its all part of the job and customer service through retail is what your all about; so smile, listen and delegate the day so others can too because remember your a leader to others, an amazing team, as a head cashier."
good,Typical day at work was working the front end observing potential shop lifters from Internal/External and making sure things were rand in a porficient manner also while making sure all safety issues were addressed from overheads to anything from the aisles.

The most enjoyable part of my day was being free from the cash register and helping out customers look for items or loading for them."

good,Co-workers were great as well as some management. Typical retail culture with endless meetings.
good,"Typical retail job. Must work nights and weekends. Co workers are great. Benefits for full time associates are really good, hour wage could be better.

good,You learn a lot of different home improvement methods. Co-workers are easy to work with and will always give a helping hand. Hardest part of the job is helping load and unload materials. Most enjoyable is the customer service.
good,"An average day at the Home Depot is usually entertaining. The store is running 24 hours everyday so even outside of business hours we are always maintaining the store appearance and keeping product stocked. In the paint department, it can be very fast paced during peak hours. So multitasking is a must and working in a organized manner helps a lot. "

good,Learned a lot of experience from Home Depot. How to operate machinery I have never used before
good,Enjoy customer service but pay wasn't well and a couple things that were mentioned by Home Depot wasn't true
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work. You get to talk with many different people. Management is just ok. They have a lot of rules to follow which makes it hard to know what to do at times. Co-workers are great and good to work with. Hardest part about working for Home Depot is the scheduling. Shifts rotate daily and it makes it hard to have a life outside the store. The pay is decent as you can not have a specialty in an area and still receive decent pay.
good,"Appliance Sales, Greeting educating customers about products, displaying and demonstration of products and services, financing and extended service programs . Maintaining and exceeding sales goals and objectives and providing world class customer service"

good,Great incentive plans and bonus program. Flexible schedule. 55+ hour work week
good,Since I was a lot attendant my day was chaotic for the most part but you get good at it eventually. I learned a thing or two about something in each department. Management wasn't bad at all. My co-workers was helpful. Hardest part of the job would be not knowing about all the products. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfaction from happy customers.

Managing is the best part of business, it consist of a good relationship with all co-workers and departments, so their isn't any hard parts of the job, but maintaining a good flow of business, always seeking a stronger profit and promoting the business to a higher levels. The most enjoyable part of any business is closing its books out at the end of every year, on a productive and successful level.  The Home Depot could always use a better management team, and in time they will become a better company. Good Company to work for."

good,Communication is poor. Scheduling is atrocious. Management is well rounded and helpful. Store has a family feel to it
good,"On any given day you can be cleaning bays and dealing with customers all at once.  You have to know the products in the store well, even store associates would approach you about where certain items are.  From working here I've learned a lot ranging from electrical to roofing.  Management team has helped out by transferring to my closest store for less of a drive.  Prior to that transfer was traveling about 40mins to a hour.  The team I work with is great we all get along and joke amongst ourselves.  While our work is time based having constant customers ask us for help it can be very challenging at times to complete our tasks at hand.  At the same time it is fulfilling to be able to help customers while giving them your own insight on certain products and to help with any project they have going on for themselves."
good,Deal with materials entering and leaving store in a timely fashion
good,have a great time with my co-workers.  learn new things through computer training.

I stop working for this company on September 1,2014 because they wouldn't work with my second job shift. I would of loved to stay with the company but it was only part-time."

good,"Helping customers find what they are looking for, how to watch prices when shopping, good to work for, helpful co-workers, driving a fork lift, seeing customers leave the store happy."
good,"When it comes to retail everywhere is busy. Customer service is always the priority. I've learned everything about painting, flooring, and contracting. Management changed often, but my final store manager improved store revenue and got employees a bonus. A lot of hard work, movement, and customer serving."
good,"Good Corporation job. Requires quick learner, good with technology, ability to maintain an organized work area, and provide great customer service, as well as keep up to date on product knowledge."
good,Home Depot was a great experience for me. It comes with its highs and lows like any work place. I learned allot about leadership. The do's and don'ts. I gained knowledge on how to run a company. The employees are really what make Home Depot. The biggest opportunity would be more consideration of employees personal life. The most enjoyable would be building relationships with other associates and being able to help out customers.
good,Started prior to store opening during store set up.  Learned a lot about setting up a new store.  Management mostly consistent in store policies.  Good opportunity for advancement.  Really enjoyed working with customers and management
good,I travel approximately 100-150 miles per day driving to customers houses to take precise measurements for several different services.
good,"loved this job, great way to meet new people and very satisfactory with customer service"
good,"Lots of computer training, a friendly co-worker environment, the most enjoyable part is the interaction with the customers"
good,"I loved working for the Home Depot! I worked as an Over night stock person, to start, for 6 months. I would stock shelves, clean the store before opening time, learned to operate a fork lift, cherry picker, and any other equipment needed to do my job. It was hard work but I worked hard (I was one of two females on a full man crew). I then went to days and worked as a garden associate only for a short while, but learned what was good for your yard, what were great products, how to design your yard to be well manicured, and even worked in the tree tent during christmas time. Shortly after christmas I was asked by another department manager to go to Deliveries, This was the best job out of all of them! I was all over the store, filling orders for customers, and made sure the other orders got on the delivery truck. During the summer of 2007 I became a lot tech loading cars wth sod, fertiziler, rock, and mulch. Most of the managers were great, a few were unreasonable, and majority of my co workers wer fantastic to work with. The hardest part of my job was the heat during the summer, but the most enjoyable part of my job was the infinite opportunities for work during my career."
good,The Home Depot Call Center I must say by far as been the most fun work environment that I've worked. It starts with a comfortable work place that required casual dress. We had daily pot lucks with different themes as well as daily contest with making a sales closing very exciting. The managers treated the employees as adults which allowed us to work freely. Unfortunately the department and the entire call center had to close and that employer will always have a special spot in my work experience!
good,good work environment. learned that I work well with others. Supervisor was persistent on when and how the work is suppose to be done all around good staff.
good,I was lead Receiver who was in charge of setting up schedules with trucking company's. The loading and unloading of trucks through out the shift.
good,Overall the work environment was great. Managers treated you with respect and everyone was always doing what had to be done.
good,"Employee recognition, making their employees feel appreciated."
good,"Typical day at work entailed clocking in, heading to the front of the store to find the head cashier. Then I was told to either work at the pro cash registers, regular registers, self check out, or garden registers. It was always a very fast paced environment and I had to check customers out quickly and effective while still maintaining a positive and cheerful attitude. Soliciting credit was also a huge part of the job; offering it to every customer that came my way. The hardest part of the job was being able to direct customers to the location of their desired products when I first started working there. I had not familiarized myself with everything yet. It was an easy solution though, whether I asked a nearby associate, the head cashier, etc and provided the answer for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers. Many customers bought very unusual things for tasks such as DIY and it was nice to talk to them about their plans as I checked them out. It enabled me to provide great customer service while I checked them out."
good,This is a good place to work but you must be willing and ready to move quickly and be courteous to customers.  That however is actually the best part of the job; helping customers solve their problems and going out of your way to ensure they have a great experience.
good,All types of employees and everyone gets along.  I really like the people.  Customers are nice too. So it makes the job enjoyable.  All head cashiers are always willing to help you if need be.
good,They keep you busy while on the clock.  Supervisors and leaders were easy to work with and understanding about employee circumstances.
good,"Only thing I didn't like, they hire everyone part time. Very hard to get full time!"
good,It was an enjoyable place to work. Many high expectations. I enjoyed working with co workers and customers. I did not always feel that management was supportive of associates. Many times it was expected of me as a supervisor to take care of the needs of other associates while my own were overlooked.
good,"Responsible for stocking, packing in and out merchandise, organizing the sales floor for safe environment while providing customer satisfaction."
good,"Come in do your Audits, Catch some shoplifters, Write a report- get yelled at for not getting enough shoplifters, Watch your dumb associates give away more money then you stop from shoplifters, No OT ever, NO Atta boys, not a lot of appreciation for extra work- "
good,"Good environment. Good benefits. Co workers are friendly."
good,home depot will give you hours and aetna healthcare and little room for advancement but it is there
good,"It is an interesting work place, constant changes are being made to make customers happy"

good,"varied"
good,"love working with a new age group of kids, helping out the teacher, Getting a taste of a teacher's life style."
good,"Every day was different at The Home Depot. The weekends brought much excitement; the store was always packed with regular and new customers that I was always ready to assist. I learned how to be an independent worker who is yet still part of a working team. Often many tasks were set upon me that I had to fulfill while still helping my customers. Some times I was given a leadership role as head cashier. Most of my co-worker were very friendly and we all worked toward the same goal, customer satisfaction. The hardest part of my job was not having a set schedule and being outside when the weather was cold. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people, pointing them in the right direction. I really liked my customers and they enjoyed me as their cashier."
good,Good job. Sold appliances. Had to help customers with there choices on appliances and the benefits of each set or piece of purchase.
good,"You have your busy days and you have your slow days, during the slow days you have to know how to occupy yourself and stay busy there is always something to do around home depot and a customer that may need help, if you can tolerate standing up all day this is the job for you, home depot always finds away to give back to the EMPLOYEES and make sure were enjoying ourselves :)"
good,Busy place to work at learning new skills always keeping busy answering phone calls and returns for customer
good,"As a manager, you will work 7 days per week and very long hours during the bulk of the week.  A lot of pressure to surpass budgets and when they are exceeded, budgets are raised without notice."
good,"I manager over 130 associates.  I handle phone screens, new hire orientations, training, scheduling, town hall meetings, staffing concerns and customer service"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot and was looking for a full time career with set hours, which at the time, they were unable to provide.  this is a great place to work if you don't mind working any time they need you.  Hard to manage your work and home life."
good,it is very down to earth place to work at. can always find help and have questins answered. but some of the ppl there are not so nice
good,I was certified on all machinery. I kept a very neat department and also fully stocked.
good,"I greet customers and direct them to the location of what they are looking for. I also cashier at times and checked out customers. I worked at the service desk. A typical time at the service desk was doing will call/phone sales. will call is when a customer wants to pay now and pick up at another time or location. Phone sales is when a customer is not present and has someone shopping for them, a call is made to customer for information. I learned to work with a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers to the items and any information that I knew to help resolve any situation that they were trying to resolve. I learned as well to keep calm when the customer is not."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Pay was decent. Employees were the best to work with.
good,I really liked working for Home Depot. Management could have been a little bit better but overall a very good job. A typical day would be emptying carts and organizing assigned area. Th most difficult part was staying awake because it was an overnight job. But I enjoyed it very much especially the other employees working as a team.
good,Working at home depot is good. i have learned a lot since working there
good,A typical day working at Home Depot is enjoyable.  The customers and co-workers keep it live and fun.
good,"This job requires a lot of standing, lifting and other physical challenges. Pay is not commensurate with physical demands."
good,"My direct supervisor is the best boss I have ever had, very understanding and a great guy overall. The reason I label this as split decision is because throughout the rest of the store supervisors and ASM's are chosen based on favorites, not skill."
good,"With micro management and strict sales guidelines, I met with new and existing customers each day.  Each customer had different needs and expectations.  I was able to tailor my customer service skills to help each customer secure the materials needed for their individual projects.  "
good,Meeting new clients daily. Providing showroom tours.  Assisting new clients with budget planning. Overseeing kitchen and bathroom projects from start to finish.
good,help customers look for the items they are looking for so they can finish there projects
good,"I got to spend the bulk of my work day outside, where there'd be lots of positive activity throughout the aisles of the Home Depot's nursery.  The flowers and foliage were gorgeous.  Most days consisted of switching on and off between loading vehicles with various soils, mulches and composts and working on the sales floor, assisting customers with their in-store needs.  The management was very pleasant and the co-workers were all fit for excellence.  I enjoyed my department and I liked making people smile."
good,"I worked with some great people, managment could talk to each other a little more, but all in all they were pretty good.  They don't offer enough hours unless you are in managment.  They cut hours for everyone even the ones who are only getting 20hrs a week.  The people that work there do seem to enjoy what they do, they are friendly and very helpfull."
good,"Home Depot overall is a pretty good place to work, it has its ups and downs like every other job. They've overall been pretty good to me, but it does take a while to get anything done. I understand management has a lot on their plates, but some of the managers can make you wonder, i have been waived off, and ignored a few times. I dont take it to heart, but I'd like to be heard voicing my opinions and concerns and it kind of disheartens me that something that could easily be squeezed in in a week takes months of time."
good,"One problem was no stability in managers. Changed all the time. Work hours are terrible for families. Most assistant managers were single, divorced or separated. Never could plan anything with your families."
good,Its a good place to work for job security. not a good balance of job/work life. its open entirely to long.
good,greeting customers and meeting their needs while working in the paint department. I was constantly learning new things about the various products we supplied and techniques on how to sell the products we provided. Several of the co-workers I had were very helpful when I needed assistance with a project. The hardest part of the job was dealing the usual drama that went on between some co-workers and staying out of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was mixing paint and assisting customers with their home projects. I also had a wonderful management crew. They were always willing to lend their expertise on what ever issue I had.
good,"A typical day of work for me was creating employee schedules and reviewing applications for employment.  I also worked directly with the store manager and department heads concerning their employee needs.  The hardest part of the job was the store manager not caring about the employee needs.  My last store manager was very proud of the fact that all of the department heads at the previous store were all terminated and replaced within a short period of time.  The most enjoyable part was creating the employee schedules.  I loved the task work this involved, almost like piecing a puzzle together.  I had to place the right number of employees during the times needed while also not leaving the departments without anyone to cover.  Very challenging at times with the limit number of hours we were given overall so the store remains profitable."
good,"typical retail, until you get into management you don't get paid well unless you have been at the company >10 yrs"
good,"Everything was great here. Great staff, great bosses, great pay, and plenty of room to advance!!!!"
good,"easy work, can be fast paced environment but overall satisfactory"
good,This was a fun place to work and great comunitiy. Not alot of opertunity for advancement. Most of the employees like their job and position and want to stay.
good,"I really Enjoyed working with Home Depot each day is a challenge and is exciting. the downfall will only be the immediate upper management team. The Home Depot I was working had a really great team. some however lacked the mentality of training associates to become leaders. too much is relied on computer training and the expectation of being ""expert"" at the end of the training is a bad culture to have. there is no reason a new associate should close or run a department alone on thier first day on the floor or even first few weeks depending on the department. Training and mentoring needs more imphasis here. To work for Home Depot is a great experience with room to rise to the top!"
good,"great company to work for. Amazing work environment"
good,Rewarding and Growth Oriented Company with a lot of opportunity for advancement based on Career choice.
good,"I work with the best MET Team Members Ever, couldn't do the job without each other."
good,What is a typical day at Home Depot? Customer service. Customers always come first i make it my business  to greet customers as they come in to shop provide loading assistance for items that they or unable to load themselves (for example Fencing Appliances Drywall Plywood Flooring ) It is also my job to provide a safe an clean environment for both our customers and employees keeping the lot clean and clear of trash debris anything harmful also to report and safety hazards gave me life i gave them 6 years and they treated me like family every step of the way i love the people there everyone gets along great its an overall great place to be and work
good,"A typical day would include assisting customers, performing cashier duties, using company specific information and equipment.  We cleaned and organized the area at the front of the store or in the garden shop.  Management was helpful and my co-workers came from very diverse backgrounds.  I really enjoyed working/assisting the public."
good,"Easy and reliable job"
good,"Some locations are great, some are not.  Staff is typically friendly and training is well thought out."
good,"At The Home Depot every morning before getting to our usual duties, the team meets up and discuss the work safety topic for the day as well as stretching in order to prep for any strenuous manual work. Then, apart of the daily task are to change daily prices changes throughout the store, take care of any priority task (such as vendor display changes, product moves, fixture take downs or to be put up, and routine department servicing) in a timed format and continue daily bay service throughout the aisles."

good,Fun place to be. Great opportunities for growth. You can learn so much.
good,"Typical day is pack downs,customer service, create orders, complete orders, delivery orders. What have I learned is to be organized when you work or share a desk with other associates not everything is where you put it.  Management , time of the day well, to complete all tasks. All co-works work as a team, make for a well working engine.The hardest part of the job is the lifting of all the heavy material that would have to be loaded for the customer. And the most enjoyable part of my job is a satisfied customer, walking way with a smile on his or her face."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is the people i worked with. management was good.

Learned about products within the store and special ordered thru vendors.International customer with there purchases overseas. All my managers within my long term job were great. i always tried stay communicated with both my managers and co-workers. Helping my co-workers was great with so many years of experience.The hardest part of my job was my schedule because of my kids .I enjoy my job because i was always busy. Working in a high pace environment .Either on site or on the internet or on the phone, making sure i found the best prices for the customer ,special order or not for large quantities ."
good,"During a typical work day at The Home Depot I would normally run the returns department assisting customers in the exchanges/ returns of damaged, unused, or unwanted merchandise, along with marking down damaged merchandise from the sales floor. During my time working with the company I learned a number of skills from communication with both customers and my colleagues, to home improvement tips used to further assist customers in a number of departments. While I do have a number of fun and interesting experiences with the company and job in general, such as being chosen to represent the store in a regional ""Front End Olympics"" two consecutive years, there were a number of challenges such as due to the smaller size of the location we did not carry a number of products a typical home depot would normally carry causing much confusion and dissatisfaction of some customers."
good,Place product on shelf and take product in overhead storage to fill shelves.  Unload freight from incoming trucks and place product for outgoing orders. Use forklift to place extra stock in overhead storage
good,"I do recovery at night and assist customers with last minute purchases before the store closes. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers locate and purchase stock merchandise and special ordered merchandise. I also spent time training and assisting new cashiers to prepare them for preforming fast, friendly, and accurate check-out. I easily form friendships with my co-workers. I really enjoyed taking care of the customers and ensuring that they left the store satisfied with our service."
good,As an associate my day consists of customer service based work. Mixing and matching paint to customer liking while assuring their entire project needs will be met.
good,very friendly environment very crowded enjoyed helping load vehicles and the interactions with different personalities
good,"Typical day was taking care of plants. customer service, teaching customers and fellow associates about types and maintenance of plants. Helping new associates and cashiers"
good,"The work and the workers were great, it was the upper management that you had to look out for.  They were finding ways to get rid of the people that had been there for a while with new suck ups who didn't know what they were doing."
good,"I enjoyed it at first cause it was something new. I was cashier and was quickly promoted to line manager. But the pay was low, and I found out there was high school kids coming in making more money than the ones that were experienced and basically department heads. Management did not back up its employees who were trying to stick to the posted guidelines."
good,"I have the best management team! I have worked for the company for about 4 years and the company really does take care of their people. Being on the MET team I only work Monday thru Friday and its the best schedule. If you work for the store you do not have a set day or time, you work when they need you. That's why I like working for their merchandising team."
good,will recommend to my friends  for any part-time jobs.  Great co-workers.  Poor management.  Flexible schedule.  Not so great medical coverage when you are a part-timer.
good,This was a fun place to work as I would constantly interact and build relationships with customers.
good,"Good management,fun co-workers,team player,everyday is a  good day at work.no task is to hard."
good,"I had to unload & load trucks by using a Fork lift operator. Most house hold goods, being shipped around the world"
good,I cross trained myself between the different departments on either side of me so I could be scheduled for those departments as well as help where needed. Added for a busy day which was more rewarding for me.
good,"i would always help the departments when they need it, i been cashier of the month 5 times in a row, always like to learn about the benefits of each product used at home depot, get along with everyone and really a good place to work at"
good,The employees of Home Depot have gone above and beyond to help me in learning my job. They were all so very kind and patient with me.
good,"Supportive management, friendly environment, safe for shoppers,"
good,I was trained well on the foundations of providing excellent customer service
good,"Customer service Lead at Home Depot Contact Center where I talked, listen and help resolved conflicts with customers and sometimes with confused or irate customers. An expert communicator was able to listen effectively to find the root cause of issues, and communicate clearly and in a friendly way to solve the issue and keep the customer happy.  I did what was needed to motivate the team, work with them to make sure they abide by all company policies and procedures."
good,"I loved Home Depot because some of the management was great. It is a great chance to be able to advance and the benefits are pretty good. It's retail so the pay isn't great but its enough. I love that they pay weekly. My location people did not ask for much but you needed to be nice. The area was filled with pretty good people and some people liked their jobs. I loved most of my customers, they were great. The hardest part was when people called out, if you knew another department they would use you but back before the whole full time/part time discrepancy happened, you got paid for the hours you worked. Even overtime. Now Depending on your manager, you wont get much time."
good,"fast pase company ,spiffs and friendly customers.I learned to drive different machines, friendly co-workers. long nights."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time of employment with The Home Depot. I was given the opportunity to learn multiple aspects of the store departments, inventory control, product knowledge, and customer service. I would most definitely work for the company again if given the opportunity."
good,"I like my job,but there are long hours.    fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"
good,Watering is the most enjoyable part of my job. I like the busy work environment and providing customers with assistance.
good,Greeting new people and having great customer service to assure that the customer will return again.
good,It was a nice place to work at. You have a lot of regulars that go buy and they reward you with events.
good,"A heavy work load of data entry and filing."
good,I am the cashier at Home depot and i love it the customers are all very nice as well as the other associates the only down fall to this job is you do not get a lot of hours
good,"Hardest part of job was working by yourself in the delivery department. You would have to pull orders from all over the store, from lumber to garden. In lumber your could have 2 or 3 full size decks to pull by yourself as you had little to no help."
good,"I loved working at The Home Depot, and did so as I attended University. I chose to continue working there because of how secure their future is, and that I would have job security. For the most part, that is the biggest thing THD has going for it."
good,"Assuming that not all Home Depot stores operate with the specific qualities listed in this review, working as a night freight crew associate at a small store in the Kansas City area provided both excellent learning opportunities for this young worker, as well as a glimpse of the worst management policies. One who would wish to join The Home Depot's Night Freight Crew would have the opportunity to train/operate heavy lift equipment (a valuable skill in this reviewer's opinion) as well as bond with a small group of 20 or so associates in the standard restocking of freight and lumber materials. One of the biggest detriments at this specific store, however, is up management's inability to connect or even associate with any of the night crew members. Many times the running joke would be that the ""big boss"" is just a name on your paycheck, when The Home Depot PR department preaches that management takes a specific interest in all their associates wants and needs.  As a freight team member, there is a set time in which you (as a team) are a needed to complete your job; the time is unwavering.  Meaning, on heavy nights you may get four (4) hours to put everything on the shelves and in the bays, and on light nights where the Depot receives only a pallet or so of freight, you still have four (4) hours to kill."
good,"A day at The Home Depot is rarely dull. There are always many customers and contractors to work with discussing/designing projects, communicating between departments to make sure what they need is available and loaded, but also constantly maintaining the store's appearance and shop-ability, by way of painting signs/fixtures, making displays, packing out freight, and also catching up on computer trainings for company communications and department info and updates. The company, for the most part, goes by a 'you work hard, you play hard' mentality, which helps and the team as a whole utilizes that so it's not a stuffy bunch in the least bit, but there are definite times you really work hard. You can't be afraid to dig in and get dirty: hauling sod, mulch, stone, cutting lumber etc. for customers. One upside is that you are trained for one specific department fairly thoroughly before you even hit the floor. You don't randomly cover various departments that you know nothing about."
good,to delegate to maintain the stores appearance while maintaining excellent customer service.
good,"You have to manager a lot of minor details of the building. If they are not maintained, you will run into major issues."
good,If you like retail you'll love The Home Depot. This website is making write some more so here you go. The Home Depot pays its employees low to keep profits high just like any other retailer. I have been treated fairly for the most part.
good,Number one customer service oriented company. Know your section of the store to be able to help customers.
good,a typical workday would be providing the best customer service to my best of knowledge i also get to meet alot of people which is good i normally work a 8 hr shift which is normally with another associate along with me the hardest part of my job is helping people who are impatient and what i enjoy the most about my job is helping people because thats what i like doing.
good,"What I do is put away freight, whatever amount out crew has in that time. I also did scan outs to point out to the store all the products within the store to show what needs to be ordered, or to pack down products that are above selling shelving in order to make it accessible to customers. My bosses have been cool, the people I work with are nice people, the only issue is the coming and going of the people who work with me. It seems to be a short-term job, and I can see that. Also if we get too much freight in one day, we can be there until 3:00 A.M or later. Usually without notice either."
good,"Good company, hard to get full time and benefits. Good opportunity to learn different areas."
good,"Engaged culture, true to their values.  Fundamentally sound and fun work environment.  Management will work grueling hours in certain regions of the network."
good,Nice working environment with good benefits. Friendly environment and knowledgeable coworkers.
good,The hardest part is putting up with the uneducated and lazy people they hire at minimum wage to fill job openings. There should be higher standards for hiring besides who's the cheapest.
good,"•	Interacts with customers and associates in the store to ensure that excellent customer service is achieved.  Acts as troubleshooter and technical support for store associates and customers.  Answers customer questions (via telephone or in person), sets expectations, facilitates will call pick -ups and resolves any issues that arise.  "
good,"Good place to work if in school, allows worker to set availability. Just doesn't pay enough."
good,"responsible for balancing money in the vault, and cash registers, I also entered data into the computer system"
good,Solving customer problems and I learned many tricks of the trade when it comes to paint and hardware.
good,"When first hired I was taught every aspect of the company that there was I was actually one of the persons who opened one of the new locations and I set shelves and product.  I worked as a cashier, customer service and returns then I was taught the job of expediting (tracking products for customers) then I was also taught the installed sales aspect of the company how to enter measures, and sell the install to the customer, this is what led me to Lowe's Home Improvement where I was their Installed Sales Department Manager. I loved everything about Home Depot but was given an opportunity for advancement and that is why I left."
good,"great team work, great experience, good people.  enjoyed helping people"
good,"A good place to work for full time employees, with great benefits. In a Typical day for me as a Part time employee begins at 8:00pm and ends at 5:00 the next Morning Friday through Sunday which involves Breaking down freight, sorting the same and stocking it on the shelf's. The management there trust you to do your job as there in no one constantly looming over you. The hardiest part is having to stock to the lower shelf's (being on your knees) and not knowing if you will get full time employment."
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot, the only problem i had was regarding the hours and shifts. An unsteady schedule made it hard for me to prioritize my work."
good,"There's always a good place to shop but when you work in a place where people are still friendly, then it's a place to call your 2nd home."
good,I enjoy interacting with the customers and always learning something new.
good,Great experience overall. I learned a lot about Home Depot and their strategies in being successful. Great management team and environment.
good,"Clock in put on the Home Depot apron and head to the department to assist customers in what ever was needed."
good,I enjoyed training others and seeing that impact that one can have on such a large group of people through leadership and teamwork.
good,"Working for this company was great. I was in a very positive environment all-around and I really enjoyed working there. Sadly, there was no discount for anything in the store."
good,"At Home Depot there has always been a good vibe for me, even as a kid coming into the store with my dad, so I applied to work there later as a young adult. My position was in the paint department as a mixer. The company provided all training required and had a great supportive staff to help with the hands on learning process. I really enjoyed this job because of the various traits to be learned, opportunity to grow and have a diverse skill set under one store roof. That particular store was the cleanest, most helpful and friendly environment I had encountered when walking into a Home Depot and I was very proud to say I was part of their team. As an employee of the paint department there were a lot of things to learn about product and how to operate machinery. My coworkers were of an older generation than mine, creating a different type of fun atmosphere. The toughest part about that job was gaining the product knowledge and learning how to accurately color match paint samples customers brought it, and gaining the muscle strength to be able to lift some of those 5 gallon buckets of paint. The pay and hours were consistant and benefits were handed to those in full-time positions."
good,it an easy going fast pace job. great invorment to work in nice customers and great work place wit good co works
good,Began employment and immediately began an educational route in learning the merchandise available on the sales floor.
good,"this company offers you a lot of benefits but not a lot of hours . "
good,normally pushing dirt around in the off season but very fast paced in spring. most people are friendly although some are very up tight.
good,I liked my job I just didn't want to live my life being just a cashier and not trying other jobs.
good,I like the environment of Home Depot. Great place to work. No training needed. For the position in which one is looking to work they will train you for it.
good,"Home Depot it is a good place to work with, but it is very hard to develop your full potential as leader."
good,Was enjoyable to work with many of the co-workers but was hard not being able to make certain decisions
good,"it was a great job i was just lookin for better work and more money at the time, now yeas later i wish i stayed there to more on with great life."
good,It was ok I woulnt work for the company again.I thought it was going to be a greta experience but it wasnt the people were mean and the schdule was always getting messed up

good,"Customer service based job. "
good,I was in charge of window treatments. I dealt with any where from in house merchandise to custom orders. I worked with a great team and I like the fact that there was never a dull moment.
good,Working at homedepot taught me good customer service skills and I enjoyed helping customers with problems that arose from projects they were working on.  I felt very confident when I could help them out with questions or problems they had.
good,"Cashiering and customer service, friendly staff. Typical cashier job with room for impovement"
good,"A typical day includes the servicing of merchandise, this included verifying the planograms, dusting, making sure accurate price tags are in place, and restock empty holes on the shelves.  In my time with Home Depot I have learned many merchandising tools, as well as product knowledge."
good,"There is a lot you can learn about home improvement and even things you can do yourself at home.  Most people are very helpful.  There are some scheduling conflicts at times and as most retail jobs, if you aren't in management, good luck getting full time work.  Very good benefits however, especially vision."
good,"I worked at Home Depot for nearly ten years, moving up throughout the company.  I decided to follow a different career path."
good,Uplifting work environment that encouraged growth within the company as well as improved knowledge on product
good,Good management and very good products. Co-workers were all part of a intricate team.
good,Enjoyable job Pay scale very low for job.  Can be working on an independent level at time or as a team to get the required task at hand complete.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the customers were great. I was actually excited to go to work everyday and the management was always very helpful.
good,"Average paced job speed, very helpful co-workers. The job is very detail oriented, with lots of team and solo projects. Supervisor very direct, in leading and instructions. Learned many skills from driving lift equipment to functions on a first phone."
good,interaction with customers and the chance to learn product knowledge and to use tools.
good,I really enjoyed working at HD. You can  learn a lot and you will meet a lot of people. Not really a lot of room for advancement but they have pretty good benefits and the people there are great
good,co-workers are very nice and helpful.learn lot with the company managers are helpful and very nice.
good,The job at home depot was Productive it helps u to learn about local things around the house hole
good,fun filled work experience with great people and even the managers. never had any problems when needed help or chaining of schedules.
good,the people there where always nice and always wanted to help you get your self better. I learned more about home improvement while i was working there. the management was alright but since i left all the management has changed
good,Home Depot was my first full time job. It was a fun place to work. I learned a lot about home interior and hardware.
good,I've gotten some great experience from THD that looks good on your resume for future employers. Also management is great and very flexible with working hours.
good,"I worked overnight receiving. I checked in and unloaded all the trailers with the slip machine. Received in special orders and placed them in they're appropriate locations for pick up. After unloading all full pallet trailers I would unload the last floor load trailer by hand and separate them by department onto rdc carts or hand stack on pallets according to size and weight. At the end of my shift I would confirm all po numbers in the system and run the daily reports. "
good,"Worked as customer service representative. Company used to provide benefits to part time employees such as tuition reimbursement and health care benefits, they no longer do so."
good,A great place to work. I was able to learn alot from numerous training classes and learn from older employees who didnt hesitate to answer any questions
good,"A typical day at Home Depot as a Inbound Receiver working from 7AM till 11:30 AM. The first thing I would do is the morning start up and stretching. One of the supervisors would assign me and another co-worker a few trailers to work on throughout the day. you must read the receiving report from the truck and make sure that it's the same as what I have on my report from the Inbound office. As I'm doing my job I must follow all the safety the rules that's given to every employee. I would work until first break at 9:30 and take my 15 minute break. The hardest part about working there it's hard to meet your goals because there isn't enough freight to do so but I still enjoy because I had to opportunity to meet a few amazing, characteristic, hard working people like myself, people that didn't mind working as a team and helping when it came down to things I needed help with. I would work from 7am till first break at 9:30"
good,Everyone there was eager to help one another. Very casual environment with positive feedback and growth incentives.
good,"A typical day includes bringing down new products and adding new signage along with fixing things in the store. The hardest part about the job is starting at 6am everyday, however having weekends off is nice."
good,a typical day at the home depot is clocking in going to assist customers and maybe working in different departments. Ive learned how to become a team player at all times. The management was okay sometimes hard to talk to. My co workers were my co workers. The hardest part of the job is working out in the sun in the summer time. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers and making they time at the home depot a very pleasant visit.
good,"A typical day at work would basically consist of a vast number of things. For example, I clock in and the first thing I have to do is walk the entire store and check for things like fire hazards, merchandise protection standards, safety risks, empty packages within the aisles, etc... This is all done for a daily routine form that has to be filled out everyday. After I walk my routines, I would normally approach cashiers and ask if they had any out of the ordinary returns from the previous day/night and see if there any people of interest I should look out for. After, I would approach an Assistant Store Manager and ask them the same. I would then walk the sales floor looking for shoplifters and every hour I would check my Asset Protection Inbox to see if there are any tasks that need to be completed until it's time to go home. I've learned a lot of operational work at The Home Depot. Home Depot understands that only about 2%-5% of their overall shrink is from external theft, so they like for their Security Team to focus on a lot of the operational side of things, which is about 60%-70% of their shrink, in order to develop high dollar internal investigations. Management, as far as security, I don't like. Reason being is that I see too much favoritism going on and a lack of recognition. One week you can catch 5-6 shoplifters, the next week you catch none and all of a sudden you're spoken down to as if the work you did previously meant nothing. My co-workers are great. Team work is something my co-workers and I believe in strongly. The hardest part of my job is that 95% of the time"
good,great place to work family like environment  fun environment.  everyone is so friendly and helpful.  the hardest part of the job is having to go home at night
good,Very busy and fast pace and I worked with equipment such as forklifts and the reach.
good,You needed to be very upbeat and on the move for the job. It was an extremely busy store that always had something going on. Customer service you needed to be informed of the returns policy.
good,Staff was great. Company was caring. Neighborhood friendly store.
good,Great job and good people work there but not the greatest pay.
good,"I spent 11.5 years at The Home Depot and during my tenure I managed seven different departments and was captian of the inverntory team three separate times. I was responsible for training associates to always put our customers safety first and always provide exceptional service while maintaining effective levels of product on the shelves for our customers. I was the trainer for all new associates on the forklift machines. I worked closely with upper management on a daily basis, constantly being asked to spearhead the days ""must get done"" tasks. Time management skills are a must at The Home Depot and the ability to solve customer needs, even when they might not be happy to be there, is a priority."
good,"A typical day at work is always an adventure and a learning experience. Whether I help a customer with a very challenging problem around the house, or learning something new myself, I always leave with a sense of accomplishment."
good,"My daily work consisted of many different tasks. Customer service was the most important.  I would maintain the department items and return them to its right location. Assure there’s no safety hazard in my department. Print and do “new mods”, which is modifications to walls and features on the sales floor. I would maintain the “site to store” inventory, label and place the items in designated locations. I would take on any project my manager or supervisor would give me. I would help unload the trucks in receiving."
good,always making sure all products are organizes and nicely stack on the sales floor and ready before the store opens the next day.
good,I go in we start our morning meeting and stretch and flex. After its straight to GS(general servicing) for most of the day which consists of making sure the bays are set the way the vendors want. Product is nice and presentable stocked fully and labels mostly as well as displays sometimes. 2 15 minute breaks a 30 minute lunch. only difference Mon. Weds. and Fri. are lumber days for my self counts and stocking mostly as well as taking out old boards.
good,Just like any other Home Depot . Loading and Unloading Trucks and Picking orders for Customers
good,Can't wait to learn more and grow. I love retail. I just want to learn new things.
good,The customer is always right. Management just sits back in their office collecting their checks
good,"I would love to be a permanant employee of The Home Depot SSC in Atlanta.  I was on a contract and I thought I did good work, I believe that my team and management would agree.  I was hoping to convert to a full time employee but budgets and organization is changing this coming fiscal year (starting in February) and this change left not only myself insecure but also the full time eployees in the department including several senior managers.  I am not sure if this occurs every year but if that's the case I'm not sure I would want to be associated with the company.  "
good,"Learned a lot about customer satisfaction!!  A great place to learn a lot about all the needs for the home, inside and out."
good,"My first real job, it was something new where i learned to work with people, learned my customer service"
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working for Home Depot. I was living in New Jersey at the time so lifestyles and interests differed between myself and my coworkers. None the less, they were all wonderful people in their own ways and a joy to work with. I was a cashier to begin with and eventually was taught how to work in returns. We were responsible for scanning every item, inviting customers to sign up for a Home Depot credit card, and process all forms of payment. We kept all work areas clean and tidy to look presentable and safe for ourselves and customers. We would direct customers to appropriate locations of the store. We would call for department assistance if items had missing tags or pieces. In returns we had to make sure all items were accountable to its packaging in order to return, this excluded defectives. We had to locate dates, prices and form of payment on the receipts as well as see an ID. When a return was finished we would put the item(s) in carts set up for each department and call them to pick up when the carts were full. The hardest part about the job was there were various shifts, which I always managed well and with a smile."
good,Great place to work. Co-Workers are fun and get along well. I enjoy the interaction with customers but dislike the workload and lack of tools to complete the job at times.
good,"management played favorites with all the ""cool"" kids and treated everyone differently.."
good,"Typical day at work is solving and resolving customer home improvement issues: plumbing, electrical, hardware."
good,"A typical day at work includes covering several departments beyond your own and helping customers all over the store. You may be hired into one department but after some time you will expected to learn more. Co-workers are like family and always rally together to help anyone in need. The most enjoyable part of the job is the family community when you work with people you have longevity with. The hardest part of the job is the compensation, as well as the expectation to constantly produce more with less support and time."
good,Just like family....wish they would have kept the division open
good,I loves working here and being around all of my co-workers and managers. we all had a great time working together. Their very flexible with schedules except on weekends. I loved when we had cookouts for the employees it showed that we were greatly appreciated.
good,learned telephone techniques and always had a friendly crew
good,started very early ...am    morning meetings.  stretched and went over safety concerns. real nice clean warehouse environment......long hours for overtime pay a-plus
good,"Typical day:"
good,"handled 50-60 calls per day regarding appliances for homedepot. Co workers friendly, customers can be a bit upset"
good,"Can be a very high school like enviroment, but the company is very dedicated to their employees and taking care of them."
good,I liked working at Home depot because of the staff and the interaction with customers
good,Home depot is a great place to be employed. A typical day would consist of meeting and greeting countless customer throughout different departments. Stocking shelves and maintaining safe working environment is a major aspect of the job we try to sell everything. the one thing I've learned at Home Depot is how to value a customer. Standards are set so high that every customer leaves pleased with the service they received. As far as management it can be described as survival of the fittest . There's no bridge between management and employees and they come and go. The hardest part of the job is remembering to take a lunch break. Its so busy in the store that you taking a lunch break is the furthest thing from your mind. The most enjoyable part is having a customer come back to the store and thank you because the product you recommended actually work.
good,"I thought the company was amazing, except for I was training people who were making more money then me."
good,"Handle orders of customers, make sure process is okay, handle payments, top customer satisfaction"
good,Nice Place to work. Learned a lot about products. Coworkers are great. There is really no hard part. The most enjoyable part is working as a Team.
good,This was a tough Full time job in the Seasonal department which was intense as the location was one of the highest volume locations in NJ.
good,"Working for THD has been a wonderful experience, very fast pace and ever changing."
good,provide outstanding customer service. management varied and changed often. most of the co-workers were good to work with. the hardest part of the job was the inconsistent schedule when you have a young family. most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers.
good,Directly work with customers and vendors for a corporate office food court.
good,"While opening the store :"
good,"I enjoy working around employees who genuinely care about their customers needs. Team work is a large part of any business success and this company allows us to get in contact with any other department in a quick timely matter in order to help our customers. There is much to learn in this environment. If i don't learn something new from an employee, then i will take the liberty to learn something new from our customers just to ensure i learn something new everyday."
good,"Had a good experience with this company, Ive leaned how to cut lumber and make keys"
good,I worked a cash register. I enjoyed my days at work. i was fired because i didn't know that i couldn't use store credit that a customer gave me.
good,"4-8 am. Learned how to order and find merchandise in store as well as ran forklift, reach truck and order picker. First manager was a great guy and helped with tasks but after he left the management dropped off. Coworkers were usually fun and helpful. Throwing hot water heaters 20 feet in the air was a difficult task to not drop them as were toilets, cabinets, doors and showers. My coworkers were usually fun people to work with and breaks were always interesting."
good,"I am on the team that applies price changes, sets the aisle to plan-o-gram, keeps the shelves clean and stocked for customer satisfaction.  Co-workers are great and very helpful.  Supervisor is very fair and knowledgeable."
good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with other employees and customers in a safe environment getting the job done to the best of our ability, and getting needs met. I learned to interact with customers with greeting them with a smile on my face, and positive attitude, and bringing out the best in me, and just meeting new people, and helping others out. I've worked with some awesome managers, and co-workers who are customer oriented, and making sure the store runs smooth, and keeping busy at all times to get the store needs met. I always got along with management and co-workers. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was being able to multi-task with getting things done around the store, and also, helping customers out as much as possible to make sure they're satisfied. The most enjoyable part was helping customers out when they came into the store to make sure they were satisfied to coming back to shop, and to get great reviews on the store and how excellent the customer service was on our part."
good,"Fun Staff to work with"
good,Perfect job for a kid in high school or a retired person. I was a cashier for my time there and it was pretty enjoyable. Nothing really hard about the job but also nothing really enjoyable its a relatively regular job.
good,I managed the Home depot Paints it program for the Cleveland Market. The Program and was not well thought through as far as timing.
good,"A typical day at work began pretty slow but by midday the service desk was busy.  We had to check out customers, take returns, answer the phones, send products out for repair, help other associates with problems that would arise, and smile the whole time while doing all of this at once.  The management was pretty good.  The hardest part of the job was the rotating work schedule and being away from my children when I would have to work until midnight.  I enjoyed being able to resolve customer issues.  I like to take a bad situation and turn it into a good situation, or at least one where no one is angry anymore."
good,"stocking freight, large amounts of pallets filled with small merchandise needs to be put on shelves same day.  Fast paced work; safety is a must."
good,"•	Managed the cashiers and the customer service department associates"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of loading trucks with freight destined    for a certain store. The work is not hard and can be easy to manage, but however their is a very remote chance of ever being promoted as the only management positions are filled from outside the company."
good,"I learned that Home Depot is a good place to work;  that there were a lot of fellow employees who really cared about one another and that the goodness in the name Home, had a ripple effect for both the people who worked there and the consumer. I also give credit to the management and the creation of the orange aprons; the color denotes enthusiasm, happiness, creativity, attraction, success, and stimulation, attracting people to something. If a customer had to wait to see if we could find a stocked item, they were patient and senior coworkers were there to help if need be. The management were fair and pleasant as well and appreciated all efforts. The hardest part of working at Home Depot was that too many people wanted to be The Boss sometimes which might cause gossip. I would just listen and let it go, looking for the goodness in that coworker and then I would lead with my good example of doing my work, minding my business and giving excellent customer service, or cleaning, going the extra mile; Keeping my energies, my integrity and the focus on my committment to Home Depot, all clean, cleared and positive. "
good,"Enjoyed working with Home Depot, I learned how to manage lunches and breaks, as well as how to manage a team of people."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working here simply because of the amazing management team that I had the priviledge of working with."
good,"Home Depot has a specialized retail environment dealing with home repair, and appliance, merchandise. I provided customer service as a Special Services employee and was later moved to Contract Services. The management has a high turnover so it is difficult to keep a consistent level of the understanding of your job requirements. I liked the position but inner office politics became unbearable."
good,"Merchandising, cleaning, sales techniques and constant customer service. Management is generally good. Coworkers are mostly great and willing to help with tasks. Hardest part of the job is dealing with retail hours and grumpy customers."
good,I worked first hand with the customers. I was a cashier. The employees weren't very friendly.
good,"Always something to do."
good,"•	Worked with store manager to develop strategies and objectives to drive sales and profitability."

good,"-Providing great shopping experience"
good,"Working at The Home Depot was an interesting experience for me as it held a lot of mixed emotions for me. I worked in the Electrical Department of The Home Depot, which is a rather rigorous department to work in. My fellow co-workers and associates were a pleasure to work with and even my supervisors were great and helped to create a comfortable environment. Management, however, was often difficult to get along with for me as they didn't come off too friendly for me a lot of the time. I realize that they have a job to do themselves, but they could have been more friendly and helpful about it all. While I had a minor issues with the manager and assistant managers' attitudes towards my fellow associates and I, they definitely did work hard and do their job well. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the interaction and open friendliness between the other associates and cashiers. I felt like I could be myself and enjoy the companionship of others while I was working. Everyone respected each other, for the most part, and we either got along well or left each other to our own devices"
good,You have the chance to work in different departments and learn a great deal about home improvement.
good,"high volume internal and external customer service, and lack of management help and guidence"

The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting and standing for hours on end but there are some good qualities to the job as well, such as friendly customers along with a high spirited team of co-workers. The management team does there best to work with you if you have any issues on the job and are compationate in alll situations."
good,Overall the customers was the best part of the job. Helping them getting their invoices done for the work they needed to get done.
good,"As a District Manager, I had to go to a store everyday and audit the lighting and electrical department bays for accuracy. I had to make sure that all projects were being completed in a timely manner. All fixtures had to be displayed, otherwise there needed to be notes on the back of the planogram telling me what was going on with it. I was making sure that the merchandisers were always busy and in compliance with all the rules and regulations of home depot and crossroads. I actually enjoyed my job, but the traveling was a little bit of a pain."
good,in my opinion it was a great place to work is just if you are part time then they cut a lot of hours.
good,help customers fid products that they were looking for. provided excellent customer service
good,"Many customers asked for me when entering the store as I was willing to help them with any problem they might have.  Most co workers were great to work with.  New management came in and was not well liked by many of the employees.  There was not really a ""hardest"" part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the customers I met as was able to make friends with."
good,"awesome place to work there. management and co workers are amazing. long shifts, but plenty of breaks and they make sure you take your breaks."
good,fun fast paced place to work and co-workers are great.  the hardest part of the job is dealing with inpatient customers.  The most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers.

Perform repairs on lawn mowers, tractors, generators, chain saws, weed eaters, pressure washers, jack hammers, fork lifts, appliances, airless paint sprayers, concrete saws, tillers, sod cutters, aerator, and truck rentals basic repairs."
good,"The only bad thing about this company is that it is almost impossible to get advancement and full time. I started from the bottem as a Lot Tech and didnt get very far in my 2 years serving there. They hire and fire to quick, and do not offer to many benefits. Other than that the people are great and it was close to the best job I have ever had."
good,the people are very nice to work with. The company it self needs some work.
good,Quarterly Bonuses. Not stressful work. Good management. Flexible schedule.
good,Customer Service is the number one objective of this company

good,"I loved working with my fellow associates, it was a fun and productive place to work at."
good,Garden associate. Employees helpful. Knowledgeable about products willing to go that extra mile for people
good,The Home Depot that I worked at in Oxon Hill Maryland was close to my apartment. I was part-time and I was glad I was getting a few hours when I first begin. Then gradually I started to get less hours and that area has bad customer service. Which gave off a bad vibe and you could also have no choice but to carry other people's workload.
good,"I learned a lot working in a home improvement store/retail, like the different kinds of dirt to use when gardening different things and how to markdown things and how to use many different kinds of tools"
good,"a typical day at work i meet bright, cordial, and hard working people. I converse with them and learn new things about home improvement. We also exchange ideas, theories, and practices. Management is very thorough and efficient. Their positive and proficient work practices instill the beneficial customer service values that allowed us to become #2 in the region. The hardest part of my job is dealing with irate, obnoxious customers. But the most enjoyable is meeting, enlightened, free-spirited individuals."
good,"The days were always busy with little time to catch your breath and just when you think it's all over another wave strikes in. I learned to become more active, there was little time to think about what to do since there were a lot of things that had to be done. Management will keep you on your toes they want a lot of things done and sometimes what they say goes against what another says. Like any other job all I can say is co-workers will be co-workers there are those that you want to work with and those that you have to work with but as long as the job is done it doesn't matter. The hardest part of the job is that things pile up fast if you're not working fast and even if you are things still pile up because everyone wants you to do everything. The best part of the job was attending customers and completing my tasks successfully and to the best of my ability because there is no greater feel than the feeling of achievement."
good,"I was a parcels assistant. Scanned, and packed parcels unto pallets. Helped out others when my line was slow. Management was cool and acknowledged all the hard workers. Rewards, cookouts and awards were given often. Good pt time work. Paid weekly."

good,Job experience allowed me to grow and do better in current position.
good,"I come into work sign in, then go check in with a head cashier to find out where they want me to work. There the front end, lumber till, and green house. Front end in just general cashier tasks, lumber till has to do more with different kinds of lumber, concrete, and roofing. Green house till is more to do with ringing through plants, we also help the seasonal staff with sweeping, watering and dead heading of plants. If i'm on the front end I can put through any or all of those items, if i'm not busy with customer i stand out from my till to greet people and chat with the other cashier beside you. Or if it really is not busy we tidy up around our tills and restock candies and gum. "
good,"Just recently starting at The Home Depot it seems to be a enjoyable place of employment. I like their values on customer service, coming from a strong back ground of customer service it comes natural to me to help every customer with exception service."
good,"Worked in the Electrical and Hardware department. The work was good; however, was not going to get full time."
good,"I would go to my divert and boxes come down my line. I used this sort of scan gun to open and check each pallet was correct. I would read the labels and take each box to its designated pallet. I would do about 1800 boxes in an 8 hour shift. My teammates were generally kind and supportive. after many months it became very tedious and boring, I was only doing it for the money."
good,I Loved working there . I learnd alot . I had the best Assistant Manager and nice Co-workers.
good,"The home depot was a great call center to work for, for the pay"
good,"great place to work, good assistant managers"

good,"Les pauses de 15 minutes payées et les pauses repas sont respectées à la lettre selon les normes du travail dans cette entreprise.  Collègues très agréables, superviseurs disponibles et à l'écoute des besoins de leurs employés.  L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste est la routine, toujours répéter la même chose et l'aspect le plus agréable est le fait de travailler avec une belle équipe enthousiaste et sympathique."
good,"Decent place to work and it pays the bills. Its not something I would stick with forever, but it isn't bad. They make sure you get proper brakes, and they have some company wide employee help funding I found to be very considerate."
good,Excellent place to learn that you are on your own if you dare to accept a position there.
good,It was a great place to spend several years.  I held a couple different jobs titles.  I was a cashier.  I also was a customer service rep.  In addition I work on a special team called the MET team.
good,"great work place, so so management and lots of lazy workers."
good,"This is retail, so there's never a chance or even a thought of down time, until its time to take your break.  If you are unable to get the hang of that, this isn't the place for you!  I enjoyed the opportunity to help SO many different people with SO many different problems.  No one day was the same for me at Home Depot, which kept the day moving.  Along with assisting customers, I was answering phones, setting up measurement appointments, maintaining the isles, giving professional knowledge and advice on customers' final decisions.  The Home Depot team was family-like and that's very respectable."
good,"Stock freight overnights in specific departments, Help co-workers and am helped when extra freight comes on days for specific departments, learn what products go where. Hardest part of the job is repetitive motion for heavy freight at the beginning of the week. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting objectives done and going home satisfied with the days work."
good,Learned how to measure wood for checking out those who were buying wood. Very nice people. Helped you out in learning fast. Was fast pace
good,A typical day at work would require me to walk my department and create a work-list on what needed to get done for that day.  I would also look over the sale numbers which would help me to create a plan to generate more sales for the store.  I also coach and train my associate to help them grow and become successful.
good,"Great if they didn't constantly change management.."
good,Help customers find products and look for the exact items needed to make customer happy. When not busy helping customers you sweep the floors and make sure products are well organized. Management informative and co-workers are exciting. hardest part lifting some merchandise. satisfying is when customer is happy and comes back.
good,I pull orders for the prodesk. I learned how to work the computer systems. Management is great. Co-workers are very helpfull to get things done. Pulling very larger orders by yourself. Is haveing weekends off
good,"Positive attitude all around. I listened to music well working. "
good,"enjoyed job very much since I love working witth flowers, co workers were very friendly,"
good,Hoe Depot is a good place to work at. The only issues i found is that to move on up you have to be on a constant transfer from one store to the other even if there are positions available in your store. They do work with your schedule and tend to be really flexible which is a big plus.
good,On a typical day you answer customer questions.  I've learned a lot on building a house and what materials that I would need to fix certain things.  The management is hit or miss on what to expect from them.  Co-workers are nice but some can be a pain.  The hardest part would be the wear and tear from walking in the store if your shoes aren't of the best quality as well as dealing with an onslaught of customers.
good,"for those looking for a future in retail, HD is a solid choice. They are very good about advancing valuable employees and striking a good balance between work and time off."
good,Learned a lot from management as well as my co-workers. Enjoyed the different type of work as far as training to drive optional lift equipment.
good,Great 1st job to get. You learn job etiquette and structure. How to follow rules given by management.
good,"Goo work environment and management. Most co-workers were motivated and happy. Working outside in extreme weather conditions was not fun, but only occasional. Dealing with customers, face to face, was nice."
good,"A typical was pretty average by going around doing my job, helping customers and co-workers a like. My big take away from both of my jobs at The Home Depot was customer service and the small and fine details about it. Management was present, but my interaction with them was minimal. My co-workers were generally good people and put in honest effort for their jobs. The hardest part of my job was dealing with conflicting goals from management / teams, outside of that, the physical labor. The most enjoyable part was putting in the effort and seeing it pay off with projects."
good,since being there ive learned a lot and have moved up fast depending on the store manager we have. i wish they did a better job at training there associates. i have some of the best co-workers there that ive ever had anywhere else. for the most part my job is pretty easy there isnt anything hard about it at all.
good,"A decently steady rhythm of tasks in the environment, but not very challenging over a span of time. "
good,Interesting and new clients each day. Opportunity to learn as much as you can obsorb. 
good,"• Trained new hires and managers"
good,Home depot was great to its employees.  I know many people who still work there part time to this day just because it was enjoyable. 
good,"Watering trees and flowers in the early morning or late evening is a Zen-like experience. Customers who really enjoy their home projects and gardens made the job fun and interesting. Being a part-time, temporary employee means no job security and lacks a sense of being part of the company's Big Picture. While I took my job seriously, worked hard, felt responsible for the product,  tried to learn as much as I could about plants and trees and give good information to my customers, I felt totally replaceable. Being let go with less than a day's notice because of the company's bottom line was insulting even though they gave my name to another store further away. "
good,Customer service is number one here; it is also the hardest part of the job. 
good,The Home Depot is a wonderful place to work. It is a team environment so if you don't have the answer there is always someone to ask. The people that work here are fun and outgoing.

good,"Worked in conjunction with Home Depot and Bell Nursery staff to ensure product excellence, service delivery, and customer service needs excellence were met"
good,I have been in a few departments and things are constantly changing.  Most co-workers are enjoyable but there are always a few who are difficult.  
good,I have learned so much regarding retail and putting customers first. I have always worked in customer service and have been successful doing so
good,I work part time as Front End Associate processing customer purchases and providing customer's  with  assistance and information about the Home Depot's products and services. I work with great co-workers who make the Home Depot experience an enjoyable one. The biggest challenge is moving customers along when the front end is short staffed. It is rewarding when customers appreciate the great service they are given.
good, A typical day for Home Depot consisted of customer service and selling tools. I would stay with a customer until that person got everything in the store they needed. I learned a great deal about sales. Home Depot had good management and co-workers were all very helpful. Knowing that advancement in the company might take up to 10 years was discouraging. I mostly enjoyed the people I worked with as well as some of the customers I had the pleasure of knowing.
good,I can honestly say that working there provided me with the base of all my management experience. I worked with individuals of various backgrounds and lifestyles. 
good,"I think home depot is great when i was a school. They worked with my school schedule, no problems, but now that im out of school and am available to work more hours, im not getting it. I want to be a full timer but they say that their are no positions available. I've been working for HD for 6 years, i think their should be some sort of seniority, dont you?"
good,"i learned how to cut carpet, measure square footage, and install flooring."
good,"Everyone very nice,  store had great management.worked there 2yr and moved up in the company fast"
good,"worked %100 all the time, learned how to read/make labels, management is very nice and respectful, co-workers are really lazy I have to do almost everything myself. hardest part Is working what others do not want to everyday. best is very quiet and work alone most of the shift. "
good,At the home depot it was a very nice work experience. I learned great communication skills. The nicest and the most helpful people you will ever meet all work there. the most enjoyable part of the job was the part were you got to help people with their projects. It was also really nice that you got the chance to teach someone else something you have learned. Management is really nice and understanding they do everything in their power to help you achieve your goals.
good,"A typical work day for me consists of interacting with customers and management. Approving transactions,handling cash and making decisions based on the situation.My co workers are supportive team players. They are very helpful and knowledgeable in their departments and as well as other departments. The hardest part of My job is sometimes it can become very busy and customers can become very aggravated due to the lack of help sometimes. What i enjoy most is interacting with the customers and meeting new people everyday."
good,Customer Service Product knowledge. Well managed Corporate store with benefits for part timers

good,"positive environment"
good,"Home Depot was an enjoyable job.  A typical day at work entailed markdowns/markups, assisting customers and contractors.

good,"Unload trucks, sort freight. Review reports, schedule trucks, process returns."
good,"Home Depot is a nice company to work for. I really enjoyed to working for this company. However, it would've been better if this company pays you a little more for your service and work there. "

good,"Set bays, cleaned, organized merchandise. helped customers.  Great benefits"
good,"Assisting cashiers with lunches, breaks, helping customers with concerns, questions etc. Everyone is fun to work with. There is a wide variety of people that I work around. You get to know a lot of people."
good,"The most difficult part of retail is working with customers since not all people enter the store with the same mentality.  The simplest tasks included showing a customer to his.her desired product and recommending similar products, while the most difficult included customers with little to no patience who needed heavy material that required the use of Fork Lift equipment.  "
good,"The manager I worked under was very harsh to me. I quickly learned that if I needed something important, I went to the manager over her. "
good,"It became easy to be friendly with every person I talked to. I had a lot of practice. Another plus was that I got to work outside and have friendly conversation with the customers. "
good,"I enjoyed working for The Home Depot in the beginning and then new management came in and moral went down a lot and it was not as fun to work there anymore.  I got along with most of my coworkers, I learned how to deal with customers that were a little more difficult than others.  The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of the management and lack of communication.  "
good,hd was a good company    it offered unlimited earning potential   
good," I love learning  new things, trouble shooting, and the fruits of hard labor.  The end product is always something to be proud of, especially when customers are happy with your skills,  If I could I would work for this company Full time, but bidding for jobs isn't a full time permanent thing."
good,Many different tasks keep you busy and help a day go by. Good company to work for with decent starting salary. 
good,"I started out being a cashier and was eager to become full time. I became full time and got promoted to a flooring specialist. It was inside sales to public and private contractors, specially trained to provide professional information on flooring and décor products and give estimates on projects customized to fit their needs."
good,"*Receive truck and check for accuracy. distrubute to the floor to be packed out."
good,"While working at Home Depot they train their employees in the departments they are in and other departments.  Along with constant train and updates,  they try to work with scheduling to make sure you have time with family.  The hardest part of the day is when you have a customer who comes in already angry and unwilling to be helped.  In the same way helping that same unreasonable customer and making them happy is the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,A typical day is answering questions from customers about there DYI projects and how and what is needed to complete them. Prioritizing tasks for associates to preform in department to maintain product availability and coach associates of qualifying customers of there entire project.
good,"Very friendly environment. Gets very busy at times throughout the day. When it was busy it was constant moving, helping customers, picking up stuff putting it back on the shelves. We it wasn't busy I had to find things to do such as clean up the work station, sweep the floors etc"
good,"I loved working at the Home Depot, it was enjoyable and fast paced."
good,"I learn that every body need help."
good,Easy goning day. I learned about different products every day. Management will take care of you if you take care of them.My co-workers are the highlight of my day. Hardest part of my day is working with really upset people.Layed back
good,"I have learned alot in my job, it is the kind of place you never stop learning. Management dosen't communicate very well with the Associates making it difficult to have consistency in the workplace.I appreciate everyone I work with I firmly believe there should be no cliques allowed and everyone should be treated equally. My staff and the people I work with make it a fun atmosphere I enjoy them. The most enjoyable part of my job is ensuring customers are happy !"
good,"Very easy job, wish I can work for them again, but my resume seems to get lost in their websight."
good,"Pretty standard customer service stuff here, Home Depot does care about it's employee's but it cares about the customers more, so don't expect a manager to back you on a call a customer didn't like. "
good,"Maintained the parking lot area with picking up trash, gathering karts for customers and loaded customers vehicles."
good,"Company its self is great. From store to store, values and structure varies. If each store was ran per SOP and the values / structure HOME DEPOT prides its self on, most likely everyone that came to a store would leave with a smile on their faces. But in real life, its a very random expression to see, customer and / or assc. "
good,"Home Depot strives to be the number one customer service retailer in the world. That being said, without having customer service skills you basically could not work there. A typical day of work begins with a safety walk ensuring that the environment is safe for customers and employees. Then employees walk their department and make sure all available merchandise is put out and available for purchase. Engage in customer service throughout the day. Stock shelves with freight. Clean up and head home after your shift is complete. The most enjoyable part of this job is the wealth of knowledge there is to be learned."

good,"Daily routine of scheduling, planning and creating work goals."
good,Company that believes in associate development. Lots of room for upward movement and great manager incentives.
good,I just recently got hired as a CSR. Super excited!!! I have heard only great things about working for this company. Call center has not been open very long in UT.

good,Energetic and fun fast pace with frequent personal interaction.
good,Great team all around. Amazing dental/ Vision benefits even for P/T employees.
good,"High energy enviornment, options to move around to different departments and learn new things, learned how to use different equipment such as key and blind cutting machine, managers did not mind putting you to work on something different and stayed busy, multi-tasking was difficult when there was a one hour time limit for each project and you have 3 or more projects at a time, meeting new faces and seeing your regular customers were the best part of the job. When customers like your work they constantly look for you, reward you and spend money."
good,If your looking for an exciting work day I would respectfully recommend not working here
good,I was a great place to work. The co-workers were very nice and helpful. I enjoyed the people that comes by and acknowledges my great customer services.

good,Managed 12 employees did reviews and acknowledge their performances for raises. Unload merchandise and truck and stock shelves and make sure ready for everyday use..
good,The benefits for working for Home Depot are awesome if you can walk on a concrete floor 8+ hours a day. People there are nice but some not held accountable for their actions. Teamwork can be improved and so can MGMT. A lot of work and not enough pay.
good,"I never knew I could help in such a way that would make someone happy. I learned how to listen and resolve issues regarding prices,and inquiries. Made sure they walked away satisfied. Management and co-workers were wonderful to me. I felt like I made a difference each and every day I was there. My favorite part of the day was when I was able to work in the cash office.

good,Fast pace environment
good,I really liked working for both Home Depots all most all employees I got along with and we for the most part pull together. A few thought they where above the rules and made it harder then it should have been. Home Depot thought nothing of pulling cashier off regesters to cover floor associates. Then when there where lines and we would call for backup the got upset for taking floor associates.
good,"The training is readily available for any home renovation topic there is, and the staff and mgmt are usually willing to lend a hand to help new hires get the hang of it. The people there are for the most part, hard working people with the exception of a few; but that's to be expected. The most enjoyable part of my job is gaining all the knowledge I have in the past few months."
good,"Never a dull moment, fast paced cash flow the entire work day, the management team was always helpful, willing to teach and help new employees through out the day."

good,"good place, good benefits nice atmosphere. co workers were cool. you know its alot of diff personalities. everyone is different"
good,"Working at Home Depot I learned the importance of having hard work ethic in an ever shifting environment. A typical day of work includes greeting and assisting customers, maintaining bay and aisle assignments, and carrying out various plans throughout the shift. I found it a pleasure as well as a formidable challenge to work in an environment that calls for punctuality and responsibility. The greatest pleasure of working at The Home Depot would be the knowledge I have acquired in carrying out these tasks."
good,I started at Home Depot part-time over 5 years ago while I was in college. After finishing school I transferred back home with Home Depot and became a department supervisor. Best part about my job is getting to help customers with their home improvement projects.
good,great company with good benefits with a lot of work. Fun to work for and fun to work with customer.
good,"A typical day at work was me delegating task to others and making sure store was in stock. Providing outstanding customer service and making sure customers feel warm and at home. From my years there, i learned alot. I moved up the corporate ladder rather quickly because of my hard work and dedication.There wasnt anything hard about the job because i was a quick learner and I got things done. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I train and develop others and giving customers the satisfaction they deserved."
good,The store I worked at had grear enployees but BAD managers. That did not like to work.
good,"Depending on my shifts, I would either start immediately with sending shopping carts in or pick up the debris from the night before. My job also included helping with customers getting their bought products (lumber, garden stones, mulch) into their vehicles."
good,This company has and is still going through many improvements as far as technology and associate attitude. A few years ago it was in a downward spiral and not living up to it's reputation as a customer service giant. The company has and is still going through changes to improve and modernize the way customers shop and purchase goods and services.
good,"Has room to grow, and lots to learn about fixing up a home. Working at Home Depot is like having a second family--you love them and hate them!"
good,This was my very first job and it taught me a lot. A typical day for me would be interacting with customers as they would check out or ask questions. Management wasn't always great. I got along with all my co-workers. I enjoyed my position I hardly ever had a bad day.
good,"A typical day involves constant communication among coworkers. management skills as well as heavy machinery skills. It's easy to get noticed by the bosses, but some managers do prefer charm to actual work."
good,Always putting Customers first is one of the main things for focus on and it can sometimes be dificult but i love interacting and takeing care of customer because as a customer I love when people take care of me.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work unless you are a temp. Be careful when applying during the spring because the hire a lot of temps during this time. Once the spring is over they let 95% of the temps go.
good,Even though the position was temporary I learned how to mix paint
good,Fun and full of energetic customers as well as employees. This company definitely gives you the room for growth.
good,"A typical day of work would be: signing into your on name on the computer in the break room, get your apron on make sure your name tag or name is on it, your measuring tape, pencil or pen, and make sure someone in your department has a radio. You would do any task from helping customer find product, cutting down wood or any other product to size for the customer, forklift duties in your department and others (only lumber sales had forklift certification), help load unload trucks of new product, refill and stock shelves of any product that was low and make sure your department is clean and cleared for customers to walk down aisles and find what they're looking for. Make sure you have a spotter at all times when using any heavy equipment while shutting down backside aisle if your pulling a product off of top shelf to insure no one on the back side gets hit from falling objects if there was.The meetings at night would tell us how much we made or lost in a day. Some things i learned was driving a reach and forklift to get products, how to deal with customers, know how to order products online in case it wasn't in the store, and know how to help in all departments because at times we were way busy or didn't have enough people on the floor so it made us quick and fast learners on the move. The management was pretty chill and laid back but was always on the floor making sure everything is up to par. they would work with your schedule if you made a month in advance notice to have certain days off and were flexible for you to make shifts changes with other co-workers. schedules were"

I worked closely with customers to help resolve delivery issues and other customer service issues. I was also a member of the safety team (In-Focus) assigned to address and suggest corrective actions for any safety issues found within the store."
good,"Very 'hands-off' management environment. Goals were expressed in very broad terms. The consulting team developed our own tools, methodologies and reporting outputs for the Home Depot Personnel."
good,"It is a very busy environment and customer oriented. I was a head cashier so I was always doing something, whether I was ensuring cashiers were performing their jobs properly to helping manager's when needed in other areas of the store. For the most part co workers tried to help, but sometimes couldn't when you needed them because of being tied up with customers. Most enjoyable part of the job were the holiday parties."

The managers like to reward you when you have been outstanding with customer service. My coworkers are some of the nicest people. My coworkers make my job enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is the hours. It takes 30 minutes to get to work and 30 minutes to get home everyday. It works out to be a 10 hour day."
good,"Treat employees well but are missing work/life balance. Company culture is really big and can be overwhelming. Because of its size, you often feel like you're working against yourself."

good,"The company is making many positive changes and try to reward success. They still give raises, although they may not be alot at least they still are and they also give out bonuses based on store performance to every associate in the store. Day to day work is what you make it and how good your manager is. A good manager will cut out the BS and drive you to either be better or find other employement. To succeed you need to have personal drive and use the tools along with common sense to grow your business. We are allowed to do many thing in order to make customers for life and some of the creative things that have come up are the real fun."

good,"There's no such thing as a typical day, really. That's what makes it fun and keeps it interesting. Cross-training at the different stations has given me a broader understanding of everything involved at the front end, and in turn given me a deeper respect for how it all comes together through our teamwork. The most rewarding part of my job is that I get to see some great people every day, whether they are the ones I work with, or our customers, and doing my part in making it a great experience for us all. The hardest, or least favorite part of my job is simply that I wish I had more hours and more of a regular schedule. Sometimes it's hard to make plans when your schedule can change on a daily basis.

I worked front end, special services, garden,lumber,kitchens,plumbing,electrical,hardware,and lumber. Everyone of my co-workers were more than happy to help me and work by myside. The hardest part of my Job was losing the management that had focus on doing things right, not cutting corners to ensure they got the more for themselves. The Job in general was the best job ever.

good,Home depot is a great company that has rank amongst the top big box retailers.
good,"Work was very simple. Basically you go in and put together different things such as grills and wheel barrows. My co-workers were easy to get along with. Management didn't really bother unless a certain job was not done. There was nothing to serious about the job. My job was as an assembler so once you get the hang of putting together things it makes it way easier and faster, but maybe the first couple times you would have to get the feel of it in order to move at a good pace.

I met some amazing people working at Home Depot.

The Home Depot help me get an education (Bachelor's in Business Admin) and is a leading retailer in the world. I am very grateful for all that I have learned and the level of dedication this organization shows for its customers. But as a 23 year old man, that would like to one day start a family; I don't feel that the inconsistent schedule and weekend/holiday demands are truly worth it. This is one of the greatest companies out there; but it is not right for everyone. Once again, I have nothing but good things to say about the big orange box."
good,Always have had wonderful co-workers. Management styles are so different from store to store. Good benefits.
good,You work hard and fast but always give time to the costomer. The saterday classes are fun to teach and the training is good. I came in at a bad time because of a bad ceo. I didnt stay as long as i wanted.
good,"Very productive and high speed work environment. Having a district, the job required a lot of travel to all of the locations in the assigned district from day to day leading to a fresh work environment daily. Generating leads during field days was exhilarating and at times difficult, but also made the day go by very fast. During office days putting together marketing and advertising plans, training new members, learning from senior members, and working with the office all together were supreme learning experiences."
good,I loved the team of people I worked with. I also like how i was always on the sales floor and working with the customer's on the floor. I never had a slow day while working on the sales floor and I liked it that way.

good,"It was hard work as a overnight freight associate,but we made the best of it .we had alot of fun and we got the job done."
good,"Home Depot is a fun place to work. However, because of the corporate structure now, many of the perc have been taken away."
good,"Working there was alright, but I did not like working shifts from 10pm to 6:30am, getting home to sleep at 7:30am and waking up at 9pm to only have an 30 minutes to get ready to go back to work."
good,Great place to work if you are into construction or providing customer service. Range of hours help with accommodating students and employees who work a second job or odd class hours as well as night shifts available. Always hiring new employees with a wide range of jobs and departments to fit every interested candidate
good,This job with Home Depot gave me the ability to exercise my sales skills. I was happy with the opportunity to greet customers and sell them a productive they had little previous knowledge about.
good,Very focused on customer service. Provided ongoing training.
good,"The Home Depot was a good place to work. Advancement was fairly easy for very hard workers. Benefits were good, and compensation was fair. Most employees are friendly."
good,The people that worked there were good people. The company had a lot of benefits for their employees like profit sharing every 6 months and they would help out if you were struggling.
good,"I worked a little less than 3 months at a Home depot in Albuquerque New Mexico, 12200 n. Coors 87021"
good,The Home Depot is continually developing items and ways to enchance customer service for each and every customer. The Home Depot wants life long patronage so associates are being trained on a continuous basis. There are also programs to make sure employess are life long and healthy.
good,working there was definitely worth it but it took a while for benefits to actually kick in.
good,"Home depot is a fun place to work for people like me who love to fix, and build things."
good,"I love home depot, and the team work displayed. it was a good place to learn new things, but there wasn't equal oppotunity."
good,"Home Depot provides an excellent opportunity to become more familiar with a wide range of tools and material. It was also exciting working toward providing better health and wellness to store sales associates and giving back to the community through ""Team Depot,"" which is Home Depot's Community Affairs Program."
good,This job offers a good work environment. Ability to work on your own and grow within the company.
good,They don't like to hire or promote to full time. Prefer Part time workers and they demand a lot of work for what little they pay hourly. They do offer benefits once you get full time. But on what they pay hourly it's hard to take advantage of these benefits.
good,"Like most retailers, there is a focus on maximizing each department by cutting hours to the point where there is too much to do in the time that one is there. I supervise the Pro Desk and there have been 10 employees to fill 3 positions in the past year. Most leave because the pay is not enough for the pressure involved with the job or that it is necessary to cover for other departments because someone calls out or someone else is at lunch.Because of the high turnover, talent is never really retained and the cycle begins again."
good,I learned most of what I know at this company they offered great training for associates and good work-life balance. They always are willing to help in the community and their Associates and have great programs to do so
good,The Home Depot has a great work culture. They are constantly doing something to give back to their employees and it feels like a family. If you don't mind a little heavy lifting from time to time and you don't mind retail home depot is the best store you can hope to work for.
good,This is an overall amazing job to work at it offers many great benefits and a lot of friendly people in the environment. It works with your schedule so depending on you is how they work with you
good,I was their for three years and everything was good except for management.. I believe they need to train managers at  better at handling of work place atmosphere.
good,My review on being a Garden associate  for the Home Depot is a pretty good position to be in if you like communicating with other customers about the outside world while gather and helping them with what ever they need to get done whether is they have a project on a house or a business.
good,"The culture is great, and you get to learn a lot, but you really have to push to get new things adopted and tested. Learning opportunities have to be fought for. Work life balance is great but the benefits are lacking. Compensation is also competitive but promotions and raises are not clearly marked."
good,"I don't really have anything to say about The Home Depot. It was a pretty good job, but there were some things that they did unfairly or unreasonably. Overall though, I've enjoyed my time there."
good,the people you work with are like family the pay could be better and medical insurance is very good  I like going to work to help customeers but manager need be on floor more than they are
good,"Great company, as long as you're an emotionless robot. Do not show any feelings, positive or negative. Only speak when you're spoken to. And smile! But seriously, if you have thick skin and a good sense of humor, go for it."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot depends on what season we are in. While in the spring and summer seasons Home Depot is very busy and lots of people come in every day to purchase something. While in the winter, Home Depot is very slow and most employees are stocking shelves, cleaning, and making sure everything is in the right place. Management at Home Depot changes sort of often, you are given tasks to complete in you department specifically, however you might be told to help another department if they are busy or have too few people. The hardest part of the job is you may get too busy at times and you will have other customers waiting on you for a question or any other help and it can be difficult to get to them quickly, because you want to give quality help to customers and make sure to not give them wrongful or half witted answers. On the other side of things, i find the most enjoyable part of the job to be able to obtain multiple lift equipment licenses to help you perform your job and to also meet new people and have quality encounters with customers."
good,"If anyone is able to work at The Home Depot, they can quickly gain large amounts of home construction knowledge. The many departments employees are very knowledge and very helpful in ensuring you have the knowledge to help customers."
good,"Leadership team always remains in a supportive leadership role for all store associates, regardless of assigned Dept."
good,"The was an enfaces on team work. When you start to working there you watch a lot of training videos, once that is done you are you work with your departments supervisor as well as a coach who shows you what to do."
good,Overall I had a good experience with this company. Unfortunately had to move on because the advancement and benefits I was looking for was not there..
good,"I had the ability to work by myself and make the necessary desitions as needed. I  also had the support of my manager as well. I  did not feel pressure from management, all I fell was true support and explinations when neded."
good,"Poor pay along with raises, raises should be based upon work performance per employee not same for all,,,,,,    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"It can be a great place to work but, there is a disconnect between Home Depot university classes and how business is performed in the store itself which is a reflection of the store manager and the ASM's.."
good,"Working in the lumber department, their will always be something to do. wherever it’s helping customers, operating machinery such as the the forklift/Reach , there will always be something to keep you busy."
good,Home Depot is a great job if you are in between jobs.  Home Depot does provide decent pay and ok flexibility. I personally would not make a career out of Home Depot.
good,Overall great place to work but a lot of turnover because of pay. Good employee perks and lots of food. A Homer fund that employees contribute to weekly and company matches which stays in store and is used to help employees that may need financial help in an emergency
good,Buena empresa en general con principios y valores.
good,Hours were good. My Boss was not a people person made it miserable but you can find that anywhere. He knew everything about the store and was responsible for many areas but not good with employees. Other employees were great to work with and very helpful.
good,this was a great company to work for. when it came to them promoting from inside the company it hardly ever happened. you could have 10+ years experience and still not get promoted due to them hiring someone fresh off the streets who has no experience but a relative higher up in the company. its unfortunate. other than that this place was amazing to work at. pay could of been better but the atmosphere was always a good one.
good,"Enjoyable experience in merchandising. Loved the stable 6-3 Monday to Friday schedule. Started with full time hours as requested, but cut back to allow fo new hires before the busier spring season"
good,"Good family like environment."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. There's opportunity to move up if you seek it. The company will invest in your career if you are self motivated. Great core values.
good,Be willing to work hard and be on your feet on cement. Not many full time positions mostly part time. A very large company and not very personable. And lots of computer training for all positions
good,It offers really flexible hours and a friendly work environment while also letting you learn about your jobs and the other employee's. It's a great place for out of school money.
good,"I worked for MET ( merchandising execution team) as a supervisor and the Monday to Friday  shift was fantastic. The management and people on the store side were supportive, positive and friendly, they were family."
good,"as a freight associate we are the backbone of the store. we start with unloading the truck then after sorting the freight we stock it all, finally downstocking as needed, every day. the work is fast paced, with a heavy load most days. there is a difference in culture between night shift and days, often for the worse. management has been steadily improving with new managers coming in to balance the old ones. new work practices have made for a more effective environment"
good,"Great place to work. The train program is excelent. Interaction with the customers was great experience, Working under a financial monthly goals was  a new experience for me."
good,"I would work there again.  I only left Home Depot to pursue a better paying job.  Given the opportunity, I would work for Home Depot again.  The paint department was awesome."
good,Some very good employees there are just trying to get their job done the best I can trying to make up for the bunch of lazy and useless employees that you got standing around there not caring and not doing anything just making it hard on everybody else
good,Decent pay and profit sharing check. They have many Things to do for community and employees. They usually start out part time and they have different schedules but you can not tweek time at all. For ex. If its 10-6 you can ask for 9-5 instead. They'll let you leave if it doesn't work for you even if you're a proven asset instead of adjusting the hours
good,"easy place to work. also easy to get passed over for promotion. I worked with a good team, and it made work enjoyable. others who fail to do their share make work difficult and frustrating. management fails to hold people accountable."
good,You can't maintain a lifestyle without help in a job like this.I have nothing more to share about working for this company.The job wasn't difficult but what was asked of as didn't match the compensation.
good,"Home depot is a great place to work, either part time or full everyone here is a team, yes there are many departments but there is only one roof. that makes us one team there for each other at all times....management is right there with you working by your side, not just giving orders. If you want a great part time job then home depot is your new home....At home depot you are family period"
good,"There are lots of learning opportunities, lots of different departments for one to gain knowledge about . Friendly work place customers and employees . Unfortunately the pay isn’t the best ."
good,"Good work environment. It is hard to plan for anything, since your hours are never the same. One week is 20 hrs., the next week is 32 hrs."
good,"A safety driven company, many terminations were due to workers not acting safely or not reporting incidents. Long hours around christmas time. Low drama environment."
good,Working was great with staff and sales. Pay left much to be desired. Training was excellent. Would recommend anyone that need a job to apply because they would have a place for you.
good,Very stressful at times very good company when it comes to taking Care of its employees but alot of disrespectful employees.  It seems like employees run the managers.  Been there three year's and just not getting better when it comes to employees treating there co workers very disrespectful.
good,"Very nice people to work with, help customers figure out how to do projects correctly without wasting time or money on things that they don’t need to buy"
good,"It’s a good place to work, the employees were very diverse and nice. The job itself is great you get to learn about items in the store you didn’t know about."
good,Learned how to work faster and more organized. Also i learned how to work more as a team to get things done that i wasn’t able to do alone. Also how to multi task and take care of customer's while working
good,"Pay could be better, benefits are good,  you are able to work from home if you produce well. Its very hard to get promoted because of management. I love that i have my Kaiser benefits that have had all my life"
good,Its great place to work.  Easy going atmosphere and amazing working culture.  Company could train better and hire people fulltime instead of parttime mostly.
good,"I was treated decently, enjoyed the other associates and management was Decent. Pay was average for this area. Benefits we're good too.  There was often food and, when I fell on hard times, an employee fund to apply for."
good,"I loved working there. Instarted in Receiving unloading trucks and placing production the sales floor for the overnight stock crew. Later I moved to mid shift in the lumber department. I enjoyed all the people I worked with on both shifts. Customers can be a lil mean and demanding at times, but when you get a kind customer that appreciates the help and knowledge it makes your day. Management is usually understanding and acknowledge a hard worker and a good mind."
good,In all was a good corporation to work for. They have wonderful benefits an. Hopefully  they treat their most established and educated employees with the respect and don't just throw them out  on the street.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to grow professionally.  You have an opportunity to work in various functional areas.  Since HD is a large company, networking is very important and helps with navigation."
good,"If you have skills to benefit the company then you have a chance at more pay and possibly full time. Working part time can be rough, especially when the slow months roll around. You can wind up with as little as 10 hours a week."
good,This is a fast paced environment to work in. In todays market with technology shoppers are very smart. The people can shop around while looking at your products. So you must be very confident in yourself and your products to be helpful to the shoppers.
good,"So Home Depot is a pretty great and sweet job for everybody and anybody. It's super easy, relaxed and the atmosphere is very positive and lively. The benefits are crazy good, also. From what I remember, part-timers qualify for dental/vision medical coverage and full-timers qualify for full medical coverage among loads of other things. "
good,"I worked for THD for over 25 years. It was at times contentious in that you learned about your responsibilities the hard way ie : really bad reviews on your performance.thus a not so good wage increase.It seemed like I was always ""walking on eggshells"". Over all on a scale of 1 to 10. I would rate7.5 to 8"
good,"Typical day on the job required the handling of various product to be loaded and unloaded from trucks with multiple machines. Best part of the job was the consistency and regularity of hours worked. The worst part about the job is it's very corporate, to many  supervisors and managers."
good,"Overall, a great company. Very fast-paced environment in a competitive retail space. Collaborative environment with somewhat relaxed workplace culture"
good,"Home depot was a great experience when its your 1st job but I cannot imagine staying there for many years. A typical day was coming in and signing on the registers, ringing customers and making returns, phone sales etc. I learned many valuable info about home renovations and products as well how to quote for special jobs. Management is different some are always there and have your back but some have favoritism and that is not good. Working at HD was great, the contractors get to know you and always come in to happily greet you its a special bond. The hardest part was being on my feet for many hrs, the floor is cement and they offer mats but they ware fast. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and translating for them and taking the extra mile to help them, they are the sweetest and they are like family."
good,"Focus on customer service is a must."
good,This job is good for school graduates they always offer part time jobs and and if they like your work they offer you full time but that's not so easy. Need to work the ladder up and work is always appreciated.
good,like most expect it all for a fraction of what they should pay for  it ie  the work of 5 people for the price of 1. i was there  a little over a year received a 3% raise.and was making more than some that had been with the company for over 6 years.
good,"I liked what I did, loading lumber I guess it depends on if you like what you are doing. I worked overnight and it also had its pros and cons. I mean you have to sleep during the day but when i was at work it was peaceful customer wise. But i was under a lot of pressure to get a lot done because there was no distractions."
good,"Attended meetings with vendors"
good,"I enjoyed by job at the Home Depot in Prattville, Alabama.  The only thing I didn't like was working weekends.  That alone was the reason I left.  The sales goals were reasonable.  However, I didn't enjoy asking customers about opening up a credit card."
good,"You will love the people there, most coworkers are usually pretty decent people (varies on location of course). A typical day varies honestly, It depends on store functionality. Some stores scramble because associates do not want to fulfil the responsibilities of their role and others operate smoothly because everybody takes part in store functions. The hardest part about being front end is when customers mistake prices and you have to elaborate, Worst is when you need assistance from a department (Price check, SKU number, etc) and they are either super busy or ignoring the call and you have a line of impatient customers  WITH NO BACK UP!"
good,"The Store Manager job is very fast paced. Every day is different so it does keep you on your toes. I felt the job was very rewarding as you were truly able to change lives both employees you managed and customers. Hard work and dedication I felt is appreciated by most however, you can be limited by the leadership team that works above you. "
good,Not a bad place to work but there's not much consistency with hours. Environment it's alright but management isn't the best. Advancements are there if you if have more skills and licenses than others. Also the money could better.
good,"I learned flooring, decore, Kitchin designing, how to use different tools, helping the customer in the retail environment. work environment was good, my immediate supervisor was helpful."
good,Very slow and very poor management. The job itself was pretty easy but everyone made it seem like it was harder than it was and always made it that way
good,Unfortunately they make it extremely hard to be hired back no matter how good of a worker you or what your title was but most managers are promoted from within which means they're more understanding and look after their employees. The company has a TON of benefits for students and families.
good,Make sure u have another job or retirement and u like walking u do alot of walking and Physical fit because there alot of heavy lifting. Managers are good to work for but I could not live off 18hrs a week.
good,•	Assisted customers in the lawn and garden department in providing high quality customer service in different areas with different products for household projects
good,Working at the loganville location was pretty good for the most part. The employees generally wanted to be there and work. The only complaint I really have was with management...
good,"My day started at 5 a.m. and ended at 1:30 p.m. Each day was full of price changes, detailed bay replacement, planogram resets and large holiday resets. I learned how to be a merchandiser during store hours while giving excellent customer service. Each new reset offered the ability to add my own flair while still following specifications."
good,Was an ok place to work at first but they wouldnt let you have more than 4 hours a day and thats not enough. Managers were helpful and nice but the regulars were rude and not helpful.
good,"Common in retail, staffing has been cut to the bare minimum. The only challenges in this workplace arise from this - the job requirements are simple and pay is fair in short term, however raises are small. There is room to grow in the company, and an eagerness to advance will be met with enthusiasm. Full time employees have set shifts, and fair benefits,  and part time work is flexible. Weekends are required regardless of what is promised at an interview, and while hours are guaranteed for full time associates, part time hours are unpredictable and may not have shifts in their off season. Demand is high for reliable and fast paced employees."
good,"Working at Home Depot was genuinely fun when I began working there in 2017, everybody was close, it was like a family. I was excited to go to work and enjoyed my time there. The enjoyed the people I worked with and things were not a strict. However, towards the end of my time spent there I began to dread going there. I switched from closing shifts, which I worked originally, to opening shifts and any ounce of fun or enjoyment  was sucked out of it. I enjoyed helping customers still and management was alright but the Head Cashier's had become impatient and it seemed as if they sought out mistakes in the workers. The department head of the cashiers was an absolute nightmare. You were not allowed to do anything but stand AT THE END of your register, not speaking to anybody but customers. If you even brought your phone out to look at the time as it was not shown on the computers, you would be chastised like a child and threatened to be written up. Upper management's (Store managers) and lower management's (Department heads/head cashiers) rules varied so greatly that it made it difficult to understand what was actually allowed and not as you were not getting in trouble with upper management for things you would be disciplined for by lower management. This is a job meant for a hardened adult who can handle ridiculous management, I would not suggest this job for a teenager UNLESS they took night shifts (approx 4pm-9pm) as they have the most slack management."
good,"Loved everything about my job but poor management forced me to resign, leaving a bad taste in my mouth about the company. I wouldn't have left if it weren't for new management."
good,This job made it available at all times to have the ability to advance and grow within the company. There are multiple areas to train and work within the company.
good,"It was a great place to work, the work was hard and the pay was a tad under what I wanted but I really did enjoy my time there. Hardest part of the job was working outside in the Garden area in the middle of the night when it was bitter cold outside, they did however provide hand warmers to take the edge off of the cold."
good,"Great co workers and team spirit. Flexible schedule, dental, vision, paid vacation/holiday for part time four hours. Fast paced most of the time. Learned good customer service skills."
good,Management leaves much to be desired. Not too respectful to their employees. Most employees have a not so good relationship with  management. Always complaining
good,I guess it all depends on where you are located at. I worked at the downtown Los Angeles location which got extremely busy at time especially on the lumber side.
good,"It was my first job. I worked in the lumber department running the forklift, stocking shelves, providing customer assistance, and closing down the department at the end of the night."
good,"Been working at Home Depot for a couple of months now. The staff on my team SEEM friendly and helpful but I think they need to work on their people skills. Overall, it's a great working and learning environment. As a Freight Associate, I was trained with 5 different lift trucks which is pretty awesome. However, the training went pretty quick on all vehicles. I didn't have time to get use to each lift. However, I did learn and got use to them on MY OWN time. It was pretty much a learn-as-you-go experience. I didn't get ANY help from my supervisor as far as operating the lift trucks for the first time as I had hoped for safety reasons. So I'm sure management and the coworkers were the only issues I have aside from the hours I work because my hours SUCK! I understand it is a part-time job but i expected to work more hours then an average of 20 - 25 hours per week."
good,"I thought I wanted to quit at least 5 times and find something else, but every time I went back and kept learning more things about myself or people or society and kept realizing I was glad I stayed because otherwise I wouldn't have learned these things."
good,I was close to retiring and had worked as a professional trainer and consultant and I enjoyed the experience at The Home Depot especially working with customers. I found cashering fun and the learning curve not that bad with lots of help from other associates.
good,Home Depot is a pretty good place to work. You are usually required to work weekends but that’s typical of a retail store. It is a good starting place for learning how to drive the forklift.
good,Great place to work but I believe they are behind the curve in monetary compensation. Hourly wage is not competitive with other warehouse jobs if they want to establish loyalty. Huge turnover.
good,"Home Depot is a very good company to work for. They have opportunities to grow without having to have a college degree which is nice for a lot of people. It is what you make of it. Management and customers are the worst part. Management does not always back you up, and set goals that are almost impossible to meet. Customers and people in general are so rude which becomes very evident once working in retail. Overall though it’s a good place to work at."
good,"The team itself was strong. How ever most of the managers would leave and not be able to be contacted in anyway. i worked there for two years, only got a 10 cent raise, but was left to run things as if i was a manager being paid as an employee"
good,"I enjoyed my time working there as I enjoy helping customers.  Although, I started in the plumbing department which I did not have a lot of experience in."
good,Just go to work focusing on the your job tasks and duties. Don’t  get involved with any work gossip or any of the above. As long as you work hard and do what you have to do there will easily be room to advance within the company.
good,Good energy .. fun working environment.  Management will just dangle the carrot. Empoyees that work so hard and go over and beyond deserve to be compensated much more than what they are paid.  They lose very good employees due to management  placating  amazing employees.
good,I was responsible for the day to day operations of a HD which employed over 175 associates. I was responsible for ensuring the customer service level was what our customers deserved.
good,The Home Depot is an excellent company to start my work experience off. I have learned many aspects within this business that would better my career in the future. The only downfall I would have to say about working for this company is the pay rate for the tasks Home Depot requires is low.
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot it truly gave me a sense of family and belonging.  No task is too hard, and everyone is ready to help out! On certain weekends we would do DIY projects with the surrounding communities ,,"
good,Task were always completed I followed directions and helped others when needed. I was always attentive to special details and learned alot about putting projects together .
good,"Buena opción para crecimiento laboral, buen ambiente de trabajo salario justo."
good,Very nice part time job. customer relations is my specialty so I fit in very well. They are very accommodating with scheduling. Bonuses every 5 month.
good,The work is average. Some departments require more heavy lifthing then others. Customers are normally rushed or in a hurry. Its good to know a little bit from every department. Most customers assume that working at home depot that you know every department well. So it helps to know some of the basic products for each department. If needed you will be moved to another departmenttemporarily.
good,Good temporary job. There was good teamwork on our night shift. The workload was shared among the team. I enjoyed my five month stint working for THD.
good,I have worked at the Glendora Home Depot and my time there was okay. Some management and leadership needs to reevaluated since they make some absurd decisions. As long as you do what is asked of you then you will be left alone. Recognition is based on popularity and sometimes ignored. In order to move up you need to build a close relationship with management and if you don't then I would say move on to another job.
good,"the only thing that I can say is enjoyed being apart of the company. Secondly, there need to be a better way to reward the individuals that goes beyond the Job description. Ten cent raises don't get it."
good,"The Home Depot is a nice place to work at, the environment is alright, everything can differ base on which Home Depot you decide to apply to and work at."
good,Home Depot is a very good company to work for. The leadership team is always open to new ideas and encourage change. Work and life balance is great. I have learnt a great deal at my time with Home Depot.
good,"It's retail. Base pay is determined by corporate. Pay raises are less than a quarter. Lots of teenagers who need a parttime job, so there are loads of bad personalities and low productivity. Management tries hard to retain motivated individuals but pay doesn't reflect workload and 150 coworkers make life miserable. Good management improves morale. Lots of free food on holidays and special events. It's probably the best retail job you could have."
good,"Worked as a night stocker because I needed to be with my family during the day. Home Depot was not a terrible place to work, it was what I needed at the time."
good,"There are great opportunities within The Home Depot.  They provide the training needed for associates to be successful within the organization.  While working for THD I've learned the business of taking care of the associates, and everything will fall in place (Customer Service/Performance/Teamwork)."
good,"The work load wasn’t the hard part, the hard part about my time there was management as-well Learning to work on my own doe to few associates on hand. Even with all that in mine they hand great benefits like. Insurance, Opportunities to build stock with in the company was available. To top it all they   Tuition reimbursement"
good,Nice second job to have. Worked there for about 10 years and it’s fun. Work can get a little overwhelming to balance the customer service and work that needs to get done.
good,Was a very good place to work with great managers. The reason for leaving is the low hours you receive in the job that i was doing. Would like to stay but no room to switch roles.
good,"Home Depot was enjoyable to work there, but I couldn't understand why management wouldn't let us work a schedule to rotate so we all could have 1 to 2 weekends off a month."
good,"great place to learn home improvement skills, and benefits are great for all. Management could be improved, store level managers are never on the same page about things, the department heads are also hit or miss"
good,"One of the better paying retail jobs ive worked. They have a casual work atmosphere and uniform. You can dress practically but comfortably than just throw on your apron you're ready for work. The time clock is in the breakroom so you don't have to worry about spending part of your scheduled break time, walking to and from your position and helping customers. It felt like a retail environment where they actually cared about their employees"
good,As a cashier it was difficult to stand in one spot for 8 hours a day without being able to sit down. Very slow sometimes often nothing to do but to dust the candy racks by your register.
good,"Very flexible hours. Lousy pay and career advancement. The people who work here are very friendly. In weekends it is a zoo and it is very busy and very fast paced. As in every place else, promotion is garnered by who kisses up to the boss the most."
good,"Decent place and company to work for, but don't expect good management or consistent hours regardless of performance. Typical minimum wage job so don't expect a lot unless you're managment."
good,I learned a lot when it comes to tools because their were many things I seen at the Home Depot that I ain’t ever seen before. The hardest part of the job is when it’s really hot outside and your loading mulch because on days like that it’s always busy .
good,It was very strenuous at times but when all of the cashiers were there it was okay. Understaffed so it was harder than it needed to be. Was not for me
good,"Really great work atmosphere, unfortunately the company gives out full time positions seldomly. I got hired for the spring rush, and was getting full time overnight, but by the end I was only getting 1 1/2 hours a week. Thankfully I have a car, so I could drive home, but I have a friend that was scheduled to work 4 hours on an overnight shift, so he had to wait to the end of the shift when the buses started running again to go home."
good,"If you work there as a cashier, I advise getting started on an allergy pill, especially if they have you in the garden. Instead of getting an employee discount you get unhealthy food every other week... yay..."
good,"Great company to work for. Care about their people, the community and environment. Great opportunity for advancement,  you can start as a part time associate,  the sky is the limit. You can become ASM,SM, DM. It totally up to you.  Just, Come to work, take care of the customers,  and do the right thing!!!!"
good,"What I have to say about home depot is that it used to be a great place to work. As time goes on, the company seems to care less about the mental and physical well being on their associates. Managers especially seem to pick and choose favorites with their associates, favoritism is a big issue. That and having a personal life is the hardest at the Home Depot. A typical day is usually good, work is the same, busy and productive. The days that make it great are the fellow associates and certain long term customers. I would say that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Overall, was a good job. Pay was low and they do not like to promote within, they prefer to pull people from other locations or outside sources. Management was alright but not the best."
good,"Good environment to work in, team oriented mostly. Fun people, good teamwork attitude, strong on safety and most of management are proactive in praise and complimentary"
good,"Hard work, but good for a first time job. You can develop a number of useful skills.   I would recommend this job for high school and college students."
good,a typical day we unloaded trucks and stocked merchandise on the shelf. had grewat associates who help[ed me out whenever  I need it it they always looked out for me and helped me become a better worker.
good,Overall a decent place of work. Some requirements for certain positions are counterproductive. Often times there may be 2 people in a particular department and if one person calls out of work you are pretty much alone. The company however is pretty lenient when it comes to attendance and does give you multiple opportunities.
good,"Working at the Depot can be great as a stepping stone due to the fact is if your lucky and on good terms with your SM or ASM they may be able to help you with your schedule. Unfortunately, There are so many people who can change things at the last minute so if you already have a ""class"" and have prior authorization a supervisor can change things on you at the last minute. Most People being associates and supervisors are friendly and its a very great place to work (at least that was my personal experience). About possibly moving up in the company, I've seen well trained and highly motivated people apply for a position and they never get interviewed yet some people new to the company who just came in two months prior get the position then leave or get fired in as little as three weeks. There's a bit of good but there's some bad too."
good,"Working at Home Depot, or at least in my case, varies from day to day. But I have come to learn that customers usually start coming in big numbers at 9 am going strong till around 4 and get to noticeable crawl at around 5-6, only to spring back with customers trying to get all their stuff before it closes. "
good,Upper management has lost their way and no longer follow the home depots core values that made the company a success in the business world but also a success to their associates.
good,"Very good Management, professional and understanding.  Work environment is safe and friendly.  I enjoy the people I work with and really like helping customers."
good,Working at the Home Depot is fun but really rough. Standing on our feet for hours takes a toll especially on big guys. Home Depot is very respectful towards its associates
good,not really any stress. training was very good and instructive. most all fellow employees were easy to work with. no adverse atmosphere to deal with . good atmosphere to work and engage with the public. excellent facilities to work in.
good,"Work days are long here. There is no opportunity to receive a raise in your current position. Only opportunity would be to leave or apply for another position within the organization. "
good,muy buen ambiente laboral lo cual la empresa se apega demasiado a las reglas
good,"Empresa agradable, se basa mucho en los valores fundamentales tanto laboralmente como personal!"
good,You could really make friends or family in this kind of work environment. lots of things to do and so many departments to choose from. Also as a home owner you could really learn a lot for do it yourself projects.
good,"daily routine "
good,"My store is located in Farmington, NM thereby you have associates there who are from Farmington or who have lived there awhile. Two wars were a breeze"
good,falta mas apoyo para los asociados en tienda para su desarrollo dentro d ella
good,"The Home Depot is a great place for career advancement. However, management at times can be hard to understand difficult times within the store itself. Pay is top heavy."
good,Great company to work for. My location needs some improvements in Managing and representing what the company stands for. People will always make the difference in a work place.
good,"Good place to work. Clear expectations. Great team work. There's a lot of opportunities for promotions within the company, but not so much on Maui unless you're willing to relocate."
good,"The Home Depot does compensate the management well, but the management work life balance suffers as a result.  It is very difficult to manage business and family time, and upper management does not let management plan time with their families that will not be interrupted.  Expect to be called while on vacation, and even asked to return to work."
good,"A typical day is grab your apron and hit the floor running. Always something to do. I learned a lot for working there from kitchen designer to working with contractors if your willing to learn you can be anything. Upper management doesn't care about associates. "
good,My managers worked with my schedule since I had more than one job. I was able to get my job done in a timely manner. My team and I worked well together.
good,"This is an awesome company to work for. They give you a lot of benefits even though you don't get a store discount. The management is great here, they are very professional. Most everybody gets along here and its a close community. There is a decent amount of opportunity but there is favoritism. which is frustrating at times. Even saying that I would recommend this company to anyone!"
good,I loved my job at The Home Depot. it can be hard and overwhelming at times. And the higher-ups would blame us for anything If we did it or not. I'm not going to get into details about it.  the main reason I let was because of Garden recovery. that's all I need to say.
good,A great job in Spring/Summer. Good mix of physical labor and customer service. Management fed us a lot in the warmer months. I'll never forget the hot dog eating contest.
good,each day was different. Had some set tasks but was more customer service and communication of tasks/items needed to complete DIY projects. Friendly staff and management. Training was provided.
good,Pretty flexible except for the fact that weekend workdays are basically mandatory and have to work almost nine hours. Job is quite lenient and cooperative with team mates
good,"Great place to work. Started in high school but wanting to move onto something different. Very easy job to pick up, everyone’s always in a good mood. Not stressful"
good,"Los valores de la empresa son muy buenos y concienten mucho al trabajador."
good,"This is a great company to work for, unfortunately there are certain stores that are not worth it. If you get a good store with a good management team, it could be the best job you've ever had! If you are so unlucky to get a store with management that doesnt say a word to you until you've been there for a full 6 months, stick with it until you can transfer to a better store! It's worth it once you find the right fit."
good,El trabajo tiene un ambiente de trabajo entrañable sin embargo no tiene buenos salarios ni horarios
good,"The Home Depot has a rich history and great culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help out our fellow associates and the community in times of need or tragedy,"
good,"I personality had a pretty good experience working at Home Depot, but some people at other stores really didnt like it because of toxic employees and possibly managers, as well as low pay and sub average benefits."
good,"My time at Home Depot was an experience that helped me grow as an individual. Everyday presented us with new challenges at the work location, but we would have to work as a team to ensure that we finished our given tasks in a timely manner. I appreciate all Home Depot has done for me and wish both the company and my fellow peers the best."
good,Very quick paced environment. Must be able to work in outdoor weather conditions. Pay was decent and paid bi-weekly. Co-workers were friendly and helpful
good,Working for Home Depot was a fun place to be. You can ask for time off and hours are flexible there. Management needs to be more caring for employees.
good,"Home Depot is an interesting place to work, and try and build a career. If you are willing to work hard in the face of stress and if you feel comfortable in a fast paced environment then you will do well. You just have to go in knowing what you want out of your time and out of the company."
good,Coworkers are amusing; they have erratic days off and you can't plan life around it due to inconsistency; there is a certain manager who is very power hungry that should not be a manager due to how she handles certain things.
good,"Home Depot is a good place for retired person and students or low-Skilled people. Because of flexibility of hours and work days but based on low salary of it, actually for some people are just wasting the time."
good,"I like working here I started as a front end cashier in another Home Depot location and job transferred for an immediate family members health.I have cross trained into other departments, there is room for advancement but its only part time unfortunately offered."
good,Not sure if the missions aren't followed in the south as they are in the North or if the company has just changed that much over the years.  Hopefully I just had a bad manager.
good,Good experience but not a place for a career. I would recommend as a great summer job but not something I would want to do long term. Very transient company staff.
good,"Great place with nice people but employees are given no direction on how to advance. can feel like the work and rate of pay don't equal out. lots of job perks (lunches, potlucks and an amazing Christmas party)"
good,"So far, I have no complaints about working at Home Depot.  We have a great group of people that work in my department as well as the time frame when in work.  So far, so good."
good,"Another review this system will not allow me to skip..."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Home Depot. I learned some great skills that I put to use on a regular basis. It's not an easy job, you are on your feet all day but the customers and co worker are very friendly."
good,"enjoyable place to work, the co-workers are what makes it enjoyable their, pay is not good and part-timers get the worst schedule and maintain you on low hours.  Most enjoyable is being able to take care of customers needs."
good,I think the most memorable aspect of working at Home Depot was how nice and honest your coworkers were and open athey are to helping one another. I am still in contact with several of the employees to this day.
good,Working at home depot was enjoyable over all. I had many years of experience in Design and was offered less than 10 dollars an hour. It was diffucult to get full-time. The management was nice and I appreciated my supervisor.
good,"Great managers and employee's."
good,"Good company to build relationships with v customers and understand the many areas of home Depot"
good,"I worked at The Home Depot for a year and a half, and my time there felt like a never ending uphill battle. The theft activity was rampant, and to make matters worse, I worked alone for a good portion of my time there. Most of the stores in my district had one or two AP Specialists assigned to them, and the company seems to think that is enough to make a dent in the shrink that is affecting the stores because of theft. Furthermore, they've recently put new policies in place that make working there as an AP specialist much less safer than before, especially considering that a large portion of the shoplifters you will be dealing with are career criminals. There's also the constant restructuring they do, which means your position is never really secure. In my opinion, the cons outweigh the pros when it comes to working at The Home Depot."
good,Great Company to work for outside of the call center. If you are in the call center it's not suitable for people with families. The culture outside of the call center is absolutely amazing. You're treated like a kid in the call center.
good,"the people you work with are great, it is definitely a humbling experience. However humbling doesn't pay the bills. The wages are low to say the least but with the right team and set-up for coaching, involvement (associate and customer relations) it can be bearable. would not recommend for a single income household with dependents or outside of low end ""middle class"" life style. culture is awesome, for the most part I believe they try to throw the biggest mix of people from all walks of life into a pot. most enjoyable part is working with ""a family""."
good,I had to leave company when it came down that they were no longer hiring full time for the position I was waiting for.  Attendance point system is also no fair across the board.
good,"It is a family oriented place to work with interesting people and co-workers, I have learned the ""do it yourself"" method with tools and appliances that I can install or build around a home. Including following a planogram to get the job done accurately."
good,"The company overall is such a great company to work for. With the vision and the culture invested in their associates, they continue to strive to be best in customer service. However, some refinement is still needed: Compliance with standard operation alignment of procedures and updates, resources within the company were not made  aware to  associates, and general overall treatment of respect. Management continues to struggle with engagement with associates due to the amount of stress and pressure they are put under for daily activities; however, if everyone instilled the customer service mantra, the company will continue to be successful as they are."
good,"It's got its ups and downs like most jobs. You do what you can there and the management usually doesn't get on your case much, as long as you do the work. The people there are generally friendly. If you like home improvement, you might like working there."
good,The benefits aside from PTO are extremely good.  They are some of the best I've had.  I have met some fantastic people.  They have a mentor program and I have kept close contact with mine. That has been a great benefit.
good,"Overall Home Depot was a fun place to work, but they seem to value their employees. Pay was always pretty low but not having anything to compare it to early on was fine. Wouldn't recommend staying long term unless you're planning on going into management."
good,Home depot is a good job if you can handle the schedule of retail and walking on cement flooring all day long.  The people are great.  I would recommend it for a start up position
good,"Is interesting as a cashier to meet a lot of people every day, co-workers working with me are nice and helpful,is a fast environment but fun to do every shift is new."
good,"Cleaning up getting ready, doing every day of my normal work stuff. The management is ok, good days bad days. The work place is a good place friendly people. The hardest part is working out side some times in -35 in a hoody. I enjoy the physical work, i really like most of the job."
good,"Home Depot is definitely a real team of people, which is furthered by everyone having at least a little cross-department knowledge. So you're not just going to interact with the people in your department. You can ask virtually any of your coworkers a question about a product or the store and they'll have the right answer most of the time or know how to find it."
good,The Home Depot is a very Cutomer Firendly/ Customer Service driven company and strives to constantly bring its customers better services and better customer service. The Home Depot is very driven to help train employees and make sure they’re well prepared for anything that might be thrown at them regardless of what that department may be. Great first Job for anybody or even someone with previous work experience. Highly recommend.
good,Good work culture and management is also good. Customer services is really good. The superior office door are always open and they are really friendly too.
good,Good place to work but needs improvement on helping associates to move up and advance. Needs to give more hours to people who need them and give raises when they are due.
good,"I began working at the Home Depot in 2015. Since then, the company has taken on policies that restrict part time and even full time hours severely. In addition, management is promoted based on brownie points earned with superiors rather than skill. This occasionally leaves sycophants with poor managements skills in positions of management. Overall, I'd still recommend the company to those looking for work."
good,"A day at work would consist of assisting customers with various DIY issues."
good,The home depot is a dynamic workplace. Sometimes it can be fast and sometimes it can ve slow. There is usually always something to do. There is alot of opportunity to advance your career.
good,"If you enjoy learning  new things, then this is a cool place to learn. Employee management and data analytics is what I learned here. Management is understanding and professional. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours and never going full time. Helping solve a customer's issue was my best part of the job."
good,"A typical day consist of facing product and packing down as needed. Educating customer about the difference in product choices.  Coach the customer on the process to have the product ordered, delivered and installed if required. You learn the value of keeping a clean area and fully stocked product will help sell.  The work structure is friendly between all the assoiciates and managers  The hardest part of the job is packing down and keeping the product stocked. The most fun part is helping the customer with their choice and solving any issues they might have concerning product and installation and maintenance issues.  Providing good ole customer service."
good,"you visit with customers in their home to present solutions. "
good,"Home depot is a great company, for a retail store. Good management, benefits, and scheduling. Starting to care more about ""creating shareholder value"" than employee value, though."
good,if your unable to perform at the rate they want you to they will let you go. overall very fast place work environment only plus is the amount of days you have off
good,"Working at the Home Depot was great because the benefits were good and the applications for the skills learned were large. Unfortunately out of the three Home Depots I've worked for employees have discriminated against and profiled young people as being prideful, stuck-up and overall not good workers. Management could also use some work with having a more centered viewpoint on a conductive workplace environment. Overall though, they were a good place to work for if you want real life applicable skills and knowledge."
good,"Management "
good,"Overall a bearable workplace, most of my coworkers were enjoyable to be around. Management was rather hands-off and a couple ASM's were sometimes reluctant to assist."
good,"The pace in the warehouse was fast and friendly. There was always a friendly associate that would lend a hand and share tribal knowledge. The upward mobility is difficult, but the overall culture was diverse and friendly."
good,"Home Depot as a company is great they give back to the community, help out there associates when needed, and have a great culture to work in.  The downside is the compensation is difficult to live on."
good,"Employee consensus is that we are provided the tools to get the job done each day, sometimes improvising to solve problems related to the job or for customers. Sometimes stress related with negative customers, but overall a relaxed environment to work in. Everyone complains about the pay and the indifference to how some employees are treated better over others. Some people are paid higher than others doing the same job."
good,"The hardest part of an ASM role:"
good,Not a bad place to work. Honestly Home Depot isnt a horrible place to work... but if you arent looking to make Home Depot your permitnent home be careful because you can get trapped...
good,Good for a high school job. You learn a lot of things depending on what department you work at. The downside is you get little pay when compared to new associates even though you have experience and other skills.
good,It wasn’t a bad place to work. They are pretty flexible if you are going to school. The work environment was well. The coworkers were nice and nobody was rude or treated you differently.
good,They do a lot of layoff and call back. They will train for different position. You learn different things about the tools and other things. A lot of teamwork.
good,"The work is not hard, and if you do what you are supposed to, you are left alone.  People are very nice and everyone gets along.  They have store contests often and throw BBQs in the park.  The store is divided by Store employees and Merchandisers.  I was part of the merchandising team."
good,It was so much for one person doing all the work outside and really stressful to get every single one in there before closing time and some  managers were more biased towards others
good,"You'll learn a lot, that's for sure. Depends on what your department is though, I suppose. As a puller there's a lot of stress involved, but if you can manage that and handle the other employees, you won't have a problem."
good,I’ve worked at the Home Depot through school and have known that I don’t want to advance to higher up positions.  It’s good when the management is good.
good,"You will not get rich at Home Depot. Like most retailers, the pay is not great. better then a lot of retailers, but you will not get rich there. Customer service is big at Home Depot. I never got in trouble for interacting with customers. The team is genuine and the customers are a hoot. Too bad the pay is low."
good,"Productive and educational workplace. Management is good."
good,"i enjoyed working there for the most part, but like most thing their is people drama with employ on management.but on holidays they  would bring on food to cook  or already cook for us but mind you we where the night shift so for the most part it wasn't good by the night.But if you had a problem with something they where quick to help you in any way possibly they could."
good,A typical day as an associate at Home Depot prepare daily to cover for a department not your own because some days coverage is short or others call in and need a fill in. the work environment is friendly and relatively relaxed.
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, es un trabajo limpio y seguro"
good,loved it here. too bad the corporation is so big that the powers that be sitting in Atlanta turn bblind eyes to specific situations on a local level.i bled orange
good,"Can be stressful, as in any retail establishment. Reasonable expectations for the most part. "
good,"Typically begin the day walking my section to check for safety and security concerns and then checking for any unfilled products; if located, down stock to ensure product availability for the consumer. Greet customers as they enter my area and assist in any way I am able."
good,"Home Depot is a decent place to work, at least my store is. They need offer more competitive compensation.  Many other companies in the same job field are doing so, and they need to follow suit if they want to retain their employees. Home Depot believes their incentives are enough to offset the lower wages, but they are wrong."
good,"It was a fun job and strictly part-time.  I enjoyed the customer service part of the job.  A lot of turn-over.  Pay was not stellar, people were fun.  Management was management - both good and bad."
good,"Working at the Home Depot can either be really busy or really slow at least for my department. They give a lot of hours if thats what someone is looking for and needs the pay I highly recommend. They do work with your schedule you just have to let them know and see what fits best. The people there are cordial. If you have a short fuse I wouldn't recommend working here, customers can be pushy and impatient  not all the time but time to time. Overall I never had a bad experience here. The management team is understanding."
good,"Very rewarding industry with minimal opportunities for advancement unless you are in the know."
good,"It is a well rounded workplace, although with management changes there has been a few hiccups, they still try to be the ""famiy"" the store always projects."
good,As a Home Depot employee you are exposed to a lot of creative ways to enjoy your job.  Training was lacking and could have been more detailed but they do offer cross training.
good,Its was a good first job i learned alot. The worker are helpful and polite and i would recommend this job to many people no matter the age difference i think its a great diverse environment.
good,"If I could work there again, I would for the environment that I had with my fellow coworkers. Honestly, if there was a bit more accommodation for standing on cement for extended times in front of cash registers or desks, it would be nice. More mats, preferably."
good,"I loved the job, people I worked with and working to help the customers. Everyone there was helpful and willing to share their knowledge. As was I. Hardest part was locating products. Nobody could find them. I learned a lot of patience with difficult customers."
good,My work at the Home Depot was fulfilling. I would like to look for new opportunities in the company or outside. I recommend Home Depot as a workplace.
good,The department that I worked was very demanding. We could have had more people to make it better. The manager could have or should have taken some ethics classes.
good,"Good managers and supervisors."
good,"If you can get your availability right, The home depot would be ok place to work. Good salary, lacking in communication. You can purchase stocks at a 15% discount."
good,I enjoyed working with the people there and the customers as well .  Lack of training in some areas. Hardest part was Trying to help customers with certain items in the store due to my lack of  knowledge.
good,"I worked the overnight shift at Home Depot in Shrewsbury. Every night was the same thing: bring out product from receiving and load it on to the shelves. If their was any overstock, use ladders and machines to put it up in the overhead shelves. I was also responsible for recycling cardboard in the baler. The management style of my store was teach by example. They would show me what they wanted me to do and then leave me to do it. After a few months working there, I caught on to the rhythm and could pretty much do the job with little to no supervision. The hardest part of the job was the fact that my sleep schedule was the reverse of everyone else. I slept during the day and worked during the night. After a while you start to miss the sun. Luckily, Home Depot knew this and tried their hardest to make the job palatable. Every month you had something to look forward to, some event or free meal that said that Home Depot did care about you."
good,"Most days are fairly uneventful, but rush time can be really stressful. Management is chill, but they work hard to stop theft. Home Depot has a lot of associates that are happy to help others, and the culture is very inviting."
good,"The company as a whole is very who you know trype of company. Job security is non existent, and mediocre  pay for job workload is all but meaningful. Overall it’s a good place for a college kid, as long as your ok with customers being rude to you occasionally."
good,"Home depot is always busy, there is never a day that you wont have a challenging task to tackle. Everybody does there part to help the store and to help everyone."
good,managers are not friendly they rarely greet you. some of the department managers wont answer you when you ask a question. other than that fun to work sometimes
good,Great company to work for.  You are able to grow within the company quickly. Learned a great bit being able to work in multiple departments within the store.
good,As you progress up the leadership ladder Home Depot demands more productivity from you as an individual. It almost felt like average and below average employees could just show up and yet department heads the better your production the more they demanded from you.
good,"it is a good place to work, the people are great. the business is run very smoothly and people work together to get everything done. there are tough days but it can be easily solved by working together"
good,The Home Depot is a Customer oriented company that's extremely fast paced! The volume of business is astronomical. Management is lacking a little but all in all this is a great company. They could pay a little better.
good,It was an okay experience working there. Was sometimes frustrating working with some of the employees as they would tend to do things their way instead of following company policies. Was short staffed in some departments.
good,"In some ways not a bad job.  On the road in your car going to appointments at customers houses 90% of the time.  If you don't make the sale, you get nothing.  There is no mileage reimbursement.  Its all built into the commission."
good,"The work environment had a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere. The people working there are great and have great communication. As a cashier, there are periods of slow days, where customers are few those were the times' work became slow. But during the busy hours' work was fun and exciting. I enjoyed assisting customers and talking to them I enjoyed my time working at Home Depot."
good,"Nice people to work with, never had a problem with anyone. Always had help if I ever had a problem, and did not understand. Threw parties, etc like Christmas, Thanksgiving."
good,"Although I did have to work hard as a cashier some of the time, I also had to stay visible up and down the main aisle so customers could see where a checkout area was and so thieves could see that exits were monitored.  Also you had to ask for days off four weeks in advance although you only got your scheduled two weeks in advance.  You had to work 7.5 hours to merit a 30-minute break and I was rarely scheduled for this long of a shift.  Finally, a Head Cashier harassed me, the managers knew she did this to several cashiers, and she was never coached or disciplined about doing so."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work with opportunity for advancement. They offer all the training that the job requires with competitive benefits and pay.
good,Decent place to work. Management was nice and respectful. Any issues would normally be resolved in a timely manner.  Too many long time employees that plan to retire so getting on full time is impossible.
good,"Home depot does not poaition employees according to experience, but rather due to seniority. It doesn't matter if you were in a District position before,  you have to start at the bottom and work your way up the ladder."
good,"Had a good time working . Great benefits, happy staff and didn't mind going above and beyond for Customers.  The pay per hour is ok but if not in management  You probably need another job."
good,I transferred to another job and was unable to take my job with me. The pay was ok and the work days were great. The pay could be a little better. Decent place to work.
good,A typical retail experience regular hours a set environment without any possibility of adding anything to the way business is done. The overall climate was good with a feeling of caring that you were an employee.
good,Can be stressful at times due to lack of help. The pay is low for what is expected and raises are small. Management tends to play favorites. They do try to work with you on your hours of work.
good,"Management is childish and they need to update their systems and learn to listen to what works. They lose too many good people because of this and the solutions are logical. Other then that, its the coworkers and the culture are what makes you stay. That and if you look for the benefits and the advantages then it is totally worth it."
good,"Treat associates fairly. When minimum wage increased, unlike many employers, Home Depot did NOT cut hours or benefits. Hours of work vary from week to week."
good,"Everyone gets along, good team environment; management stands by their employees; flexible hours; never a dull moment, work is consistent; opportunities for advancement"
good,"Opened the department five days a week for three years.  Forklift certified (OSHA) in order to unload and load trucks.  Created orders for inventory, HAZMAT trained, and pulled online orders for customers.  Excellent customer services skills and certified on all saws in Building Materials/Lumber.  Due to those skills, often worked in Lumber, Building Materials, Hardware, Receiving, and other departments where needed at that time."
good,I have worked with the home depot for almost one year. I enjoy the job and the people I work with. The manual labor is limited with the ability to drive equipment.
good,Freight associates have a repetitive and usually give weekends off besides during the summer. The Home Depot is a place I would recommend working if anybody is willing.
good,Most of my hours were spent at the store after closing and before opening. Work was delivered to us at the locations where it would be stocked on the shelves.
good,Good company to work for u told you make someone in power. Mad .Then you can count the days till you are terminated. They expect way more than they pay for.
good,Good overall if you have the right blend of upper level management and employee balance. I enjoyed working there and would like to go back and continue with the company but circumstances didn't allow it.
good,There is some favoritism among employees and management for recognition and awards. overall a good place to work with the right people. Bonus twice a year nothing crazy though.
good,"Had to take order for oversea customers and call to check on order that was going overseas, made sure that each order was pulled and ready for delivery. I also took orders for contractors and pro customers that came into the store. Place special order for items that the store did not stock and made sure that the order was in on time and call the customer if there was a delay in the order."
good,Not to much hours but its has a great work environment. Management and fellow associates are all nice. Good benefits for full time but no employee's discount.
good,my typical day at the home depot was getting my department ready for the work day that was the hardest part of my day. The best part of my day was driving the fork lift and helping the customers find the things that they needed. I also liked working out side in the garden department.
good,Home Depot was a great place to work. Both lower and upper management was very personable. The work was not overly difficult. The only problem that I found with working there was that it was very difficult to get at least 30 hours per week.
good,Home Depot does a great job creating a culture of teaching. I loved helping people learn how to do something. To this day i still do. They give back to their communities and their people. It is a little stressful because you can use more help. It used to be a structure of upside down management philosophy and that was great but the change made a lot of great people move on. I still believe in their basic philosophy and products. I dont like that many of the products come from china.  People can have a great life working here.
good,They were really helpful and a great environment as a first job. They were understanding and there were great leadership that walked me through the process of being a great employee.
good,"Had a great Manager and enjoyed working with him and the other wonderful people at the Burnville, Mn Home Depot.  The hours worked well with my busy schedule.  Often thought about going back to work part time with the Richfield Home Depot."
good,Company offers great potential for analysts and managers to enter the company and obtain promotions quickly given the constant rotation and promotion.
good,Home Depot is a good company. The workload keeps you busy and other workers help make the day go by. I would definitely recommend Home Depot. The only con is the price of the benefits vs what you pay out of pocket.
good,"The Concord Home Depot is always busy, and you can learn fast, and move up easily. Management is mostly great and does their job, and it seems as though everyone there is a family."
good,Over all I liked working at home depot because it allowed me to learn so much more because it was my second job overall. And after u work in a fast paced job everything else is a piece of cake.
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Management comes and goes quickly so there are constant adjustments to be made. Work isn’t too challenging and for the most part great people to work with.
good,"on average of 135 associates. profit and loss reporting reports and a lot of other reporting for different departments in my career ant the home depot I started in the Mill work department, as an associate, I ran front end and pro desk and service desk, I managed hardware,electrical and building and lumber and then moved up to a key holding manager."
good,Management  was not willing to work around my school schedule. They were reluctant to schedule me for less hours. The pay was decent for the job required but hours for part time associate are too much
good,"Home Depot is a fantastic company. Many of the employees in the stores, the field and at corporate office have tenure. The environment is awesome and you will learn to be a great leader and individual in your community. The issues that I personally experienced did not start to impact my view of the company until I reached the corporate level and started to see that sometimes its not  what you know but "" who "" you know when it comes to promotions / lateral moves. The schedule for salaried leaders can sometimes be brutal but if you love what you do you don't mind the hours and I believe that this is the mentality of most leaders in the organization. The pay is on par with industry standards as well as the benefits."
good,HD is a good company to work for.  Stores empower employees to make sales and have fun.  It is a very social environment.  More of a job and not a career.
good,The Home Depot RDC is a fast paced environment. Management does expect a lot from their employees and should give more recognition to its harder workers. The workplace culture is not too favorable.
good,"The home Depot is not a good job to turn into a career, but as far as being a decent place to work it's alright. The wages were a bit low for as hard as the overnight team worked in the fast paced work enviornment and management wasnt very willing to listen to the team members or willing to realize that we have personal lives outside of the work place."
good,"The Home Depot was a nice place to work, although I worked the late shift, witch I didn't like. My fellow employees were very nice and helpful. Management was also very good."
good,When started I wanted full time work and Benefits but they informed me they only had part time work for now I was a lil disappointed so I guess I just have to hand in there
good,Graveyard stocking from trucks can be very physical. Hard to get from part-time to full time. Can get forklift certification through this job. Ok place to work
good,"I would receive a list of customers with the specifics to their order of flooring the night prior to the measure date. I would contact the customer and set an appointment for the following day factoring in travel time from one measure to the next, the complexity of each measure, any time limitations and the size of the job. The most challenging portion of the job is catering to customers time demands that are similar in nature but they might be 75 miles apart from one to the other. The best part of this job is meeting people from all walks of life. Many interesting people out there with intriguing stories."
good,"Good place to start if you are willing to give it your all. Possibility for improvement however, it takes a long time and there is a lot of competition. If you enjoy a retail job you will enjoy this one."
good,I really enjoyed working at home depot. I knew what my tasks were and I accomplished them. I arrived early for my sift everyday. I am a strong worker.
good,"Pay was too low, extremely difficult to move to full-time where the good pay and benefits are. Some of the staff were very strained financially by these limits.  I was working part-time just for something to do, so I wasn't looking for full-time."
good,This company is well established and well structured overall.  The processes and procedures that are in place help to make your job much easier than it might be otherwise.
good,"rapid promotion to fill store needs with a stopping point when you reach assistant store manager level as very few spots available. Like any retail depends on the people you are working with and your direct supervisors involvement. Very long hours during peak times and crunches, experienced having to stay because of lack of coverage to open or close store. Upper management leadership role feels like being under a microscope with all your actions being reported. Lots of associate engagement and rewards."
good,A typical day at work varies. I learned that I like working by myself sometimes. Manement was fair and respectful. Workplace culture was great. The hardest part about the job was sitting in the cubical by myself when it was a slow period. The most enjoyable part of my job is the employees and how laid back it was.
good,"Great work environment as long as you are there to do your job and not make a friend. Pay is decent with the right hours, always room for advancements"
good,"The managers do not care about the employees. All they care about is sitting in their office doing as little as possible to collect their paycheck. I worked as a sales specialist and specialists only get $1 per hour extra over every other associate in the store even though specialists bring in most of the sales. Specialists have much more headache and stress to deal with, especially with terrible installers and delivery personnel. The managers have a superiority complex and that led to many people leaving the store. The issue is still present at this home depot."
good,The company offers many benefits.  The ability to learn is endless crossing over into other departments.  Your able to pick up additional skill sets and company offers monthly learning requirements.
good,A typical day was moderately busy with a list of jobs that need to be done by the end of the shift which aren't too overbearing. What I learned is a bit different compared to the new lumber associate. I learned a lot when I worked as a lot associate before hand. The culture is great. There's this atmosphere where everyone wants to help everyone. The most enjoyable aspect of the job would be the customers and the employees. The customer's genuine gratitude to your efforts makes the job so much more rewarding and with your coworkers continuous help. It makes everything so much easier for the day to day tasks. The hardest part I would say would be the busy days but that can be said for any job really. The real hardships I had was with management but not the whole of it just the store manager. The store manager held impossible standards for the our department in that time. It felt like it he wasn't taking into consideration the current amount of people on hand because we were shorthanded and simply gave our supervisor a list to get done but still required us to fulfill our daily tasks. He even made things worse by shifting some of our personnel to other departments.
good,"It is crazy and no set schedule not a lot of hrs,but love the customers love the managers it was a great enviroment. It is a great place to work with great people."
good,"Home depot is a productive place to work"
good,"When I started, it was a temporary part time job. I quickly grew to the pace and was consistently out-performing others. I decided to move up with promise of more money and more promotions quickly, which never came."
good,"I was given a unique position with this company.  I enjoyed it very much.  I was treated well by my bosses.  I have worked for their competition and they did not measure up in the work place environment that  I experienced at Home Depot.  Do not expect any serious raises unless you want to step up in position.  "
good,"As a whole, it is a great company to work for, the benefits are varied and great, but on a store to store level it can vary with management and the lack of given overtime."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, I have learned a lot about management.  I work from 7am to 3:30pm, I take care of Contractors and help them get the best deals available.  Management has changed at the store and it is time for me to move on.  I love the interaction that I have with my fellow associates as well as the customers that I have grown to know and love."
good,Too many employees depending on others to do their work. Too much slacking and customer service not up to par. I liked the hours but some customer service was not that great. Customers not helped as well as I like to see. I did my best to help customers.
good,Walking the store and making sure associates are doing well.  Assist customers with what they need.   Scheduled interviews.   Training associates and also assisting associates with classes for manager positions.
good,good place to work for a part time job while in school. work well with other jobs. low pay for the work you are doing if you are hard working. management is not that good
good,"Over all good company with good goals, execution could use some work as far as the hiring aspect goes.  They offer good benefit even to those on  part time, such as health, vision insurance, and 401K options, and mental health help options. (IE counclings)  But with what the pay is as a part timer that is hard to do cause they take money out of your account to do those things.  It is nice that they have a thing called the Homer fund, were employer donate $1 from each pay check to help keep a pot of money dedicated to going toward helping fellow employees out in times of need.   The thing that I have noticed is that they are always under staffed and therefore expecting and needing you to go over your scheduled time, and then having to cut your hours at another time in the week because they do not want to pay you over time.  Scheduling, as with any retail job is inconsistent and you can't take real time off to spend holidays with family.  Depending on which one you apply for you may not hear back for months unfortunately."
good,"Not going to give out my name or the location I worked in but The Homedepot was a overall an okay job to be in. Just a lot of things  kept happening. Don’t regret quitting I knew my worth. Poorly and horrible understaffed , favoritism , hypocrisy. AND ECT. If I ever had to work at The Homedepot again i am choosing a new location! Not my old one."
good,This job entails continuous courses and small stress. While management makes sure everything is orderly they are also there for you and support you. It is physically demanding since your on your feet and deal with some heavy products. There is the possibility of being asked questions outside your knowledge of cashiering.
good,"Hope Depot is a great company. They value their employees and take pride in their ""value wheel"" and make it well known. Management is great and very approachable."
good,"It’s a on hands on learning environment. Very friendly and social workers. You will learn about anything and everything, amazing place to work and grow."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work and is surrounded with great people. The job can get stressful but you shouldn’t have to worry. Everyone is very nice and very understanding.
good,"I would have preferred a full-time position. Good company to be employed with, performing great deeds in the community. The physical store was hardly ever cleaned, whether it be the lumber area or the cashier stations."
good,"Enjoyable customer service focused job. Good local store management, support and training programs. Excellent department head. Mostly great/good customer interactions, I love being able to help folks with electrical issues and products. Good mix of physical and mental work, I walk over 7 miles during an 8 hour shift."
good,"a day there at the home depot "
good,A very good job for young people looking for a career and not in a hurry to get there.Enjoyed working with customers in the store and when i had to go out to customers homes to take care of problems.
good,Each day was very fast pace and always involved having to multitask with multiple customers. Management had our backs whenever there was a situation that needed to be elevated. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the extreme side of unhappy customers. However the best part was seeing customers become returning customers and recognizing us knowing we are good at our job and can help them with whatever needs they have
good,"I was the go-to person in 2014, had a total hip replaced came back to harsh conditions, In 2016 returned to worse conditions. No consideration for the ADA act. more added work fewer people and longer days on my implants. Thank you for your concern for Humanity. It depended if you were on the IN with the district managers and played the game."
good,"Started day with sweep logs, safety walk, loss prevention check, then worked off of work log or downstocked product. If scheduled, watered plants. Walked aisles for customers to assist. Attended Dailey morning meeting."
good,"My co-workers are great to work with, most are hard working individuals and its a blast work with them. I also herd the benefits are nice. Some of the employees are don't do their job and give you more work when they could help out. Most customers say they like to go to our store because of the friendly customer service vs. our competitor (Lowes). Most days it's a pretty easy job except when the departments don't answer or you cant find others for help when you don't know something. Making sure the deliveries get out on time can be stressful especially if it was not ready the day before and it goes out that day. But they are very flexible with the schedules and will schedule you to work if you say you can."
good,"Very fun place to work, not stressful but more demanding each time new management took over.  More sales demanded with less people on floor to help, it got frustrating."
good,"This is definitely a good place to work if you are in school. Part-time they work with your hours well... Don't get trapped in retail. Expectations for management are high. They are expected to put in 50+ hours a week, meanwhile associates are told to cut overtime. It makes for a weird dynamic."
good,"Very down to earth plsve to work. Super relaxed and laid back. Not a huge wage though, hard to live in an area i do when im only making around $15 an hour."
good,typical day of work is just restocking shelf's and helping customers ive learned a lot from plumbing all the way to electrical but most people just stay in their department the management was kind of bad multiple managers while i was there the culture is diverse which is nice and the hardest part of the job is angry customers thats it the most enjoyable parts are free time with coworkers
good,A typical day at work start off at 6 am. I clock in the put my apron on and head to the front of the store. I check the war board and find out what register that I will be working on and when my breaks and lunch will be given to me. I open the register by type in the username and password. Once the register is open I verify that I am starting my register off with $75.00 cash and change. I then turn my light on and clean up around my register getting ready for my first customer.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for. The benefits are good and the pay is okay. The people can be hard to work with and management can seem impossible to please. I came here for a better opportunity for advancement, but they come across  as if they  don't want me to move up. I don't want to be a supervisor, I just want full-time work. They say I'm a good worker, and I've been here three years. I would think I'm worth at least that."
good,"Have to aware of all, all products, including knowledge of everything that you do know about the construction for anything..so customers would expect anything from you for their projects."
good,"It’s a good place to work for a college student. They will work with you on your availability. Every six months you get a tiny raise. Management is like a revolving door so it’s hard to rate them. Customers are usually nice, but you do get the rude ones every once in a while.  According to coworkers it is a good place to work if you need a second job."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to get overnight work experience. I was never bored and always had something to do, even when we didn’t get a truck in for the night. It is fast pace and things must be done efficiently, as well as effectively."
good,you work hard and if you are able to pass the tests you can get promoted. there was some internal promotions when i was there but could not get past the supervisor role.
good,"It's an alright place to work, the place can run itself. i learned the basics of warehousing and the environment is nice with many ethnicities and cultures. Unfortunately supervisors sucks."
good,"You tend to get bored working here, but you can always switch positions. Because you can switch positions, there is always something new that you can learn at thd. Management tends to get frazzled at times, but they usually know what they're talking about."
good,"Fast paced environment.  Some heavy lifting involved but enjoyed what I did.  An employee can also help in neighboring departments which creates a close relationship with co-workers.  All in all, I have good memories while working their."
good,"It was fun working with customers and assisting them with their purchases."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work. As long as you do your work, you follow the company guidelines, you come to work on time, you don't have anything to be afraid of."
good,"Experience dependent on managers and if they like you. I believe if you are a young person without any limitations you will do very well. They tend to groom only young men. Young women, older women and older men treated like they are a waste of training for a career."
good,"can be early or late shifts, but never close then open. Company has a good policy of minimum time off after a shift. Most management is great, they do get rid of the bad ones."
good,"lots of hard work, it was very constructive, worked in a team environment. opportunity to move up in the company. hours were good also and no nights and weekends"
good,"Management is pretty chill but needs to crack down on the workers that laze around and don't do the minimum work required. Too many employees get off with not working, taking to many breaks or leaving messes for others to clean up"
good,"Excellent work conditions"
good,"The Home Depot offers all kind of training for employees for safety, customer service and product knowledge . Always in the top of innovations to offer service to contractors, individuals and employess"
good,Work started good and there was plenty of oppertunity to advance. They had a positive culture and seemed to be concerned with the average employee. In 2016 a new executive team was introduced and things began to shift focus and trend down. Our store changed managers shortly after hiring a new district manager and work was no longer desirable. A complete 180 from my first 3 years of employment.
good,The employees working here are friendly but the actual job you can't make a good living off of and they don't like putting people to a full- time position. Including a pay raise that was barely anything. They expect to have too much done with not enough people working. This is due to people not being full-time and the company refusing to promote these hard working employees.
good,Great place to advance or learn for next phase of employment. Minimal opportunities. Hire within. Very average pay for the amount of work. Decent benefits.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work yet you get to interact with employees and get to know the customers more and as you get to learn the customers you get more knowledge about product .  The Home Depot is all about customer Service!
good,Provided customer service by helping the customer’s home improvement decisions as well as DIY project.  I provide service to cliental from DIY customers to contractors.
good,"Greet customers and providing customers with excellent customer service. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, during holidays you a given free meals during tough times or holidays"
good,Necesitan mas prestaciones e incentivar mas al personal
good,"When I first started working there it was different, it was my first job after 23 years in the Navy. It felt rewarding and satisfying. I come to the Pro desk and it usually is busy right away, taking material orders to phone sales to cashiering. The hardest part of my day is to disappoint customers by not being able to help them with their needs. "
good,"Good company to work for.  401k and stock options help to insure financial security for the future."
good,I really loved my job. I enjoyed my time there. they have lots of tool on line to help the associates when in time of need. I didn't care for the way people are treated in the small town. they do have their pick of people the like to keep there.
good,God job. Needs more room for advancement. Good benefits fair pay. Excellent supervisor. Close to home. Have made some good friends there. Looking for more career advancement.
good,You go in to start stoking shelves and assist customers in between. I learned how to put orders into a computer and be able to assist customers over the phone as well as in person.
good,"Great management, but some of the other employees are questionable. There are times where customers expect complete knowledge on every product in the store, but that is whay happens in retail."
good,LOTS to learn and grow from. The staff was great to work with. Helping customers and understanding there needs was a bit challenging identify what they really needed.
good,Work was great i was always on the move and never had a dull moment. Workplace culture was overall pretty good people were friendly and we often worked together to help a customer.
good,"Making sure I gave 100 percent."
good,"Great job, good for opportunities and much more. good opportunity for learning how to be part of a big team. skills as well as being knowledgeable in home improvements and much more i would is a plus working there"
good,They were very flexible with allowing me to to leave for school and football season. For example i would need to leave every year from August until November for 4 years.
good,you are hired to work in a certain department but you eventually learn or have the opportunity to learn other departments. Theres a lot of growth in the store. Everyone is very friendly and eventually our like your second family.
good,I enjoyed my coworkers. I enjoyed learning new things and being able to pass that knowledge onto others. Home Depot did a good job training its employees
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work if you are looking for a part time job. They work well with your schedule, and will give you time off to go to school or a second job. However, if you are looking for full time work, this might not be the place for you. Pay is very minimal. I have been with the company for almost 5 years and I am still making the base minimum the company pays their associates. Moving up is not easy, because they are always bringing in associates from other stores instead of promoting within. On the other hand, the people are great and genuinely care about your wellbeing. There are many pros and cons, but overall, I’d say if you are looking for a part time job, this is a great place to work."
good,"clocked in very early morning and started the day off with few early construction workers there at the doors ready to get their supplies for work."
good,Low volume stores never have enough personnel on hand to properly  serve the customers. Forklifting anything during business hours requires two people.
good,"Management doesn't like to reward associates who actually bust hump, but prefer to dangle carrots at the lackluster workers instead. This is supposedly to spur them to be better workers, yet really just pushes the stellar to stop caring as much."
good,the hardest part of the job was going in at 10pm and leaving at 6am but while there having to deal with co workers that would sleep/not do there work.
good,Is a fast paced job that brought something new daily. One day I could be working with cashiers and another loading up appliances into customer's vehicles.
good,"Home Depot call center is one of the best customer service contact centers. It is fast paced though, and fairly strict on policy. Advancement is incredibly hard to get and I wouldn't consider this to be a place for a lifetime career. Great for students"
good,the Staff and Management are fantastic! I truly enjoy working with the people there and the customers that come in looking for help. The scheduling leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Your job is to provide the best customer experience you can.  All the while down stocking, filling holes, other tasks assigned to you by management, and covering other departments for lunches.  If you are a specialty sales associate, you also have weekly matrix's you have to meet.  The problem comes when there are not enough people working and you cant get anything productive done.  Then management comes and speaks with you on why nothing was done."
good,"Felt sure that I would either die or retire from Home Depot. The last 2 years, the management has changed so much. There used to be so much appreciation for 'outside the box' thinking. Now it's ""run the play"". Do not veer from the path. It puts a whole new light on Micromanaging. I always believed that the rules should be followed by everyone. At least at our store, you had to be part of the managers click, and the rules always have exceptions for that group.From attendance policies, to dress policies. Just depended who you sucked up to."
good,Excellent opportunity and enjoyable yet somewhat dangerous job as far as asset protection. Full arrest and search and seizure for theft which could get a bit risky.
good,"Always something to do, even if it's not your main job to do. Always customers to have to help. Usually long workdays with something to keep busy all the time."
good,Jus want a better chance at advancement. Fell that do not have a chance for advancement happening anytime soon.What to give myself other options that can better my life style.
good,"Home Depot itself is a great company. A lot of opportunities to advance in further in retail career, the environment itself is not the best when you’re surrounded by non self motivated, negative people, people (supervisors) who put other asociates down."
good,"Management attentive to customer and employee needs and suggestions, but due to corporate oversight and policies , restricted in ability to make need changes."
good,Very fun work place business was small so everyone was like one big family. Management was always available and had an open door policy. If Pay was more would love to work there.
good,Can be a great company to work for has a lot of great core values.  Individual stores however can vary base upon current management team.  Especialy in middle of a transition.
good,I really liked my job at home depot because I got the opportunity to help people find the items they are looking for. The job required quite a bit of heavy lifting and the pay scale was on the low side.The hours fluctuated quite a bit so it was difficult to make family plans.
good,They started cutting hours so im looking for another part time job. Its a good team effort from mostly everybody. I learned and continue to learn great customer service skills. I like when its busy because that's when im most focused.
good,"Home Depot is really nice to work for as far as retailers go. They helped teach new skills and promote from within. However, managers and department heads often come from outside"
good,"it was a daily routine process."
good,"Easy work, management doesn't really treat all of their employees equally. Only get raises once a year. I have good experience with cash handling and customer service from this job"
good,The Management is very well trained and they treated everyone fairly. They are great people in general. The culture at The Home Depot is very warm and opening. You can have a good time but also do your job at the same time. You make a lot of great friends with your co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to my co-workers and make friends with them. The hardest part is probably some of the people that you have to deal with.
good,Working as a Cashier was very stressful but the company had a lot of benefits and did its best to take care of its people. The problems sometimes come from the store workers.
good,"Home Depot is a great company with strong values , compensation packages, recognition for associates of all levels and an Environmental that allows for growth and advancement."
good,"Your day will more than likely start off at 6am. You do bay service, which involves merchandise is where its suppsoed to be, checking inventory and make adjustments as needed, etc. Every so often you'll receive a project that you have to complete in a specified amount of time. That's about it. As far as management goes, your direct supervisor, who is on the floor with you usually, can either make your job easy and enjoyable, or can make it stressful."
good,"Can get extremely busy, not a place to take lightly, have to be good at multitasking and management is decent but can also attend h.s or college while working there."
good,"In any public job there will be stress.  You must really enjoy working with the public to perform in customer service.  Early in the morning customers are ready to come in and as contractors get their items and move on.  They are in a hurry to do so.  As in any field of business there will be bad days and good days.  Management, I feel sometimes could better staff the Customer Service but then they are in a better position to make that call than I am.    The most enjoyable part of my day was when customers were not in so much of a hurry but wanted to actually offer a smile to a busy cashier / Customer Service associate."
good,I always enjoyed going to work and loved the people I worked with. Management was always very responsive and helpful. Unfortunately the pay and the hours were not enough to live off of.
good,"Home Depot is the kind of place that can be stressful but you have to keep in mind as well that there is stress at every job. Home Depot has a lot of room for their employees to grow, but the question to ask yourself is if you want to move fast through the company or slowly."
good,"When I first started working for The Home Depot it was great, the people were nice, the hours and schedule were great and very flexible. I worked seasonaly so for the summers and winter breaks it was fine, but after a few times returning the atmosphere was not the same and I had co workers spreading rumors and making advances on me and management started to slip, and as much as I still loved the job it became harder and hader to want to return each break."
good,"Customer service, stocking, computer work. Management-strict, however, well ran. On your feet and cement floors most of day. Great team. Flexible hrs."
good,Great company but very low salary. Some department managers make less than 14.00 pr hour. Really nothing bad to say. Enjoyed the atmosphere and heaping customers . Just could not work for the low pay. If the salary was raised I would be happy to go back.
good,"Overall, I like working for the company. The benefits are decent and they are always looking for ways to improve. The call center is decorated nicely, and most of the staff I've had interactions with are very pleasant."
good,"The work there is okay, but advancing is very hard to do. If you are lucky enough to enter one the classes you can learn a lot. You have to work hard and maybe you can advance if you are liked. If you are not liked you will go nowhere."
good,"Working at Homedepot can be very productive and fulfilling however that is only if you choose to make it so. As a whole, the company does offer many good benefits and opportunities to those that are willing to work and take advantage of them. However, if you're working in a large city area the quality of your co-workers is going to vary so drastically and can directly impact your desire to push hard. Managment in the city can also really curve your desire as well, if you're looking for a simple 9-5 job then the Depot is fine but if you want a place you can grow I would say work outside of the city otherwise it is going to be a hard long road for very little reward."
good,"Working as cashier with Home Depot was interesting as the Associates work In several different departments lumber, seasonal and the front end. I found working in lumber to be the hardest as it is the busiest area in the store. I especially enjoyed working in spring and summer seasonal with all the flowers, shrubs and trees of which I learned a lot."
good,Great associates and work environment. Management fluctuates too much. Getting full time positions is difficult and takes a long Time to do so. Pay is okay.
good,"Good company, good corporate culture, super inclusive and diverse. Not a lot of room for advancement, only a select few actually get promotions and they sometimes hire externally even when there are a ton of super qualified, trained employees wanting the promotion. Corporate is like that. Not the greatest if you want quick advancement and lots of opportunity, but amazing benefits and overall some great people."
good,"Tiring. Long days on cement, walking around and restocking shelves. The benefit to get 401k match required 2 years of employment if working part time."
good,"The team I'm on, we work together and get along quit well.  We help each other and some of us treat each other like family."
good,A typical day at Home Depot would be assisting customers with their home improvement needs. Stocking shelves and delivering packages to customers homes. Home Depot is a very flexible company when it comes to meeting employees needs.
good,"My start off day would consist of stocking, helping customers, ordering product, and mentoring new associates through the day.  Some days i would have to build displays of product that we would have in our ads that would be for or on sell."
good,The hardest part of the job was the fact that the shifts for the associates were never the same from day to day or even week to week.  However at the time that I worked for them they offered several benefits (monetary and health).
good,Good company to work for. they worked around my school schedule.
good,Working in THD's supply chain is a great way to build experience. they have a very structured approach to work and performance management. The training and onboarding process is very well laid out and is a good starting point. The quality of the associates varies from building to building though.
good,"Job could be very stressful at times, but I am lucky to work with great coworkers who made the experience worthwhile. I am very proud of what I have learned and achieved here. They gave me the experience I need to move on with my life."
good,every day was a new experience with good people and good managers. . hardest part was not being considered for upper management  when you were training the upper management coming in. Homer fund and employee committee were great
good,"for a typical day at work in the garden are you make sure the plants are waterded and that the loading are is clear of obstruction, also you have control over the propane distribution."
good,"They pay was nice for part time cashier and they worked with you when it came to scheduling. The job was slow and easy going. I would work there again one day,"
good,"night receiving lead person hostile if not full time regular employee. Scheduling became a nightmare, one week was only schedule 6 hrs after working 20-26. Couple of manager great to work with! Others not so much as they were more concern with doing least little thing byt he book. If you love drama in all shapes and form Home Depot is place to work. Working with customer was challenging and at times a blast. Move upward was based on favoritism."
good,"Worked at Home Depot in San Jose, California. The pace of the stores in San Jose area were fast and furious."
good,I liked the fact that I was rewarded for a job well done with HD dollars that I could use to purchase items in the store. I loved helping customers find things they needed for DIY projects it also became one of my favorite places to shop for my lawn and garden ideas...
good,"I worked at two different Home Depot's the one i was hired at was my favorite by far. very kind, fun, outgoing people. Store manager took the time out to get to know you and made you feel apart of the big home depot family. the second store made me want to quit and start new at a different job, i was just a transfer and didn't mean anything in this store. No one gave me the time of day and i was very un happy so i quit."
good,"8 hour shift."
good,"What I personally have to say about home-depot is nun of your business, you have no rite to insist that one be written about my current job. this is an invasion of my privacy."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work at but the hourly wages and raises could be better. It takes a year for you just to get a quarter raise. money motivates people
good,I began my career in the plumbing department. Mainly a stock person. Always restocking the shelves. Only when a customer needed help could you not restock. The biggest issue was hours. At one time I was denied vacation and then began to get less than 8 hiours per week scheduled. Needed more hours.
good,"I worked here for 4 years and enjoyed it for the most part. Like any other retail job, you have excellent bosses and then you have absolutely horrible ones. There is LOTS of room for advancement, and benefits can be awesome. You get discounts, insurance, matching 401k, stock shares. There's a program called the Homer Fund that helps out employees in need; I used it once when I needed my alternator replaced. It's has a family feel to it. Store manager can make or break it, though."
good,"The Home Depot can be an excellent place to work. Advancement within the company as well as raises take considerably longer than other companies. Store ""rules"" do vary ALOT from store to store based on management."
good,Better business model than Lowe's. Training is computer based but more in depth on product knowledge. Scheduling uses the same software as Lowe's but management is competent enough to adjust it to be more employee friendly.
good,I enjoyed my time here as a part-time worker. The full-time workers seemed miserable and overworked. Any shift longer than 6 hours gets two 15-minute breaks as well as an hour lunch. This made shifts go by quickly.
good,"I learned how to drive a pallet jack, how to pick and stack items from heavy to light big to small, how to correctly stack them, seran wrap label and ship out orders."
good,"In my experience, they expect you to bust your butt and kill yourself for crumbs. Now that’s cool and all if you’ve never had a slice of bread before, but when you know you deserve that slice of bread why in the world would you settle for the crumbs?"
good,"Associates are required to be available for customers, know the answers to the customers questions and/or be able to find the answer for them. They are also required to stock shelves, keep the aisles clean, and be able to help other departments when needed."
good,"Job has its drawbacks including how heavy and large these items are. Must be in shape and early morning exercises are performed before the work day starts. Overall, I learned how busy can a retail environment be and knowing your job and utilizing your own resources like a cell Phone is a must to answer questions on every department ."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena, sin envergo carecen de lideres, y políticas internas que no favorecen al trabajador."
good,"the hardest pArt of the jib was moving all around the sections of the store, to work the cashiers in the different parts of store.  Policy is strickely enforced."
good,"This was my first job, and I found it fairly enjoyable for what it was. The largest downside was working until sometimes 2 in the morning, which simply didn't work with my pursuing school. But if that's not an issue, it's honest work that isn't too challenging and gives 30 hours a week."
good,"Horarios flexibles, siempre hay tiempo para descansar y trabajar sin ninguna queja al respeto, ambiente agradable, los superiores siempre están preocupados por el bienestar de los empleados."
good,"I was one of the cashiers. I primarily rotated throughout the store. I would start out in one area, someone would need a break so I relieved them, then the next person needed a break and I would relieve them"
good,"Inconsistent on managing associate. managers and local higher up management unable to do job properly. too much of a high school mentality. there are rules in place, but no one to lead and manage examples in a practical and proper manner."
good,Great place to work. Was fun and had lots of interpersonal interactions. Pay was not enough to make a living. There are a lot of opportunities to give back to the community and volunteer for projects.
good,"its a great place to learn, build knowledge of different products, and expand your personal and professional skill set that's needed to grow. The store is setup to have each department as a small piece of a giant industry."
good,"It’s been a good experience working with Home Depot so far , I have no regrets for this opportunity  because this company has taught me a lot and also has me ready for any other opportunity that comes along my path ."
good,"Home is a good place to work for, depending on store manager and assistant store managers. The department supervisors are GREAT!  "
good,"This was a great way to get introduced to the customer service life. They kind of throw you into the middle of things so you get a good idea right away what you job is going to look live, but right out of the gate someone is always available to help you with any and everything you need."
good,"The workplace culture was fun and everyone was nice and accepting to me, but I don't like how the job was very repetitive. Customers did not like the outbound calling practices and it was harassing in nature."
good,It's a productive. we generally clock in and go back to receiving and start stretching and see if we have a floor unload. if we do we start unloading it in a timely fashion.
good,"The typical day working as an asset protection manager at the Home Depot is very complex. It includes managing several asset protections specialists in their daily routines and supervising shoplifter apprehensions. Managing the security guards assigned to the store to cover all entrances and exits as well as the parking lot. The APM is also in charge of creating and maintaining a safe work environment for employees and customers. Handling of hazard materials also falls under the supervision of this title. Working internal investigations of associates who commit theft and fraud are a main function of this position. Exception reporting and utilization of our Central Investigation Team is crucial to these internal investigation. Working with the store operations manager to handle OSHA claims, P&L issues as well as receiving and special services are other daily routines handled by the APM. Inventory reconciliation as well as supervising the actual inventory process of the store on an annual basis rounds out the primary functions of the title."
good,If you are looking to make a career or just a part time job Home Depot is a great place to work. Schedules for management is not as favorable but for regular full time associates and part-time associates it is reasonable and flexible for the most part. As long as you show interest in growing your career with the company you will have no problems moving up.
good,"A typical day includes stocking shelves, receiving shipments, working rtv's, and offloading trucks. I learned how to process returns for credits, key receiving merchandise for the store, hazmat, and driving forklifts."
good,There is always stuff to do. The Pay is low but you get to meet alot of interesting people while you work there. you can move up the ladder if you want to become managment.
good,started as a lot associate. wasn't promoted but only pivoted into an overnight position then forgotten about for 3 years. wanted to move up. but was never given the opportunity
good,n/a- no comment at this time since I am presently working there.  The atmosphere is good and the benefits are good. I just would prefer to work in my field.
good,Good pay when I worked there 15 years ago. High co-insurance for medical and dental benefits. Had to work different shifts each day. Good people to work with.
good,"Pass on  leaving an opinion for some it’s hard to get full time employment, you can work hard in the “munch pit during the Summer and work hard in the tree lot in the winter but never get asked to work full time."
good,"good benefits,  promotion and fun workplace."
good,"As a cashier, all you do is stand for hours ringing up customer's items and assisting them with every need. They ask you to offer them the company's credit card as well as taking their time to fill out some reviews. They are all about customer service, which is great, but sometimes at the expense of their employees. The job can be boring at times, especially in self check out. Supervisors do show appretiation and care."
good,Days at this job varied. We mostly had steady days and I would  process shipments. I would stay busy from the time I got to work until quitting time. There were days when were not so busy that we would get sent home because there was not enough work to do.
good,"Great assistant managers. Great co-workers. Family environment. Once in a while people will get frustrated and throw around attitude but that's life. Good people. All of us agree to disagree and hardly argue. Apologize for immature actions or attitude and move on getting along. Good cooperation and communication. At least in my department. "
good,A company where the employees not only take care of the customers but also each other.  The company culture is focused on helping customers with their most important possession - their home.
good,"The staff is very friendly. like a family.. "
good,"Home Depot was a very relaxed job when I was a part timer , working in Electrical. After a year , I was promoted full time. Then that's when the job became too much because I was transferred to lumber. Avoid lumber. Besides that, everything else about the depot was great."
good,"Fast paced/ good associates/ good culture/ gratifying to help customers with their needs. Store manager was not very helpful with personal involvement towards knowledge needed to succeed ( more negative input than positive, If any Positive at all) I REALLY liked working for Home Depot! Its a heart breaker that I am no longer a part of them, I will truly miss it! I was a department supervisor , and was an associate for 10 years. (sad)"
good,"Everybody at The Home Depot were very pleasant to be around, but not so fun to work with. My supervisor would often tell our managers that we had our breaks when we didn't. The hardest part about the job was that the hours were very spread out. I would go in one day at 6am-2pm and the next day have to close and open the day after that."
good,"good training"
good,I love how they support associates that are looking forward to going to school and families who are also going through a tough time and may need financial assistances.
good,"A typical day was acceptable and encouraging."
good,"It is a good place to work. The environment, however, is a bit tough especially for those who suffer from allergies. There is quite a bit of dust in the air constantly. Other than that its good!"
good,Great place to learn and grow.  Atmosphere of caring team members and managers alike.  High expectations with the support to accomplish the desired goals.
good,"It's a good place to start off working if you looking for something quick, the working environment is great that the employees are nice people. But it's a few things they could fix at the Home Depot but other than that is a good place to work at"
good,"Great environment, management tries hard to push ""family"" feeling of employees. Best corporate environment I've worked for in a large company. Plays the hours game so you're almost never ""full-time"" for benefits."
good,"Was a decent season job, pretty laid back, just need to have some knowledge of carpentry work, and know how to run a saw, "
good,"The company is disorganized, no one follows policy. I wouldn't mind staying at home depot but there isn't really any room for advancement at this location."
good,"Working nights was fun, however there was times we would stay way later than usual because of the MEPS team. not bad though, just wanted to advance my career and the pay isn't that good for a college student to make it on. At least when only working 25 hours a week."
good,A typical day at the Home Depot as a cashier  is helping customers as they check out.  I learned how to deal with individuals  accordingly. Very diverse
good,"Arrive at wok, help with Pro desk, help customers with finding items, sales in the department. create measures and lead, help with customer service and cash register. Keep showroom clean and presentable and great customers."
good,Management sucks and they bring people that are immature and not experienced therefore they should not be leaders ....................................
good,Hard work can lead you far with the company. great deal of loyalty towards customers. Hardest part of the job was completing many tasks at once. most enjoyable was working along my team to complete the tasks.
good,Typical work day work be taking inventory and placing orders along with a general walk through of the department to see if anything needed restocking or cleaned/fixed up.
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work during the summer, close to home and hour flexible. was pretty laid back during my time there, both employee and management were friendly."
good,"It was a nice place to work. The only thing that I didn't like it not being able to move up with the experience I have. I really enjoyed the customers, and love working with the public."
good,"Good company, good benefits. Great training and on hand experience. Requieres great level of customer service and communication skills. It is a warehouse so there is a high lever of noise."
good,Employment at The Home Depot requires some physical activity and is oriented more towards customer service. Friendly working environment and never gets boring.
good,"Everyday as a cashier I was require great the customers while they walked by or if they just enter the store as well as accurately ringing up the customer. I learned great people and problem solving skills that helped aid the company in sales production. The management was very understanding to work and personal related problems, they worked their hardest to accommodate the needs the employees and customers at all times. Although the most difficult part of the job was ringing up the customers at a fast pace all while doing it accurately. And at the same time was the most enjoyable part was it being fast paced all while interacting with the customers."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for... if you are part time and only work for a extra money. If you are fulltime then it just comes down to which department you decide to work in
good,"very flexible with hours, very busy business, as a cashier you have to be very fast and offer credit cards. Managers are very niceand you can move up in the company"
good,Home Depot is a great place to be and work for either just temporary or permanent.  The workplace is enjoyable and culturally diverse. Managers are willing to listen.
good,Working at Home Depot was ok until you run into a customer that's having a bad day. Manager are somewhat fair they have their days and some can be racial and not understand certain situations. Sometimes it was boring due to lack of customers but for the most part it was pretty steady.
good,It is certainly fast paced and can be stressful at times but most of the co workers make up for all the cons. I for one have absolute respect for the co-workers I work with
good,"Do your work, don't get to personal with co workers or managers, this should be only a temp or secondary job. I think every store is different again don't get personal."
good,"I have worked here for past 3 year and i have given all my efforts and improvements in my JOB."
good,"I worked here for about a year and a half and it was a nice job for while I was young and fresh out of High School. When I left, I was seeking ways to further my education and find a career that I would enjoy as well as be good at."
good,Depending on your shift your social life can suffer and weekends are non existent. The people that work there are generally great and fun to work with. Being a kitchen designer is a huge improvement over a regular associate.
good,Sales position had good mentorship to train for selling the products. Workplace culture was good to discuss selling techniques.  Group department meetings before the work day and individual following by senior members to discuss the process were excellent.
good,"The Home Depot is a good example of a company taking the initiative to change as the world of retail becomes more online.  With that being said, some of its management teams need to be updated on current, effective management practices."
good,"When I got to my department after a while of being a cashier, my department supervisor quit doing his job and I had to take over. When I talked to management about it they did nothing. A lot of people helped me with problems I had there so it was not like I was left in the dark, but over all it was decent but I know I could do better."
good,"it was great to work in home depot, if you are hard working you will be able to be promoted, and will learn a lot.  it is challenging to work at home depot, some days are really difficult."
good,"Typical day consist of restocking , customer service, some labor.  Home Depot has a nice environment and can be creative.  The hardest part of the job was the inclement weather, and the most enjoyable was to  be able to help people with their home projects."
good,home depot provided good hours fixed three weekends in advance if you wish to move departments you would have to wait for an opening as expected.  One of the downsides was that the store had a lot of short staff.
good,"A place that is best for people who can think about projects and understand the process that goes into said projects. If you're unable to think about how the projects work, then you'll have problems. The customers have a tendency to think that every associate should know everything in the store or everything in the department, regardless of how long you've worked there or how much is in the department. Management is understanding. The workplace culture emphasizes working and helping others. "
good,"My review has two distinct areas of subjective observation."
good,Amazing people to work with really felt like a family great managers amazing work ethic just very poorly paid! Would definitely recommend as a job for the experience but not an over all career.
good,Working at Home Depot was a high pace place of employment... We were required to stock inventory that were placed in the department from the over night crew. As well as handle all returns from the previous day. In addition to fulfilling costumers' request  for assistance..  But I have observed that there have been changes in the structure in which certain operations are performed...
good,"Most of the day was spent stocking shelves, but was also broken up with interaction with customers. It required knowing about the product and where it would be located. One could learn a lot about a specific field if exposed to it enough"
good,the store manager told me later that he didn't know that I was so experienced. it was on my application and resume. there are people that that will just stand around and get paid the same amount you do for doing so much more work.
good,Training is a priority for all associates. Safety is emphasized on a daily basis. Success Sharing is a motivator for sales. Learning how to best help customers/vendors/fellow associates is part of montly training.
good,The job environment was great and you got to meet new people everyday. Great coworkers. The management was ok but not great. Overall it’s a good temporary job.
good,"Days as a Home Depot employee were very rarely stressful. However, I found the workplace to be both productive and relaxing even when the days were busier."
good,Management was good people to learn the business from. It also had a good work place culture depending on the location you chose to work at. It is a job that you are able to move up in the company if you chose too.
good,"Once hired on the work day was fairly straight forward; clock in, go to your department and walk your aisles, and start making calls to your pipeline all while helping customers as they entered the aisles or approached your desk. The other employees are friendly for the most part and just want to help you succeed. There was also constant training that you were notified of and were given time to complete. The only frustrating part was that if you were too good in your position it was very hard to advance"
good,"As a temporary job, Home Depot would be a good option. Great company overall, some stores may lack certain aspects to prosper. The work can be fast-paced and very busy."
good,Good company. Fairly paid. average benefits. Have to listen to a ton of GoTEAM! from corporate. Advancement could be slow depending on the locatio. Overall a good experience.
good,Management was okay but it was hard to rise up in company. a typical day of work was just cashing out customers which was fairly easy. Another hard part was they constantly push for you to get people to apply for credit cards and if you didn't get enough you'd get in trouble for it.
good,"Big box store with necessary ridged procedures on how things are done. Associates receive regular training on doing their job.  Work schedules are inconsistent, especially for part timers.  As in most companies, some of the supervisors are better at their jobs then others.  90% of the group of people I have worked with at the Home Depot have been good reliable associates and worked together as a team willing to help one another.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they came into the store to purchase, or helping them decide what they needed to complete the project they were working on. The hardest part of the job is not having a consistent work schedule."
good,A typical day would be to come in and unload that days shipment. Then the freight team would stock and store all of the new product. We would work as a team to accomplish this every night.
good,"If you're looking to make a living as an associate at Home Depot all year round, things can get tough. During peak seasons, spring and summer, hours are plentiful, however when winter and the rainy season rolls around hours are cut severely due to a slow workplace. I went from an easy 35-40 hours a week down to about 18-20 hours."
good,usually is crowded and most of the time i would advice customers about paint colors and a variety of products in the paint department. The best part was to see the customers coming back to show you pictures about the projects they did with the advices provided.
good,Focus on your work solo or work in a group setting. Great facilities and benefits. Management seems somewhat iffy on what direction is coming from above.
good,"there is no hard job at HD, it what you make it. Many students work there. There is only a handful of full time people, Home Depot in a part time employer"
good,"Great place to work, doesn't matter if you a just entering the work force or looking for something to be a career. Great atmosphere and working environment. The pay could be better."
good,"Fun job. You get two breaks, A 15 and 30 minutes. It’s not a hard job. The rush can be a little over whelming at times but after a while you become used to it so it becomes fun"
good,"As a cashier, your job is pretty simple. Check out the customers and give them great customer service. Being an associate. Management will occasionally ask you to help other departments when there is coverage. Decent job otherwise."
good,"Diligently worked to pack out all merchandise, took inventory and made sure the store was ready for opening. Worked with reach truck, order picker, electric pallet jack and electric ladder. Licensed in  operating all of the equipment."
good,"I am thankful to Home Depot for giving me the opportunity to begin my career as a Security Analyst. Although I moved on after only a year, this was an opportunity from which I have benefited."
good,"The Home Depot really does listen to their employees and tries to better their working conditions, at least with my experience in their call center. I have never worked inside of the store. Their Kennesaw contact center was a great environment. Free lunches some days, snacks available for purchase, ping pong and televisions available in break area. My latest supervisor was one of the best I had in my career. Although I cannot say the same for most of the senior management at this location. A decent portion of the managers and senior managers located at the Home Depot contact center were very lazy people that only obtained their positions by ""favoritism"". I experienced many instances  where a very incapable associate was given management or ""lead"" positions because they were liked instead of them actually being good at their job, or having any leadership qualities for that matter. This has riddled this location of this company and will not stop until the HR is changed. They continue to support this method of action and are even very guilty of doing it themselves. Many colleges have been ""pushed"" out of the door because of them calling out the HR dept. Please be aware that every negative comment Im stating is mainly toward their customer service outlets of the KCC online contact center, not towards the Fraud Dept. Im required to do this to create an accnt and Im not currently willing to do it twice. lol"
good,"employee rewards such as cash bonuses, free food, etc..."
good,"The best aspects of working for Home Depot were the excellence of their training, their sense of teamwork and collaboration with departments,and great customer service."
good,"Unless you intend on being management, don't expect any advancement. It's an ok place to work. But it's all entry level employees. Decent pay, decent benefits."
good,"I made great friends while working at Home Depot. I still enjoy shopping this store and seeing these friends."
good,"Home Depot can be a good place to work. Mostly it is the low pay though. You can work into management, but be prepared for a ""slave labor"" situation. If you like working with customers, this is a good job."
good,Home depot was a fun and relaxed job that provided employees interaction with customers. The lumbar department was essential to Home depot and was busy from time to time.
good,"Loved the values of the company and the culture."
good,"Job Placement due to experience was not always accurate or spot on. Some personnel were not as experienced as originally thought ."
good,"worked part time in tool rental, very fast paced, learned customer service, worked many times by my self, had very short time to learn all the aspects of the job"
good,"Great people work here. Everyone is so nice which was a great change coming from another retailer. Supervisors are stressed out constantly, associates are always complaing about pay. Managers walk around and call their employees lazy and babies."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work if you are looking for part time employment. Fun environment, knowledagble associated, and lots of training provided to work throughout the store."
good,"Summary is about it. The pay is poor for anyone trying to make a decent living, but the people and the way the company seems to care about the people almost make it bearable."
good,You better be as smart as you think you are or it will be hard. Face to face business sales with high level decision makers. If you don't know how to talk to people you wont make it. You maintain the customers you have and grow the business. Easy sale if you know what you are doing because everyone knows  who Home Depot is.
good,I love Home Depot. You really end up becoming really close to your co-workers. There is unlimited job advancements. Over all I do bot regret my choice to work at The Home Depot. Its the #1 customer service retail of the world for a reason. You just need to want to be there.
good,"Home Depot's Service Desk is extremely fast paced. There is never a dull moment at the desk. You have to juggle online, special, and in-store orders. You also have to manage deliveries, make keys, answer the phones, handle returns, tend to customers in-store,which includes ringing out there purchases, answering their questions, helping them locate items in the store, etc. On top of that you must file paperwork and clear the to do bins on the computer. Time management and efficiency is key."
good,"Really good stable job and was overall a good job, good HR and good people, good opportunities to advance and get over time and good pay wage, great job"
good,"Great work environment, management lacks in fair career advancement. Constantly stay engaged in the workplace which makes work more enjoyable on a day to day basis."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work, great benefits and take care of employes during times of need. The company is resorting to more work less associates. I do enjoy helping customers with their projects."
good,Need to listen more too employee for structure and less time on computer training and actual training or classes with actual people instead of computers
good,Home Depot is a job where you can find friends very quickly. The employees at Home Depot are very friendly most times and can keep your mind off a bad day.
good,"In my view there are multiple system failures, low pay, indecisive management  and lack of consistent department head management  As for the culture everyone is friendly  and it is a family atmosphere"
good,"Go in and have a meeting with the boss to start the day, he would assign jobs for us to do. Learned to read planograms and hook up lighting. Management wasn't that good, my supervisor was great. It was ok  butthere wasn't any black people there. hurrying to get the job done. working with the employees."
good,you are expected to accomplish a lot of metrics and tasks but do not have much help to accomplish these plus take care of customers that come into the store.
good,H.D. is a great company to work for over the past 23 years. unfortunately upper management is were the problems exist. Upper management does not have job security.
good,"Typical retail job.  Most of the time it was slow and became boring quickly.  There was not much extra to do there, when it was slow it was really slow."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"It is a good company to work for. it is hard to get upward salary increases worth having, due to the matrix they use, which is biggest negative standpoint."
good,Hard job for a new person in the work force. Very demanding must have an open schedule to do full time. Pay is good but management is tough. Extremely high turn over rate too.
good,Typical day consists of clocking in and following certain procedures. Store readiness checklist. Receiving checklist. MPS walks. Safety walks. This job has enough things to help your day go by fast all while learning along the way.
good,"A typical day is fast paced and goes by quick"
good,"Fast paced great environment co-workers were easy to get along with and everyone help each other. The environment was great to be around, even though work was demanding."
good,Every aspect of the The Home Depot is classic retail. Extremely competitive and reactive to stay on top. It is a great company that takes care of it's employees and communities.
good,Home depot was a place with many ups and downs. The work environment was very busy and people were working all types of hours and areas. There really wasn't a hard part working there it was a busy environment.  Sometimes customers get upset and go over board but that is about as hard as it gets.
good,"Great team. Loved my coworkers and management. I hated some of the customers and I hated the hours. You get scheduled for shifts that you can't really work during, and you get scheduled for days that don't match with your beliefs (religion)"
good,"The Home Depot was a great transition workplace for me. At first, it was just a place with a stable paycheck, and a place to grow and advance. After growing to nearly every instore position, I noticed the job became much more stressful, compensation didnt grow, advancement was far less available, and the job requirements significantly higher, including working off the clock and through all breaks/lunches. I learned the most of customer service, salesmanship, leadership, team building, product knowledge, equipment, and systems at THD then anywhere else so far in my life. I think its a great place to learn a skillset here to take with you to other companies and catapult yourself into new careers and use it to start off stronger at another firm."
good,"I enjoyed working there, If I didnt move then I guarentee that I would still be working for that company. I had two children while working for them and they took really good care of me. I was able to apply and received FMLA that way I still got paid while I was on maternity leave."
good,"I am a cashier and love meeting new people, enjoy working with customers and like the management. There are no full time employment opportunities available. I only get 20 - 25 hours a week and need full time employment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is I love working with and helping people in any way I can."
good,Like with every job some are good and others are bad. The thing I feel that needs to be addressed is the pay. For MET team you only get $10 an hour and the job is extremely physical and hard on the body. They need to raise that a bit more. The environment and management are amazing to work with and always help balace out the stressful days.
good,"They struggled to follow my availability."
good,People and management was helpful most of the time. Atmosphere was team spirited and was mostly friendly. Store Manager was inspiring and very engaging. There was a lot of turnover however so there was a constant retraining leading to under qualified co-workers.
good,"It’s an ok company, can play favorites at times, I’m a merchandiser so you can’t advance but the schedule is good if you like weekends and some holidays off."
good,Work load changes daily from easy to overwhelming requiring overtime to meet goals.  Working on freight team means you work at night with a set schedule.
good,"Working with other associates is great. Can joke around but have to work aggressively too. Fast paced warehouse work. Management expects a lot with the day to day workload,"
good,"I found my job very interesting and I loved helping the customers. Many different people, all kinds of nationalities. learned many things while working there."
good,"Typical big box retail store.  Average management, part time benefits are minimal, no employee discounts.  Part time hours vary week to week.  Customer First is key, but some issues with Merchandising team."
good,"Ok company. Co workers are great to work with, pay could be better."
good,"underpaid if you are on freight team for the amount of work in the time frame. hours are there if you want them "
good,Challenging job with high associate turnover. Consistent overtime due to not filling required manning for work load. Very high pace. you will stay busy all day.
good,Holidays feel so festive when working there. Helping people find presents and new toys for dad or grandpa. Friendly guest new items always filling the stores.
good,"Store was always busy, always had something to do, pretty good job if you are starting off or in school and need a job that can work with your schedule. The pay was decent, but not enough, by my 4th year there was new hires that were making more than I was and I had way more experience and knowledge than they had. Paid vacations and sick days were always nice, also nice they paid us on holidays. Management can be a hit or miss, some managers will throw you under the bus just to save their own jobs. My job didn’t feel secure, I saw so many coworkers get let go for the most controversial reasons. Overall great work atmosphere, best retail environment I’ve ever worked at. If you’re gonna apply to this company, do your research and apply to the most busier stores, those are the ones that are always fully staffed and time will go by so much quicker."
good,"Liked working there, liked the people that I worked with but management seemed lost most days as there was always inbound issues of one sort or another.  Seemed like management wasn't really in touch with what was going on in the warehouse or ""on the floor"".   These issues weren't there before the company decided to go from 3 to 2 managers per shift due to ""communication issues"" as it was told to us.  Also, the company seemed way too dependant on bad weather and holidays for us to remain consistently busy.  Some nights it was really tough to find productive work to do especially after Christmas"
good,I worked as a customer order specialist and a lumber associate at The Home Depot. Everyone that worked there was very nice but we were always understaffed and the managers were not that interested in helping you grow your career.
good,Home depot was a great place to work. The balance between physical labor and calm relaxing was great. They have fun employee events and do give good hours.
good,"Supervisor about 20 employees giving there work assignment and helping the Contractors with there project and closing the sales, checking the invoices, order supplies, using handheld scanner for prices, missing label, order stocks, sales, setting a goal on sales .Customers service."
good,"Working here was fun. Met a lot of great people throughout the company. Management in the front end is very poor. It's almost prison like. No small bathroom breaks, and you HAVE TO go to lunch when they say or you'll get into trouble. Sales floor is a better place to work."
good,People that walk in to shop are genuinely friendly most of the time same as the people that you work with. They are willing to help and tell you what needs to be done and how to do it. It also isn't too hard to move up if you have the will to strive for it.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work at as long as your not on the freight team. Once your on there your like the red headed stepchild. They expect so much out of you. part time employees on freight just do there 4 hours and leave not getting much done, then leaving the rest of the work for the full time employees. Then when work isn't completed full time freight are the ones that get in trouble."
good,"this job was amazing the people, mangers was awesome friendly  the work was great an easy job just so far fro where I lived the days and hours on the job I loved 4 12 hrs days Monday thru Thursday"
good,The management is awesome to work for. It's relaxed and there wasn't much pressure as long as your drawer was correct and the customers didn't complain.
good,"-had to manage most of my department since manager and coworkers were absent"
good,"Nice, fun, busy, fast pace place to work. Able to move up in this company if you work hard. Able to achieve high low certification though this company."
good,If you are seeking to continue to uphold strong sales and performance standards or simply increase and develop new revenues for this organization you should take a look at this company.
good,"My time with depot has been good in some regards, worse in others. Career advancement is encouraged and easy enough, the quality of managment below SM leaves much to be desired as a result. Lack of communication and seasonal workers who don't take the task at hand seriously make it hard to deliver great customer service, though to its credit, HD takes great strides to address this. Overall, it depends on who the managment is in the store you get put in, and you should ask an associate who looks content if the current leadership is worth working for. The current managment in my HD is doing an adequate job in their role, and are supportive of me, and work with me to overcome challenges, and issues I may have, this has not always been the case. Customer service isnt always fun, but Home Depot has kept my years with them memorable and engaging."
good,"Responsible for a dozen plus employees."
good,It was a stepping stone for me.  Would like to have a set schedule but it changed every week.  Most co-workers were a joy to work with.  Some days were longer than others
good,Great place to work for anyone. no experience necessary and benefits are great for full time associates . The culture is focused on customer service and the customer will always come first.
good,It was a fun place to work once people got to know you. they always encourage you to do better and help people out. If you don't understand they help.
good,I enjoy The Home Depot because they really care about their employees and everyone works well as a team.  There is little career advancement and low pay for the hard work.
good,Customer service for the warehouse of the Home Depot consist of the stores being our customers. At times you had to deal with vendors or outside carriers but all customers were the stores.
good,"Good support from the senior level employees, good learning experience, balance between personal life and professional life.  Overall a good learning and working experience."
good,I really enjoyed my fellow employees and dealing with the customers. The management at the time could be ridiculous but all in all were fair. If you can find a store that will actually allow you to advance id take it because it could be very beneficial.
good,Great culture to work in and great benefits. The company makes sure to take care of there associates so they do a great job on the sales floor. Reward in prizes generously and love working as a team.
good,"Very hard to get promoted. In a typical day of 12 hours, you get two 15 min breaks and 30 for lunch. The learning process is on the job training.  The workplace culture is okay, team mates help out when you need help."
good,fun at first but there's no time to clock in you cant clock in early nor can you clock out late. everyone has to clock in at same time so your always late most of the time then after 3 late clock in's there you fired.
good,Overall this was a great place to be employed. I worked at the kentwood locations and throughly enjoyed going to work every day. I really wish I didn't have to leave
good,nice place to work managers seemed to have there favorite employees there but overall not a bad place to work pay was alittle less than and wanted more work from some employees and not others that was getting paid the same.
good,"I personally think working at Home Depot was an educational experience beside the friendly environment. I met some incredible people in the time I spent working at The Home Depot. I also learned many things that I never knew such as: flooring, tools, garden and receiving.  This experience will be useful to me for a life time."
good,The work place wasn't stressful but confusing. They switched managers twice when I was there. Each manager had a different vision of what they wanted the store to be. People from the community was upset because everything was moved around and they couldn't find the products anymore. That was years ago I'm sure they have it together now.
good,"The people I worked with were good, but customers are hard to deal with when upset.  I got burnt out on cashiering and dealing with customers, so I did my best to avoid issues that others created. Hardest part was letting customers curse, demean, and threaten with out reacting."
good,if you get up to department supervisor it can be worth it. But its all about who you know and who your friends with. Which isn't  good in my eyes because a lot of people that work hard and seem right for the job don't see eye to eye with management.
good,"A very fast paced work environment, Which promoted growth of knowledge base, and skill sets learned during training. management did a good job trying to work with the team, hardest part of the job i would say the lack of hours available, most enjoyable part was the fac that rewards were given for safety and service, which created a safe yet competative work environment."
good,Customers were fun store manager was great. hardest part was not have staff or many call outs and not held accountable. I enjoyed moving to a different department I work paint and front end
good,"This company will take care of you if you work hard, be participatory, and work to understand the tasks and challenges of store associates. With mentoring programs, tons of training opportunities, and positions available all over the world, this is a company you can spend your whole career with. To be successful here, though, you must be a self starter, and be willing to give up nights, weekends and holidays (more often than not.)"
good,"Enjoyed working here, many, many great associates and customers.  They generally are pretty flexible with scheduling, given adequate notice.  Limited hours, PT is restricted to 29 hours /wk."
good,Home Depot is a good company. There's not much chance for advancement. It is a good working environment and enjoyable when you have a position that is desired.
good,"There is always something to do, Many chances for advancement and plenty of friendly people. Pay isn't that great and amount of hours was lacking, but it was a good place to learn and work"
good,"Home Depot is a great company with very good employees. They also have very loyal customers to their successful business. This job is very fast-paced, and exciting. You get to meet a lot of people all day who range from every profession of life. It is an exuberant, task-oriented type of job. You will enjoy it!"
good,"Kept me on my feet, there was never a dull moment. Its a great place to work and meet new people. I really loved working in garden and lumber area because of the fast pace there it makes the time fly by."
good,"As a Cashier I was expected to be respectful to customers at all times and as this was the first time I had been a cashier this was a real learning experience. I learned that I am pretty good at working with people, helping them to find what they need and making sure that they have all they need for whatever project they have going. Management is great to work with and never making you feel unappreciated. There is a real emphasis on co-operation between departments and associates."
good,"As a cashier and then Paint associate I will say Home Depot is one of the greatest stores to work in, from my experience in retail. Decent pay but not great. Fun people to work with. Very easy tasks and great work environment. Fast paced."
good,The job was good but the money was awful. On one could possibly  be able to pay their bills and pay for a child while working there. Family comes first in all aspects but Home depot doesn't believe so.
good,Seasonal area for company where we had to be up to date on products information.you would have to be in good physical shape as you are lifting 50  pounds regularly.
good,Clock-in early and move products/carts. Learned a lot about contractors. Your bosses are always there to help. The work place is not very stressful. The hardest part was remembering to drink enough water in the summer heat. The best part about the job was all the walking in the sun and meeting new people.
good,"I started at the Home Depot in the early spring of 2017. That following summer during June/July, there was massive flooding in our area, and the Home Depot was not only understanding with flexibility in scheduling enabling me to help the people I lived with protect our home, but also called me on multiple occasions to ask if there was any way they could offer assistance or support of any other kind, including trying to find volunteers amongst the employees to fill sandbags and donating certain products to help in the relief efforts."
good,"Great place to work while your in school, if u like flexible hours and good benefits this is a great place to work. Discounts are not in store but 401K and other discounts are really competitive."
good,"Overall a good evironment just one problem, the pay is too low they give to many reponsiblities for the pay. The hardest part of the job was when you were left alone to do the job that normally three people do. the most enjoyable part was bieg recognixed by your hard work and evryone respecting you for that, the managment as awsome they tryed and help with whatever they could even tho sometimes we were left aloine. If there is one thing im gonna miss is gonna be my coworkers because they always made the job seem not so bad."
good,I have win four customer service awards at home depot and have been with the company for more than four years. I have had many positive feedback from the employees and customers at home depot and have enjoyed working here as well.
good,I enjoy the work and the customers but the pay is substandard for an experienced worker who has a serious work ethic and enjoys working. I have enjoyed the training and the work environment.
good,The Home Depot can be a great company to work for. For me a typical day at work can be stressful because of how this particular Home Depot is managed. The management at The Brea Home Depot is not too good. The only manger that I approve of is the store manager. There's really no hard part about the job unless you make it hard. the enjoyable part about the job that i enjoy working with my co workers.
good,"the people who work there are cool and nice. vary welcoming, but the managers are a diff story. but its a ok place to work just dont go to deliveries..."
good,The Home Depot is a great company. I really enjoyed working for them. They have flexible schedules that allow you to pursue your educational endeavors.
good,"A day at home depot for me was all about dealing with and helping customers find items and ring them up in a fast and friendly manner."
good,"Basically warehouse work, if you have sensitive ears I don't recommend. What I loved about my job at Home Depot during that time was they made their associates attend what they called PKU classes every morning or night before business pending your schedule. PKU an acronym for Product Knowledge Understanding classes was designed to give even a simple cashier like myself the knowledge to help a customer find merchandise and answer questions regarding their projects. This in my experience shopping at Home Depot today they no longer provide."
good,"Great place to work in with the right people. Every store has a different story, it's Russian roulette who you will get as your management team. When it comes to making their associates feel appreciated and welcomed, Home Depot does a fantastic job on doing so. They tend to their customers, vendor, and associates need as their top priority. As long as you do your due diligence and portray a top notch customer service. You can reach far heights within the Home Depot company. They strive to harness and enhance those who seeks knowledge to be a better asset for the business."
good,"For retail place home people does care about associates .Safe,Competitive Here's about their customers and their associates In the people can be a lot of fun"
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work at, they do take care of their people and looks out for people that wants to move ahead with their career. They do promote from within."
good,"The good the bad and the ugly. "
good,The employees are very supportive of each other. If you can not handle working with people this place is not for you. You get a different array of customers some are easy and some are incredibly difficult.
good,Used to be better. There is a lot of changes happening not all good. Sometimes very frustrating to work there. Company cares about employees  personal well being.
good,Home Depot is not for everyone but it is a great company to work for. Benefits apply to all associates. Vacation time and personal days available. 401K options too. Very interesting to learn the different aspects of the business
good,"Great people, I enjoy going to work.  If only we were paid an actual living amount, things would be great."
good,Pleasant environment to work in.  This job requires extensive knowledge of  building trade.  Sometimes seems like compensation is not comparable to work expectations.
good,"I worked for Home Depot for about a year and in that time I went from knowing nothing to being able to run the paint, and plumbing departments as well as conduct inventory prep. I was being trained for Department supervisor when I decided to continue my education. I was treated better at this store than any other retail position I had."
good,"Very hard to achieve full time or supervisor positions."
good,"As one of the only male cashiers, it was generally put to me to work outside in garden or at Self-checkout so that I could do all the lifting and loading when loaders were too busy. This was expected despite the fact that I have physical limitations."
good,"HD can be a rewarding job that allows its associates to move up if they desire to. Depending on your job title, some positions require more lifting and work.Management is always there for you to address any of concerns you may have."
good,Enjoyed helping people. Broadened my general knowledge in gardening. Worked at Home Depot while I went to school to get my CNA license and Phlebotomy. They were very helpful with working with my schooling.
good,"A typical day at work was routine."
good,"A typical day for me was opening at 5 am, packing down my department, while still helping the customers that came into our store. You had to be quick when packing down as you were trying to finish before you left, which for me was around 2pm as I took hour long lunches. I learned a lot about customer service, different tools and how to use them. I learned a lot from the contractors that came into the store too, about their professions and how to get into their fields of work. I learned how to be a backup supervisors as they started training me in it before I had left the company. The culture is great, I loved my managers, department heads and my co-workers everyone was very friendly and most were willing to help out. The hardest part of the job is making sure you're good at time-management, especially when you need to get multiple projects done while helping customers. The most enjoyable part was learning new things everyday, helping the grateful customers that came in and the friends that I made while working there."
good,"not much room for advancement "
good,"Fun and lot to learn"
good,It was never a dull moment at my store but it is the people that make all worthwhile!  Helping the customers accomplished their goals of home satisfaction!
good,A typical day at work revolves around Unloading trucks and stocking the merchandise. One day out of the week you perform pack-down for the whole store.
good,"it was a amazing job with plethora of different tasks, this was my first costumer service associate type job outside of work experience. this was a job that required you to be physically fit. you pushed around long lines of carts in all types of weather."
good,"A typical day is being ready right when you get on the phones. Customers will call as early as 3am so you have to make sure even tho its early to be upbeat, happy and ready to assist the customer. I've learned so much while working for HD.com. From what materials are needed to remodel a kitchen to gardening. Its amazing how many products homedepot actually has. Management was good, very helpful and ready to work with their employees whenever needed. As any other job, there are some management that are not as friendly and help but regardless you keep- doing your job and do it to the best of your ability. Most enjoyable job are the other employees, they are so fun and always willing to help as well."
good,I do not wish to give a review on Home Depot. I feel this is not important for the review of this company. Stop asking me to review the Home Depot buisness.
good,"Everyone there is really friendly and kind. Management is understanding and compromising. The hours and times are scattered and not consistent. One day you are working four hours the next it could be nine. You have training every month and there is only one assistant manager that doesn't listen to associates and customers. You have customers ask about where everything in the store is, and you are excepted to know. There are customers who feel entitled and others who are so kind and very friendly. You have to pack down on the aisle and face all of your aisles."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. The work environment here is very friendly. Everyone is is here to help each other. There are always great events for the employees.
good,"Home depot  creates a friendly,productive and fun working environment at all times for its associates and customers.home depot  has provides its workers job  security As leader in home improvement and home renovation Home Depot has proven to be committed to customer being happ and returning to our stores"
good,A great place to work. The store manager Tom always comes around and talks to employees. Checks on us and makes sure everything's okay. We all know everyone and we all are willing to help each other to get the job done.
good,"They pay like most places that used to be considered ""high school"" jobs, and by that I mean they don't pay well at all.  Both with personal problems and work related problems the management is greatly helpful in finding resources and solutions for and with you.  Upper management and higher ranking people need to stay out of the stores because they don't know what they're doing."
good,"Company has great benefits. You can learn a lot working there. Not only as a retail business but you can use the knowledge for any business you go to. If you take the education that is offered seriously, you cannot fail as a business man/woman."
good,"Fast pace day. I have learned a lot working as a garden associate.  I have learned about plants, different gardening products, and how to operate a forklift. My fellow associates have become like a family to me.  We all work as a team. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet on concrete floors eight hours a day."
good,"I enjoyed going to work and loved my job but it was physically taxing and the lack of availability for advancement made me leave."
good,"Most coworkers are nice people, persons in management and lead positions burn out because of overwork, most departments are heavily understaffed all year round. High turn out rate due to low salaries,terrible schedules, and poor management. Only a handful of people can earn a decent living with what they make there, but they have almost no life left for themselves."
good,"Loved just about every minute of it. Liked being able to connect with the customers and put a smile on their face in the mornings. Loved the drive through. Had an awesome manager, when she left things kind of went down. There was no direction. Slow to promote. Perks were great. Almost got to become a Coffee Master. Difficult to transfer."
good,Decent place to work at but management needs to be able to spread the work towards all associates in the department and not rely only on those who have proven themselves to work efficiently.
good,"Overall a good company to work for. There is very much to learn from the company. Management was less than helpful in some aspects and did make the work more stressful than it needed to be sometimes. There is however much to learn from this company, the staff is, for the most part, very professional and educated in their fields."
good,"While working at The Home Depot dfc the mornings were more than slow with barely any work to be done for the first 3 hours, and in contrary the nights would be too hectic to get materials put away safely and generally made the workers rush to finish the 12 hour shift. "
good,"While my efforts as sales specialist that led to a 7k per week gain in  contractor paint sales went very well acknowledged, it didn't translate to my pay. Not commission based and I felt like I could do better for myself on ebay. However, I did learned a lot from working in a weekly high pressure goal driven environment."
good,It is a good place to work with excellent vision for the future of retail.  It is a physically demanding job as you are on your feet all day and consistently load customers or down stock product to the shelves.
good,I really enjoy working for the Home Depot. The schedule is not to be desired for work and family balance. I have learned terrific management skills. The diversity is remarkable.  I have learned to make on the spot decisions to ensure the best customer service.
good,"Like any other job, you are required to have to weekdays to close, a minimum of four hour shift, along with the whole weekend open for availability. Management is a hit or miss. Coordination between the managers can be off sometimes, leading to tons of confusion. You will rarely see the department supervisors in their actual departments, and often times you as the associate can be expected to cover the brunt of the responsibilities of the department by yourself each day. At times, ridiculous rules will be imposed with counter-productive results upon ""not following them""(for e.g Saying ""Hi!"" to every single customer you see, and getting a notice from the manager upon missing even one customer)."
good,"Overall I would rate the Home Depot as a great place to work for part time and full time work for the average worker. The managers, however, are held to a higher standard and are taught to prioritize performance over the human side of the business. It becomes less about working as a team and instead about making sure your team doesn't become the problem."
good,Una buen empresa te ofrece algunos beneficios extras que otras tiendas de autoservicio no las ofrecen
good,worked overnight. went in at 9 worked till 6 am. restocked garden department outside. swept and cleaned up garden area for next day. made sure everything was nice and neat on shelves.
good,Depending on how hard you work will earn you the schedule you desire. New Associates are provided with a schedule to meet their needs when coming onboard.
good,Learn skills in working with tools and how to perform tasks in order to better help consumers. Learn to think critically and operate forklifts along with other mechanical lifting devices.
good,"Normal retail experience with the varied customers who know what they want to the ones that have no idea why they are even in your store and need you to hold their hand and tell them what to buy. The work is hard but oddly fulfilling if you are the type to take pride in your work. Management could use a little help with making sure that problems are addressed in a more timely manner and that people who are causing problems are dealt with, but for the most part they aren't bad. There was a lot of ""passing the buck"" when it came to taking ownership of a problem or getting things done. I actually had fun while working there and lost a bunch of weight from all the walking and lifting I did. Advancement seems a bit slow and pay increases are minimal. Most people there work more than one job to make ends meet."
good,"Es una empresa de primer nivel, dure mas de 10 años y obtuve muchos beneficios y conocimientos es muy redituable en salario, es una empresa de carrera y con gran oportunidad de crecimiento, lo único no tan recomendable son algunos malos lideres distritales y el poco tiempo que te queda para disfrutar a tu familia casi nulo. Pero en lo demás tiene muy buenos valores y códigos de ética así como procedimientos. Es por tanto una empresa recomendable para realizar futuro laboral."
good,"During my work experience with Home Depot, I was under a great staff and management. I was always motivated to come into work and even asked for more hours due to the good pay."
good,"Supervisors rarely work the floor. Unqualified people tend to be promoted. Praise is rare to come by. ""Evaluations"" rarely truly represent your abilities. HR is awesome and responsive and upper management in very involved. It's the department supervisors who tend to lack true effort, with a few notable exceptions."
good,"I was a Lot Associate, my job pertained to working in the parking lot outside, hauling carts for customer use, as well as loading stock, and special ordered product into customers vehicle. On occasion I would helped with product inventory, notifying departments, that they were out of certain products. I would also participate in setting up displays and then helping dismantling them at a later time. Other tasks that I had been assigned included maintenance and industrial clean up. Including hazmat. Occasionally floated to different sections, in which I would stock and assist with sales on the floor. Management was wonderful and completely understanding and helpful to staff. Hardest part of the job, would probably be when we were understaffed on a fast day. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other staff members and learning new things every day."
good,You can grow and learn a lot from this company. We provide great customer service and accurately check out our customers. Home Depot is a company where you can grow with many different opportunities to upgrade
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for. My coworkers are awesome and Home Depot has good benefits. Home Depot has flexible shifts, from early to overnight."
good,"Very fast paced environment. You get slammed with at least 50 questions a day. Morning time and holidays are the busiest time you know your department, everything else is a piece of cake."
good,"Not being able to move up in a department, even though you work really hard. Being kept in a position that is no longer enjoyable because no one else wants it."
good,"Good job for retail, well paid for retail. Turnover rate is high for supervisors though. Scheduling for full timers is fair, not so much for part timers."
good,Although at the time I was the only girl working with my coworkers I felt comfortable. They always helped when I needed help and didn't judge me for working in packdown and being a girl.
good,"wake up very early morning "
good,Most days consisted of stocking shelves while helping customers find what they need throughout the store. Several times throughout the day you would need to cut custom products like window blinds or carpet for customers and also create custom orders for products online which usually pertained to flooring.
good,"tuition reimbursement was particularly helpful, good dental and eye, but a pretty bad paycheck, "
good,"The department I worked in was very unprofessional with the distribution of workload, but my coworkers were very friendly. Management was very friendly, but very inefficient with communication and delegation of work tasks."
good,"The people i had worked with there, were nice, the job wasn't easy always, but we got through it since customers would make it hard. IT was a great job."
good,I just want to work part time and earn up to $900.00 per month. I would love to help unload and load. Also like to stack up on shelves. I would love to help customers to load their things. Also I work any time very flexibly but can't work on Wednesday evening and Sunday morning
good,"The work was very sample to understand. Hardest thing to deal with was customer with rude behaviors. Work environment was always peaceful, and very flexible with your hours sometimes. It will go up and down tho"
good,Was not difficult to move up as a supervisor you just need to work hard and be willing to be trained and be dependable. Hours vary no set schedule unless you are the one writing the schedule. Seems like the managers are not all on board with each other and don't know what's going on it sucks for the ones who do care.
good,"For the most part Home Depot is a great company to work for. I'm an in-store hourly supervisor. I make a fair rate, but it comes with sacrifices. I never have a consistent schedule some nights I'm there until 2am and then another day I open the building at 5am. My role is a developmental position for those who want to become an assistant manager. I assist salaried management throughout the day with anything and everything needed all while managing two departments as well."
good,"As far as retail work goes, I had a pretty good experience with Home Depot. The customers were nice. Break room was always a good place, employees knew each other and were very nice. I liked being able to be a cashier in multiple departments, it mixed stuff up so it wasn't the same every day."
good,"Good company to work for, they provide some very good benefits and support for their employees. Profit sharing is a plus and helps make up for no employee discount.  However, typical retail chain and management can be lacking.  Often not enough hours to fully staff store, leaving customers upset and employees covering multiple departments."

good,the Home Depot is a ok place to work. the benefits are good and the people i work with are great. the downside of working there is the pay. work the work they expect the pay is way off.

good,"Is a good place to work but not too much hours. the people there is great, made a lot of good friends. Learn a lot there too. You can go up if you have patience."
good,"While this job pays alright and has excellent hours, the work is very physically demanding and leaves you quite sore. The Home Depot mostly only offers Temp positions for its overnight staff during the busy season. When I was hired, I was told that my position was to be permanent, however, when I talked with the HR worker at my particular location, I quickly learned that they hired me as a Temp associate."
good,Provide great costumer service at check out by making sure transaction is as accurate as possible. Offer and open credit. Keep front end clean and uncluttered form returns at all times.
good,the company overall is a good company to work for the pay is average and the bosses are for the most part decent to work for but it is fast paced and until you learn the home depot way and systems you will struggle a bit
good,"Management seemed to understand many of the complaints about workers receiving mouth from customers, however management seemed to just brush it off. Schedule is always different, making a decent work life balance extremely difficult."
good,overall good company not impressed with the leadership team advancement is there but favoritism is how it works not by most qualified. They are rude if not having a good day do not practice what they preach as far as respect towards us as we should towards the customers
good,"Interesting environment to work in. Good management team that recognizes good effort with opportunity for advancement. Pay structure is positive. If one is flexible, success can be yours."
good,"I over all enjoyed working at The Home Depot. Management in the store I worked was okay, but the HR person was not so cool. I loved serving the customers, and my co-workers were cool too, we had fun to help the day go by."
good,"its cool. very fast paste, good people, the management is a little iffy, but they are working on that, I wish there scheduling was better than it is, but its not bad"
good,"I really loved working at Home Depot because of the environment, they were very organized, and productive. Also, i loved working with the people who shopped and also the workers. The only down side was they weren't willing to help work with my schedule."
good,"I had started part time, and quickly gained full time in a few months.From this experience i have learned how to better handle conflict resolution, by assisting  customers with finding the right people for the job. Management at the store was very nice, but strict. A lot of the time they would leave me in charge of the front end. I would say the hardest part of the job was finding the right SKU codes for things that were not in our OCB,or binders. The easiest part of the job was the environment. A pleasant working environment with friendly coworkers and bosses made it easy to provide customers with optimal customer service. Overall I feel the company gave me the tools I needed to further my career path."
good,A good environment and management to work for. Culture changes rapidly and often. Tenured employees are well compensated. As a do it yourselfer or experienced handy man the opportunity to help others is very satisfying.
good,"I worked overnight freight and the typical night at work was fast paced and often challenging in the beginning. Eventually, you adapt to the work environment and the nights get easier. I learned everything there was to know about the freight process. The managers always bumped heads, which, made the workplace a little hectic. Although they were good guys, they were selfish. They would rather overwork a good worker than ask a mediocre worker to do more. They do this so the the mediocre worker don't call corporate on them."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is fun, but the pay isn't very good.  The people who are good workers have to carry the ones that aren't.  It's difficult to get any results when you talk to management about problems."
good,The workplace at Home Depot is a nice and friendly environment. I learned a lot about customer service and management is relatively understanding. The hours are fairly consistent and flexible.
good,"Sales, helping people find products or finding info about products. You're in the same department all day and it gets boring, especially if you're there for a long period of time."
good,Home Depot isn't a shabby company to work for. It's really on the person and desire to work for them they do offer great benefits and different events throughout the fiscal year
good,"home depot is a great company, especially for those in management there. However, compensation as far as pay goes is low for the amount of work they put on one specific department. cashiers get paid the same to do a lot less. The service desk is definitely responsible for a lot of things and get paid the same. however, with a good management team and associates, things can go smoothly. There are opportunities available within the company, but they are quick to let go of good employees and keep ones that can manage to get to work on time or not call out although they do not do a great job"
good,"Good company to work for. They care about the employee sometimes, they are much better than other first class jobs, but, I wouldnt get on the wrong side of the managers"
good,it was ok working there the job was fairly easy and i didn't work for the store so i got to do my job and not have to worry about customers asking me a question every minute but i always helped when i could.
good,Nothing too bad but seasonal cashier. I worked for the period of a few months and I enjoyed the people and atmosphere while working there. I recommend you always be on time because I was late a few rimes and it wasn't the best. Never is in job fields.
good,"being over several areas where cashiers were , a lot of walking , learning through workshops gives you skills to do things on your own if the pay and raises were better I'd still be there  a place income wise for young people with no family. When you have home issues you learn what to do how to and were in the store to get what you need to fix it your self   ***save  money ***"
good,I really enjoyed my job at Home depot. When I was there the pay rate and raises were very good.The schedule was terrible. Nights and weekends were the norm and in most cases your schedule from day to day was always different and sometimes extreme. Working till midnight then having to be back at 5 or 6 a.m. the next day. If not for the terrible schedule I may still be working there.
good,I had work part time for Home Depot for seven years Satisfying the customer was the number one priority had to learn how to deal with customers that were upset and find a common ground.
good,"If you are into problem solving and helping customers, it's a great place to work. You can advance up to department manager. Hours of work are rarely set the same from week to week."
good,"They sometimes staff too thinly, but overall this is a great place to work. The management makes a concerted effort to listen to associates' concerns and respond in some manner. Extraordinary effort will be rewarded at times with recognition, but more tangible, financial recognition would be far preferable."
good,"I have been employed with Home Depot for almost two years on second shift. There have been many changes on my shift, in which some are for the worse and better."
good,"The Home Depot has great resources to assist their associates and members of the community."
good,This was a great place to work for. Management was good. Training was easy. Great teamwork. Garden Center in Season was the area I liked most.  Clean.
good,"Provide ongoing department training and cross training. "
good,"I was a sales associate. I was in the lumber / roofing department. Working with Cement, Dry Sheet, Cutting wood, Carpentry made work a good work out for the day."
good,"Prides themselves on great customer service. I learned the importance of customer service and that it is top priority. "
good,I worked here for about 7 months I enjoyed working here. However I did have a problem with them constantly changing my shifts the night before I have to come in.
good,Worked in flooring and decor and window treatments. Loved the job. Just not enough hours. Supervisor was nice and I had a few people I loved working with.
good,"Very large company. Safe doing business with them because of that.dealing with national products and local installers."
good,"Great place to work. Management teams are power hungry. Too many bosses, not enough listeners.Not much gets done as management constantly fights. No organization with co-workers. Easy job. Just show up and exist."
good,"It was a nice job, Good experience and training. Decent moral and some went above and beyond for their employees. Not a bad place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was that they give back and there are bonuses as long as you put in time."
good,"The atmosphere was always fun. The company always made sure that the employees were taken care of, in regards to being happy, their wellness and safety was a serious matter. The happy employ represents the happy company."
good,you have to learn the basics before you can move up. started as a cashier  motivated me to  be more hands on with customer service getting a taste in the field of
good,"A typical day starts at pro desk, with maximum  communications and patient work with PRO customers. The hardest part of the job to drive sales and be on the  top of store inventory, because you deal with more than a million products."
good,"I was a sales specialist in the Millwork (windows and doors) department. My typical day consisted of assisting customers with their window and door needs. I got to show my expertise not only in sales but also in installation and repair. Management is always concerned with numbers. They don't see that living and working in a small town such as Okeechobee that there really aren't a lot of people needed our help because we don't install in mobile homes or park models. Coming from the much larger city of Jacksonville, Florida, it can be a bit of a culture shock. I was consistently #1 in sales in my store where I worked there. But there was also a different market. More houses, less mobile homes. Hardest part of the job was attracting qualified customers that could benefit from your knowledge. Most enjoyable part of the job was when the customers came back and told you how much they appreciated your help and how satisfied they were."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of opening the store, and providing good customer service.  Management could be a little overbearing, as their salary and bonus is rated on sales."
good,"I loved working with the customers, everyday was something new, alor of the employees where more about getting one another in trouble then trying to help eachother succeed"
good,The home depot was a great company to work for in all aspects of the sense. if i didnt have to leave for care of family i would have enjoyed working here longer.
good,"I worked here throughout college, and I met some of the nicest people I've ever known. It is a minimum wage job, which is terrible, but most of the employees are great."
good,"it was fun because my co workers, "
good,Multitasking from the minute I walked in door. Expectations were far greater than any other employment. Big box retail is all about management. Best part is experiencing the customers smile and knowing that he or she are leaving the store happy.
good,"Learned a lot about Home Maintenance, Building, Gardening. I believe my experience here will help me make well informed decisions on the job and in life. Stayed busy learned a lot kept up with a fast paced business and how it operates."
good,"The Home Depot is over all a good place to work based on the co-workers as well as management. "
good,"Merchandising can be fun and challenging with customer service thrown in throughout the day. The retail environment always has something to do, never a dull moment if you choose to work. MET has a great schedule of Monday through Friday which is very unusual for retail. Advancement is the most limiting aspect of the job."
good,I enjoyed being greeter and cashier at the Home Depot.  I learned a lot about the products they carry and services their contractors lend.  I also was recognized in the area of customer service.
good,The Home Depot was a great place to reestablish myself in the sales arena. It was not a place that allowed for a accelerated career advance. This is a great place for a person just starting out.
good,"Food prep: chips, frozen items, burgers, chicken, hot dogs, brats, buns, beverages, along with stocking, listing, keeping track. I also learned how to handle a food stand by myself. I learned to make relationships with customer=rs as well."
good,Its a great atmosphere to work in. People at the store are friendly and easy to get along with. There is a lot to learn in the store but by learning more it will help you move up faster.
good,"A regular work day consists of opening the store with a morning rally with all staff to get day started. Then we do a daily safety inspection of our areas.The rest of the day is customer service and stocking to keep store neat and organize."
good,"it wa such an amazing experience , that i could get involved with costumer service , and got licensed as a forklift operator as well as reach truck."
good,"Home depot is a good place to work, but when they start hiring people in with little to no skills making more then a long term employee, then that's a little more then someone can understand"
good,Culture is to help one another.  Customer service is a priority.  Limited hours at various positions. Free lunches at times.  Turkeys at Thanksgiving  Ham at Christmas
good,It was a good job to work while still in school but I wasn't given the set number of hours I needed per week. The supervisor of the department changed a lot and it was hard to get used to a set routine because of that.
good,Fair place to work.  General full time and part time posistions available.  Fulltime set shifts. Schoolallowance available through HD University
good,"I set my own schedule to meet with customers all over south Texas.  The thing is that we had so many customer to measure and were getting more between two Project Coordinators and we really needed to have a third Project Coordinator to be home by the decent time of six or seven pm..  Management would not get a third PC and said the answer is to work more hours which let to getting home at between 10 - 11pm daily.  "
good,Favoritism is an issue. They could do more to recognize their employees that work hard as others but are not compensated because they are not the favorites.
good,"Home Depot es un empresa preocupada en la capacitación, manejó de personal y busca la excelencia en el servicio al cliente"
good,Please don't make a career here. you CAN do better. they don't offer enough for the crud you have to put up with if you work there longer than a few years.
good,Great staff-fun place to work-lots of heavy lifting and heavy customer service-good benefits-selling expertise encouraged-good training-nice perks
good,i like working here it was good hours and really worked with me when times were hard . i learned a lot from this company and made some lasting friends.
good,I had fun working there. I learned a lot about the renovation world and home improvement. I really enjoyed the staff and camaraderie.
good,Great place to work and learn. Friendly staff and deent management. Different people you meet is a plus when installing windows and doors.
good,The company is over all great other then management. It is more of due as I say and not as I do; leadership. Other then management it is a great company to work for.
good,Worked alot harder then most and dealt with alot of complainers. Who didn't understand what I did and the time it took. The Management at times did not understand and put too large of an expectation on my team and I. We still came in every day and made all the freight disappear and occasionally left some.
good,Was a good job.  Problem is that they just plug and play anyone into the appliance department.  Pay could be a lot better and performance based instead of straight hourly.
good,"-Good Start if you want to learn and gain more customer service skills."
good,"Working outside was fun and most of the customers you meet are nice people besides the few bad apples you'd have from day to day. Department head was a micro manager and played favorites so unless he felt you were on ""his level"" he'd throw you under the bus even though our department always had our work done and on time. Co workers are great and always willing to help. Management can get lost in the shuffle from time to time but overall they're a solid group and the drama that goes on sometimes is ridiculous but I guess it's to be expected."
good,"Working at The Home Depot was great, the people who work there are friendly hard working and very helpful the management always very involved and were very over all caring as well the hardest part of the job was just making sure we had the product over all the job was great and helping customers was an amazing experience."
good,Good company to work for. Needs some tweaking on communication between managers and associates. Changes to associates file should be discussed with them
good,"A typical day here at The Home Depot is simply finding out ways to make my job easier, and the company better. Filter through emails, create excel docs to review stats, and enjoy my co-workers."
good,"It is good place to work, i learned a lots of new things, good work environment all are nice people and helpful as well. I work during weekends most but it is fun."
good,Generally a good place with reasonable people (both customers and fellow employees) but your entire day can be easily ruined by some jerk that has nothing better to do then make your day miserable.
good,"Focusing on providing best customer service, and driving sales and reviewing all discrepancies related to order processing."
good,"Los cambios continuos de horarios"
good,"I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot, as it provided a place to grow my interpersonal, customer service and decision making skills. I enjoyed the costumer interaction, as I gave various product knownledge. My co-workers were a joy to be around, and made work fun and exciting. I feel the hardest part of the job is not intially having an asnwer to a customer question. Management was very encouraging, and gave great feedback on how to develop our skills."
good,Not a great place to work and also not a bad place to work. Has it's ups and downs as a company. It is your standard warehouse job with an open floor plan and all the moving parts!
good,The customers are what makes the day worth it. The friendships you build with them is what can make you smile. The employees treat eachother like a family.
good,Often get paid what you deserve. Sometimes slow work. Redundant work. Opportunities to learn new equipment and other jobs available within corporation available.
good,"For a transitional Job- it was hard work but a lot of fun.  Hard physical work but I loved it.  Staff was fun and helpful."
good,Being a cashier meant one day you could be in the front another you could be at returns or another you could be outside in garden overall a nice environment to be apart of.
good,"Working at this company has been quite a rewarding experience. I have developed strong customer service skills. Management at The Home Depot is somewhat good, sometimes a lack of communication between associates and management can be the most difficult part of my job because when there is no communication, it creates a stressful work environment."
good,too many issues with certain department supervisors who leave their work for others to do for them... the real workers do the brunt of the work and the department supervisors reap all the benefits.
good,"Working for home depot is great for a part time job, even a full time job especially if you're going to school. Once you complete your 90 days they'll reimburse 50% of the money you paid for school if you received a C or better. The downside is trying to have a family life and work the full time shifts. Seeing your family somewhat becomes something on the back burner."
good,"At Lowes I learned how to stock merchandise, order items also helped customers with purchases."
good,Takes forever to become full time which makes their turn over rates so high. benefits are a plus in the situation tho and they're pretty decent with the scheduling if you really need it.
good,Home Depot seems to be a very political company in terms ones ability to progress in the job. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was waking up at 4:30 every morning but the enjoyable part was getting off work at 3pm everyday.
good,"I am a self motivated and enthusiastic person. I love that the managers don't follow you around all day looking over your shoulder. I was able to complete my task daily with freedom at a reasonable pace. Loved my colleagues. My only issue with the position was working evenings during school. I would have stayed if I were able to work morning shifts. I had no one to pick my child up from school, otherwise I would have stayed."
good,Employees are friendly and are willing to go out of the way to help you out.  I learned that everyone works as a team for the customer to receive a great shopping experience.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes the limited amount of workers in the store.  Many hours have to be cut towards the holiday season to meet the quota.  The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to associates that come from different backgrounds.
good,"Great cast of employees and ever changing display of product lines."
good,"everyday in retail is a little different and there are good days and bad days. Management is happy if they are making sales, and they look good to the upper level.  "
good,Highly held core values. Management can be difficult at times. Job is stressful if not given adequate management support. Opportunities for advancement if you work hard.
good,"A typical day at Homedepot was clocking in going to my sup. to see if i had a truck to unload and then i start stocking. I learned its better to stay to myself and im more productive that way. Mnagment played favorites a lot, i witnessed lots of people treated unfairly. My co-workers were bitter due to the managment. The hardets part was dealing with the unfair treatment and tension in the work place. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in different depts."
good,Very good at educating EE's on product knowledge and communicating with EE's. Great opportunity for transitioning around to other departments and growing within a company.
good,"Management depending on the stores is not great but just depends on who the management team is. For the most part everyone gets along but its like its like high school at times. Customers can be rude like anywhere working with the public. Only closed on Christmas and Thanksgiving, get holiday pay for the rest and they provide food if you are working on the holiday. Can get an hour or thirty minute lunch on a 8 hour shift. Too much computer training and the safety training is huge in the company."
good,"The Home Depot was the longest place I ever worked. Never a dull moment. My coworkers and managers were fabulous. The only draw back was the pay. I was working astronomical hours with not much pay and living in Atlanta, GA is rather expensive."
good,"Management can be disorganized. Good environment, good people, low wages, good for student or just out of high school. Good for warehouse experience.."
good,"This is a good job. I just don't see a future for myself as a retail manager. I learned Forklift, Reach Truck, Order Picker, how to lay flooring. Many great skills you pick up while working for this company."
good,"Sarcastic work environment, some lazy co workers, others are great to work with, just have to decide which you're going to choose to be. Sometimes scheduling gets messed up and you are slammed with customers, some managers will help you if they are there."
good,"As a supervisor, maintaining the peace was the call of the day on most days, I started in garden and made my way to shift supervisor. The management changed so often as others progress in the company, you are given limited time to prove your successes and demonstrate abilities to incoming upper management. The most enjoyable part of this job was as a supervisor motivating the people that worked under my responsibility."
good,"co-workers made the days go by fast "
good,One of the most welcoming job experiences I have encountered. Employee's were friendly. Benefits were impeccable. Customers were very accepting. Felt like one big family overall.
good,"- I either ran cash register or I was gathering carts out of the parking lot and helping customers with loading heavy items into their vehicles."
good,"Overall if you are trying to get back on your feet a good place to start. Depending on your department or job position and the overall communication at your store, your day could go from very well to exceptionally dreadfull. I learned a lot of valuable lessons working for the company such as the importance of covering yourself in any and all possible situation, that no good deed goes without punishment and the importance of understanding the ground work for a company as far as how it functions and who in management to impress. As i gained more experience i began to realize the importance of time management not just by completing task and assignments but as well as how it affects your own personal development. Other associates will help when needed and are some of the most polite and brightest people I've ever met. But communication is extremely needed and just as important as time management. Management varies but my experience wasn't to good considering we couldn't keep a store manager longer than a year."
good,"I for the most part enjoy working at The Home Depot. When i arrive, i scan the shelves in my department and make a list of what is either low or out. Once we are all clear of customers i begin to bring down pallets or product from the over head to stock. I know how to operate a forklift, a reach truck, and an order picker. I enjoy all of my coworkers even though in my department i usually work alone. My overnight manager does a great job of mixing friendship and manager duties."
good,it was nice sometime management could use a little more training. always under staff. the location was secluded and hard to get to if no transportation was available
good,"Home Depot was a fine place to work. The management was kind and helpful, but the work was not very rewarding. It made a fine summer job."
good,"My time spent was very educational and I am thankful for the skills I learned while employed with this company. I learned management, relationship building, and problem solving skills that are key for the next level in my career."
good,"Perform in-store merchandising service activities such as merchandising projects, planogram maintenance, overhead organization, and display/signage maintenance designed to enhance the customer experience."
good,"I have never seen or heard a company spend so much money on food for the employees. This is supposed to make the employees moral better, but I don't see it. The food they buy is so unhealthy. How do they expect people to work with enthusiasm after they eat potato salad and baked beans? The management at my store is not very proactive, from what I see. They seem to busy to help with anything physical and if you ask for help they say they will get some for you, but you never get any. Management does not promote teamwork well."
good,"Everyday at Home Depot is different, I go into work not know how the day is going to go. In customer service I have to work with many different customers with many different challenges. Some of the tasks  I performed on a daily basis are: return, sales, tool rental, special orders, and installation contracts. While working at Home Depot I have learned how to work with many different people. I also learned how to use many other computer systems. The management the Home Depot is very friendly and helpful, I only have good things to say about them. At Home Depot I got to meet and work with many different co-workers which all where friendly and helpful. The hardest part of working in Customer Service at Home Depot is the fast past environment. The most enjoyable part of working at Home Depot is all the new people I have the pleasure of meeting and helping."
good,"The home depot- Front end Associate position is a long hours and tiring position. "
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot usually consisted of doing my safety checklist to make sure my department was safe and clean to work in. From there I would check out of stock items on the shelf and pack down if possible. "
good,"Better, but still leaves a healthier work/life balance to be desired. Human nature seems to go unchecked in a lot of places ... I expect work NOT to be one of those places.  It's about business.  That should be it."
good,"un lugar amigable"
good,The days go fast because  their is lots to do. I drive tow motor an reach truck . I am trained on hand scanners an met phones. The hardest part of job is tracking inventory . The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with.
good,"On an average day, customers are basically pretty reasonable to work with. You have to have patience like Job because there are some customers that can flip your personality from trying to take care of the customer to really wanting to just hang up."
good,"I worked for Home Depot for 14 yrs, would still be there if they would have let me stay. typical day at work would be mainly helping customers find what they want then there may be some packing out merchandise. may have to drive a forklift for another dept but you gotta do what helps get what the customers need."
good,Home Depot was good company to work for. Worked in receiving dept. for 6 years enjoyed it fellow workers where great. they are strict  on no overtime. rainy days were the worst if you like to stay dry while unloading.overall had a good time with Home Depot.
good,"Good place to work, they value their associates especially hourly. Salary managers work long days and rarely have 2 days off together so it can be tough at times to get recharged and motivated to perform at a high level. Being a Specialty Manager I am responsible for all installations that the store does. This can be difficult to manage due to the installers being independent contractors working for United Home Services. When they don't show up for a install the customer calls you and wants results fast and its difficult to get a satisfactory resolution for the customer."
good,Working at the home depot has been a valuable and interesting place to work.  It has provided many opportunities and provided me with valuable work experience.
good,"The customers and having the opportunity to learn so many new things every day was my favorite part of the job. I loved that I was offered over time almost every week, and that the job was systematic."
good,"Good place to work, the swIng schedules are tough, low paying, are told last minute when you are working, you almost have to marry the company to get promoted."
good,"If it's retail work you are looking for it's a great place to work."
good,"Typical work day would include helping customers with their small projects, gathering products for customer orders, assisting on the front with any lines that may occur.  Co- workers help out at times, when they are not busy with helping any of their own customers. Hardest part of the job is working with minimal amount of employees on the sales floor (It feels like every limb is being pulled apart in every direction)."
good,"A typical day is assisting customers, reviewing inventory, working reports, giving directions to associates on things that need to be done."
good,"Home Depot is an interesting retail store to work in. Daily tasks include shelf maintenance, helping customers find products, and load products into their vehicles."
good,Working for this company was very rewarding and great experience. They cared about their employees and were very flexible and cared about employees personal lives.
good,The management was not good but the associates were great to work with. The customers that you build a relationship with keep coming back to see you
good,"overall good place to work, head office needs to pay more attention to associates needs and suggestions to make home depot a better working experience"
good,A good company heavily centered around customer service. I was a deliveries coordinator and I loved helping customers. The job was challenging but I always found a way to make things work. Working here I learned how to stay on a job and be consistent. Management was terrible because they didn't know the difference between being a boss and being a leader. They rely heavily on politics and favoritism with mostly people who didn't do their jobs. But even through all of that I still found a way around it. My co workers were good people in general although most of them were lazy and wouldn't assist you to save their lives. The hardest part of my job was working with people that didn't pull their weight. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and making sure they had everything they needed to get the job done.
good,Working hard with customers everyday to provide great customer service. Great job to learn multiple areas of the company all at once and to have freedom to control amount of learning you can accomplish.
good,"A typical day at work is coming and making an assessment as to who the truck is going to be off loaded, so that the freight can be staged and packed out in the allotted time."
good,"Co-workers made it worth while, not very flexible with school schedules or other personal issues, had to deal with many rude customers."
good,The company builds a work environment based around the teamwork of all of the employees.  The company puts the hourly employees first.
good,"Its a steady job and everything but not a lot of advancements. Management was fair wish there was more benefits and on the job training,"
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work and learn, but the schedule is demanding. If you are considering management remember that most store managers require their Asst. managers to work 50 to 60 hour weeks and 70 hours on holiday week. It does pay well however; an Asst. manager starting out can make $45,000.00 plus quarterly 15% bonuses."
good,"Although this was a temp job, i really enjoyed work for the company. I learned different things about plants as well as lawns .Co-workers where great source of knowledge and was a very friendly environment.The hardest part of the job was feeling very underutilized because having coming from a prior hardware background where i practically did every department with the exception of lumber , where feelings of out of place . but over all I really liked working for Home Depot ."
good,"Exceedingly high call volume, difficult to catch one's breath between calls. The stress related to some poor project planning has added to an already challenging role. If it were not for great co-workers and a supportive supervisory team, the churn would be much higher. The hardest part of the job is knowing that many of the challenges could be avoided with a better better proactive approach. The best part of the job, is the end of one's shift."
good,"it was okay i suppose.  very typical large company, slow to promote, but that's not a big deal to everyone.  A lot of people settle there into middle management, but analyst turnover is very high."
good,"working at the home depot is an excellent way to hone customer service skills, each day presents new challenges trying to meet and exceed our customers needs."
good,I learned a lot of skills to work with customers and vendors. Some of the hard things about the job is that a lot of the systems crash frequently. Not a ton of support and their benefits are very expensive. For as much money as they make they could definitely provide better medical insurance. I paid about $400 a month for myself only.
good,loved working with the crew but the hours were not enough to live off if you have a family. lots of laughing going on and team work was great. I would return if there was more hours to work.
good,A typical day at work would be giving the best  customer service you can give. Its very fast pace and enjoyable too. It will always keep you on your feet. You will be able to interact with very diverse people.
good,Home Depot is great for the fast paste individual. If you have high energy; motivated; team player and want to learn. This is the place for you!
good,"No issues. excellent  Human Resources Team "
good,"Fun and rewarding work environment. great employees, and great customers and some customers are regular. Managers are always there when you need them, they help when ever they can or when we are having trouble or have a problem."
good,"buen lugar para trabajar, lo malo es que las personas de recursos humanos no te permiten trabajar, son muy castrantes"
good,this job was a great way to experience new things and meet contractors. The management here was not that good they would make you work more for less pay. I really enjoy working here because i get to learn new things and meet alot of different workers
good,"The Home Depot is a decent job that has plenty of opportunities to move up in the company.  Even if your looking for some extra work on the weekends, I recommend looking into it."
good,"I enjoyed the fact that when I did begin my employment with Home Depot, there was a great amount of training to advance my skills and make me more knowledgeable of my position.  There was a lot of support from co-workers and Management"
good,"*  Check security on doors, getting cash register in order, cleaning your area"
good,"Not enough hours or money, But it is nice to be outside during the summer and take care of all the plants and to help people with their project needs"
good,loved worker here but hard to move up from within also low raises and not enough incentives to doing good work supervisors with little to no experience hired to do a job they no nothing about pay raises are 25 cents for the year
good,"Overall this experience was a good one. Peers were always more than helpful, very positive and welcoming to newcomers. Management was flexible considering the early hours our execution team was required to work. My supervisor was very understanding when in it came to incidences in family life that resulted in a missed days work. Although the attendance policy isn't as forgiving. It is very set in stone, cut and dry shall I say. The hardest part to be honest was finding a place to exceed expectations, because as in all situations I've come across, their always ""Favorites"". My favorite part of the job would have been resets. It got us out of the repetitive work we did on a daily basis."
good,"heavy lifting, customer service. How to sell garden products. Stressful management. helpful co-workers. Learning how to attract sales. Getting the right product promptly."
good,"I typically spend part of my night putting away product on the shelves, followed by lift truck operation as needed (both manual lifting and fork lift operation). Generally, people are OK with working, but it can be a bit of a drag from time to time and people will really get down on the job when it happens."
good,"I have had a decent experience with the home depot, they are flexible and management is strait forward and friendly. The compensation is not very competitive and benefits are sub par. Some positions require intense constant lifting of over 100+ pounds."
good,There is always room to move up and learn here. so many different departments and places to advance. co workers are like family and there is a strong influence of team work.
good,"it is a hard work place and constant running, must be aware of people around you for safety issues. great interaction with people."
good,"Great company to work for, I can't say anything bad about home Depot, great benefits and perks. I worked there for fifteen years under great leadership."
good,You can learn a lot and move up the ladder quickly if  you are professional and work hard. Handling aggressive customers is the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable is having a connection to regular customers and your co-workers.
good,i loved learning new things and helping people when they needed help and the best part was receiving my forklift license
good,"Really enjoy providing customer service to the home depot community. A lot of diverse, fun loving, customers who are working on extraordinary projects. Its very gratifying to help them find what they need to complete their projects."
good,Very busy place to work in the paint department. Each day brings new challenges even though working with paint. Learn something new everyday either about a new product or how to use new products. Most enjoyable is the people I really enjoy interacting with them to have them get the right paint and supplies for their jobs.
good,"Management was notoriously inept, constantly passing responsibility on to lower level employees when said tasks are clearly the responsibility of management."
good,"it is a great job. people are very friendly management is great. your always busy, always have something to do. helping people and coworkers. loved it"
good,Great place to work. You learn alot from customer service to home improvement. Co-workers are good you help each other out usually no drama...management yea not so much but are understandable easy to deal with very lennient. I worked in the horn lake store for 5 years and loved with the atmosphere the people but the money was starting to be an issue. The raises every year were not decent at all...got $.15 raises and had new employees making the same or more than me. Asking for a raise even when changing departments was nonsense. Its a good place to work but the money to support a family its not worth it.
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, the down side is the schedule.  You do not know what days you will be working week to week.  It makes it a challenge planning anything outside of work"
good,"start up meeting and stretches....go to assigned location and log in scan product on your line ,pack and label send on conveyer.in heavy repack we use foam machines to pack around product inside box in smaller items we used plastic bubbles. management was very respectful to associates. I got along very well with my co workers ....odd shaped items were the hardest to deal with. had to use imagination on how to pack it....most enjoyable likng the job itself..."
good,i get to help many people that comes in and out and to guide them to the right people in the departments for what they need plus it keeps you busy in any weather and i learn from managers about how to keep the shelves stocked up and help co-workers if need extra pair of hands if the loads are too much to handle
good,Good place to work not much opportunity to go full time though. They put a lot of emphasis on safety. Abundant opportunities for training
good,"Good days and bad. Heavy influx of various customers in myriad stages of knowledge. Have to adjust on the fly for each situation. "
good,It is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. I had tons of fun when I went to work. You get to know a lot of hardworking people that work and shop there.
good,It is a repetitive task everyday. Love working with people. The management are not that good to recognize people who really work hard.
good,great place to work to help people with their new projects and making sure customers left satisfied with their visit to the store.
good,I love the work I do but people who work there is a down fall fast paced and enjoyable. had fun for the most part just a lot of people there are to lazy.
good,Very easy to move up with the right will power. Great company to initiate a career. Accuracy is key. Very high expectations. Scheduling can be better. Excellent talents.
good,Working with all types of credit and money counting. Had to make quick decisions on inventory so customers were informed so they could make good decisions on goods.
good,I worked with them with my brother but it was only during the winter the short time frame to help shovel roofs and make money.
good,"The effectiveness of management depends on the manager.  Some are more concerned about the business than others, and some managers do not understand the business.  "
good,"productive and efficient working place,team work the best ever. the environment is conducive for working. staff and employee alike are ready to listen and learn."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work, but in my opinion the local store lacks the leadership needed to run the store effectively."
good,"A day at the home depot started by checking my schedule to see where I would be working and with who? I also check for the manager for the day just in case I needed them I knew who to call,  I learn so much just by working at the home depot, on of the many things I learn was how to do some gardening, how to treat the plants I learn a lot of names of the flowers, I had amassing co workers I really enjoyed working with them. I would say the hardest part of my job was to try work late shifts and then wake up early for an early shift. I really enjoyed helping customers in their needs."
good,"Its a good company if your a fully time employee, unlucky for me its down season during this time so home depot in Riverdale doesn't want to hire a full time associate."
good,Every place can be nice if you like the people you work with. If you enjoy working with the public this is a good place to start. Pay is good as well as benefits even for part time employees. Downfall is unless management really likes you or you kiss butt you will be overlooked for promotions.
good,I loved the people here but they wouldn't work with me on my schedule nor could I could I get my availability changed even when I spoke to them about it.
good,Great company to work for I like the experience I had there. but now ready for a new endeavor. lots of task sometime do not have time to finish task
good,"Enjoyed working here for the most part. You pretty much have to just go with the flow. Priorities change from day to day. Assistant Managers at the Jackson,Tn store are pretty great.  Day by day kinda job."
good,they lacked the a true leader to set forth what expectations were. but was a relaxing job and good for family life. the best part was the outreach in the community that really set them apart for me.
good,"I unloaded trucks and put stock away. Operated a reach truck, sit-down forklift, and order picker. I used hand held scanners to accurately locate products, and adjust quantities."
good,"Besides being a rep and selling a good product, I enjoyed helping customers in professional environments.  I was responsible for my own inventory and re-ordering of products and visual merchandising."
good,"not  a bad place to work. very laid back. culture is decent, work is relatively easy, a good job to lose wieght in. "
good,"Can be a fun yet productive work environment. Has decent working schedule hours Monday through Friday, weekends off. Great health benefits for full time associates."
good,"I come to work for the people. The starting pay is very poor. Some have said it can take 2+ years to get full time. You are expected to do a lot, for very little money. If you can get hired into a department, you will earn more money. Co-workers are great."
good,the customers make the job. you couldn't sit somewhere and think up the stuff people ask you.in the same day you could teach a senior citizen how to install a water heater themselves while a group of guys wait for your help to build a 12 foot three stage beer device and all the while there is a 3 year old that's fascinated by a plunger stuck to the floor. just remember its a big box store and most of the decisions are made by someone far away. it just makes the wheels of change turn very slowly.
good,this is a good company to work for it just seem to take so many years to come up and they say they are a family company but they do not excuse proven absences for children being sick or in the hospital/
good,"My typical day at work would be taking  in deliveries, checking out customers, answering the phone, working the rentals, and also doing phone sales. Most of the time I'm working at a very fast pace. I love customer service and being able to work with different personalities. We work as a team and make sure the job gets done."
good,"Employees were awesome, related to some and befriended a few of them. Most non managers were young and talkative. All of us at the store were productive especially when we worked together. Managers were great as well, except some were a bit too demanding (not all) some expected me to perform multiple tasks in a very small time window. Overall was great, friends compensated for demanding tasks."
good,Weekends are the best. Great co-workers.You are told everyday in the morning meeting to have fun and give great customer service.
good,"Have the right idea but sometimes have trouble executing. Great people but have difficulty accessing skills those who can and those that won't.  Compensation is not based on performance, contributions to bottom line, or ability."
good,"Fun place to work, good employees and staff. Very supportive CEO's with good benifits and bonuses, but I left because staff turned over at my location. Managment was awesome and got fired for a stupid reason and management went down hill becoming very hard on all good staff making many good employees quit. I love the compnay and their intentions and know they will weed out bad seeds sooner or later but I moved on."
good,At Zaxbys Everyone Was Friendly & Easy To Work With. There Was Times When Ive Needed Help Or Others & The Managers Was There To Help You With No Problems.
good,The Home Depot was a fine job. Good hours and decent pay with opportunities to move up if you decide to pursue a position within their company.
good,"Typical day at work would be Mondays, that is the time the store manager tour the store to see that items are on the shelf, and also where things have to be. However, i learned how to put customers first,and how to accomplished task within minimum time. I also relate well to co-workers to achieved objectives,and the last but not the least the hardest part of the job is deal with customers, and in the same  vein is fun when you have antidote to their problems."
good,"The people you work with are nice. Being hired on and being promoted take a while so hang in there. The store manager is great. You will learn a lot. Your experience is in your own hands. Work hard and do your job, you will like it here."
good,"I work with a good team of people in my department. Together we help assist customers with their projects, or any item they might need to obtain. This includes but not limited to the following; getting pallets of product down via fork lift or reach, searching our online inventory to find a certain product and its location, and asking specific questions to better understand which type of pesticides to administer to the customer."
good,Great Company to work for. Learned something new everyday. Enjoyed helping customers and solving problems. Company has great benefits and profit sharing. My coworkers became a family.
good,"associates are good to work with, learned a lot in business and people skills while I was there. Management needs to be on the same page of the business."
good,home depot is a great place to work. it has a great assortment of people thast are great to be around. The job is very physical and hard on your body but the people make it worth it.I take boxes off a divert and scan them and depending on the labels is what pallet i put it on. I build pallts that fit the pallet are eight feet tall and can survive the drive to stores farther out.
good,I learned a lot about data entry/ and also shipping and receiving. RTV was not a simple job but I did learn something new every day.
good,Working here was a fun learning experience. learning different fields and working with a great management team. Not a great starting pay wage but you can work your way up. get good bonuses and great benefits.
good,"bookkeeping, making change orders, deposits, special services, will calls, special orders, assisting customers over the phone, cashiering, and taking payments over the phone."
good,"Typical morning Is doing the morning reports make sure all orders are there for when customer pick them up. Have to call customers for their online, will calls and special orders."
good,"good decent place to work, would recommend it for a part time job.  I was full time, easy to move up just gotta learn the phone things."
good,Was a great job for the long run. Training was fast and easy. Everyone in the work place is friendly and whiling to give a helping hand.
good,"Enjoyed the co-workers and Supervisors, Felt rewarded when helping customers with issues or placing orders. Very positive word atmosphere"
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that didn't know what they were really looking for to do their job. "
good,"Open the registers in the morning and get the store ready for the customers. Get the first employee on the registers going, help  customers in the isles. Next, check drinks, candy and the buckets stocked. Give breaks and lunches to checkout employees.  Then, work on the paperwork and help out customer service with the customers."
good,"my typical day consists of receiving freight and unloading and stocking merchandise. It is at times very stressful and physically demanding. The managers at Home depot are, for the most part very caring and helpful. I have good relations with my co workers since there are very few of us who work overnights."
good,A typical day of work started out with a sales meeting. We then received our leads for the day. After getting leads we proceeded to all appointments for that day. I learned quite a bit for such a short time. Management was always very fair and willing to work with me. My co-workers were all extremely nice and very helpful as well. The hardest part of my job was the travel with no guarantee of a sale in a commission only job. The most enjoyable part was meeting new and sometimes very interesting people on a daily basis.
good,"Had a positive experience worked for Wal-Mart for 3 years and staff was very friendly and supportive. I left on good terms max wage was 8.72 in 2007, although it is a stressful job sometimes the company over works their employees routines."
good,"Great place to work, management is great, the employees are good to work with but the pay SUCKS.  You cannot make a decent living there unless you live in a trailer, unfortunately many do live in trailers or subsidized housing (over 55).  The corporate culture is positive and they care about their employees, they offer benefits and other things to even part time employees.  If you want to make a career there is that possibility but it will be tough.  Pay raises are only 35 to 65 cents an hour if they come yearly.  The way to make more is too apply as a supervisor AFTER your yearly increase.  In all it's a fun place but I should have applied to COSTCO..."
good,"Great training , love the people I severed, loved getting to drive the heavy equipment . love working with all the staff menbers"
good,I know I don't want to work at home depot any more.. Ever were you go there are good people and bad people. I know it might be hard top find. Treat every one the same. Here if they didn't like you would work in garden. They open garden in march till end dec. There were times when I would ask to work outside.
good,"Great place with amazing co-workers to work with on a daily basis.An environment that contains a lot of fun activities for associates, social committees, and team players who are there to help aid you on day to day tasks."
good,Great team work ethics with great customer friendly work ethics. Very fun crew with fast paced work flow in such a busy area. Management. did not work with me when I had a personal life event occur.
good,I working with customers on a daily basis I was able to improve my inter-personal skills. Unfortunately I had to deal with less than desirable technology to complete my daily tasks which caused my customers too much non-productive time.
good,"Home depot is a great place for a college students to work, and great for a second job. Career wise this isn't the place to be."
good,there is always something to do at The Home Depot. You will always be engaged in doing some sort of activity or task. co- worker are always willing to help when you ask them. everyone is friendly
good,"I went to work for Home Depot as a seasonal/part time employee. It turned out to be a pleasant place to work. Management (all levels) actually looked after all employees, including the seasonal people. Employees are encouraged to learn about all products carried; time was provided for developing product knowledge. The more difficult part of working for Home Depot involved constantly walking on concrete floors; this does go with the territory. The constant activity, meeting people and their dogs was one of the perks of the job."
good,"I loved seeing the different customer's come over to me for help. I didn't get a chance to get to know my co-workers very well, but the ones I did meet with were very very helpful. This environment was quieter compared to previous ones, and didn't require more than one person at the designated area for paint. Hardest part of this experience was sirring the paint. The most emjoyable part of it was I was able to provide customer care resolution without help from management."
good,Not a bad company work life balance could be better however it is not terrible. There is room for growth but it may require you to change stores if your serious about moving up the ladder. Good culture can be a revolving door especially if they bring you in as seasonal. Management could be a lot better.
good,"its hard if you got school, but the people you work with are incredible and understandable I would recommend this job to anyone it isn't the hardest and it pays well."
good,Everyday was busy so my shifts went by faster than expected. Ive learned a lot having went through 5 supervisors my first 2 years. The hardest part of the job was learning the new supervisors and rules changing so frequently. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and watching the smile as well as them showing appreciation for your helping hand.
good,"I have learned how to use a standup and sit down forklift, reach truck, clamp, and electric pallet jack. I enjoyed working here and training new employees on the machinery was also a plus."
good,"It's ok, climate is a big problem but the customers are the best. The best part of my job is seeing the smiling contractors faces as I assist them."
good,I enjoy going to work and associating with my co-workers and a couple of my ASM's as well as helping  my customers. The hardest part of the job is there is not enough time to get everything done but the best part is the help I can provide to my customers. They ROCK!!!!
good,"Opening and closing, manage productivity including hours. Assist customer and follow up with associate to ensure proper stocking and customer  follow-up."
good,"great teamwork at the job, hours get vary busy around 11 to 5 overall it is good just don't have the Time to live your life.if you want to work here at homedepot make sure you have good selling skills"
good,"The Home Depot does have a great job culture and is a strong business. However, I felt I would easily be able to advance, considering the fact I have a college degree."
good,"A day in paint can be very busy through out the year. I have  learned to work with all types of customers. The good out way the bad.  Also, co-workers will help you  when needed.  It's a fast-paced position at times. The hardest part of the job is when I know the customer is on a fixed income.  The customer wishes to paint four rooms and can only afford two. That's when my experience comes into play using all resources that are readily available to me as an associate.  If there is a sale, oops paint, or Dept. Head, I will get the job done quickly and make sure the customer feels confident with the purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers come back  into the store and thank me.   It is a very rewarding feeling for me!"
good,"Great co-workers and managers, all are very friendly and caring."
good,"Scheduled for 11 hours a day, 5 days a week. There's an unspoken requirement to work beyond your schedule and possibly on days off, depending on sales. Great place to work however, if your very driven,"
good,"•	Strong design knowledge of restaurants and commercial kitchens."
good,Good People to work for.  Sometimes stressful but always willing to listen to employees and teach their employees new skills.
good,The company is truly dedicated to the satisfaction of their customers. Entry level pay isn't promising. However the do advance employees.
good,"I would love to work, to work for them again, in the same position, maybe as the lead.working as a plumbing associate, I gain a lot of knowledge in the retail business.."
good,"Management should listen more about employee complaints, otherwise the work environment becomes hostile and unfriendly to coworkers."
good,I enjoy my job it is actually a great working place.I been the for 3 year and became an operational supervisor. It is a great place to learn responsibility and gather work experience.
good,I enjoy working here. I am just looking for something with more hours and better wages. The managers are all nice. They have different incentives for showing employees how much they are appreciated.
good,"It was pretty good to work there, never boring because there was always something to do and for retail the customers weren't terrible."
good,"This is a good company for the most part. The benefits are great and the majority of the people are awesome to work with. The downside though is if you want to set your schedule in any way you cannot have full time status. Advancement is rough because it usually only comes along when a manager leaves, so it could be every couple years or more."
good,"Home Depot is a fast and sometimes chaotic retail store. they are mostly concentrated on customer service, being in-stock, and trying to keep the stores clean. You learn a lot about basic household fixes and new innovative products. Some management are really good to work with and others seem to only care about themselves. Your typical Co-workers are either folks right out of school either college or Highschool (must be 18 and older) or people who are retired and just looking for something to keep them busy. Hardest part of the job are the conflicting assignments given as a lot of the assignments are in direct contrast to what the company is actually trying to achieve. Advancement in the company is entirely up to you and if you can badger management into giving you a chance."
good,"Things are not consistent.  Maybe for a few months, but once someone new comes in they feel the need to change absolutely everything and it is just crazy."
good,"excellent site to show yourself.work ethics are questionable if you have to rely on fellow coworkers attitude and lack of to get your job done efficiently"
good,"al llegar teníamos la junta diaria para discutir sobre los objetivos del dia, eso me ayudo a aprender a comunicarme con mis compañeros."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and working with the company. I learned many new skills working with the company. It showed me different elements I needed to assist different type of needs for customers.
good,On any day I could work many different shifts . When I go in I am on a register the entire time . I learned to use the cash register. The co workers were all very helpful and friendly . The hardest part of the job was standing when it was slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers .
good,On boarding is not done very well. Depending on the manager you get you are set up for failure. Huge turnover at this specific location. Longest tenured Ops Manager 4 years and Supervisor 4 years. One of each. All others are new to their position and are still figuring it out for themselves. Lots of micromanaging. Fellow coworkers do not work as a team and do a lot of backstabbing. This is not company-wide just at this location. Home Depot in all is a very good company to work for.
good,"typical day at work is pleasant "
good,"The Home Depot helped mold me into a better leader and improved my knowledge on home improvement that I now use in my every day life. It also has helped me learn to take on multiple tasks at once, prioritizing them, then attacking each situation with a game plan that ensured the work would be completed in a timely manner. I also helped my supervisor train new employees to quickly learn how to engage in a fast paced environment that helped them excel. During my time in appliances, certain situations helped me understand how to engage with multiple customers at once, but also listening and asking inquiring questions to get a better understanding to as what works best for them. One of the most important things I've learned during my tenure at The Home Depot is there are different strokes for different folk and realizing what may have helped a customer in the past, may not be the scenario for everyone. Thus, everyone should be provided with their own unique customer service."
good,I enjoyed working here in a new space that was created to support directors. It gave me a chance to obtain new experience.
good,"When I first started at The Home Depot, I did not know anything about appliances except for the ones in my student house and at my parents'. With the proper training, I received the title of Appliance Specialist and was able to help customers make informed decisions on what to buy for their homes. It was a very rewarding experience knowing that I was helping young adults a few years older than myself, to retired couples over the age of 65 make decisions that so significantly impacted their lives. Especially when I was, at the time, only 22 and without a home of my own. I took pride in the fact that I was able to educate myself in my department, and pick up home-owner tips from others as well. With the help of my supervisors and other managers, I was able to receive the right training and guidance to become an informed associate who could provide excellent customer service. I really enjoy working with the rest of my appliance team, as we communicate so well on things from customer issues to delegating tasks and providing any extra knowledge. Staying on top of constantly updating information is the most difficult part of the job, as I have to know about it before the customer so that I can relay the best and most current information to them. I always enjoy the feeling of completing a big sale, knowing that the customer left happy having gotten what they were looking for, and that I was able to positively affect the company's bottom line."
good,"I was a Customer Service Worker and I was Always kept Outside Maintaining A Parking Lot full of Carts, making sure they were always available to Customers who were coming into the store, my room for advancement in the company wasn't very slim whats so ever. I enjoyed working with my Co-workers and they always knew what I was capable of doing on a daily basis."
good,"Working for Home Depot is a great experience. Generally everyone has alot of buy in on the company's values and vision. However, making the switch from the stores to corporate office is difficult. No relocation and pay is less than what is industry standard for what i was asked to do. Also, though there is alot of opportunities and roles for my desired field, the path to getting them is too linear to be desireable."
good,"I worked in the seasonal dept. very busy in the summer, had a great staff, and enjoyed working with them."
good,"My time at Home Depot was spent extremely well even though I was only a temp worker. A typical day at Home Depot consisted of helping customers and when the store closed, cleaning up and front facing the isles along with down stalking. While working at the Home Depot I learned a lot about customer service and how to use problem solving skills. From dealing with an anger customer or having a display not work, you just had to keep a level head and roll with the punches. Working with the management there was a pleasure because every time I had a question or issue with something, I could easily go talk to someone and that also went along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would have probably been the fact that some people are just really hard to please, customer wise. The best part of the job would have probably been the great environment they offered."
good,"This job taught me a lot about home improvement and dealing with customers. every day you problem solved for your customers to give them the best deals and shopping experience. learn from your co-workers and you will do fine at this job. the hardest part may be the problem solving, sometimes you can't give them everything."
good,"This is a very good job with great benefits and pal, several employee incentives, Management needs improvement in Attitude with employees and better communications skills"
good,"I worked nights and the main office would turn off the swap coolers making it the work place exceptional humid. Nothing management could do to over ride the system. Controls were in Atlanta. Good work out+ sweat= weight lose if you were over weight, which i was not. I enjoyed the people i worked with & left on good terms."
good,Culture varies on department. If you leave before 5:30 pm it is frowned upon. My boss sits in the cube behind me. The compensation is great but when you get promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job is the overall company culture. You really do bleed orange. Management could be better.
good,"Fast changing, every day is a new obstacle a new adventure. the co-workers make it fun, a strong team environment both associates and leadership teams are engaged."
good,The computer training was really easy. Going into work I made sure my area was clean and flat stacked. Finding customers in need of help was easy.
good,On a daily basis the main goal is to provide customers with excellent customer service. I learn the specifics of retail as well as how products make there way from distributor to the customer.
good,"In a normal day, I usually bring shopping carts and toddler carts into the corral in the entrance of the store. When called for loading assistant, I go there immediately assist someone (most likely customers) to the best of my ability. Other task I can do is help associates move returns to their respective aisles, getting propane, work at the contractor parking lot (if I have another Lot Associate working today), assist self-checkout, use the intercom to assist customers, and take out the trash."
good,"I like going into work to be around the friends I have made there.  If you are a hard worker, it is usually noticed, but sometimes the work load is unevenly balanced depending on management.  Will work with your time off requests."
good,Steadily work pace. Great team players. Good Safety equipment provided. Water was always available in the building. Fair management and team leaders.
good,"Started my day by Night recovery of product in garden area. I learned many gardening aspects. The management and co-workers were always helpful in learning rules and regulations. The hardest part of job was knowing it was only a seasonal job, but the up side was learning new people."
good,loved going because of the customers and I love to help people. the employees were very helpful and friendly. the scheduling sucks and the managers are disrespectful
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers, setting up merchandise, cleaning the work area for customers and feed and watering all plants. I learned how to handle different situations such as a customer yelling at me and how to handle those different situations. My management was awesome, always gave credit where credit was due and was always interacting with the associates. My coworkers love me and I love them. We where a huge family always looking out for each other. I would have to say rude customers was the hardest part of the job because they would like to get in your face and tell you how you where wrong and how you didn't know your job but in all reality it was more than likely because either we ran out of a certain product or didn't carry that product in stores. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my job. I take pride in getting to know my jobs."
good,"Home Depot is great place to work, unfortunately that not the career path that I want take in life. If i could move up into a corporate position i would gladly take the job offer."
good,I enjoyed the guidance and support of the management and co-workers.  I especially enjoyed helping the customers in all the departments.
good,"A great store, it taught me a lot of material. Many different department which promotes team work. Hardest part would be long hours and always being short staffed. Most enjoyable part was the friendly staff and everyday teaches something."
good,"It was a good place to work but the managers play favorites with promotions, the people I worked with were great, but management sucks"
good,"A great job with even greater benefits. The typical day consists of a morning meeting making sure every one is caught up on the sales and events of the week, followed by mandatory stretching. The only down side to this job is the self entitled contractors that treat every one as if they owe them for being such loyal home depot shoppers. Other than that, it is a great place to work!"
good,Working with the associates was what made the day go by very easy. If you love to interact with the customers and with people on a daily basis this is the place to be. Most of the management team are very helpful and the interaction with the people is amazing.
good,"This is a decent place to work, they start you out at minimum wage or above depending on position. Part timers get 20 hours vacation their first year, can contribute to 401K, and make great connections."
good,"I enjoy the people that I work with. My supervisor is fair, my team is productive and fun to work with.  The sales associates on the store side are cooperative and we all work well together."
good,"Home Depot was a relatively good place to work. The pay was decent for an entry level, skill-less job, and the environment was usually friendly and supportive."
good,"I learned great customer service skills, attitude towards customers, and the balance of work and home. The most enjoyable part was the events for promotions and associate appreciation days."
good,"Learned skills in coordinating multiple projects at once, also managing people."
good,Hard to work and take a full semester of classes. Too many late nights and weekend got in the way of school work. Showed up to work and was forced to learn something new everyday.
good,"hard working environment, helping customers comes first, nice co worker, hardest part of the job is putting up with customers that think they're always right, although i am excellent at handling such situations."

good,"I've been with HD for over 14 years and love working with the customers and employees!  I'm a Head Cashier and get the opportunity to manage the front end and cashiers.  It is very rewarding to gain the knowledge and friendships/acquaintances.  As always, it is retail and that can be challenging at times.  There are fires to put out and people to keep happy!"
good,"I loved my time there, made a lot of friends. The pay was great, but the hours and some of the lower level management leave alot to be desired."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers, prepared sales,  and managing store front and drive through environment. The management was great and provided good employee training. The co-workers were very friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was the pace, and ensuring all orders were successfully completed, meeting the needs of the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with customers and working in a positive work environment."
good,"As I would walk into work on an opening day, I would check for safety concerns overhead and spill kits throughout the store. Opening my department by purging the tint machines, and getting an inventory cart, from there I was able to replace price tags and order inventory. I was directly involved with managing several employees in my department. One of the best parts of the job was custom color matching for customers"
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work,  Co-workers all seemed to enjoy being part of a ""team"" to guarantee customer satisfaction.  I started out as a Cashier and moved to Bay Integrity Associate.  Home Depot did away with that job and moved me into Shipping/Receiving.  I was responsible for doing daily scans of product within the stock that was out of stock.  Also moved product from receiving to shelf placement.   The hardest part of the my job was switching from working 4am - 10 am to going in at 9 pm and working til 2 or 3 am.   The most enjoyable part of my job with Home Depot was the ""family"" atmosphere among all my co-workers."
good,"My typical work day was to see that all my associates were assigned to their respective depts. Place my orders for product."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, serving customers and loading their purchases for them.  My co workers were like family, there was very little I didn't like. However, after about a year, we got an entirely new management team in, and this made it difficult, Procedures were changed, and the tone in store became very tense.The most enjoyable part of the day is when we got busy! I loved the pressure and customers!"
good,"My typical day consists of refunding returned merchandise, completing quotes for customers both online and in person.  Assisting in online orders and ordering."
good,Home Depot Was A Great Expierence For Me. A Typical Day At The Home Depot Is Knowing That Once You Clock In You Surrounded With Your 2nd Family. As Well As Becoming Familiar With Customers And Their Desires When They Visit The Stores. I Learned That Team Work Can Make A Dream Work. It Shows A Group Of People Coming together To Fulfill The Vision Of A Company As A Whole. I Would Say The Hardest Part Was Knowing That Sometimes The Customers Was Going to have To Leave Un Satisfied.
good,"set up the shift by assigning associates to where I know they will succeed in the department, sign out the packets to the associates, unload trailers, receive trailers if needed and work on CRTV's to send out for repairs and help set up the other departments."
good,"Take inventory of customer orders. Management is always there, however can be incompetent. Lack of coverage on the sales floor on a daily basis."
good,have fun working for them but the money it was not that good for all the fuction you are subject to.every day everything is differnt you are suppost to now all departments
good,I would say it's great working here however there is no work life balance. It is very difficult to spend time with family and friends with the crazy schedule.
good,"Clean workplace, teamwork among associate are great, need improvement in communication and benefits, planograms are well organized, fair on scheduling"
good,"I have spent almost 5 years with The Home depot and I have truly enjoyed it. From the people that I work with, to the customers that come into the store. I have found that building relationships with my customers and peers has grown myself as an individual and with the business as well."
good,It is a great job within a fast-paced work environment. This job requires you to be able to change gears quickly and work as a team.
good,"Pretty okay Place to work, Could have issued out more hours and they ended up laying off the whole freight flow team but besides that its a nice place"
good,"Its a nice store to work in. people are nice to work with and the customers are good people. Management is very good, they know what they are doing and run and operate the store very effectively. At this job i learned alot about what customers look for and how they like to be treated. I also learned alot about gardening,plants, tools for the home, painting etc. Hardest part of the job would probably be the concrete floors on your feet, and heavy lifting, and dusty air. The best part of the job was the people i worked with, i grew very close to them."
good,"Very demanding work pace but not unbearable. Friendly coworkers made it feel like a family environment. Management needs work though on sensitivity and racial profiling,"
good,"I was a Appliance Sale Specialist. Was trained on all the high end products, and felt management really care that you well trained. You waited for customers, and if they needed help that's when you find out their needs, and fit a package together that was suitable for their price range. When your division was slow you went to help other employees."
good,"During the course of a day I sell merchandise as well maintain appliance show room.  I have contact with lot of repeat customers, this helps them feel comfortable in a retail setting."
good,"I love being able to casually talk to the customer's. Plus I learn little tricks along the way from another's personal experience, I research the facts before recommending it to others."
good,"This field consist of many different links to keep this store operating as one of the best in the southeast division. This taught me the true value of proper customer service and hoe that could shape the face of your business. Though management was difficult at times due to the fluctuation of different members, the relationships established through coworkers is still ongoing. The most difficult part was dealing with high traffic quotas to meet during certain times of a fiscal year. The best parts were the rewards for meeting these requirements and the payoff for  doing so."
good,"I love what the company does for their associates through the Homer Fund and they definitely do their best to promote helping the community and customers by all means possible.  It's up to each store to take the initiative, though."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits for full-timers.  Could encounter crazy hours.  Advancement always in reach.
good,"The Harriman NY Home Depot. "
good,"Hmmmmmm............... days were fast, some early mornings, unreasonable supervisor, many complications with closings, attendance system was unlogical and stupid to be honest, many complaints from co-workers about management, etc"
good,I did not like being micromanaged. CEO during my tenor was not  well liked. My co-workers were great to be around. The rotating shifts are not for people with families.
good,My current employer Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. A side from the typical issues that can be found on any job it's highly regarded in my opinion. Just need to up the pay rate.
good,home depot is a great company that forgot department heads and asm need adequate time  to train employees as opposed to completing coverage of departments
good,"I would come check inventory for products that needed to be ordered, make sure that all top selling items were down stocked and shopable for customers. Then I would give whatever direction was needed to my associates to complete daily tasks. I learned that being a manager was more than just telling people what to do. All of my co-workers were friendly and helpful with helping me transition to home depots systems from lowes. I didn't find anything about the job particularly hard. Working in a group invironment is always enjoyable."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"The best thing about the Home Depot is that the work schedule is very flexible for students! Generally, I found the atmosphere to be very positive, and there is lots of opportunity to learn new things."

Assist co-workers and managers in new on coming projects with in the store. The hardest part will be getting dirty on the job. The most enjoyable would be co-workers and meeting new people."
good,Great Training and support which keeps the company objective and customer care initiative moving smoothly. Overall great company to work for.
good,I really love working at Home Depot. Everything about how the company is structured has a common core of high morality and integrity. The only negative is that most employees are only given the opportunity to have a part- time job with the company.
good,"Management is supportive and associates are very helpful."
good,"Great place to work, with part-time benefits and diversified staff being a bonus. Typical day at work involves setting-up contractor displays to better promote their products.  In addition, cleaning shelves and restocking as well.  Heavy customer assistance and product knowledge is maintained.  Hardest part of this job is lifting 30+ lb steel beams. Enjoyable part is maintaining close working relationship with fellow workers."
good,"Typical day: Madness "
good,"•	Administer, combined budgets of more than $3.5 million, including production, warehousing, and shipping."
good,The home depot was a great place to work although I worked there for some time it became frustrating when they would not hire me on as full time. They would make me work full time hours but I would not get the benefits of a full time employee.
good,The Home Depot was a fast paced work environment. I would usually be on the Cash Registers ringing people up. I would sometimes change areas. Sometimes it was returns and other times i would be in garden.
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting customers with our knowledge of fashion. Management did not acknowledge the hard work of employers or award them. The hardest part of the job was to maintain areas assisted with the mass of people in the stores.
good,"As part of the management team you were able to learn and apply every aspect of running a business.  Advancement  was available to associates.  As a salaried manager, work/life balance was difficult due to the changes in scheduled days per week and the amount of scheduled hours per day. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was that every day was different and the ability to be able to make a positive impact in the lives of the associates and customers."
good,Worked Monday through Friday starting at 6 am. Finished at 2:30 pm. Made sure that all signage for items were correct. Cleaned and reset certain sections per corporate standards. Learned how to balance time between certain responsibilities during the course of the day. Prioritized tasks per management structure. Management was okay. Coworkers were okay. The things I did not like were climbing on a ladder to clean items out of easy access and travel involved during the holidays for setup of winter items and Christmas shops.  The job was okay if you like the steady daylight hours in a retail environment.
good,Great Environment and great leadership. As long as you are a great team member this is the right place for you. Generally the customers are caring and easy to talk to. You have a great chance in learning more than you thought you would after the first week.
good,"I worked for the Inglewood Home Depot on the Freight Team for about two years and I enjoyed it very good place to work excellent first ""job"""
good,Friendly management who help you with time off and fun to work there.
good,"I loved the fast paced, problem solving part of my job. i tried to make a difference in every person i helped or meet. But cutting of hours wasnt helping me out"
good,"Home Depot has done a lot for me as far as helping me out when I was in a rough spot. The company itself is great to work for. They really do care about their associates and customers. Each establishment is different, some have horrible managers, some don't. You have to suck up to the bosses to be even considered to be full time and to go up in positions is even harder. There are all types of people in a job like Home Depot. I learned to be a sales associate and give excellent customer service here. I also learned to be a cashier here. It's an overall good, not great place."
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting customers locating merchandise, explaining how certain products work or recommending alternatives, cutting lumber, loading customer's cars. Depending on the amount of foot traffic making its way through the store i will assist on a cash register as a back up cashier. "
good,Great place to either start a career or simply work part time while you do other things as well. Expect at times hectic schedules and demands by both customers and management.
good,"Typical day at work- running a $51 M/ per year business..."
good,this place has a lot to offer if you show up do whats asked and go home youll do just fine.i wish i could go back. the reason i left was performance punishment
good,"I love working with Home Depot! I am a people person and enjoy working as a team. As a cashier, I get to help people locate needed items, answer questions, and work in different cashier stations within the store. All management is approachable and willing to help associates when needed. There is a feeling of camaraderie among employees which makes working enjoyable."
good,Benefits and hours were excellent but I found other employment.
good,"A typical work day includes running reports on sales, orders, out of stocks.  Going over open sales orders and calling customers to find out what their concerns are and seeing what we can do to close the sale.  Working with management to merchandise the store as well as taking care of any issues regarding installs or special orders.  Working with co-workers to maintain the store to top standards."
good,"Very busy environment, great managers/supervisors"
good,"The job itself is great! The people are great! The communication between management and associates not so great! Too many chiefs!"
good,"A typical day at my job is both rewarding and challenging.  I manage a department that receives thousands of pieces of freight daily whose charge is to get every piece onto the shelves or in the overheads and leave no freight behind in receiving.  I manage a difficult process that changes in an instant and can become more or less complicated at any time throughout my shift.  "
good,the hardest part of this job was the the lifting of heavy items and equipment.
good,"One day i'm working overnight with co-workers and we have a slightly huge truck and there was only 4 people present at the time. We started working, moving as fast as we could, and other co-workers were scheduled to come in about 3 hours later than those that were present and when they got to work to help with the truck, not only did the pace pick up, but everyone was on one accord and we got the job done quickly. I learned the more help you have, the more get done and having the same goal helps to achieve that goal. The co-workers were great. Fun to work with and hard workers. The store and employees was well managed. Managers and supervisors always made sure everyone was informed with daily tasks and projects. The Hardest part about the job is not having something to do. Your always busy and that's a probably the most enjoyable part about the job as well"
good,"Some preset appointments providing an opportunity to help Home Depot customers re-design and update their kitchens. A typical call consist of learning the customers needs, wants and desires regarding their kitchen. From there I would inspect their kitchen area, offer design suggestions, show various cabinet design and color options, explain the value of a kitchen reface over painting or a full kitchen update and finally close the appointment with an order."
good,"back in my days my store grossed about 2 million a week, un heard of in todays big box society and very competitive in nature there was tons  of promotions happening at the time and people where at the time and people were becoming very wealthy"
good,"the home depot is a very productive and fun place to work, my co workers are excellent and management is cool. the hardest part of the day is getting the store presentable for the customers. the most enjoyable part of the day is helping the customers and to make sure they have the right products they will need to improve their home."
good,I have fun working in the workplace and working witch customers. I also learn a lot from the work I do and from customers experience with the appliances they purchase.
good,"I must admit I did truly enjoy my job, helping customers with their questions, being able to fix something for a customer, helping them to better understand the credit card ststements. Every day ws a learning experience either from the wonderful associates I worked with to the customer that needed a battery in their flashlight."

good,"Love working with the people, have learned many new things in the vault, returns and on the sales floor."
good,I wasnt there for long due to enlistment but its definitely a company that has a lot of culture looking to assist their employees.
good,Well cashier position is very laid back.  Not much to do but stand there. I get along with co-workers so that makes a fun place to work. I'm a very active person so it is hard to be in one place. Opportunity to advance is hard.
good,Nice co workers good bosses nice break rooms learned a lot about the home depot gotten a few lic. over all a good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to learn something new everyday and to better my customer service quality each day. I learned to always keep calm and put yourself in the customers shoes because you never know what that person might be going through that day and how your actions may affect the out come for the customers feelings. The hardest part of the job is when you come to work and a new rule is going to take place, sometimes you have to explain the change to the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you provided the best customer service and creating a bond with your work family."
good,Hardest part of the job was to deal with always being under staffed
good,"I get to work with customers on a daily basis.  My team and I work well with others and my boss is very easy to work for.  The hardest part of my job would be when I am unable to help a customer with their questions.  Overall, I enjoy the work I do and meeting and helping new customers every day."
good,"I would go back to this company if offered an opportunity."
good,"After about a year and a half, I am in my fourth department. If I hadn't been given so many opportunities, I honestly wouldn't know how management felt about me. Typically the only time you know how you're doing is if you're messing up. I feel I work too hard for what I get paid but over all don't mind the work. It is a nice place to work and gain knowledge and experience but not somewhere I would hope to stay and build a career."
good,The customers make the job worth doing. Hours are cut if sales are down. Fast paced and lots of walking.
good,"hours are good, good place to work friendly management and co workers."
good,"Cashier, greeting and cashing out customers"
good,Great benefits and job security. Opportunity for advancement is pretty high. Job can be very stressful and pay is far too little for the amount of work that I am required to do
good,"Home Depot has a lot of great learning opportunities and fair benefits.  The only concern with it is after witnessing the transitions between Store and Assistant Managers, the morale and the behavior of individuals in the store gradually changes.  There are some very specific individuals in several stores who allow and/or participate in inappropriate behavior and retaliation against others."
good,I like working with the people there. They are all very helpful. It is a great experience to learn different departments d know more of the product you retrying to sell.
good,Can be chaotic and unorganized and will work  you as hard as they can for little to nothing
good,hours come and go but the work environment is very click oriented
good,great place to work. meet new people. some nice some not so nice. but its a good place to work.
good,"Great hard working employees on the overnight team"

good,"it was a wonderful place to work but deteriorating working conditions, cleanliness, operable equipment, management had all gone down"
good,"A typical day for a lot associate is very rigorous and physically challenging. I gather all the buggies, help with loading assistants, sling bags of mulch, and haul lumber all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving building advice from local contractors. Our management team is fair. Could use bit more organization."
good,"you get to learn new things everyday, no day will be the same as yesterday there."
good,Being a Cashier I stand on my feet for several hours at a time. I wait on customers and check them out at the register.  I also process return transactions.  I assist customers when i'm not checking out their order.
good,A typical day would be started very early from contractors coming in buying all kinds of equipment. I learned about several different power tools and wood. Management was ok. The co-workers helped to assist in areas you did not have much knowledge about. The hardest part of the job was not knowing about certain tools and products if a guest asked for it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different customers.
good,"Activate cell phones, process payments, inventory management, great team."
good,A typical day at Home Depot consists of over 100 customers per cashier. There is never a dull moment. I learned other ways to help our customers and better my customer service. Management is extremely helpful but also hard to move in to. My co-workers at Home Depot are very friendly and helpful. I ask a lot of questions so I can learn about merchandise and what to do in certain situations. The hardest part of my job is the customers that you cannot just help. The customers that don't want your help but need your help and will test your patience I think is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part is getting to see and meet different cultures.
good,"typical work day is usually assigned to one department but end up helping out in other departments as well. i have learned about different nuts and bolts, power tools, how to mix paint, appliances, building materials.Management keeps changing. most of the co-workers are a pleasure to work with."

good,"opening shift I did the signing, freight and finish cleaning  up the department that wasn't done the previous night.Mangers were very helpful and fun to work with and my co workers were easy to get along with and work with. The hardest part of the job was working alone in a big department for a few hours trying to get everything done and helping customers."
good,"The company is constantly getting feedback from associates and customers, then acting on that info. Great training, fun events for customers and employees, plenty of recognition and praise."
good,The home depot really does offer a lot for the self motivated individual. I started as a cashier and moved into a supervisor position just after a year with the company. Its retail so you have a good mix of good and bad management that can and will change on a whim. Hands down the best thing about work for home depot are the people you meet. Being a supervisor for the home depot is one of the hardest positions in the company and takes a lot of patience and will power as there is a constant demand on you.
good,"Enjoyed working in the paint department, helping others to obtain all things needed for their projects."

good,Good and fun place to work at while helping customers and creating friendships with your coworkers.  You will learn what you need to know along the way.  Good but tedious computer training
good,I had so much fun working here the best part was making paint and stains the hardest part was some times you might work by your self and have 20 people in your line waiting for you to make paint and stains or just help but I had to get my manager to also help I learned training over the computer it was my favorite job there was lil supervision but it turn out good.
good,"loved this job, but management was unwilling to work around schedule changes and were unforgiving of needed time off. Built lasting relationships with customers. Get recognized everywhere you go as 'that girl from Home Depot'. Learned a lot of technical stuff about laying laminate floors and installing tile, etc. It will come in handy some time in the future."
good,"This is great company. Management really cares about their employees and ""Live Orange"" culture really grabs you by the arms."

good,There is mutual understanding and great cooperation between team members and management.
good,I started at home depot when I was 22 years old. Home Depot became my life and their way of promoting from within declaring you didn't need to have a college degree to become a store manager was intriguing to me. I served as a supervisor and customer service manager for five to seven years and was at the height of my career in Elmont NY.  I enjoyed socializing with the customers learning their projects they are embarking and paring them up with an expert of that department . I also enjoyed problem solving for customers with special order and installation issues.
good,"A typical day at Home depot usually starts with safety and walking your department. Then you restock the shelves and set up displays until prime shopping time, while serving customers.

When finished I help Pack Out Crew preparing store for ""Grand Opening"" appearance."

good,"The Home Depot Canada is a wonderful place to work. The people that you get to work with are great. The training that you receive is very thorough and the time spent on each employee is very generous. It is very impressive that a company this large can spend as much time and money on each of its massive number of employees. Even part time employees receive medical and dental benefits. I was pleasantly surprised when I worked there. Unfortunately, the pay cannot support a family unless you are one of the few who make it to upper management or you live in a low cost area of the world. (Definitely not enough pay to survive in BC) Also, the hours when you start are quite random so sleeping is basically a luxury. Overall though, you can do a lot worse than The Home Depot. I have a lot of respect for this company after working for them for almost a year."
good,long but fun day the day is never the same. customers will have you busy and the mangers are great very knowledgeable
good,"support big box store environment with providing materials and goods for customers"
good,a normal day at work was always something new to do a new challenge everyday and i love that
good,"The Home Depot has a very strong corporate culture of caring for their employees and the communities in which they live.  I would recommend The Home Depot to anyone looking for an employer who truly cares about its people.  The work is hard, but the opportunities for learning and advancement are the highest I have ever seen.  This is a company which invests in humanity."
good,"a good place to learn basic marketing and merchandising skills. professional management, although somewhat disconnected at tiems keeps a tight reign on time management . not much room for advancement and culture is great other than tolerance for medical emergencies."
good,"I would go to my department and walk it, pick up my ""to do"" list and work my way down.I'd then do things that I saw needed to be done. I learned how to manage my time with all that needed to be done. Management was on hand to answer any questions.My co workers were team oriented when needed.The hardest part of the job was never having a steady schedule.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer I helped leave happy and with a smile."
good,"basic day includes down stocking product, cleaning my department , setting up merchandise displays, and loads of customer service. while management is friendly enough they are not always direct with what they want from the employees. There is room for advancement ,however ,as with most retailers, compensation leaves much to be desired."
good,"Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. Home Depot prides itself on health and fitness, so there is a full service gym in the building and restaurants for every culture to enjoy. Home Depot also prides itself on diversity and that is also wonderful"
good,"There was nothing typical on a daily basis while working for this company.  I was listed as a cashier, but I was constantly rotated not only from different positions, but to various stores as well.  I learned many different attributes that allowed me to  multi-task in various positions. Management was awesome, but it always came down to the final say so of the acting GM. Most co-workers were lazy and did anything possible to avoid work, thus the reason I was constantly moved around.  Hardest part of the job was the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"prioritize my work load and check mark the important task"
good,Great company as a whole. Experience with superiors were not the greatest.
good,"Merchandising, maintaining a clean environment, providing excellent customer service, and ensure product knowledge both towards customers and co-workers."
good,"A typical day consist of confirming safety regulations are being followed as an opener and closer, providing the necessary product info to customers, conducting demos, arranging DIY classes, and merchandising."
good,Home Depot to me gave me an opportunity to work and grow as a person while assisting the public.
good,"after 19 years, I was off with a disability. during that time they claim they sent me a letter about returning to work. I never received that letter. I went to store manager and talked to him He said they sent a certified letter. Again I said I didn't  receive this letter and to give me a phone number where I could get a signed receipt of this letter. I have asked him for this number, and I still haven't received the phone number"
good,When I was working for Home Depot I was a as satisfied employee. I left the company before I was terminated. Because of my attendance I felt the need to do so. Home Depot is a great company when it comes to benefits. the staff and manager's are all team players.
good,"I enjoyed managing my staff as well as being responsible for inventory, ordering and mark downs."
good,this is a decent employer that will cut your position quickly to improve there stock.
good,Up early and schedule took me all over the valley to look and installs.  Spoke to passed clients and new clients.  Helped install crews with their needs during the day.  Working with the owner on anything else needed and covered for installer sick days.  Co-workers were great to work with and they worked hard.  Hardest part of the job was communication between what the store (Home Depot) would say to a client and the client not understanding what could and could not be done.
good,"A typical day at work would begin either opening the store or begin right on the floor of the store mid-day. Ive learned a lot of characteristics such as customer service, efficiency, communication skills, and professionalism. Management was friendly once you got to know them, but very conservative at the beginning. Co-workers on the floor with me were amazing. Friendly, helpful, and always willing to extend the helping hand when needed. The hardest part of the job was helping extreme amounts of customers as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the talk to customers, talk with co-workers, and help out customers one day at a time."
good,the home depot is a fun place to work if starting out with employment experiance. But their job training methods sucks everything is computer this computer that. not ideal place if looking for union job.
good,A Typical day at work consist of one person at the customer service desk and a cashier at a register. I have daily paperwork to complete along with yard checks and reservation reports to pull. I also hold the main line to the entire store so all telephone calls come to my desk and I direct them to the departments that they need to speak with. I assists customers with online orders and either place them for them or sign them out when they come into the store. I process returns with regular store merchandise or anything that was bought online and either ship to the customers' home or to the store. Some days I work in the shipping/receiving or delivery departments. There I am responsible for obtaining Key-rec numbers for the products shipped to our store. I count the merchandise and unload them off the trucks with the forklift of the reach truck. During a delivery day I pull any orders that the customers have placed and put the product on pallets to be picked up by our delivery driver. I handle paperwork showing our product going out of our inventory and makes sure the proper signage is completed.  I have learned just about every department in the store. I have learned to make relationships with my contractors and my everyday customers. The Management team is willing to let me work in different areas to learn new things. I enjoy my co-workers. Most of us have been there for a while and are like family. The hardest part of my job is I get pulled all over by different associates that need help but most of the time I am in the middle of something with another customer. Its fine but
good,I made some very good friends while working there. Management for the most part was good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and peers.
good,Nice job working on temporary/summer seasonal full time basis.  No job security.  Looking for better job opportunity.
good,Working at Home Depot as been an awarding experience. The benefits are really nice for a retail job and the starting pay is also really good.
good,"Though hectic I enjoyed being a cashier at the Home Depot."
good,"Days are never the same, moving around to different departments, gossip runs high, can earn awards and bonuses on checks."
good,"i worked 5 hr shifts and we had to put out the freight and put it up, i learned different equipment and costumer service skills. management was decent they was reasonable co-workers was helpful if you didn't know something you can count on some co-workers to help you out.the hardest part of the job was helping customers find items you never heard of or seen i enjoyed learning new things and new equipment"
good,"Store was extremely understaffed and management seemed apathetic to the problem. The lack of staff caused problems with long lines at check out and upset customers. This made the normal job of cashier much harder. "
good,"A typical day coming to work was knowing what my assignment was, going to my department to assist customers, on paint choices and making the paint up giving advice upselling on other products pertaining to paints. I learned a lot from the customers as well and the store over all. My coworkers were quite helpful there was one who stood out very much a gifted individual and consistent in all that he did it was a pleasure to work around him he was kind, considerate and educated and informative to me and the customers. Initially it was difficult getting the rhythm going and learning about the chemicals that were new to me, but I learned with the help of others. The Joy came when I was more confident of all that was going on the customers needing my assistance and the level of expertise that grew over time especially with the skilled one who taught me a lot. The employee who's name  I won't mention  It was a always a lot going on there very festive place to be at times. sometimes there were unwelcome things where customers would cause problems but I never felt unsafe or unease. I would always be able to go to the tutorials to educate myself on the updates and new product knowledge information it was to keep the mind fresh so that you could better service the customer."
good,"Me gusta ser dinamico, no me gusta estar quieto y siempre aspiro mejorar las cosas."
good,I liked interacting with the sales associates and customers. The only downside that i had a supervisor that was more concerned about his reputation than the well-being of his staff. I believe thats a wrong approach to supervising.
good,"Working the overnight shift at The Home Depot is tough, but you go home in the morning feeling like you accomplished an amazing feat.  There is a lot to be done in less than 8 hours to make the store ready for customers in the morning.  "
good,"As most companies tend to be, Home Depot is slow in recognizing the potential of new employees. Report card: Incomplete."
good,Customer Service. How to cut wood. Managers were good. Most co-workers were cool. Unloading trucks. Helping people.
good,"Overall good, people are fun and not to much stress."
good,"Coming into work every shift able to help serve customers, to the best of your ability."
good,"worked there for a few years, a good work environment with good people."
good,good work climate currently looking for additional work in the same area or any others that fit my credentials
good,"Unfavorable working scheduled, and not been able to satisfy customers need."
good,"a typical day is was busy, but I learned time management. My co-workers became my closest friends the hardest part was the temperatures and accuracy with the line moving so fast."
good,"Good environment to work."
good,great place to work the managers care alot for the people that work there.
good,"Enjoyed all parts of Home Depot,served many positions from reach truck operator to race track manager."
good,"Handling the check-out of large orders by customers and Pro customers while dealing with personal information and large amounts of cash. Co-workers are friendly and willing to help. Management is friendly to joke with and okay with helping to solve certain issues, but is not very caring about personal lives and are unwilling to sign on to a register to help customers check-out quickly at crowded times. Things that were learned were safety procedures, following store policies, learning about unfamiliar products and advertisements, how to upsell to customers, and another trait that was improved on was being friendly and personable to the general public, who are dealing with all sorts of moods and problems."
good,"The best part about working for The Home Depot is the people."
good,Great company to work for. Great managers and they really care about there associates
good,"I joined Home Depot in early May, as part of the MET Team. It took about a month after the interview to be hired but I started at a decent salary. The hours were early and took a lot to get used to (5-1:30), and there were two 30 minute breaks a day that you could pretty much take whenever you needed. "
good,"Easy and fun job, has very busy moments then really slow days."
good,"I love my job and the people I work with.We help each other as much as we can.I have leaned so much about lawn mowers,weed eater ,bug kills and much much more.Every day I answer lots of question,loud lot of soil and mulch,climb ladders and clean up the iles.The hardest part of my job is not getting enought hour so I can make a living.The best part is helping the customers get what they need .We also have great managers ,but they can not do anything to help use get more hour."
good,It was a good environment to work at and it gave me good experience in costumer service. Co-workers were fun to work with and was a simple job that was consistent everyday.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work I've learned so many things about plants , lawn care, pest control and patio furniture. for Ex: I didn't know that there are plants that last for years ( Perennials ) and plants that die off when the season ends ( Annuals ). I've met some great people in some of my co workers and even friends with some. Over all my time at the Home Depot has been pleasant, although I don't agree with some of the choices management has made when selecting new supervisors that don't have enough experience or maturity. The hardest part of my job would have to be working outside with the extreme humidity and blazing sun and the best part would be being able to provide exception customer service to a variety of customers."
good,"As a cashier, I was part of the front line of customer service. The management team was helpful, if you felt comfortable going to them. Most co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job, at first, was standing around all day. The best part were the connections made."
good,I worked at the Call center in Brandon that was closed due to outsourcing. Was a great place to work and make friends.
good,"My typical day is dealing with contractors, and ""do it yourselfers"" contractors know what they need for their jobs so I make sure they get everything loaded into their trucks (lumber, concrete, rebar, block, brick by hand or fork lift) the ""do it yourselfers"" need help in picking the right product for the job. maintainance of the department is a daily task. I have learned that even though I am female, I can work just as hard as any man with ease, I can do physically demanding manual labor, and i can delegate tasks in the absents on my supervisor. My co-workers are amazing workers, we all get along great. they are all extreamly hard workers and I really enjoy working with them. the hardest part of my job is working with people that look down on you because your female working in a male dominated department. I really enjoy the customer, most are a joy to help."
good,ok place to work great customers depending on the department your in you meet new people everyday great mix of people schedule is ok when it is written out three weeks in advance like it is suppose everybody experance will be different depending on the management team promotion is based on favortitism you can learn a lot if you apply yourself
good,Home Depot Is a good company to work for and is very Fair to it's associates
good,I learned a lot at my job. I served as a book keeper and a cashier. I got to view the store from many positions. I learned how to do business deposits. I made coin and cash tills. I look for over/short money for the store. I also learned the meaning of customer service. Working at the Home Depot for 10 months I acquired a lot.
good,I was a cashier. I loved this job! had great people and great environment. I learned people skills and how to mange money among other things. I had to leave here because of the management it was great at 1st but they soon changed the management and it was a horrible place to work. I loved the people and parties and things.
good,"I swear I grew up in a Home Depot.  As a child I believe we spent every weekend ""picking up one or two things"", so working for this company was like being reminded of my childhood everyday.  I loved the fun we had as a company and the service we were encouraged to provide to our customers.  Everyday was a learning experience that I was able to share with customers who needed help."
good,I've learned how to stock and about different products. Everyday is different because you never know what the customers may want. Everybody worked together mainly. Management was ok when it wanted to be. They were not really friendly not all of them. Most of the co-workers got alone and had cook-outs and pot lucks.
good,"Great place to work. Comfortable and flexible hours. On the job training. Friendly environment both customer and associate."
good,"• Bilingual Garden Associate."
good,I really enjoy working with the customers and other cashiers.  This is my first job working retail and I have been somewhat surprised at the lack of organization and the inconsistent instructions that come from working for a large company.
good,I love how the employees at Home Depot work together and are willing to help each other out. Helping customers is very fulfilling. Completing projects and learning about each department is challenging but also makes it worth while to work at Home Depot.
good,"Working in the garden department was an educational experience. I learned about different products in the department. During the time I worked there I learned how to mix paint, do special delieveries, and cashier. "
good,Home Depot was a great place to work.  lots of hard work but it was also fun.  The pay was not that great.  Management started to become more rigid as I was leaving.
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a good place to work. With constant regrouping and organizing, it is a great place for those who are retired or starting out in a work environment. My specific department has great supervisors with an understanding of work/life balance."
good,Supervisors have requirements of filing reports and reviews as well as covering shifts. required to work all shifts on rotation. Salary is at the bottom of scale for experience.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, but held back by management and corprate rules. Most employes are kept as part time because of not wanting to pay for health care, so the good, hard workers are punished becasue of new laws and the unwillingness of the company to have to provide health care for their loyal workers. It is an easy job with random, inconsistant schedules but a good working enviroment for a retail position. Occasionally run inefficiently, as the staff is bloated with part time workers and job advancement is practically unexistant unless you daily harass management and human resources about other open positions."
good,"The team works well together, We typically stocked the selves but sometimes had to unpack the pallets. I learned the forklift and cherry picker, management work with us on the time we could come in, my schedule was 8pm to midnight but could came in at six if I requested to. Co-workers were all friendly and cheerful and would help you if you had a problem. Maneuvering the forklift between merchandise and aisle gave me the most trouble, I didn't hit anything, it was just close. The people that I worked with and customer, I enjoyed them the most."
good,"Had an awesome time working there. If it weren't for a mistake on my part would still be there. Would also go there if they would take me back. Variable shifts, managers are people so each is different, had some good ones and some not so much."
good,"Overall, its a good place to work. My coworkers are professional and fun, Management is for the most part helpful and understanding, and the actual work is fairly enjoyable. "
good,"The training I took was totally different than what I experienced at the register..With the help of my co-workers I managed to get it down. I kept getting put at the ""broke register"" that's what the employees called it anyway...but I didn't really have any help, I didn't know anyone's name I was supposed to be introduced to everyone during ""orientation"" but that didn't happen...my supervisor never answered her phone when I needed something and I just didn't believe it was the place for me...it was a very good experience tho. "
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers, learned various thins from paint, electrical, freight, ect. "
good,"This work was continual flow of customer service both on the floor and on the phone, inventory maintenance and restocking. I became re-certified as a forklift operator with this job and continued to strengthen my customer service skills."
good,I loved working for Home Depot great team hours were long 11 hours per day 50-55 hours per week a lot of Nights and weekends but overall your retail job
good,"I love the interaction with the customers and contractors that I see on a daily basis, this is the most enjoyable part of my job is my customers.  have learned how to maintain relationships and accounts with customers, put a deck together and build a material list for a roof for a customer. "
good,"There are no typical days in retail, especially big box retail; everyday brought a different challenge, but the same result, job satisfaction and return on investment by providing excellent customer service. I learned to take care of the customer and take care of each other. Most managers that I have worked with shared my same drive and passion to build the business; some chose not to follow along and instead use their position as a negative persuasion to develop people. My co-workers became my friends; we worked together to build a common goal, to be the best people we could and build relationships with our customers. The hardest part of the job was the constant demands to do more with less and less people, due to reductions in forces. Easily the most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships between co-workers and customers. Fellow employees working as a team created a great working environment. Anytime you can develop a bond with a customer, and build their trust in you, that bond identifies you and your company. "
good,"dealing with great customers,working with great people.contractor sales is the best job in the store,dealing with proffessionals daily is a education you cant get anywhere else."
good,"I worked in inventory management for the plumbing dept. I would arrive at 4am every morning and I loved it. work flow was great and schedule was even better. Coming into The Home Depot I already had management experience and supervisory experience so this company allowed me to excell in those skills and it allowed me to find better ways to lead my peers to succesful monthly quotas. The coworkers I had were young and had no care in the world, no responsibility and very difficult to work with. The other half were older and great employees. The hardest part of my job was having to manage two or three different departments at the same time. Ovrall i really enjoyed the experience of working at The Home Depot."
good,"I worked a 2 seperate THD's, and both were good environments to work in. I was at the Tumwater, WA store until 2/10, and transferred to the Bonney Lake, Wa store. I must say, I think the Tumwater store was a bit more 'put together' Management wise. Although, there was 3 different Sm's at the Bonney Lake store while I was there. "
good,"The one thing you can expect is change. It is exciting and fun, and it will keep you on your toes."
good,"The work was very simple, no serious brain power needed, just have to be safe and pay attention to your surroundings. The people there was very relax and helpful."
good,Completing reports. Assisting customers. Coworkers are easy to get to know and work with. A team environment. Adjusting to new system updates is redundant. 
good,"Each day was rewarding in helping those who like to do projects themselves, find the right tools for the job.  I learned that really listening and visualizing what they were trying to achieve made for better recommendations for them to complete their project without breaking their wallets.  "
good,I work with various customers on a daily basis and provide them with excellent service. I assist in multiple departments in the store. I am very knowledgeable on the store's products. 
good,"Working for the Home Depot is a great experience in retail and customer service. There is a lot of recognition where it is deserved; working hard and giving effort will bring rewards. In my department, there is always something to do, as well as new things to learn. I love being challenged, and most of the time I get what I ask for. A handful of managers will jump right in with you and work along side the team, however, most others prefer to look important and hide in their office. My co-workers and I get along great, because I make it a point to befriend everyone. Unfortunately most people's attitudes are not the best in this environment, but I manage to turn some of them around simply by joking and making work fun. The hardest part of the job I would have to say, is the slow process of moving up within the company and having to train your supervisors to do their job. Overall, this company teaches great lessons on how to be professional, and keep the customers happy. "
good,"I first became employed with Home Depot through a staffing company at their Corporate office and love the environment and company. Unfortunately, that assignment ended and there were no positions available in that department so I started at their new call center which is a very nice environment but there is poor management. The turnover rate is extremely high and this office is completely different than working at the Corporate Office. Be prepared to work for more than one department with no pay increase and promotions in this company has nothing to do with how good your numbers look but everything to do with who you know or make nice with. You can also earn a promotion by not being good at your job on the phones which is backwards to me. But if you can deal with poor management and don't mind being overlook for all the Great and hard work you do, then I would say apply to them and immediately after your six months in one position start applying to positions in their Corporate office but be prepared to constantly be applying to those positions before hearing a response. "
good,a very customer oriented company with good values. must be able to execute to a very high level to meet company's standards and expectations. 
good,I liked what they have to offer. i like that i learned alot there.
good,"Great work force, great challeang to over come, ability to work with customers thru out the store."
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in at 7am-3pm."
good,"Benefits, Good Environment, Good Management, Fast Paced. To help each and every Customer in Need and Direct them to the right person. "
good,The people are what make this a good company.  The will train you very well and are pretty flexible with schedules.
good,Home Depot has taught me invaluable home repair and improvement knowledge. I spend most of my time servicing product and completing special projects. Management is better at HD than other retail jobs I have held. Co-workers are hit or miss ranging from great employees all the way down to the terrible. The hardest part of the job is time management. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to share information that helps people accomplish whatever task it is they are trying to complete.
good,"A typical work day consists of working with many customers to solve many different types of difficult situations.  I have learned many management and business skills from The Home Depot.  The management here is willing to help and very resourceful.  One of the most difficult parts of working at the Home Depot is time management.    It is very difficult to manage to completing the assigned daily tasks along with balancing the large amount of customers needing assistance.  Although difficult at times, I enjoy the fast paced environment and the company of the hard working associates that I work with."
good,at work i help customers and stock inventory. in the past 6 months i've learnt a lot between going to college and starting a new job that made me learn something i've never thought i would learn. i am a great learner and a dedicated hard worker.if you was to talk to any of my co-workers both present and past they would say the same things about me. like that i aalways give 100% in anything i do and i have the best personality. the hardest part of the job is when it starts getting slow and there is no work. the most enjoyable part of my job is when i help a customer and you can tell how happy they were with their help.
good,"Was a temp job. A lot of people were let go, including me."
good,"I was a manager on outside sales, I occasionly was in the stores, the store manager had no respect towards the outside manager vices verus. The company always wanted both sides to come together and work as a team.  "
good,"Customer service was of the utmost importance.  Very busy service desk, taking special orders, expediting installations, communicating with customers, vendors and installers. Learned to operate cash register (POS), well organized and attention to details.  Maintained a good repore with co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was getting associates to be trained properly when lateral moves were made throughout the departments in the store.  Sometimes management would not co-operate or communicate well with these issues.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with questions and suggestions pertaining to their home improvement projects since I was self-employed in my prior position with a remodeling company."
good,worked there while in school. pays well and was secure while in school. management can be interesting but fun
good,Start the day by cleaning my work area. Would cook for customers and would take their orders. Management was always there when you needed them. Hardest part was cleaning the Brioler.
good,Home Depot during my time with the company was a high growth business that rewarded risk taking. They fostered a great sense of culture and team work.
good,"If you like working with people, this is it!! Full-time flexible hours keep you in focus."
good,"I like helping customers, however if I was the manager, I feel like I would make the company alot more money by making associates more accountable. love what I do as each out of STOCK hole I fill with freight allows the customer to shop for what they want"
good,"Home Depot was a great work place to work, the training emphasis was second to none, district teams are great friendly and full of knowledge."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a great job to have, there was rarely any stress and complicated days. I managed to work my way from starting out as part time head cashier to a Vault Clerk/Loss Prevention Supervisor. I learned a great deal on how to be customer service driven and how to manage and listen to fellow coworkers."
good,Overall a good place to work. Very busy and sometimes heavy workload.
good,Life at the Home Depot was ever changing and fun! Assisting customers with dream projects or emergency fixer-uppers was a constant but the comradery of the staff and the ever-changing needs of the customers made this job a one-of-a-kind experience.
good,"A typical day at work usually consist of ringing out customers , helping people find what they were looking for , I learned more about paint and building things , the managment was very different and showed alot of favortisim . the hardest part of the job was having to lift things that was very heavy and having to tend to lines very long with no help and no head cashiers will get on . or even standing by the door in the winter my coworkers were very much helpful and fun to work with and the most enjoyable part was helping the customers"
good,this job was my first and i obtained alot of skills from it. i love working with others and this job just showed me my ability to
good,Fast paced sometimes stressful when not enough associates
good,Helped qualify the needs of the customer and ordered or helped find what they needed and completed any necessary tasks to meet those needs. Management was a little overbearing at times but for the most part liked how i helped the customers. My co-workers were very knowledgeable and were fun to be around. The hardest part was being pulled in a lot of directions from a lack of other employees being on the floor. The best thing was just how much I learned about construction and sales.
good,"Handling cash, credit, and check transactions. Having product knowledge, product location throughout the store, and answering questions for customers."
good,"Customer interaction and service. Meeting with Clients and Contractors reviewing needs ,budgets and timeframe. Showroom maintainence and updating of projects. Monthly safety and design updates."
good,"Good place to work good benefits excellent culture, good leadership team can be fast paced and exciting. Lots of on the job training excellent co-workers"
good,"A typical day at work consist of smiling, engaging and greeting customers. I am also required to deliver excellent customer service which I have a passion for doing. I have learned about many protection plans that come with certain merchandise that customers purchase. The management is somewhat ""unorganized"" and the hardest part of my job is being the only sole cashier during closing time to help assist a line of patient and impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my coworkers as well as making a customers day by providing courteous customer service and helping a frown turn into a smile on the customers face."
good,I have learned so much from working here. Working with the coworkers and customers have been the funnest part. Everyone feels like family.
good,"Began working during the summer while I was in college. Hired with the understanding that I could not work on the evenings that I had class, but was available during the day and all weekend. I was constantly being scheduled to work during my classes. Once schedules were created, management was not quick to make corrections."
good,Co-workers were helpful
good,"Le climat de travail est trés satisfaisant ,une équipe bien soudée ,beaucoup de respect et une trés grande confiance entre les employés et leurs superviseurs ,les régles de sécurités sont respectés,le matériel de sécurité et les engins de travail sont à la dispositon de tous les employés accrédités .les opportunités de developpement sont minces."
good,Home Depot was an enjoyable place to work. I checked out customers and stocked merchandise. My favorite part of the day was working the returns desk because of the one on one customer experience.
good,Overall HD is a great place to work. They just don't pay you what you are worth my only problem with HD. My hours were set Mon thru Fri 8 Hr days sometimes more which I don't mind just the meagar pay and horrible music that is louder than the equipment only flaws of home depot
good,"Home Depot was the site for my first job. It is very nice, as long as you're willing to put in the work. Advancement rated so low since I waiting half a year to even get the proper training for another position."
good,Daily use of store systems to do detail follow-up. Interact with vendors on a daily basis to ensure timely delivery of products. Provide excellent customer service for sales of in stock and special order products. Engage with management on sales activity and ideas to increase profit margins. Enjoyed interacting with customers on a personal and professional level.
good,Benefits for full time only. Never bored. Always helping any customers in every department even if it is not your own. Lots of new things to learn daily. Always stocking to be done and straightening. Constantly resetting the aisles. Work days go quickly and the return of satisfied customers on a regular basis is very rewarding.
good,This job got me stuck on home improvement. Love being hands on so learning how to do various home improvement projects was enjoyable. Started out as a cashier then moved to the sales floor working in paint and the flooring departments.
good,"each day varies, sometimes i do a very heavy workload, loading for contractors and inside the warehouse, and other times i help outside to gather the carts and work diffrent parts of the warehouse. i learned alot of responsibility and hardwork and having things ontime is always key. some of my co-workers helped me out alot but many others didnt like to be to helpful or sociable. the hardest part was the extreme workload i would have throughout the day. the most enjoyable was some of the friendships i had there and learned alot of great skills"
good,It was a nice experience working with the costumers that were mainly housekeepers and stay homes moms and grandmothers. I always was happy to see how pleased the costumers returned to their vehicles after showing them exactly what they were looking for and describing to them the beautiful gifts of the product they seemed to be interested in. It was a nine to five job very enjoyable seeing all types of people walk in and out of our small place and the interaction with the costumers was a really nice experience. I worked really hard organizing and replacing old merchandise with new products. Rearranging the table setup to present a new and inviting set of products to eager to buy and curious costumers. I had a good time working there it was really nice and I learned a lot about face to face interaction with the clients and managing correctly how to finish he goals of the day in time. My supervisor was very rigorous and persistent with the cleanliness of the areas and the beautiful display and presentation of the products and I never disappointed him.
good,"What I like most about my position at The Home Depot is having the customers come back looking specifically for you because they think you provided them with the best customer service. I also like the fast paced environment because there is always something to work on whether its bay maintenance, driving the machines or most importantly taking care of customer special orders."
good,It a great place to learn how to interact with difference people.
good,The associates and customer's were delightful but Home Depot has serious management issues and retail is a tough gig without management being disingaged
good,"Great paying job but the location I was at had the worst managers & supervisors working there. No matter how hard you worked, you had to kiss up to get anywhere in that store! The employees acted like teenagers in high-school."
good,"I did not really work there long enough, I feel to provide a good review."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers choose the appropriate tool for the job they were completing and advising customers on products or sale promotions. I learned that being confident on the job and knowing what I was talking about allowed customers to be comfortable around me. I was able to build up a small cliental base. The management changed 3 times while I was there. Each new manager came in with new ideas and rules, making it had to adjust. The hardest part was keeping up with customer demands. Busy days in the summer made it difficult to keep rental tools available for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was I worked with a bunch of great guys in the department. They were always willing to share their knowledge of work related things and non-work relating things."
good,"I work as a paint sales associate most days, other days I work as a special services associate. When I work in paint I mix paint ask questions based off customers paint projects, and ensure they have all the necessary tools for their project. When I work as a special services associate I create customer agreements, make phone sales, and handle all the customers questions about certain product."
good,I really enjoyed this job. I would deffinetly recomend it to any one who likes the construction feild.
good,Good place to work got to meet a lot of nice people.
good,You meet some lifetime friends through customers and coworkers.
good,"This work place was very challenging. I was hired as part of a ""new team"" of merchandising professionals designed to improve the overall store appearance. While I was productive and got along well with my peers and employees, expectations were extremely high and stressful. I managed it well until the position was eliminated due to budget concerns."
good,"Greet customers, stock/maintain shelves, handle custom orders, run reach truck, fork trucks, order pickers, pallet jacks, Assist customers with finding everything they need, upsell customers on products when appropriate, run cash registers, set customers up with extended service agreements,"
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers. Flexible and friendly with co-workers who puts the customer first or priority in regardless of any issues they may asked. Hardest part of the job was a huge amount of work especially returned products.
good,Its been awhile but this company was great to work for. Small business with large ambitions.
good,"Coming in to work walking the store with my team looking to see where I wanted them to start working. Giving us a time frame to be finished with a task so we where on the same page. Throughout the day checking to see how they where progressing. I leanred that when everybody is on the same page and willing to work together it makes everyone's job easier, fun, and enjoyable. My co-workers I enjoyed I learned from them, and they learned from me. The hardest part of the job was going above and beyond for a customer and not being able to meet the customer's expectations with the merchandise the store had in stock. Being able to meet a customer expectations was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,My day consist of keeping customers happy; the goal is to give the best customer service possible. I have learned that if I take the time to listen and understand the problem and situation then I could better help to solve the issue. On a daily basis I manage a staff of 8 to 10 people; the hardest part of my job is when staff call out and having to shift people around to ensure there is coverage all around. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a satisfied customer smile.
good,Learned sales tactics.
good,Work cash register @ front end. It is a very friendly enviorment to work in.
good,"Cashing on till, meeting customers and conversing with them. Enrolling customers in credit card. Co-workers very good to work with. Management also very good to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing infront of the till waiting for customers. The most enjoyable was the interaction with customers"
good,solving customers problems. Seeing customers leaving with a smile on their face. My co-workers are great to work with.
good,Reset department.
good,This is a wonderful company to start a working experience.
good,"I love my job, great experience. The pay and benefits are great for you and your family. It is retail so long hours and crazy shifts are a given. However, with salaried management this can go a bit overboard. Meaning that you will work a min of 55 hours and usually its many more. This would not be bad if the schedule was set but one day you may start at 5 am and the next at 1 pm. Great for a young professional. Not so great for a parent."
good,"Great place to work, I love the people, customers are not friendly. If you have a great team to work with it makes the time go by fast. Its laid back."
good,I had fun as a Guest Service employee. I met a lot of people and have seen a lot of events. As a Guest Service Representative you learn to build a social life and become a social able peoples person.
good,"typical day at work , is when associate did notreport for work satisfying customer,"
good,i answered customer phone calls and directed them to the approbate department i made announcements over the intercom as well as did any necessary computer work
good,always challenging day
good,a typical day at work was friendly and straight to business for me. i learned many things as far as dealing with electrical ladders and having the the knowledge of learning about wires lightbulbs hardware paint and etc.. the management to me was not fair and coworkers were fine due to i get along with everyone i worked with. the most most enjoyable part of the job was i grew clients because of my knowledge and loved making customers leave satisfied
good,The best thing about working at Home Depot is always learning new things. Then taking those things and helping people. The hardest part is helping more than one or even two people at a time. Working in my last department that is a skill I greatly utilized. All day long you are multitasking between helping customers and department up keep.
good,My day at work flows well could be a little smoother if i didn't think about whether my job assignment was about to come to an end.
good,A day at work consist of assisting associates with unforeseen financial needs. Its rewarding to make a difference for the associates. Being a team player is important. Not being able to assist associates that fall short of the required criteria is the hardest part of work. I enjoy helping my team and providing great customer service.
good,A typical day at work consists of helping all the customers. I have learned a lot about the tools and garden. Managment is okay & coworkers are amazing. Hardest part of the job is the disorginization. I love working with the people I am around and the cusotmers.
good,"This job was simply that, a job. I needed somewhere to work while finishing school and Home Depot allowed me to do that."
good,I was able to learn a lot from management about customer service. I had the great opportunity to learn how to design kitchens.
good,"I love working at the Home Depot. There is truly never a dull moment. I have learned so much during my 2 1/2 years there. I have learned to be patient, understanding, and I have learned to always do your best to please the customer. I am a better problem solver when it comes many different circumstances. My co- workers are not only helpful, but also my friends. If and when I do leave the Home Depot I would still keep in contact with most of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am in my office. I get to be the ""go to person"", and I get to be more hands on which I love. However, as much as I love the Home Depot it is time for me to move on. I need a full time job. With a not so messy schedule."
good,good company with great values and enjoyable working environment
good,"The Home Depot was an energetic workplace where every day was a little bit different, even if the job was the same. I learned how to operate a variety of tools and machines. The Freight Team worked very well as a team with members who finished their department moving on to help in other departments."
good,I love helping customers with their projects but it is impossible to balance your work/personal life. I have learned so much about home improvement. I just bought my first home and I feel I can confidently fix many things up myself. Co-workers are great for the most part but severely unmotivated. Benefits are not competitive at all
good,"My day at work was always different! I always worked on new projects, learned how to assemble and maintain different fixtures, learned how to improve with people skills and communication. I also learned how to use different lift equipment such as a reach truck, forklift truck, order picker, and electric pallet jack. I got along very well with co-workers, i was always very respectful to them and they were always very respect back. The hardest part of my job was when for some reason i could'nt put a smile on a customers face to see them leave happy! Being able to save a customer money, time, and nasty attitude is what i came to work for, it made my day!"
good,"Typical day at work is help customers and driving forklifts,"
good,"Prior to working at Home Depot, I had no experience working in the hardware field. When you first start, they give you an extensive training on what ever department you are working in. By the time I left Home Depot, I have learned alot."
good,very hectic environment to work in I learned how to operate selfcheck out registers
good,Great learning opportunity
good,Very demanding job. And very busy working in the decor dept. plenty classes and work.
good,"Since being employed at The Home Depot, I have learned that customer service is a very important aspect in order to operate a successful business.Before working for the company, I never really payed much attention to customer service when I shopped at a store. At The Home Depot, our main goal is to put the customer first. We go the extra mile to insure that the customer leaves our store anxious to come back in the near future. It is rare that I receive the same service when I shop at other retailer's. In any instance that I can pass along some friendly advice, it would be to treat your customer's with respect and vice versa. One day you will be in the other person's shoes."
good,A typical large retail work place. Safety is a big component of the day along with customer service.
good,"I was hired at the home depot as a garden associate the manager found out I had a plumbers license, the company immediately placed me in the plumbing department where I excelled with customer care , service, and guidance in plumbing. I learned from the home depot store in apex, north carolina that you can't judge a book by its cover. There are many good people in the world. I worked well with all of the managers down to the store asscociates. All of the workers and managers respected me. The store was very impressed with my customer service. The hardest part of my job was getting items off the very top shelf in the store with the fork lift, I would attempt with several tries to succeed, then I would get a co-worker to help me out. I would always greet the customers with a smile. I showed empathy when they had a problem that they couldn't figure out. I would show them the correct and easiest way to do the task and help them choose the materials needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting store recognition and letters from happy, customers being the best I could be."
good,great place to work if u enjoy helping customers on a daily basis...
good,I started out as a cashier and worked my way up quickly. They worked well with my family life. When kids were sick they were understanding and cooperative. I loved working for them. Always having my best interests in mind. Recognition for good work excelled.
good,"Each day I go into work and I scan every product that's out in my departments. The sales associate pulls the products from the overhead and pack them down on the shelves. I put up new label changes and price changes daily, count products and do bay validations. I've learned a lot about the retail industry and my customer service skills have improved tremendously and my co-workers and I get a long great. The hardest part of my job is having to work at 5am and the most enjoyable part is the atmosphere."
good,"The work at The Home Depot like most places can be stressful and extremely busy, but it is nothing short of challenging. I enjoy working for this company as well."
good,I learned a lot in this job. Including helping customers up front and work as a team with my co-workers. The postion I hold with this company is a fast paced environment so it requires a lot of standing up and walking and running all the time but time goes by fast and you accomplish a lot of tasks during the same period of time.
good,Assist management with Warehouse/Distribution functions.
good,I get to work and review all my quotes and the department making sure its clean. I have learned alot of neat information and skills. Managment is okay but could do better in some aspects but could do better. They are very understanding too. Coworkers are very friendly and nice. The hardest part is as beign a girl in a flooring department i need to pick up alot of heavy stuff.
good,"proactive, suportive, the courses offerd , growth in learning always, co-workers well respected,"
good,"Pretty nice place to work. Decent pay, and a chance to move up the ranks if you are willing to work for it."
good,Well home depot is a huge retail store. It has everything to can think of to fix things in your house. The employees were friendly but the bad part about the job is you are standing the whole at while at the register. It was putting alot of strain and pain on my legs. The most enjoyable part of the job was ringing up the orders..
good,"Its fun. The hardest part time job, but there customer that will list help you."
good,I would summon it up by saying the Home Depot taught me a lot and took me under there wing like family!! I met some of the best co-workers there that are now friends of mine and some i consider family!! Home Depot is a great place to work for!
good,Normal Warehouse with fast fun and friendly people . With something new to learn everyday.
good,Usually good people to work for in store.
good,great place to work overall.i sell appliances and like working with the public and help solving their problems
good,"must really have the drive to do the job. You get a lot of benefits and the pay is pretty good, but you can only see good money once to excel in the company"
good,"I really enjoy working with Home Depot because it gives me a chance to get experience in my field and I love the people I work with. Management is very professional and good people to work for. Sometime it's hard work because you have to lift some heavy items and move merchandise around, but it also a good work out. The thing I love most of Home Depot is that it gives me a chance to work in the field that I really enjoy, which is Designing Homes."
good,"Was the chasier for the homewood, il location and people used bogus credit cards at my register and I lost the job."
good,"Understanding the culture of this type of business is critical in participating at many levels. Not everyone is on board with the values, mission and requirements and they continue to allow a negative approach to customers. A majority of workers seems to cope with the challenges presented by customers who are always right in this business. Most managers don't seem to know the value of managing people. Very traditional and almost to the point of a worker doesn't know anything so will teach you."
good,I like working at home depot but i need more than what they offer.
good,"Extremely difficult for part time employees, also the company does not accomodate for family or reasonable consistentcy"
good,"Home depot headquarters is a good place to work for but only if your a salaried worker. I was a contractor getting paid very well but trying to become permanent was the obstacle that you must overcome. They have a lot of growth potential, pleasant environment, on site cafeteria, basketball courts, workout gym, and most importantly they give back to the community. Management is hard to explain, alot of micro-managing but they have there own pressure to deal with. How home depot headquarters works is when the economy is bad and the stores are not performing well...layoffs is the solution. Contractors are expendable and are taken first."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot. There was nothing that could be considered a typical day. There was always something to do that could be considered challenging. Customer service began when you walked through the door and I have learned that your attitude towards any situation, good, bad or indifferent can influence how the customer will respond to you and how quickly you can diffuse a situation. Teaching, training, developing and motivating our co-workers was ever present and encouraged by all members of management. The hardest part of the job was opening a store and maintaining excellent service with a limited workforce. The most enjoyable part was interacting with so many people whether they were co-workers or customers and helping to solve a variety of challenges however big or small."
good,"I work a set schedule which includes no weekends. I am constantly on my feet. I have become an extremely knowledgeable associate, often given the duty of training newer associates. I travel between two different stores, so I see different sets of people each half of the week. My manager travels the entire district, so direct conversations don't always occur. It is often difficult to align the agendas of the stores I service and the work that I am responsible for."
good,Assist customers in their daily shopping experience by helping them find the products to get their job done right. Actively manage your assigned department by maintaining its shop ability by keeping shelves stocked and holding to a top notch customer satisfaction.
good,"My typical day included working with others and helping customers. I learned how to communicate with a variety of people, adjusting to different cultures. The management team worked to know their workers. My co-workers were fun. The hardest part of the job was the drive to say it was good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot can vary widely. It can be very rewarding some days and not so much on others. I have learned a lot about the products we sell and how to get those messages to my customers. I have wonderful co-workers, many of which I have worked along side for some time and consider them like family. The hardest part of my job is when I don't receive support from upper management. The part that is most satisfying is when I know I've truly helped a customer with a more difficult problem."
good,All operations from all inventory to all associate development
good,"I enjoyed the traveling and the people I started with and as the time went by the ones that I started with just faded and new ones arrived as well as new management. The Team was alright than but, the smoking of marijuana never changed. Enough is enough. I believe that should a company allow employees to continue this time of behavior, than they need to specify in the handbook that smoking marijuana is ok."
good,Good company to work for especially for full-time students
good,"ticket taking, interacting with guest, and being there whenever the guest needs your aid, I learned how to deal with sitautions when a guest is unhappy, how to keep the guest happy if they are already in a great mood and to have fun but be productive and get your task complete at the same time, Management was the best very flexible and understanding just expected for you to give your best on the job, Co- workers were great all supportive and helpful with the new comers, Hardest part was having to stand out in terrible weather because of the outside stadium, Most enjoyable working with the customers you never know what to expect and it keeps the job interesting."
good,"is a good place to learn how to fix or do it youself classes, and the amount of different ideas that customers have was interesting."
good,Good company to work for with plenty of growth opportunity.
good,The Home Depot is an organization that takes good care of the employees. they have great programs to assist all the associate in times of great need.
good,"I was able to finance earning my Bachelors degree. I was able to earn a living and pay my utilities. It was difficult to move up within the position. However, they offered a lot of incentives for better results, but perfection is unobtainable."
good,"working at home depot was a very fun and knowledgeable experience,the staff and customers were different in there own ways but very nice.they train you very well for whatever position you were hired for"
good,Since working for the Home Depot I have made some lifelong friends and also picked up some skills I never had before. We work as a team and look out for each other on a daily basis. We sometimes have a very strenuous job to do but rely on each other to get the job done. For the most part it is a good company to work for good benefits and understanding management.
good,"Worked night shift and was fun, the pay was pretty good and alot of friendly people."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for overall. They get you the training needed for the skills of each department that you are involved with. They offer benefits, stock, discounts for such things as a new car, cell phone, and some others. If you are wanting to further your education, they can help with that as well. They give back to the community. The only thing I can really disagree with is the way they give raises. They use a percentage base, rather than going by the knowledge and skills you have learned from being there. The only reason I say this is, they dont test your knowledge and how much you bring to the table that benefits the company overall. How much you help with sales and customer service"
good,learned a lot and enjoyed helping people with home projects
good,a great company  just needs to pay more an hour ..only pay 11 an hour ...when this company makes billions ....they can give their  hard working employees  more an hour
good,The team I worked with was a close group of hard working people. The overnight resets we did were fast paced and I couldn't have asked for a better team.
good,"Great work for someone either in, or directly out of, highschool. Allows you to live a flexible schedule with decent pay and doesnt ask too much of you. That doesnt mean that you cant advance yourself. Home Depot truly allows you to grow your carrier with ease. Before joining the home depot, all I had was an outstanding work ethic, now I have experience and training to go along with it."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was an intriguing job in that I learned a lot. I couldn't have told you what pressure treated wood was or that there was even different kinds of insulation you should use on your attic from the rest of the house."
good,"It may not pay more then minimum unless you move into a management role, but this company cares about its people (inside and outside of work). Many programs available for help, as well as advancement through the company. Supervisors, HR, and other management work well with you to make sure you get exactly what you need."
good,"Some of the management was harsh, but overall a good job.  Learned a lot about many different fields, and got plenty of practice with many different facets of the construction industry."
good,"I was given initial training. After that, on a monthly basis, training was on going. It was dull videos. If you paid attention and used common sense, you will catch onto the job. I worked as a cashier and dealt with a variety of human beings."
good,It’s a good place to work that pays good. The staff are nice and always willing to help. They are good employers that can lead to great opportunities within the job.
good,Nice place to work. Management was not always the greatest but I enjoyed working there. They offer room for advancement and rewards for safety and good work.
good,"Overall a pretty good place to work. Takes way too long to acquire real benefits, but the Home Depot Culture you see and hear so much about it ture. Great job"
good,"You'll learn a lot from working at home depo specially if your young you'd get a lot of different experiences out there, whether its with the customers, co-workers or the activities. I would recommend this job to anyone just make sure you can control your emotions at times because some customers can be really disrespectful."
good,Communication is lacking. Department to department and from management.   Many times the store is under staffed.  It's easy to make wrong decisions because of that.  Otherwise staff are friendly.
good,A typical day at Home Depot was simple. All the associates and customers were friendly. I learned a lot about the retail industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,"This has been a really good place to over the last year and a half. I was moved from part time to full time and into a supervisor role pretty quickly. Don't make a mistake, it's a demanding job sometimes. If you are willing to apply yourself and learn different aspects of the business you can definitely make it far."
good,Ok place to work Great benefits the pay could be better But they have other Benefits for their employees to Mickey an OK place to work how do you feel like If you work there it can’t be your only job
good,"Like any company, what you put into it, is what you’ll get in return. Every associate bonuses as well as having employe stock purchase plans. You can get knowledge from over 15 different departments, from the front end to the back end of operations."
good,"As an Overnight Associate, the people I worked with are great and The Home Depot does it's best to keep their Associates happy. But being a ""Part-time Permanent"" Overnight Associate is kind of misconstrued in it's name. The only ""Part-time"" about it is only about 3-4 months of the year. The remaining months are ""Full-time"" hours. Feels like you get less appreciation then what actual ""Full-timers"" get, even after being there for years."
good,"good place to work.  Everyone is very helpful, opportunity for advancement and considerable training is provided.  I left there to pursue to other opportunities, but the training and friendship was invaluable."
good,"It's a strong company always keeping employees involved and helping their employees with life struggles its amazing for that. It pays decent, and awesome with flexible scheduling. The downside was some managers were poor and the benefits are awful. The worst I've ever seen."
good,"Busy company, some good Managers and associates., hard workers."
good,Great for refining customer service skills. Flexible hours works great with busy school schedule. Structured management style. Great company overall. Two thumbs up.
good,You feel welcomed in no matter what. Theres a place for everyone. I am able to balance my life out side of work. Including being able to go to school as well.
good,Training is second to none. Training allows employees time off the floor to train via online courses. Management keeps everyone informed of pertinent job information.
good,It was great working there loved everyone like family great job security but the managers are not fair great benefits and had set schedule great feed back from co-workers
good,It's a good company and they are good to there workers normally but they need more help in departments. They normally have a good freight team and a good supervisor they just don't understand we do need more good help at night.
good,This is a great company with tons of room for career advancement. Very clear cut and fair. A lot of benefits that can help take care of you and your family.
good,"Like any company Home Depot has it's good and bad points. It is very pro Information Technology. All the training is done online, access to scheduling, time-off, benefits, etc. is online. "
good,"Home Depot was an overall valuable experience. After being transferred from NYC to Buffalo, it was a big change trying to adapt to the different work environments. Nonetheless, both locations added to my experience in my customer service skills."
good,Good for flexible hours full-time has set schedule.  Need to pay employee's better. Lack of direction from some managers. Good experience overall. Recommend for college students.
good,"Generally, coworkers range from old to young and act as strong team players. The work ethic is strongly driven towards safety, community, friendliness, and team building. The company prioritizes customers first, then employees, and management last. A typical day consists of interacting with customers and employees, where problem solving skills, time management, technological use (computers/smart phones), and physical labor need to be quickly executed. Many customers also expect employees to be knowledgeable of the store and products, which creates distress on either end of the party. But it is often encouraged that may ask other associates for help, and that you must also be willing to give it. As for management, it varies on their work ethics. Some will be more reliable than others and some will be demanding."
good,Great schedule and excellent health benefits. Compensation is low. Supervisor is a little unorganized. Team I work with is a good group. No clear pathway for career if interested.
good,Great place to learn and get knowledge for your future. Management at the store I worked in was stifling and close minded. Not true for all stores but it was in the location I worked.
good,pretty flexible while going to school. always something to do ore learn. pay was not that good. Nice to be able to work in different categories of the store.
good,Loved working here. Got to learn the DFW metroplex driving and delivering to customers. Got to meet a lot of people and learn a few new trades. I would go back to working here if I had the opportunity.
good,"Driving machinery, answering customer questions, freight logistics. That’s a typical day at work. "
good,"I think about the job a I did the pay is not to good to survive by your self, but is a good environment to work with people and customers, you can grow up in the company if you likes the managers I think sometimes they don’t see you hard work or the skills you have to handle your work"
good,I enjoyed working at home depot. I learned alot of intresting terminology and met some wonderful people. I also love how they care for the community. Would go back if I was ensured more hours.
good,"I honestly really looked forward to going to work everyday. My coworkers and managers always made me feel right at home. Some of the customers could be a little difficult, but I usually had the help I needed if I felt too overwhelmed. "
good,Working for Home Depot has definitely been a journey. It's a really good job and they're very inclusive. The only problems are the lack of pay and not being able to really have a daytime life.
good,Come welling to please customers home depot is big on customers service. Always keep up with the training and what's going on with products as well as any workshops that will be at the store that a customer may need
good,"Customers make you fell at ease when you have to assist them with products in the establishment , and co workers can be helpful when needed . great wp"
good,It’s a great place for a first job! You gain lots of experience and knowledge by working there. You learn how to communicate with customers and provide great service. At times you will find yourself doing counterproductive work due to the fact there are 5 managers that all want different things completed and done in a different manner then the other.
good,"Simple hiring process, and basic job requirements. My opinion on management is mixed, my store manager was very competent but some assistant managers and supervisors were questionable. A simple job to perform and compensation reflects that"
good,Entrenamiento y espacio para crecimiento y aprendizaje . valoran a sus empleados
good,"I had an overall enjoyable experience working at the Home Depot for 24 years ,i learned alot of management skills ,people skills ,Home improvement knowledge  and a variety of tasks and receiving ,merchandising knowledge,i enjoyed by far problem solving and helping my customers that i encountered there at the store the most ,also met alot of great friends and learned to manage ,motivate and prioritize tasks and people that worked under me ,Overall ,the company was  very good to me and my family ."
good,"At first it seemed like a lot to take in. After a while you get used to it. Also, there's employees that have worked with the compayfor about 10-18 years."
good,"I started off as a seasonal worker then made my way to receiving, then I actually moved to Colorado to further my future with the company. That’s where I learned all aspects of the job"
good,"Great place to work if management is drinking the kool-aid, if not it can become a sweat shop. Using cutting edge tech, data moved to the cloud. It is highly valued by the executive team"
good,You truly learn all aspects of the store no matter what department you work in. Plenty of shift options. Never a dull moment. Great employee appreciation practices.
good,Fun job  does get boring from time to time usually graveyard shift very fast paced carry some heavy objects drive some heavy equipment scan this find where on the shelves it belongs
good,"I would pull different online orders, process and make ready for onward delivery to various customer locations."
good,"I haven't had any negative experiences with direct management. Friendly people, have catered meals at monthly meetings, they reward team members if you meet company goals, nice atmosphere,management gives you a lot of respect for any issues that may arise, A great warehouse in. To work at."
good,"good place to work, friendly employees, pay is not that competitive. good benefits. helpful management. safe work environment. fast paced. poor scheduling"
good,"As a supervisor/manager in a busy retail business, you are expected to give everything you have to the business, even if it doesn't fit in with your family needs. They had no compassion for family values."
good,"A good place to work if you are young and need money for school/need to balance school life, but apart from that i don’t see it as a career unless you climb ranks within a year or two... not bad regardless(depends what department you work) its retail so that sums it up."
good,The opportunities are endless. Home Depot is full of stories of people working their way through the ranks. The pay and benefits are really good. Stay away if you do not like to work.
good,"Tell you your great and you be good mgr.  Then opening and someone else got it.  But you run projects and orders, had the authority to get them done.  But blew smoke when came down to promoting.   Went back to visit and my dept. Looked like a mess and people asked me to come back.  I gave them a chance but clearly they see how they lost good employee"
good,"It’s a okay job for me but I plan on leaving here I don’t feel comfortable here at all, they treat the lot people like we always got to be outside all the time and it’s only one manager and employee"
good,"company is friendly and easy to learn your job, most co-workers are sociable and nice, however cross training is nonexistent and can make your job tough at times, the senior co-workers are very helpful so look to them for help on odd requests and customer projects,"
good,"Working here for the most part was overall pretty nice! I learned a lot about time management and how to interact with my peers positively. The Home Depot thrives off of having a positive workplace culture on the surface. Get your work done and you will do fine."
good,"I honestly believe that the team members make my job enjoyable, their attention to details, consistent hard work, and personalities make up for the hard work."
good,"I was written up  for a safety violation, (I was guilty), yet the assoc supv did not want to train me, so he purposefully caused friction with the lead Met supv, so as to not train me. Then the Met supv said he would train me and then 30 min later said he was way behind and indicated/asked if I could do it alone and I did. Then Bea came in and saw it and wrote me up and neither supv took responsibility for their lack of action. Thank you"
good,For being an $18 billion company it sure is not well organized.  I was told that part time employees can get benefits. This is not true.  You will be hired at an hourly rate and that is where it stays unless you go into management. After 6 months my review was exceptional and no pay increase.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at The Home Depot was knowing that I helped the costumer in all of their needs and they left satisfied. Being able to connect with my regulars and build relationships made my job that much more fulfilling. Management is very understanding and will work with you. The hardest part was not having a steady schedule.
good,"I worked overnight my job entailed restocking products, rearranging displays, removing products that are on clearance from each bay, and replacing it with the new sku's and putting new displays in regards to that particular product..."
good,The hours could be more consistent.  The managers are very good at their job and making sure I am taken care of most of the time.  There are times there could be more personnel for job areas.  I enjoy the atmosphere there.
good,"Good for part time job or someone starting a career. Good training and good people, Low pay and no overtime and no discounts. I did enjoy helping customers and meeting and making new friends."
good,The culture and people are some of the most wonderful I've ever worked with. They really try hard to take care of their employees and customers. Recent issues with scheduling but that is a new change and should be worked out within a year or so. Raises are kind of a joke but most retail is. The customers and work environment is one of the bests though.
good,For the most part it was a really good company to work for. Could be physical demanding if working overnight. Did not pay well at all for the license acquireds and experience I developed.
good,"Has benefits, competitive pay for retail. Had paid time off, holiday pay, health care is a bit expensive. Company cares about employees and works to help out locally."
good,can be very busy at times but good environment to work in. Staff are treated fairley with lots of encourage and staff extras for the teams. Wages could be a bit higher for specialty staff
good,"There is a lot of team work, everybody supports everybody, outstanding customer service culture. colleagues are always willing and ready to help and teach new things."
good,"I have worked at The Home Depot for over 3 1/2 years. They are flexible with schedules and work hard to provide their employees with a balanced work, life experience. Other employees are caring and are always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,It was a great place to eork. Each store has some of its own issues. With multiple opportunities to grow within and receive bonus and other great benefit.
good,Great company to work for if you're retired or still in school. Just doesn't pay enough. Friendly employees and the best management. Willing to work with your schedule
good,"This job taught me many skills and helped develop my communication abilities, after three years I have learned many different aspects of the Home depot as well as been taught about products and how to help customers accomplish their goals."
good,"WATCH MY VIDEO ABOUT THIS: "
good,my team and work environment were fun. leadership was unappreciative and continuously applying pressure to do more with less labor. staffing process for skilled positions was a challenge and key positions remained unstaffed for extended periods of time. worked for company for 11 years. left due to management and work/life balance
good,Good company overall and good people they also have great health and dental coverage only bad thing is they’ve cut hours so bad it’s not manageable to pay bills with only one job with very few hours
good,Do your job and show up on time. Laid back management. Everybody likes their phones. Most enjoyable I work on my own most of the time. I know what is expected of me.
good,"A typical day at work included 8 hours at any one of several check-out stations, including the ""self-check-out"" stations."
good,Everyone there is nice and willing to help anyone who is new to the company. The schedule is very flexible and once you learn about all the products in the department you work in work becomes easier.
good,"Company leadership generally makes decisions with company values in mind, but shareholders are always are placed first. The company hasn't invested in its corporate campus as most other Fortune 25 firms have. Pay is not competitive in the retail space."
good,Is a good pla e to work. Good people and friends. Pay is a little low and not enough employees for the amount of work to be done on a daily basis. But overall much better than other places I've worked.
good,because i current work here i wont share my truth about my store. But its not good its just a few bad apples. Thats making that wheel of everything they preach to us not valid.
good,It was a good work experience. The company often gave employees various trainings and clases to improve in the workplace. They were very considerate of students and they're schedules.
good,I really enjoed the wirk environment. All the managers and co-workers were friendly and professional. Unfortunately the inconsistent schedule and their inability to give me time off for a family vacation  (which I requested 3 months in advance) forced me to resign. I learned a lot and wish I could have made it work for me.
good,"At first the job was fine , & they treat you okay but after a while they try to make you work more then what you get paid to do & management is horrible & support horrible too"
good,"productive workplace."
good,"A fair place to work, but the current opportunity to move up and start a career are lacking. Overall the stores are understaffed and underpaid, and the store management's ability to run a productive store is hindered by the decisions of the individuals further up the chain."
good,Home depot is a great company to work for. they have the homer fund which helps associates and their families when in need. they volunteer in the community often.
good,"Very Productive environnment, always something to work on depending on the job position role. No matter which position/department your working, you will be assisting customers on their needs."
good,"Could be a lot of things for different people. Do you want to be a cashier? Do you want to drive a forktruck? Do you want to mix paint? Well it’s all possible at the orange palace. There are many different departments and jobs for you to do. The downside, the pay is absolute garbage for what you do. Especially the garden and lumber departments."
good,"This is a good company to work for if you want to help people build house, fences, decks most of all the  company helps the vertians by going out to do work for them."
good,Sometimes you walk in and see the store packed and you know as soon as you clock in it;s gong to be a busy day fast paced day. Met some good co workers that are still my friends after years of us all leaving. I miss the vibes at the Depot. Different scenarios daily.
good,Company has great policies and amazing benefits for their associates. All of this can be ruined by one poor manager. Tons of opportunity for growth and advancement. The sense of community as well as giving back you have to your own community is amazing as well.
good,"younger employees could establish a good career if they kept their employment there....some positions seemed to go longer term employees."
good,"This store could be so much better, and it was. The best managers are promoted, going to other stores and rhe replacement's have been terrible. Showing up with a smile on your face, and following the right people will get you a department head job, even if you are terrible at what you do"
good,"Worked in back end mostly.  Easy stuff if you dig in and don't get discouraged by high volume when it happens.  Learn to use the machines and don't make it ""us vs. them"" with management."
good,"I work with some great people, love learning about home improvement. Should pay more though especially if you're a specialist. They can be very stringent when giving hours and then that leaves to being under staffed."
good,Theres alot of work to do at home depot and with the right management you can achieve great opportunity. I think there has to be lots of new associates at the job because many people are leaving.
good,"Enjoyed my position , learning tools available, was on employee fun committee, employee moral building great store meetings , co workers great.. downside had a set schedule in my position and then it was changed and I had to move departments was not happy and no set schedule."
good,"The day began typically with brisk schedule overview, where l had a sketch of my day and then quickly set out to begin."
good,Good pay hard to get 1st shift great incentive program put allot of pressure to get work done fast and mistakes accur then they get upset but they give allot back to the community
good,"Great company, good compensation.  Good training, great customer service.  Timely installations by professional and courteous install team made referrals easy."
good,A good first job. They only hire part time and its not easy to become full time. Managers were laid back and it was fun and easy and everyone is super helpful.
good,"As any other job related to customer service, there is a lot of stress when wanting to offer the best customer service possible. It get even more complicated when they want your opinion or want you to help them fix their problem since they have no knowledge or experience in regards to what they are dealing with. Overall, a good job to have specially when going to school at the same time."
good,"Training was exceptional, but there was no on floor assistance after training. The break periods were short as were the lunch periods. The co workers mainly cared only about there own sections."
good,I enjoyed working for Home Depot. They have plenty of opportunities for advancement. Its a great first job for teens. Its also a good job for anyone over 40.
good,It's a great environment until you get to Loss prevention. It pays well and  helps provide for your lifestyle. The staff is amazing. Everyone is laid back and friendly.
good,The Midtown Home Depot is an excellent location for meeting a diverse group of people. It is an upbeat setting with a pretty fast pace. The training is updated monthly and opportunities are vast as long as the employee stays on top of the openings.
good,Fast paced environment along with super organized creative team! Was an great experience diving into the digital field! Home Depot always had a lot of on site trainings!
good,Depending on the department you work in hours fluctuate drastically if you are working part-time. There are always new opportunities within the company to move to other departments or transfer to another store.
good,"The schedules are horrendous! I’m part time and can’t even remember my schedule week to week. Early mornings, mid day, evening shift. I’m all over the map on these shifts. It’s hard to plan your regular life around them. Seriously the weakest link in that company. By far"
good,"The job itself was good. It was easy going just like most cashier jobs there's the prime time when you have a lot of customers, but then there's the down time when you just tidy up and hang around you register. Only thing was the managment was done poorly at the time. Students who had class were scheduled during class time when the HR rep was given the times they could not work. Managment took forever to respond sometimes to urgent customer problems."
good,A typical day is running around the store look to help guests with their search for stuff. The hardest part of the job is making sure all the orders are right and making sure they're picked on time.
good,"Advancement and extra monetary rewards at home depot entirely relies upon the stores management team. If they are slackers, and don't notice hard work, then you will most likely not receive any extra bonus awards that are supposed to be commonly given out. Some stores are amazing, some are horrid, I would advise you to go in there and talk to a regular associate and find out how they feel."
good,In my 20+yrs of working for Home Depot I have learned alot of skills. Customer Service by far is where I shined however associates have many opportunities in many areas.
good,"Fast paced work environment, the store opens early and stays open late. Customers are waiting to get in as soon as the store opens and are there until it closes. Fellow employees are helpful. Management is demanding. Keep smiling and be helpful and you will do fine. Opportunity for advancement."
good,"Good working environment; opportunity for more hours than hired for; supportive supervisors; advancement available; for those who like working in customer service, it's a great job."
good,"Saftey and customer service is a number 1 priority at this company they want ever customer to feel good when they leave after a purchase of products, knowning product knowledge to beable to explain about the product to a customer."
good,"Nice coworkers, management needs work. game plan needs work. lots of pressure to perform duties quickly and still maintain safety procedures. impossible to do"
good,"its a good place to work at, sometimes it gets busy. Make good friends and learn about new things everyday. Get to know the customer and their backstory. Flexible hours."
good,"I worked for the Home Depot for 3 years while i was in highschool and college. It was a good job for someone with little skill and a difficult school schedual. The pay was ok, i think its 11$ an hour now. the work wasnt hard but if you don't have a cool head and can work with difficult customers i would recomend a different job."
good,Easy to balance life and family while working at The Home Depot. Treat associates like family in there time of need. Great work benifits and discount to several different retailers. If u work hard it’s easy to move up in company.
good,"Fast pace work environment. Great people in a fast retail environment.  Management is tough but fair.  A lot is expected of you, but a lot is earned.  Highly recommend."
good,"the jobs i did were very simple and easy to gain mastery with, but unless there are holidays or you are very close to a construction site, the job is rather slow and you have to make sure that you don't look like you aren't busy even when you haven seen a customer for a good hour or two. this is only in regards to during the store's business hours and i can not speak for the night shift"
good,I knew people that had worked at home depot for decades. Fun environment to work at. I got to learn things about home repairs that I didn't know just by working there
good,"I suffered with depression and all of them were very supportive and understanding.  The work environment was chill and great. "
good,Love everyone I work with everyone works together to get the jobs done . If we have an issue or problem with something management clears things up or solves the issue .
good,"Good company to work for with many learning opportunities. The scheduling can be flexible. Must be able to work weekends and a min of 2 nights shifts, but can adjust your availability otherwise. Closed holidays."
good,I would make changes to management for various reasons. One in particular move them around more often so the atmosphere does not become stale. Always say yes to veterans according to company policy.
good,"I worked at the Home Depot throughout my college career. It was a great place to work. The people that I worked with are kind and caring. The management understood whenever I needed to change my scheduling due to new class schedule. I have no complaints there."
good,Management supervisors and staff where very easy to get along with. Immensely safety oriented. In dealing with customer service you can either help with your current knowledge in a specific field or in some cases learn different things through the knowledge of another associate.
good,"A typical day at work usually goes by pretty quick. I have learned many skills including how to work well with others. The management isn't the greatest because I get told different rules from all the managers. The hardest part of my job is following the rules the right way, but then managers will tell me a different way. I enjoy the people I work with, they make my job manageable."
good,Working at the rlc everything is better then when working at the stores or rdc numbers are not as big a priority as the rdc and without dealing with customers most of the workers are relaxed the only problem was lazy associates would coast for quite a while without repercussions most go getter associates would work too hard for too long until their morale was ruined. Just go in do your job and go home and you will be fine working there
good,Scheduling is rough.  One week 38 hours and the next 16.  Very difficult to adjust.  However they have a great 401k and other benefits like vacation and paid sick leave.
good,An excellent starting job for a young ambitious teen. Great work place atmosphere with the ability to travel for work. Also have the opportunity to go to school while working to advance your career within home depot
good,"I enjoy working their,  very busy at the service desk,  typical day is answering phones, processing returns assisting with online orders. Back up cashiering . Returning mdse to the department's"
good,Working for Home Depot has by far been the best job I've had yet. One of my only issues were with the lot attendants not always wanting to do their job and/or the lack of lot attendants to load/unload products for customers. Also that Home Depot was not as understanding as I thought they would be. I didn't have the chance to give a two week notice when I had an unexpected family emergency in Florida while I was supposed to live in Georgia. I dislike that they were not super understanding and that I don't get a second chance to work at a different Home Depot.
good,Loved my job as head cashier. Wish i would of known to contact corporate about my kids & i having a sickness yearly and seasonally because i would if never lost my job over being sick.
good,On a typical work day in my work position you will be working independently with communication with coworkers every once in a while throughout the shift. There will be complaining about lack of overhead space and of individuals not following standard procedure. otherwise though it is an enjoyable place to work where everyone feels relaxed.
good,"Being a cashier, you have to endure a lot from customers because the customer is always right. Usually just stand by the registers, clean the area if it's needed when no customers are nearby. Always being pushed to open credit cards despite customers being annoyed with the question every time. However, schedule is very flexible and the pay is nice for a student."
good,10 years employee here. Loved the people the customers and the job. A new manager came in and basicly fired everyone over the course of 6 months. Most had been there for many years. I wish I had transfered and I would still be there working for HOME depot. I lived thru 20 managers while I was there but this lady is just evil.
good,"My work has good mixture of customer service and order management. The workforce displays diversity. Coworkers and managers are mostly nice. The store manager in particular for my store is the best leader I’ve worked under, always smiling and treats all associates appropriately. One assistant store manager came off as rude at times but you find such people in any workplace I guess. Overall in my experience good place to work at."
good,I have worked on the Contractors Service Desk  for 8 years. It has afforded me many opportunities to use my skillset to mentor my fellow employees and to service our customers.
good,Ok naman po mag work sa MC home depot Kaya lang po yung convenient ng customers at employees ay hindi po ganun kaganda dahil ang may aircon lang po is sa customers service lang po sa selling area fun lang .
good,"This company is great to work for while in school because of the flexible schedules they offer. Pay is good, management is okay. Work environment is fast paced."
good,Not a bad company to work for. You get what you put in. The only complaint I would have is being hired as a temporary employee. The hours get cut near the end of the probation period.
good,"First I'll get the only negative out of the way which is the pay, Its over minimum wage but it's not a living wage especially if you have a family. Now the positives The Home Depot  offers a number of benefits including 401k, stock shares you can buy at a discounted rate, health vision and dental insurance, and you can also get discounts to alot of retail stores, and vacation packages."
good,Employees hourly pay rates need to increase. Hourly pay compensation needs to be more competitive with rival lowes. Lowe's pays their employees more than home depot does.
good,"Good job for life balance, salary could be better however it's not very stressful if that's something you're looking for. Management is helpful, and there are decent benefits if you take advantage. Fellow employees are fun to be around."
good,"It's a good job, the hardest thing about it would mostly be the customers. They expect you to know everything, and if you don't they tend to get really upset. Definitely play by favorites so if your looking to move up and aren't one of their go-to, good luck."
good,I like how the management motivated me without any belittlement. They definitely gave me the chance to learn at a reasonable pace. I have been there about three months and I already see paths to advancement.
good,"The ""lifer"" at HD has been there since before the pay structure changed dramatically in 2014. very few positions are available at the Full Time level you have to be promoted into a full time position. "
good,"Working at Home Depot was great, I had the opportunity to learn new skills that benefits me in life as well as new friendships I have made working there."
good,Overall great place to work with lots of benefits and job position opportunities. Working with this company you receive a bonus twice a year and you also receive an annual raise.
good,I work with the met team and everything we do is based off of time. set times to complete a project. Allotted amount of time per bay. maintaining planograms and bay integrity down stocking and visual settings
good,Home Depot is a great fillin job for when your in between jobs. I would say not a great career choice. I moved on to Tampa General and it did allow me to get a job fast in Tampa FL.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,My hours were 7pm-3:30am or 9pm-5:30am. The schedules were consistent and I always got hours. Working overtime was encouraged and always allowed. I made $2.50 over minimum wage. Great benefits (even as part-time). The only downside was that my fellow associates were all so childish. They were adults who loved to gossip 🙄.
good,"I Gained alot of skills I use on a day to day  in different jobs, I just wish I wasn't  forced to sell credit cards to people struggling  financially  there. I wasn't  really helping  the community  in any way at that time."
good,"They work you hard, but the pay is minimal when starting out. Would be better if paid based off experience, but everyone makes the same when walking through the door.  I like the hard work, you feel good at the end of the day."
good,Customers expect everyone to be an expert at everything. They can be quite harsh if they don't get an immediate answer. Self motivation is key to moving up.
good,"I liked working here, but when a new manager received the position of Night Ops, he was chosen out of patronage rather than merit, but overall good workplace."
good,"This is the most fun place that I worked in. Staff are mostly friendly, supervisors cares about your well being. We support each other as a team. Targets are reasonable."
good,Loved my team at the Home Depot. Great overnight crew that you could always depend on. Liked the ability to work and listen to music/have some fun and laughs. Good job overall.
good,"I started Home Depot in one location and I absolutely loved it there. I didn't plan on leaving, but life happens and I found myself in another store that wasn't as great but it has its charm. I love what I do as a Flooring Sales Specialist. I've learned so much in my almost 2 years of working for this company. And I learn more everyday. Not just from the job itself but from customers as well. Everyday is different and it has its challenges, but it's well worth it when you get to see a Flooring installation from beginning to end. Or just get to help a customer leave the store confident to take on a DIY project with all the items and knowledge they need to complete it."
good,Depending on which location you are at it can be a great place to work were you'll stay busy and get hours but in other locations in can be the opposite.
good,"This is a great starting job. You can get experience in customer service and experience the feel of a warehouse. People are great. Lots of fun celebrations. Benefits are nice for part-time work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers, 99% percent are great, but that 1% can ruin your day. Management varies since the company moves them around. You have your great, your lazy, your evil overlord all in one package."
good,"my time working AT HOME DEPOT was very exciting, everyone is very pleasing to work with regardless of the department you work in. its very easy to go from one location tothe next because every dept always need extra help which has its advances to learn about more things and products when it comes to helping customers."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work when it comes to company values.  They stand by their dedication to quality and excellent customer service.  They strive to be the best out there.  That being said, when it gets down to the core of the business in the individual stores, the workload demand can get a little crazy.  Especially if your store goes through difficulties with staffing.  Overtime gets strictly watched unless you are salaried, then you get used for everything and can easily push 60 hour weeks."
good,As long as you do your job and don't consistently call off they will allow you to do your job and not give you any problems.  It was a nice environment to work and the advancement opportunities are definitely there for you.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to be for people who are looking to work hard and get paid decently well. Experience per person will vary mostly depending on which department you are put into, some require more physical work than others while others require more technical work. But overall everyone seems to be friendly and are all focused on one goal - to make their store the best of all Home Depots."
good,"Management is generally stretched thin and have a tenancy to not have a ""team first"" mentality.  Everyone is very segmented into departments, so getting support can be challenging.  The app helps with technical customer questions, but everyone seems to have a good attitude."
good,"My overall review isn't that bad really the Employees are great they work hard just like we do, The Store Employees main job is to help Customer and the Merchandisers is to help customers but mostly do resets which is about it"
good,Home Depot associates are hardworking. There is constantly bays needing personal attention. Which seems to help the shift go by quicker. With good leadership any company can be successful.
good,"Hours are convenient and structured to employee needs. Part-timers get benefits. Friendly, team oriented atmosphere. Company seems to be employee oriented with numerous motivational and helpful programs. Pay is getting better, but new changes have compressed salaries so long-time employees make the same as new hires."
good,As an Order Picker its very physical work. Lots of organizational skills help. The people you work with are so much fun and are like a 2nd family. Wish they paid better.
good,Pretty good company to work for. For the most part people work together. Although Merchandisers are different from store associates. We provide service for the vendors not customers. Isislly part time hours but flexible.
good,I currently work the graveyard shift and enjoy working with my co-workers. It's very relaxed and stress free. We are able to work at our own place and help is easily accessible.
good,"At my location the management is little no use when it come to customer satisfaction or to helping others they are very dependent on other and if you do not meet there needs they with let you know, other then that the employees are happy to be there the customers are alway willing to help other associates or customer when in need and it’s an up beat environment."
good,"Either your a part timer, being bounced all over the schedule, or you're full time and hoping they don't put two weeks together to make you work 10 days in a row. Once you're in a department, expect to never move into a job you want, you'll only ever move where they need you to go (whether you agree or go kicking and screaming). Answering customer questions is like a game show, if you can't answer it in 2 seconds they won't believe anything you say after that. Also, what the system says is on hand, is almost always wrong."
good,"job isn't hard, but they offer 0 - 27 hours per week .. it is ok as a starter job, most days are 4-5 hours."
good,"Make friends and fun environment and good learning experience , learn  different  departments  and learn different  areas and good customer  service  skills"
good,"Home depot is a Good place to work and it is easy to advance with dedication and drive."
good,"The best part of working at the home depot were the workers, management was very hands on and not above doing the same work that the entry level employees."
good,It was a good place to work at first. After I got to know the people my opinion of that changed slightly. It was a lot of things that associates did that I didn’t agree with. There were also things that managers did that I didn’t agree with.
good,Good place to work for people who are just joining the work force. But in the merchandising department there is no advancement and the pay is not competitive.
good,"I really enjoyed working at home depot got to learn how to drive a lot of the machines and learned a lot in my department."
good,The company is like having a big family. However the pay is not the best. Raises aren’t big. But if you are full time you get befits. The company overall is great it’s just the pay that’s not the best. They don’t pay the associates what they deserve.
good,"During my Time at Home Depot  truly began to understand the importance of team work and how vital it is an workplace. Here, the only real way to get and substantial amount of work done is to split up task and help each other to meet certain objectives for the day."
good,"I worked as a grave yard associate. I did not enjoy working there because I was going to school full time and had two kids so I did not have much time to sleep.  Although I did not enjoy my experience, I was very grateful for the opportunity to be employed."
good,great experience for my first job really helped me develop my skills and learned alot about garden where I worked. Enjoyed the other employees also very fun
good,"Home Depot was a very friendly place to work. Everyone was always there to help you if you needed. The customers always left with a smile after I helped them out. I really liked my job, helping out the customers and finding everything they needed for their projects."
good,Always fun to create and set up for new seasons from displays to wingstaks and cross merchandise in the store. Working with planograms and pop. Always busy and hard working job.
good,"It was a good work environment to be in . Depends on what supervisors you have. Sometimes your work would go unnoticed by the supervisors, and it was a lot of “leaving in the blind “ going on."
good,"It's a great place to work for college students, but there are several things that sometimes make me not want to work here. The system is very glitchy, there is often no coverage for departments, as a puller I am very overworked l, as a forklift driver there are a lot of times where no one can spot you. There are good things like paid holidays for part-timers and vacation after a year, but for the amount of work and very limited opportunities for advancement it is just not worth it for people wanting to make a career out of it."
good,"lots of opportunities to learn. how to make installation quotes, how to sell a project instead of just a product, making good relation with the customer, and providing the best advice and services so they will visit the store again and again. keep your department organized and clean. I found this organization as a place where your hard work will be appreciated by the management and recognized by giving homer awards, which I feel is the best way of motivating someone for doing his best. co-workers are really co-operative and respect for each other. Departmental transfers really help you to enhance your product knowledge and standards and procedures followed in a different area of the store."
good,As long as you show up on time and adhere to your schedule do your job or at least sincerely try and give a good effort you will be fine management is up and down mostly due to their rotation schedule and for the most part the people and work environment is good.
good,"the work day was a typical retail situation,Come in and touch base with Mgmt. straighten up and stock the Dept. and help customers as needed. I enjoyed helping people find what they needed for their projects.I learned about the products in every Dept. And I was able to be more valuable as an employee. the Mgmt. staff was very helpful and easy to work with.it was a fun place to work at my fellow employees were helpful with each other, a good team effort across the store,.doing the inventory and stocking the shelves was the hardest part because people were always moving items around and not putting them back where they belong.I really enjoyed working with the customers, I am experienced in a lot of areas of home improvement,so I could instruct people on how to do their projects. Because of this I gained my own clients,they would ask for me when they came in,I am very proud of this to this day."
good,As a retail position Home Depot is an enjoyable place to work. The workday keeps you busy and the hours pass by quickly. Home Depot offers 401k and matches employee. The only downfall is the lack of days off for Holidays as with all retail jobs.
good,It was a good place to work at. Like most stores they do have their problems. Too many good people were let go for all the wrong reasons and too many bad people were promoted for all the wrong reasons as well.
good,"friendly customers and co-workers, good place to learn about home improvement while at work. too many managers. caring co-workers and management. most enjoyable part of the day is the smells of the store and working with people whom you get along with. hardest part is short shifts."
good,"Todo bien solo q el filtro de contratación esta en los suelos, te puedes topar exreclusos ahi adentro, de ahi en fuera las prestaciones son buenas"
good,"I worked the front end and hardware department.  The supervisors for both departments are good people. Store manager and ASMs are good people too... I never had a hostile moment.  I really admire the infocus and knowledge depot training associates receive. Overall the company knows what it's doing and this particular store has a good enough work culture if you connect with the people. The Home Depot offers a good retail work experience. "
good,"A typical day at work, was to report in and sign in at a register and ring up purchases for customers, or accept returns, accept payments or refund payments by cash, card, or check. The hardest part of the job for me was to try and sell credit cards as I believe they are not that good of a thing to have.  The most enjoyable was the people I worked with, and on the whole, the public.  There are bad eggs, but there are also so many good eggs."
good,calm work place with understanding management and team members. management recognizes hard workers and rewards them with gifts and badges! the job was a good experience and resembled the company's policy.
good,Great place to work as long as you can deal with the long hours. Can sometimes get hot in the building but they were pretty good about making sure everyone could get water when needed
good,"learn new things daily"
good,"Good place to work for if you need flexibility. Weekends are mandatory, but weekdays are flexible. The people that you get to work with are great and it's a relaxed environment most of the time."
good,"The people you work with are usually very friendly and try to pick each other up when someone is feeling down"
good,I have worked there 4 years and I love my team and store associates are nice but we are supposed to work as a team and help one another out. Nope! it doesn't work that way. Store side has and will always exclude the MET any social events at the store. We are always treated like we don't belong there but we are employees of Home Depot. Store side (management) is quick to blame us for anything. Our job is very detailed and time sensitive and we are always asked to help them and we oblige but when the tables are turned they don't reciprocate. The most enjoyable part of my job is our team. We are like family and look out for one another.
good,Es buena y hay tiempo de crecer aunque a veces es de contentillos  y eso es lo malo
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work as a college student as they work with your schedule, however, if you plan on moving up in the company or specifically the Newark Branch, your chances are limited as it seems to go by favoritism."
good,"THD warehouse is a great job if you always show up on time, work nonstop unless on break and maintain a positive attitude about your work. ""Bleed Orange"" and ""drink the Orange kool-aid"" would be apt terms to describe the attitude they want. They also reward pushing yourself to the limit in regards to the volume of your work as well as the number of hours you work and do not budge at all in regards to the time you clock in (to the minute) or missing a day unless the reason is specifically covered under oregon law."
good,"Usually, a typical day has a moderate flow of business. My primary job was stocking and bring products from the shelves. Management at Home Depot is fair for the most part. The only downside to their management is their decision-making skills, sometimes even some that could compromise the safety of their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make the customers happy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the attitudes of the customers and coworkers."
good,Nice beginner position at front end and professional services cash area. Good upper management willing to work with employees during family issues. Curtious FE Manager as well to teach you some front end routines. OVERWORKED Fe head cashiers though. Work hours are okay if you need a Part time job only. Great job for young college kids wanting experience. Bonuses only paid if you get large amounts of warentee credit card apps on front end.
good,The store really rallied around the community needs. Managers were pretty easy to talk to. Most employees were great to work with. The store has a way of making it fun to come to work.
good,Great Place to work fast paced meet several different  types of people. The culture there is great. Opportunity for advancement is good if you are willing to travel.
good,"Must  enjoy people/customer interaction.  Always something to do whether answering customer questions, suggesting and finding merchandise or arranging shelved merchandise."
good,"Home Depot is an awesome company to work for but I had 2 degrees and it only paid $10 a hour starting off and just raised minimum raise to $11. I think, they should consider minimum wage at $15 ."
good,"Home Depot is a good company, especially if you're 18 and looking for your first job. The manual labor can be hard, but everyone is very helpful. The managers are helpful and energetic."
good,"In my position, a typical day at work is fast paced and nonstop because we are the point people for customers and, in large part, for the employees. Essentially, we're expected to know everything about products, services, store policies and rules - and I'm learning it! The company provides excellent ongoing training and encourages employees to learn more than just the minimum by offering a large library of online learning materials. Compared to the industries I was in before, the management is a bit haphazard. I'm used to management being more organized and tougher. Employees are very encouraging and supportive of each other. It's a very friendly employee atmosphere. The worst part of the job is being the point person for customers. When there's a problem, we hear about it and have to resolve it, even when the problem is caused by someone else. Customers can get very angry and upset, but we help them and make sure they leave satisfied. That's our job. The best part of the job is the people - both customers and employees. Most of the customers are friendly and appreciate our efforts to provide excellent customer service. The employees watch out for each other."
good,"Its a good company to work for. Offers great benefits. Compensation could be better, however there are bonuses given every six months and the amount depends on how the store performs."
good,"worked the early morning merchandising (MET) team. Work itself was fine but kind of monotonous. Pay was good. I also liked the hours and big seasonal resets."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work at . The benefits are great especially the 401 and stock plan . The associate there are very knowledgeable of what they doing always put customer first
good,"It’s difficult to describe a typical day as every day was different. Generally, my day began by logging into my computer and till and checking for any messages that may have come in overnight. After those were completed, the day consisted of maintaining the appearance of the portion of the store I was responsible for, interacting with customers and assisting staff and customers where and as needed. I learned how to operate the forklift and reach truck, while those certificates expired when I left, the knowledge is invaluable. Management at the supervisory level was terrific and we constantly had meetings, both scheduled and impromptu to discuss any policy or procedural issues that came up. Upper management, not to their discredit, was focused on sales numbers and logistics moreso than individual relations with front line staff. The culture was friendly and supportive. I still frequently interact with former colleagues whether in store or just in the general public. The hardest part, or the part I personally disliked, was selling credit to customers and being pressured from above to make those credit sales. I truly enjoyed helping other staff and customers in whatever way I was able to"
good,"The Home depot set the bar for what a job should be, with mandatory breaks at the 2 & 6 hour mark, with a lunch break right at the 4 hour mark. It was irksome, after all I had done, all I had trained for, and after 2 years of a solid, above & beyond performance, to only get a $0.40 raise to my already low pay of $8.00 an hour. It was even more annoying that, despite being trained for supervisory roles, to be passed over for each one to people who had just been hired in to fill vacancies that should have gone to those with seniority."
good,Enjoyed my coworkers and Associates.  They consistently overcame challenges faced and we worked closely together to achieve our goals.  My Team quickly adjusted to new work requirements and helped meet out joint goals.
good,"Working at The Home Depot was an interesting and new experience. I have never worked in a retail setting before, and none like a home improvement store. I was a Lumber Sales Associate, and my job was to service customers and have them buy our lumber products. This was an alright job that required many hours on your feet and walking around. The environment was mostly laid back, but the management was very stringent on meeting sale's quotas and we had daily morning meetings. I learned a great deal about customer service and sales while working at The Home Depot. It was also a fantastic place to work to enhance team-building skills. The hardest part of this job was the early hours - having to be at work by 5 or 6 AM, but other than that it was an enjoyable experience."
good,This is a good place to work for the interim while looking for another job in my field. Flexible hours for part time work and somewhat handicapped condition.
good,"You can expect to be on your feet all day working in a warehouse. With that said however, you will be constantly moving. There is always a project or something to do, so if you like to stay busy, this is the job for you."
good,"Which I like ""hands on"" kind of work, be busy all the time.  Always had something to do.  Alot of customer service.  Loading and onloading truck.  Good place to work at."
good,"its a well run company but day to day experience is highly dependent upon the coworkers in your store. since there is a lot of turnover as you might expect in retail, sometimes there can be conflict and unpleasant behavior that may or may not be addressed by management"
good,"Sent banks to the registers so they could open, count all the money and make up a deposit."
good,"As a Service Desk associate you will be asked to process refunds, answer all store level credit related questions, create and manage orders whether they be online, in stock, or special orders, receive calls, and assist the order fulfillment team with pulling orders when needed. "
good,Sometimes slow and relaxing but other times fast and crazy. As a lumber associate your job is to stock and pull down lumber from overhead but most of the time your being drug to another department to help.
good,"the feeling of belonging to a community is very important to The Home Depot, very diverse and accepting. The hours are decent for part time and full time employees."
good,"Started with high hopes of upper management and everything they posed was true, Management followed through with what they promised.  Pleasant work environment. Enjoyed the co-workers and got along with management. The best thing was seeing customers satisfied."
good,"The management has changed and not for the better. There is a click there that are all women. Not that it is bad but, Not good when everything revolves around the group."
good,If you are liked by the managers you are treated fairly. Otherwise things can get tricky. The company does offer good benefits. A little pricey but good.
good,"The work environment was fun, the co-workers are fantastic. At my time management was good. I left because I was scheduled 4 hours for a 2 week period a month straight."
good,"Everyone was nice, knowledgeable and easy to work with."
good,"The hours are good,Home Depot has a really good culture, has on going training, and possibilities for advancement."
good,I really liked working for the company just needed more than 13hrs a week also was looking to move up in company but couldn't get there you had to be interviewed so it felt like sometimes the person who didn't put effort into their work got to better area's than you. You did get a profit sharing check every 6 months. They did offer family medical leaveb
good,If you do you're work and don't slack off the job is fine. I enjoyed helping customers while I was a Garden associate and keeping the holes in the wall/aisles filled.
good,"This is a very good company to work for while in college or someone who would like to be a  manager in retail. If you like working with the public this is a job for you. Homedepot does not care if you have no experience, for they will train you and will have senior employees help you every step of the way. This company will allow you to go from department to department until you find the right one. This is not a company to work at if you are not strong. You will walk on the average of 10 miles on an 8-hour shift and will lift boxes throughout your shift, so you can get rid of your gym membership."
good,"Good company to work for. Raises could be more often and larger to account for the rising cost of living. There is sombre favoritism from management,  but overall,  management is fair."
good,"The ideas behind home depot are great but the execution is not. The idea of creating a postive work enviroment was awesome but when you have sexist, lazy, and downright rude bosses it makes it a hard place to work sometimes"
good,"Clock into work find my apron and head down to my department to greet my crew. I learned you don't know the job and position of the job until you are there by yourself working. Management was always gone before I clocked in. The hardest part of the job was being there alone with 5+ customers asking for certain cuts and needing assistance. the most enjoyable is having a full team in the morning because we can get everything done and get out at "
good,"Working at the Home Depot was fun and rewarding,but communication between associates and employees was sub standard.At times, days were very stressful because of the lack of communication between fellow associates."
good,Worked on multiple registers and in different departments so it was pleasant to be able to move about the store and work in different departments like gardening and the pro register.  Lots of cash handling and working with people from other departments as well as the ability to grow myself.  Although I was satisfied being a cashier.  I also worked at the service desk doing refunds and payments and returns.
good,"I really loved working there. But it is hard getting more hours. Everything was great, just need more hours. Everyone teaches you new things and you get training every month base on which department you work in."
good,This is a good place to start a working career and learn how to work through the corporate structure. can be a career if you are not working to raise a family or need to improve your situation.
good,"A good place to work. Opportunities for advancement available. Very good health and safety regulations. Benefit package good for full time, fair for part time. Opportunity to get heavy lifting licences on various machines"
good,Deal with incoming stock deliveries during the night by assisting in unloading trucks. Sort out received items and make piles according to types of materials. transport freight to the sales floors after sorting and ensuring that sufficient quantity has been delivered. Ensure that items are marked properly before they are sent to the sales floor.
good,I really appreciate my time at the home depot but i felt like because i was so proficient n my current position the powers at be did not want to see me move on for advancement for fear it may hurt them in the one singular location.
good,"A typical day in Home Depot began with checking your job list to see what you were assigned for the day and which area. Areas include,  inside and outside garden, mulch wall, tractor aisle, plants, etc.  The hardest part about working at Home Depot was working outside in the heat. The most enjoyable was working with the staff."
good,"I really loved working with my customers and helping them with their needs.  I became so familiar with our products, I felt I was a big help. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the fast pace."
good,"Stock shelves, help customers locate products and point out the differences and benefits. Hours worked are known a week in advance, so planning your life is not too difficult. Home Depot has a number of in-store training materials via the computer based training platform."
good,Been at home depot for two and a half years good place to work good people good relationship hard work do a lot of heveay lifting drive folklft and reach truck load and unload lumber help customers pick online orders and contractors orders get them ready to be shippedi
good,"Flexible hours for someone who wants to make a little extra money. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. Management not so much. Wish there was a clothing stipend, went through several pairs of shoes."
good,The store i worked for management is not great they only care about numbers not their people. only favorites get awards. upper management do not coach their supervisors just expect them to know how to get everything done in a super short dead line. moral has went out the door thats why that store is failing and has the highest turn over.
good,"It is a great company to work for if you are working full-time. "
good,"Our office is a faced paced, customer service driven business. Our goal is to help customers in anyway we can. We learn new skills everyday to take care of out business. Management is always there to help and support. The office atmosphere is that of a large family."
good,"I loved my job, when I was given adequate time to do it. My biggest complaint about being a designer at HD was their unrealistic expectations for not just sales of kitchens but other services. My work was constantly interrupted by customers from other departments needing help, or customers within my department needing help but my priority was to sell kitchens & baths which was a very time consuming process. Designing kitchens is difficult, time consuming and very easy to make costly mistakes especially when you are interrupted."
good,"good place to work but sometime quite busy.good staff and very cooperative."
good,"A typical day at work for me is.."
good,"Employees for the most part were very hard working and friendly. Management however would overwork certain departments, however they are willing to help out their workers."
good,"The job itself wasn't stressful, it was all the meetings and other things they expected you to attend, that would put you behind in your work. I learned to watch my back because its very competitive there! The building is great there is a huge cafe with every type of food you could want, a Starbucks, CVS, Gym, Massage, Oil Change. The parking deck is a nightmare to get out of and if you are running late in the morning you will never find a parking spot."
good,Don't let yourself get stuck here because you think you'll end up with a high paying job. Those jobs only go to people that have worked there through college and have degrees specifically for the Home Depot.
good,Good overall process and service. 100 % commission position that consisted of setting appointments and generating leads to proved consultation for client remodeling goals
good,"During my time at Home Depot, I learned to be professional leader with expertise in financial reporting and operational process improvement.  The job afforded me the opportunity to develop a strong use of project management, analytics, marketing and financial modeling to drive strategic recommendations that have a positive impact on the bottom line results. I was able to execute strategy through collaborating in process for business leaders, field management and internal customers.  I was able to manage a dynamic team."
good,"A typical day in the winter is slow, spring time or any warm time really it's pretty fast paced."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work for. They were very good to me. They provided ongoing computer tutorials along with quizzes making sure one would score well on quiz before continuing. "
good,"a typical day at work, and enjoyable, but the problem is I'm a part timer, and I want to be a full time associate, so in other words, I'm trying to find elsewhere"
good,"was a part time but I enjoy working with people, some time scheduling was not appropriate, management was very friendly and fair, I have the opportunity to learn several jobs,standing for long terms, fellow workers"
good,"I feel the training program works the best. they make sure that there is always safety first for there employees."
good,Migration city...lots of new technologies and changes are taken place within IT and Security. Faced paced and leading the way in IT as it relates to retail.
good,Underpaid for the amount of work being completed. Great work environment and great people. Easy to learn as well as helpful staff. Management is very lackluster and aren’t around very often.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work, especially if you are younger, and want more work experience. Employees were friendly and made work more enjoyable."
good,"Management promotes good ideas and individual thought. "
good,I worked at Home Depot close to a decade ago so I'm not sure how much the culture has changed. I enjoyed the first store I worked at in  Mississippi but the second store I was at in Wisconsin was not run as well. To each his own
good,Wasnt a bad jod with i was going to college as a kid but no real money to be made a lot of working for a .90cent raise for two years of my service's in the garden department
good,"Home Depot was an interesting place to work at, the people were alright depending on if you keep your personal information at home. Working there made me feel like I was still in high school, just one little thing you say will explode in gossip and go around the store. I like some of the people I worked at but not all of them."
good,This area expected very long work days. Some upper management were not ethical. The benefits are very good and flexible. The company as a whole has a wonderful culture.
good,"Great place to work, however it is a minimum wage job and they do so much more than minimum wage work. "
good,loved working with the people but hated the management and how the store was Runned . I liked the Benefits they offered and the vacation and sick time was given. they gave me a lot of experience on customer services.
good,I did not have many hours to work because I was part-time. I had to work weekdays and weekends I barely had time with my family because they wanted me to work all day because of many people calling out. It was a great place to work but i was pregnant and I was not able to work for long.
good,A good place to work for retail.  Management is very supportive of employee issues.  Atmosphere was employee oriented and safety conscienscous.  Most enjoyable part is the job was interacting with customers.
good,"It’s a great way to polish your customer service skills, meet great caring people. Learn to multitask and show leadership. Very organize place. Good place to learn different things about home improvement"
good,the most people focused Company i have ever worked for.  About 90% of all positions are promoted from within.  In distribution there is a ridiculous amount of focus on building a fun and engaging environment.
good,"it is a fun place to work, where you can learn about anything you might want to regarding home improvement. Just don't expect too much along the lines of pay or benefits. Great job for a retiree, or young person's first job."
good,"Overall working at Home Depot was a decent job, the Management was the best, but overall it wasn't a terrible place to work, especially because it was pretty relaxed."
good,Worked in will call and got to work with many customers.  The people I worked with were really nice and helpful and the customer was the most important part of the job. I had a great manager and enjoyed working with all my coworkers.
good,"Being a cashier is one thing they try to break the monotony by giving breaks every couple hours but they should let other people switch cashiering and cross train in the store so its fair. Typical day is at the register handling a lot of people that need their supplies. The management knows how to make you laugh so that's not bad, the hardest part is trying to pace your day. The most enjoyable part is getting off work and going home."
good,"While it was a very busy place at times, the management wasn't that helpful. In fact they where very passive and didn't want to solve anything that was in need of help. It was very hard to work there at times. While i did enjoy working there, the management and the expectations that they gave you for the deliveries team and the ofa "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of laughter, learning, and high fives.  I learned that promotion only comes from our Creator and not from people.  Management was awesome and the workplace culture was full of smiles, candy, and balloons."
good,The main thing I don't life about my job is how they say they don't have hours to give or that it's a slow season yet they are out here hiring new people and shortening others hours. I've been trying to get full time for months now and they shortened my hours and give someone else who has changed departments like 5 times the position I wanted.
good,If you have no idea what you want to do in life... Work at the Home Depot. A typical day you Clock in proceed to your department and clean by organizing the product on the shelf and maintaining a clean floor help customers and help with various projects with customers or with your team. The best part is you decide. If you just wanna be a customer driven associate you can totally do that or you can be the hard working one and either is acceptable. Priorities are taught from the beginning so its impossible to make big mistakes.
good,Loved Home Depot when I started. The philosophy for customer service was unmatched at the time. The more the company grew the less those values mattered.
good,Management is good and they’re flexible with schedules. You’re standing for your entire shift and pay is lower than it should be. They bring in food when you work holidays. They offer profit sharing when they meet or exceed their goals. You can take extra (unpaid) time off if you need to. They frequently offer snacks or lunch.
good,My job is always challenging. Not at all hard sine I've had years of experience for Retail. I definitely learned something about myself I thought I couldn't do.I interact with lots of customer every day and I lead my team to the best of their abilities whenever I am working. I enjoy taking care of my team and support their needs when dealing with customers.
good,if you like to compete this is the job for you. 4 days on the job an a 3 day weekend. Hard to move up the ladder but it all depends on your effort on trying to move up as well. have to earn respect from peers an leaders
good,Great place to work at and great learning environment.       The workers are very bright people and great to be around. When I first started at The Home Depot I didn't know much about my department but within about a week I learned just about everything I needed to know to be a productive member in my department.
good,The Home Depot  was a fast paced work environment that gave me the skills to multi task in a busy setting. I was responsible for maintaining displays and aisles to their best intended appearance.
good,"Full time positions very hard to come by.  If you got one, then the potential was there to be moved around to different positions - some people liked it, others did not, especially since you might not be familiar with the area of expertise, like plumbing or electrical - and if a customer comes in and you can't answer a question - makes you look bad."
good,"was great as a temporary job, but i defiantly applied for a full time position and went to the interview for a full time position and was given a part time."
good,"Its a great company to work for, especially if a student. They have great benefits, yet hours do tend to go down during the winter months if you are a part-time employee."
good,I really enjoyed working at home depot but I felt like I was recognized for the work I put in and I wanted to get full time but they wouldn't give it to me which made me have to start looking for other jobs. I would love to go back but I needed the hours.
good,"Es buena empresa para laborar, hay buen ambiente de trabajo, los gerentes de las tiendas tienen buena relación con sus empleados. Buen trato y una empresa noble."
good,"My experience with the home depot has been good mainly due to the fact that the people whom I work with in my department are as hard working and genuine as myself,  which makes getting things done easy. They are the only reason I still remain at the corporation. Otherwise, because of an over weighing workload to payout ratio, I would no longer be interested in working at the establishment"
good,"Who doesn't enjoy work at the ""orange box?"". Home Depot is a fantastic workplace the employees are very attentive to the customer needs and looks for ways to exceed the customer's expectations."
good,Relaxed place with wonderful people to work with. Ability to learn about different product that people need. Helping customers finish their projects they're working on.
good,"Solid values, people based, driven for results.  Top home improvement retailer in the world, continuing to grow sales and market share.  Stable company, great vision"
good,"I really like working a Home Depot, but the scheduling is very challenging. There is NO consistency; you might start at 7am one day, then at noon the next. Days off are not consecutive unless you are taking a block of time off. As crazy as this is, it is a schedule that every employee follows; full time Managers and part-timers alike. I guess that consistent policy has its advantages. "
good,Very extensive training for all the job types I experienced. Honestly the best I've had at any job I've had. There is a lot of room for advancement if you want to and prove yourself through your work ethic which is great. If you like to learn about things that are useful for everyday life this could be a great experience for you. My only gripe with this employer is the relatively low pay rate and being non-union which may not be as important to you than it is for me.
good,"My departments were never lacking in customers. The work was always fast paced and there was always something else to be done once you finished your current task. I learned how to accommodate customers in a fast, efficient way, and customer satisfaction was the top priority."
good,"HD continues to cut hours on the sales floor.They have improved basic pay but I feel they need to have more flexibility in offering pay to prospects. Perhaps we could hire and retain more individuals with higher qualifications. "
good,"Alot of hours, have to have full flexiablity in order to really get the job and in order to get promoted to full time. very hard to move up in the company, pay increases are not that great, you do get two bonuses a year depending on your stores sales."
good,I would walk through the facility and make sure all items were in their proper place on the shelves.  I help with keeping the store clean and debris from the floor to prevent any accident.  Half of my work day I worked on the register to check out customers.  If needed I would assist customers with their items to their cars.
good,High stress fast paced work environment. Compensation was relative to work load but at times had a poor work/life balance. Benefits were better than average.
good,"overall was an okay job, not a great job if you have a family to support because the pay is not a lot unless you are higher up. Wish there could've been more opportunity to grow at the location I was at"
good,"it was a fun place to work at , great environment and cultural diversity an every aspect. the job performance allows one  to grow, if carefully mange."
good,"The Home Depot is an above average retail environment. They have a great training regimen to get you prepared for the department you will be working in. If you're looking for a company that gives you an excellent chance to get a jump start on you retirement, their 401K and stock purchase plans are top notch."
good,Positive and genuinely good people to work with. My fellow associates are by far the best thing about Home Depot. I sitll work there but unsure if I will stay.
good,"A lot of good people will leave good companies if their management is horrible. A good manager is a leader he doesn’t just delegate, he shows he possesses the knowledge to do the jobs he’s requesting you to take over."
good,"Working at the Home Depot I was located at brought both stress and fun each day. Working with your fellow associates always made the days seem to go by fast and added some fun along the way, however certain departments within the store placed too much pressure on completing certain tasks during the course of a shift that it made it difficult to reach those goals, which then in tern depending on your department head made it seem like you weren't working at all. Over all Home Depot is a good company to work for but it brings high stress, high work load and at times no reward for hard work."
good,It was fun working there. You meet a lot of people nice and nasty. Learn how to use register and products. Great personnel and not to bad working conditions.. I would work there again if I want to.
good,home  depot is an ok  place to work for if you are young hard working and looking for advancement but they offer little money to start with and very hard to get any full time work
good,"I truly loved my job at Home Depot. I enjoyed the Management and atmosphere at this job. However, I was not compensated for the work that was needed. I worked in the Lumber Department with was very task devoted and only made a little over minimal wage."
good,"A good place to work if you don't have problems with your feet on hard cement floors. The managers I had were pretty fair people and the people I worked with in the hardware area were good people also. At times the paint department was a little too fast paced with not enough help."
good,"I was a part time cashier and I usually worked a flexible schedule which meant opening, closing or mid shifts.  Each week was usually about 20-25 hours.  The front end supervisors each had their own style of managing, but the last FES worked well with all of the cashiers to make the check out process for customers as positive as we could make it."
good,"relaxed and at the same time pressured "
good,Good place to work as a Veterans. Enjoyed working there. The management are staff are easy going and pay close attention to the needs of their staff and mostly their customers
good,"Great place to learn but job security is not a desire when you are part time, as they would call you at the last minutes that you do not need to come to work on that day..."
good,The stores huge size provides lots of room to move around. You won't feel cluttered or claustrophobic and will mostly be working on your own with occasional interaction with other co-workers from time to time.
good,"buen lugar para trabajar y para aprender, buena experiencia"
good,"Very busy but not much training offered that really aplies, most of the co workers were great but management was not so great."
good,"Co-workers and management are very approachable, good working environment, clear cut expectations, support and encouragement from management, opportunities to grow as an employee."
good,"Worked there for 3 years and started to move up the ranks. Plenty of opportunity to learn, but you definitely have to seek it out yourself. The one issue I had is the management, they don't offer much support and don't give you the time of day. They always pass you off to one of the supervisors who weren't equipped to handle the specific issue. Other than the management issue, I loved my job. We had a great team amongst supervisors and within the departments as well. We could go to each other for help and bounced ideas off each other as well. The benefits were average, but they just introduced paid maternity and paternity leave, so they're trying. The schedule as an associate is great, set shifts so you can plan your days easier. As a supervisor, kiss your social and family life goodbye. You work anywhere between 6 am to midnight any given week and it's always changing. I stepped down to associate and was much happier."
good,"Interacting with and other associates is enjoyable. The work hours are reasonable, though at times dealing with difficult customers can be stressful, The work environment is usually pleasant, but at times management fails to listen suggestions from associates."
good,"Good company to work for just wish they gave more hours and paid a little better, hours are too flexable, hard to know how many hours you are going to have week to week. also schedules change weekly had to plan anything."
good,"Typically at work I come and I either start helping in the paint desk if there's customers who need paint mixed or I go into the aisles and start helping customers there and packing down the product we need. Also I throw away any empty boxes and clean up if there's any mess."
good,"I worked there as a cashier, paint consultant, returns cashier and service desk and also a garden consultant. I would help customers in any way possible if I could not find the answers or the product I would find the correct person who could. On certain Saturdays I helped with he children's work shop and during different seasons I helped build different displays."
good,"My particular Home Depot is a pretty good workplace where the general employees and the management get along decently. As you'd expect with retail, there are complaints about the management not doing enough work however, I find that is not necessarily the case. The management can be harsh about deadlines and tend to make it clear when the deadlines are not met. This seems typically for retail. An average day at Home Depot is usually filled with tasks that are simple enough to complete, but still enough of them to make the day fly by. If you are a self-driven employee that wants to learn then it is a great place to learn a lot about all the different aspects in home improvement and can teach you many legitimate life skills. I have personally learned all about two new departs and, by just working here, I am confident enough in these departs now to recommend techniques to customers."
good,"Good work place environment. Hard work no help in the evenings. Sales, followup, cleaning and presentation for the next day. the hardest part is packing out those heave doors."
good,"I love meeting new people everyday.I have learned a lot on the products i sell ."
good,"This is probably one of the easiest jobs I’ve had. I mostly worked on the garden or lumber register. For the pay, it really wasn’t bad. I can’t live off the pay on my own, no, but if you live at home or your spouse provides the main income, this is a good job. On a typical day, I helped customers and checked out their orders. When there weren’t customers, it would get really boring. There’s not a whole lot to do. Sometimes, I brought my homework to work on during those moments. The management is so-so, it could be worse. Just keep in mind, not everyone wants to be your friend. They might act nice in front of you, but stab you in the back later on. Don’t trust everyone. I will say though, there are a lot of nice people that work here, so don’t get down and out about the “fake” people. Just be careful, play your cards right, and do your best."
good,Even tho i wasn't with the company that long. The time i was i learned a lot and feel their is lots of room for advancement its all what you put in. As i was 8 months pregnant the staff helped me as i needed after having my son i didn't return as i was also working another job where my loyalty lied. I would go back tho.
good,It’s a great company to shop and good quality products to purchase. Continue to shop for the experience with the associates. Provided great customer service and product info.
good,It is a great place to begin a work life and build of it but not good enough to make a living of. Great place to grow in and you learn a lot of different things for working there.
good,"your Management team and floor associates become family. day to day not an easy job when dealing with 40-50+ customers a day but you get to learn a lot, from customers/associates, from classes and also by reading the products box. everyday is different form 0 to 100, but one of the coolest things I've noticed was no matter what crazy day you've had your fellow associates understands cause they probably have a crazier day, fun fun"
good,"Low salary"
good,"Culture is great , free food some times, hard working people there and a great environment to work in. Many friendly people there.would of like longer breaks"
good,The culture and diversity of The Home Depot is unmatched in my experiences. The opportunity for advancement is there. Its all about how hard you work and not who you know. Would recommend to anyone.
good,The Home Depot was ok to work for.  The downside is being an online order picker and having to pick large orders of wood and trying to find good pieces of wood for the customers.
good,I feel like the experience can really be judge on each store location. Different people and different cultures of the different cities can make or break the desire to work at these stores. (Customers are a large factor)
good,"Assisting customers and stocking. You learn a lot about home repairs and products that you can apply to your own projects. Over all a good place to work."
good,its a fun place to work. but the hours could be better part time doesn't give you enough to survive on at all. but they have some parties and other things do the workers that are fun to get involved in.
good,"Great employer, room for advancement, amazing  benefits, great managers (for the most part), can be stressful when store is busy.The other associates are always helpful."
good,"•	Offer complete customer service"
good,"Home Depot will make it difficult to get fired, however your enjoyment at the job is completely up to you. Its work, and you have a job to do. If you dont mind working then you will be fine. If you do then you are not going to enjoy yourself as much."
good,"I believe Home Depot can do way better"
good,"Work was really stressful. One week could be really good hours the next week yould have 3 or 4 days of work. During the week, you never know which department is going be short staffed. Especially after a certain time. After a certain time, sometimes there will be no loader. Some says its slow and some days it's one customer after another. Some days its a head cashier and maybe 2 or 3 cashiers and they will crowd together and talk amongst themselves"
good,"Period worked at Home Depot was not long enough to give a comprehensive review. I, however, admired the working relationships between management and workers."
good,"Very hard to get a good raise. People just starting makes the same as others who have worked there for 2 or 3 years. Very lopsided pay, some make drastically different money for doing the same job."
good,"Great Assistant management and team leadership.  "
good,"very fast paced and demanding work. A lot of very nice people to work with and a lot has been learned from the home depot.I like the core values of the home depot, and they take care of their employees."
good,MET position at the Home Depot is a good part time position with this company.  It offers a fairly flexible schedule with decent pay and possible raises yearly.
good,"I started out as overnight freight in 6 months I was offered full-time in garden department. Homedepot has it's pro and cons but at the end of the day for it to be a ""JOB"" you kinda have a set schedule if your part time, u get sick time , vacation,  401k and every 6 months a success sharing check regardless of the amount it's free money. If you like to work stay busy, completing task and help customers its nothing but opportunity to move up the ladder. Every job has it's drama but it's up to you. Homedepot is worth it."
good,it was ok . id showed up check people out. some are nice some are mean. you know typical customers at a retail store. co workers are fun tho but pay suck benefits kinda suck too. not bad for a part time job
good,"Assist customer with their kitchen remodeling projects. Design and created, and customized kitchen based on wall dimensions. Provided customers with knowledge and information about various products."
good,"Great company,  but each store is different depending on the management. "
good,The job is wonderful but when it comes to management they favor certain employees. There is too many issues working the Front end with other employees. i love working there. I love the customers but i just need to find a career and not just a job.
good,"The company is very employee friendly. often during stressful times they feed employees and play games. some management dissensions are questionable and/or show favoritism. the company is very good, the facility as well, just some common middle management issues."
good,a very good place to work and to grow  in the company open door company  very good for climbing up the retail ladder very busy good customer skills be very friendly.
good,"i was only seasonal, i only worked there for three months. i liked it boss was nice and so was the staff .  i learned a lot about flowers and lawn mowers. home depot takes proud in there staff being knowledgeable"
good,I enjoy this job tremendously and have had many opportunities to learn different area's just not enough to achieve full time status. I would enjoy this opportunity to stay at this job.
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. I was a seasonal employee and was treated as less than a hired employee. all around not a bad experience. Would work again.
good,"The company is okay, it's got a strong family enviornment however it seems there's not always a fairness in what's going on. inappropriate work hour distribution"
good,"Not bad.  I'm just on leave from Home Depot, and I plan to rejoin them in the summer.  The hours are low if it's your only job, and although there are good benefits available to part-timers there's also not very many hours that part-timers can work.  Expect a max of 27 hours per week for part-timers and reasonably to get about 20."
good,Extremely busy physically demanding. Retail is a challenging and sometimes unrewarding field. Staff and regular customers make it fun. Satisfying to help customers with their projects.
good,"The most enjoyable part working for this company is the experience and skills i have learned  over the years and the ability to satisfy and help customers. The hardest part of the job is satisfying the upper management. Other then that, the company is enjoyable to work for and benefits are good."
good,"I've been a Front End Cashier for almost 6 months, now. I love Customer Service and as the last face of The Home Depot, at the register, I get ample opportunity to give the customer the best experiences they could have."
good,This is a good company to work for and they will take the time to train as long as you take a interest in the advancements and the business metrics and how you can impact them and turn them into sales
good,i worked in Home Depot's garden recovery program as a seasonal associate during my time there i met alot of nice individuals the work was fun nice pace environment i got to work outside and enjoy the weather overall was a good experience and i would do it again in a heart beat.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Home Depot as a cashier but would have liked to try a department position, as cashier became repetitive and mundane. Learned many handy skills and learned about tons of products which was interesting. I also learned about lumber and building materials and how they are used. The demographic of people who shop there is a nice change from typical retail at a clothing store or in the mall for example. The hours were very flexible and it was easy to rearrange shifts or have shifts covered / receive time off."
good,"I have been working as a cashier for 9 months now. Other Associates are friendly, and management is good. Hard to get full time as a cashier and hard to move up unless you have been working there for a while."
good,the home depot worked with my schedule when i was in school and was willing to work with me. a good place to work with some advancement and a desire to hire within for management positions.
good,You have to be able to multitask. Make the right decisions to get the customers taken care of. Must have a flexible schedule.be a quick learner and just do your job.
good,"Everyone within the store is family, we try to take care of each other as much as we can. However the labor can be difficult and The Home Depot needs to review it's monartary policys and pay every better."
good,"The review of the overall workplace at the Home Depot, I would give an 3.5 rating.  My fellow employees are very professional and take pride with regard to their jobs. Unfortunately, my management crew needs an little more insight with respect to taking care of the employees needs."
good,"I was working full time in Houston, TX and I had to move to Wichita, KS.  The company actually let me transfer so I didn't have to worry about having a job when I moved which is nice.  It has a pretty good culture and the positions I've worked have been fast paced in a good environment."
good,"But they started cutting hours. We weren't making anything. So I moved on. "
good,The Home Depot provides a great starting point for those interested in retail but is not a place for much career advancement. I worked there for almost a year as a Lot Associate and was never mentioned as much of a candidate for any position higher dispite the consistent praise of higher-ups.
good,"Excellent benefits program, never mind for retail.  Good opportunities to advance but are fickle and often move employees with little to no consultation."
good,Daily work is consisted on customer care in aiding and solving customer problems and providing help finding loading and choosing products as well as maintaining inventory and aesthetics to work area sometimes with the use of lift equipment.
good,Depending on your position it could be really fast paced or really slow. Typical days are usually a good pace. You have to be able to multi-task and also have good customer service.
good,"very fast pace setting, the work environment is great and friendly associates. it is best if you are a college student and need flexible hours. but most people that work their full time have to find a second job just because the cost of living is high."
good,"I truly enjoy working with the leadership team. They are fair and honest, however the drama brought by floor associates is why I'm likingfor other work. It causes a negative work environment"
good,This place was a fine place to work. The only thing that's not so great about it is the customers will always prefer a male associate and management as well.
good,Es una empresa responsable en el giro de materiales y articulos para el hogar y tiene un ambiente de trabajo normal
good,"I worked here over the summer and enjoyed my time. While not being incredible, it still taught me a lot of lessons, and allowed me to meet plenty of new people, and working on numerous projects."
good,"The Home Depot is a great job opportunity for anyone that wants it. despite the issues that were management flaws, I loved my job. I started as a receiving associate, and advanced to a supervisor in paint, and floor and wall department."
good,"This company like some of the other big companies like to purge out older and more expensive managers for newer candidates.  It was a good company to work for regards to compensation, vacations, time off and work / home balance."
good,"Everyday is challenging at the Home Depot.  From Customer Service, store appearance, stocking shelves, to meeting sales goals every day is very challenging but no matter what work will never be finished.  On the other side of things, working as a team, having fun and enjoying hearing about projects customers were working on or whatever it may be, the Home Depot really is a great place to work."
good,The management was very friendly and approachable; fellow staff members were welcoming and ready to help. Your safety and wellbeing are important alongside your performance.
good,"Home Depot encourages it's associates to gain more knowledge to move up and about products. Benefits provided are the best i have ever seen and definitely worth applying.  The salary is not the best, but there are yearly raises."
good,"Good environment. I worked with great people , great organization , I enjoyed my time there working in the lot pushing carts and helping customers load."
good,"Day to day pay, good benefits, you wont get rich there. They are way too politically correct and their culture makes no two bones about it.  just a bit too liberal for my taste, but to each his own."
good,"A nice place to work with dinners provided regularly, but hourly rates should be higher.  For the most part, Assistant Store Managers are very good and very supportive."
good,"It was a seasonal job.  Since the garden department is mostly outside, bottled water was always provided to the employees.  You have to be willing to get to work before 5:30 am, if you plan to work the day shift."
good,"Okay work environment, low wages, not enough hours, high turnover, little chance for advancement. long delays for repairs and updates.  New employees are not trained well."
good,"I started working there this summer, and I have really gotten to know everyone. It is a great workplace for any student. The typical day is standing behind the service desk. Usually just answering the phone and transferring calls, doing returns, and checking customers out."
good,"When walking in the door first thing walking up to all your associate checking  up on them to see if they need any help. Procced to follow up on customer issues, on installs, and special order items to find ETA. Walk Department for search for any customers looking for help. Making a work list to see what else needs to be done, packing down to fill holes, cleaning up the aisle to make them shoppable. Very end look to see if I still need to finish my Smart list, Accuracy review, and Product orders."
good,typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and helping them with their needs.  the hardest part of the job was the physical demand of the job.
good,"There was a high turnover rate. At the time management wasn't the best. They do work with school schedules and leave of absences well. The flexibility is great for students, parents, or if something pops up where you need to be gone for a bit."
good,"manager are hard to work with. you have the rude & close minded ones, than the easy going that understand you. i'm a very ""i got to do what i got to do"" type of worker. easy going & if i'm told to do something, ill just do it. so far after a year home depot has . treated me with the up most respect."
good,"As a part-time employee who worked for the company for the summer, I can say that you will obtain exceptional cashier work experience while working for Home Depot. It may be stressful at times because you have to ""scan"" items without a bar code. But, regardless, the person who trained me was excellent and helped me know how to figure out the information or look up the product in the computer. The Home Depot is a hardware store therefore it is understandable that not every product can have a bar code--items such as washer or screws. While it may be stressful sometimes, employees are trained well and obtain valuable experience as cashiers that will help in any other cashier position in any other company."
good,Great people but not so great management and mangers. Very good flexibility with time and school. I worked in the company for aboute 2 years I was first a cashier the I was responsible  for sells.
good,"good retirement planning"
good,"A typical day at work was preparing my team For the job functions we need in order to meet our goals for the day."
good,This is a fast paced environment and it allows you to learn many aspects of home improvement projects that will not only teach you how to fix and improve your living space but enable you to assist the customer. Management works along side the associate and they also encourage the associates to help in the community. The culture is that of people who have worked in various trades that are primarily related to home improvement. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demands of the consumer. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers to assist them in completing their projects to improve their home.
good,The Home Depot is a good job for someone looking for a place to work while in/straight Out of school. It’s provides you with skills you will need in future hands on jobs.
good,The Home Depot is a not a terrible place to work but it really all depend on your management team. That can really make or break the job in my option.
good,"sometime days were hard when register were down, and or customers were in bad mood.  i learned a lot of patients.  management was some good and some did not like."
good,It was a great experience to work at this place. They trained and   certified me to run heavy equipment. I made great friends there and was a fun experience for me.
good,"Always more to learn.  99% of the folks in my department are on-time to work, making the days run smoothly.  Most everyone is interested in making sure the customer is treated fairly.  There's lots of teamwork."
good,very fast customer oriented environment. great training and management support. you will learn about many home improvement skills. great team building workshops. great recognition of your efforts.
good,"I think Home Depot overall it is a very nice place to work for, a little stressful when it comes to your break times, 15 minutes and you have to walk all the way to the back to the back of the building to take off your apron and leave it in your locker, than take your break (including your bathroom break_ and then go back to your locker to retrieve your apron, (you cannot have you apron with you when you go on break!!!) Then go back to work if you are late 1 minute they page you to come back.... doing all of this it takes away from your 15 minute break about 10 minutes  (if you rush)  leaving you. with 5 minutes if you are lucky to maybe grab a bite or a coffee!! Hopefully no customers stop you to ask a question because what can you say...... SORRY MY SUPERVISOR WILL GET MY HEAD IF I AM LATE!!!!"
good,"A typical day was helping customers with their needs/wants in choices of new or upgraded kitchen/bath design. I learned a lot about listening more to the customer and giving them exactly what they wanted. The hardest part of the job was when there was not customers needing help and business was slow.  The hardest part was helping in different areas I was not trained in, but I would adapt to the situations at hand."
good,"Okay place to work. Low stress place to work. They left you alone to do your job, which was great. you could advance at your own pace. The hours were good for me."
good,check what orders for what needed to be pulled. learned a lot where product is and what most of the products are used for. Sometimes management would depends on what was it. Loading the trucks on time because sometimes there was mistakes on the order that we needed to fix before the diver had to leave. There were some days that we were not busy so you could go around do customer sevice.
good,"Great company to work for, they do a lot for the community. company provides great career opportunities and pay is fair for the market. Would gladly work for them again"
good,"As a Merchandising Execution Associate (MEA), it's a non-stop day. Breaks and lunch are the only times when there isn't a task to perform.  Project completion and bay integrity are the two most important jobs as a MEA. The job is constantly changing and improving, and procedures are updated by Corporate often.It's a challenge to get through the tasking while helping customers as needed.  This job is not ""customer"" oriented as the Merchandising Execution Team's (MET) main customer is the vendor who is paying MET to keep their products on the shelf and shoppable by the store customer. We are a strong team due to mutual respect for each other and a like-minded goal of customer excellence."
good,"For a flooring specialist, we work together with hardliners who keep the shelves stocked.  I would have to clean all the displays and help bring in new product to the shelves that was missed before the store opens."
good,Awesone company. Seems to have gotten a little about the money and saving of money and not about the people. Cool with this store and its staff the company has been great to my family. We're just ready for better opportunity
good,A typical workday consists of helping customers with their purchase that would fit the task at hand. Also may help customer plan a job with ideas and proper tools.
good,"Home Depot is the most stable company I have ever worked for in my career. The stability is what I needed in the economic downturn in around 2008. Great benefits are offered and the equal opportunity to advance is the basis of the culture. "
good,Great place to work but the pay could be better for such a labor intensive job. Also building lumber orders was done alone. Managers are excellent. Very understanding about needing time off etc.
good,the loss prevention could use some work. you have floor walking LP's and while its not a bad thing in a place like home depot its harder to do because its easy to recognize the LP because contractors are there 3-4 times a week and they tend to be some of your low value thefts that happen often.
good,"A good place to work with room for advancement. You receive on the job training and flexible hours. A large stable well known company to work for, good coworkers  and customers."
good,Excellent part time job. Good benefits. Diverse community most of the time. moderate training. Profit sharing.Good place to work if you are interested in DIYs and/or a handyman
good,"Happy ,friendly place with a great set of work collegues,who were there to help if assistance was required . It's hard work at a fast pace as it is a profit based business ,made a lot of friends, and became a respected member of the team learned and got trained on all equipment Reach truck, order picker ,pacer unit , sit down fork lift and electric pallet jack .was also working in various departments including Garden,electrical plumbing & rock block & soil I did really well in the time I was there and achieved a Platinum award & a watch plus $100 for doing a good job .also had several pay raises in the short time I was employed"
good,"I work hard   They notice and you get raises.  You can also get bonus rewards for good customer service or going beyond.  Helpful to be able to speak some Spanish.  Need to have the go and just do it attitude  and they will notice.  be able to have some product knowledge, learn it and be able to give good customer service.  They will notice."
good,good company to work for work life balance is not the best but overall it has great benefits and compensation . The hpme depot is a good place to work and I would recommend for the knowledge gained alone.
good,"Unfortunately Do to Poor Management at It Didn't Make For the best of that situation, a career change was for the best at that time otherwise it was a terrific place to work."
good,Nice place to work. Pay is not that great. Management can get a little power happy sometimes. I would recommend going tk the merchandising team. Set schedule and holidaysnoff
good,fun place to work friendly staff and great costomers fast paced work with lots of inventory reasonable hours and friendly managers would work here again if given the opurtunity.
good,"Totally enjoyable job, but as time went on management didn't seem trained as well as when started. Advancement not as easy as company describes. I really enjoyed working by myself with very little supervision."
good,I worked night shift from 7-12. Management was nice but would make you stay longer if truck wasnt finished. Nice hourly pay but not alot of hours. Great balance with life
good,Good place to work. Management was always helpful and informative. You knew your job function and had no issues as long as you did your job. Pay was a little low.
good,"Luck of the draw. I worked at multiple stores under multiple managers and it was vastly different each time. Some combinations the worst to deal with was challenging customers. Others had associates pitted against each other. The company as a whole is great, finding the right store is the challenge."
good,"Home Depot typical day is fill with all sort customers and challenges coming along with them. Besides working inside, working outside acquires you work extra hard with your hands because they don't use the cart machine there everything is by hand. The great thing about Home Depot is how the workplace culture is great."
good,"Great team dynamics allowing for tasks to get accomplished in good time, less strenuous on the employee, with good morale while maintaining safety standards. "
good,"I enjoyed working here when I was in school, as the hours were flexible and I could fit them around my classes. The pay was really good for a part-time hourly job, and I liked the people I worked with."
good,"It was an ok place to work. I do not know what else to say, Pay was not that great for the work that you were expected to do, and not all the people were treated the same."
good,"Overall its a great place to work, if you are looking for a long term career it is a possibility.  Hardest part of the job is being expected to cover multiple areas at a time, and be positive."
good,"It is a pretty good company/store if management runs it correctly, Also if workers are happy/willing to work, If work is evenly distributed and store fully staffed it can be a pleasant experience goal oriented teamwork to provided customer number 1 customer service."
good,"I liked my Job, but management changed and to focused on helping customers who do not want to be bothered while shopping. Also stretched too far, expected to do the work of more than one person. You learn a lot about building and home maintenance tools and material. Can lean from work shops to do your own projects"
good,"Provision of customer service by greeting and assisting customers, and responding to customer inquiries and complaints; instructing staff on how to handle difficult and complicated sales. Monitoring and recognition of security risks and thefts, and knowledge and recognition of loss prevention."
good,"Home Depot is a great company, with constant customer interaction, encouragement to improve yourself and strive for advancement. Problem comes down to insisting on particular customer service metrics, and then paring down the hours available to the bare minimum and thus causing there to be fewer associates available to assist customers."
good,"I would be happy to work there again, if there were more stores located within an hour from my home. I got to a point where I would have to chose between moving my family, or commuting an hour and a half one way to work a 13 hour shift."
good,Somewhat good to work for. Sometimes the managers don’t respond to customers problems. Little organization between associate and management. Overall great associates to work with.
good,"Printable instructions for how to leave a Google review, on desktop and mobile."
good,Greet customers daily to make sure they are pleased with the products and services. I learn that it pays to make someone else happy.  The Management team needs  to improve on relationship with employees. The hardest part of the job was getting more hours to work. The enjoyable part of the job was helping someone everyday.
good,"very family ore-intent great job for people in school high school or college. the management is not a big problem but needs a bit tune, but overall great place to work."
good,A typical day at Home Depot would be to assemble deliveries for the truck for the next few days and also Help customers. I learned patience and to focus on each individual task at hand! The workplace culture was very outgoing in helping others in need in inside and outside of work activities. The enjoyable part of this job is learning new things.
good,"Pay differential between department heads and worker bees is marginal at best.  Unless you are an Assistant Store Manager or Store Manager, don't expect to make a lot of money.  "
good,"Good place to work, just don't expect to make tons of money unless you move up. The benefits are great even for part time associates.  Opportunities to learn and advance are often.  Lots of great people, just wish it paid more than minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot for Freight Associates includes a daily stretch with the whole Freight team to prevent injuries after which each associate is placed in a department to start at or work for the whole shift. Once in a department each associate is to put the freight from the truck onto the shelves and any overstock goes into the bay above or directly next to its home location. "
good,Worked here part time while going to school. Pretty laid back spent most day just checking out customers and helping them find things. Sometimes I would help out in the lot or the garden as well.
good,My day consisted of cashiering and customer assistance. My job consisted of lots of standing and bending which made it hard on my back standing on concrete most of the day. There was very little room very advancement. I enjoyed being busy and assisting customers.
good,I started of as a cashier for a year and a half had the opportunity to be promoted to paint department worked there also for the same amount of time. had a chance to experience the Décor Department in between. Really learned a lot there and paid off in the long run.
good,Hours change weekly customers are not always friendly but they are always right. Heavy lifting .Store meeting very early in the morning.Other salespeople very freindly
good,"Always something to do, always something to get done. Job keeps you busy the whole 8 hrs during your day. There are multiple roles within the store. There is the store associates who help customers, Each department has a department supervisor, the merchandising team that fixes things within the store."
good,Home Depot provides excellent introductory training for all employees and a wealth of training opportunities.  They enforce a fair and safe workplace. They celebrate team successes regularly often with free lunches and other treats.
good,My experience in the home improvement industry has helped my understanding of the vast array of products available for the do it your self home repair person.
good,"Cashiers help customers with check out. Process payments"
good,"worked 40 hours a week. great training when hands on, also had computer training. hardest part of the job is when customers line up and theirs nobody around to grab one and go."
good,"The Home Depot provides a nice work place environment for not only Young Adults, coming out of High School, College Students whom need a place of employment while attending to their curriculum. It even makes room for the elderly and almost retired to find work."
good,For those who enjoy working with the public this is a great opportunity. Each day is different from the last which will keep you on your toes. Be prepared for things not to go as planned.
good,"I have not been working at this company long enough to form a beneficial opinion. As it is at the moment it appears that there is no time for equipment training or personal development nurturing to ensure that new employees are up to speed with operational procedures and commitments. Basically, the structured training doctrine that is provided is not being followed but new employees are expected to know how to perform the tasks within it."
good,"It can be fun working here, if working with the right people. Although the early hours can exhaust you by the time you leave for the day. You get a bonus twice a year. If your store places high in the district, you get a lot. If your store places low, then you get a small bonus."
good,Good people good company just not good for single mom who wants to spend time with her kid. When you are a supervisor and are full time you have to be fully flexible with your hours. They can schedule you for any shift they need you for.
good,"Training was extremely helpful for the area assignments, and for transition to other areas.They were accommodating to work/life balance, and flexible schedules.  Very easy to work with for the time off needed for personal reasons."
good,"Great company to work for, pay could have been better. The raises that were given were cost of living, company could have provided better benefits for part time employees, no benefits for part timers. Hours could have been more consistent."
good,"Very busy work, overall a challenging but rather awarding experience. Breaks were distributed well, there was much training to use. Other co-workers were very friendly and welcoming."
good,"Working with your Orange associates is always a blast. It's a friendly enviornment thrown in with some sticks in the mud you find everywhere. Luckily management that had been there is gone and that's for the better. Regulars are recognized and people pick their favorite cashiers to go to through checkout. It was honestly a blast to work for, it's a shame they had the wrong people leading when I was there."
good,"Lots to do every day,lots to learn more up fast but pay is not enough to move up fun place to work for short time good first job working weekend's was the worst"
good,"There are so many things that they are good but also have some many things that are bad. Good things are like part-timers we have almost the same benefits like full-timers, the bad is the lack of people scheduling to work"
good,"I do enjoy working for The Home Depot. the culture, training, and opportunity that they have given me is great."
good,"Customers usually are friendly and are regulars so you recognize a lot of them and build friendly relationships with them which makes work fun and also brings customers back. It is easy to learn other things in other departments if you ask. You have to have tough skin sometimes when it gets busy and customers need help are in a hurry. Some experiences don't go too well and its cashiers job to fix it, or at least try to. Co-workers are like family."
good,It was a nice place to work with great pay and benefits-even for part-time. The customers are very sexual/sexist towards women workers. It is an easy job that can get chaotic at times. It can be demanding and very stressful.
good,Great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. You don't have to know a thing about home improvement in order to feel like you belong here.
good,"Enjoyed working in fast paced environment, fellow co-workers made it a fun place to work. Liked helping customers on the floor, as well as at registers."
good,"At the time working there, the company was good to employees, they offer stocks at a discount price to employees and during hurricane they help to provide supplies to their employees."
good,"Greet. engage and assist customers."
good,"This is another situation where certain inequities and stress factors are a part of the culture. I think companies, in particular large conglomorates don't make enough time to deal directly with employees. Policies and procedures have blanket implementation and that is just a major part of the culture.  As a result in most cases, not all, you have a disjointed steam roller that won't fail unless you just allow it to run off a cliff.  My personal opinion of course."
good,"• Actively seeking out customers to assess their needs and provide assistance."
good,"The best part of this job is the people. If customer service is your thing, anyone can be great at this job. The management style I found to be effective and upward mobility a possibility. But this is not a long-term job. As the pay and benefits are minimal and the work culture can start to get contaminated after too many years of being on the front line."
good,I was able to work in multiple departments and was even able to start an management training program there as well. This is a great company to work for.
good,Lots of room for advancement if you put in the effort and don't mind the hours. Great job for young people just out of High School to learn what the workforce is all about.
good,"I actually really liked working for the Home Depot!! Would have made it more worthwhile if the pay was better. This is not the job for someone who has been working all there life, due to very low pay!! This would be great for someone right out of high school, or someone attending college looking for something part time to help pay with tuition which I don’t know if it would even help. Also could be good for a retiree looking for something part time. Downfall of the job was the pay, which was extremely low. Also only part time with no benefits. Pretty hard to be excited to work under these circumstances, especially when you have a family like myself. Other than that was a great company and work atmosphere. I only worked for Home Depot for 3 weeks until I found something for double the pay!! Hope this helps when applying for a position within the company"
good,Nice to work for and sales associates to work with.
good,"Pay is low, job is fun, good people , technology is improving, work can be very physical, there is room for advancement, very busy all the time, would reccomend"
good,"Fast paced work environment "
good,"I liked the homedepot i made alot of friends over there and the opportunitys they opened up for me to learn more was good , everything was a little basic on things i already knew but other than that it was a good place to be at ."
good,"Great company overall.  No place like it.  Culturally diverse and rewarding work.  Lay-offs are fairly frequent and to be expected.  Many opportunities, but highly competitive."
good,There's always something new to learn everyday and interaction with customers can be rewarding and challenging at the same time. It is a very welcoming atmosphere combined with energetic and knowledgable workforce.
good,"Associates are on their feet all day, always stocking shelves, helping customers, getting returns, putting returns up. The work environment is okay if you have friends there, other than that it is mostly older people."
good,I love working at the Home Depot as a Merchandiser. The hours I work are unmatched in the Industry. I work from 5am to 130pm. I'm usually working on projects or resets which means I basically manage myself. When my boss is not in I act as the supervisor.
good,I worked part-time with a set schedule I worked from 8pm- 1am Monday- Thursday and had 3 day weekends. There were not really many benefits offered for part-times but I didn't really care because I am a college student.
good,"Some what pre-ductive work inviroment, can you go to the bathroom there as needed? and when do you get lunch break there?Playing the pool sharks game in your eye."
good,"The Home Depot has a well-established culture, oriented toward providing outstanding customer service. Associates can expect to be trained thoroughly, and learn more as they work. The greatest part of the job is knowing all of the ways you helped your local community. From the Kids Workshop program, and Team Depot projects, providing aid to veterans, all the way down to helping small business owners find the tools to do their jobs, you aren't just getting paid to sell things, you're getting paid to help people."
good,"Loved working with customers , helping them pick out there tools to fit there home dyi projects , carpets , tiles etc. Home Depot was a nice place to work but not really able to make enough money to afford to be able to live ."
good,The concept that customers are always right need to be looked at more closely.Sometimes it is the responsibility of the employee to to what is right for the company. If a customer is  in the wrong it should be a way the employee should not feel they have violate any rules when they have to talk to a customer.
good,"I loved my job. But people don't really quit their jobs, they quit their bosses. I got to work with cashiers, help motivate them, and have great interactions with my co-workers and customers. Then we got new management and every thing changed. Now I dread going to work every day. My supervisor is a hypocrite and doesn't support us at all and when she is finally forced by her boss to interact with us it is the biggest inconvenience and all the does it gripe and yell at us when she doesn't even know what we do on a daily basis to make up for her not doing her job. She is why I hate my job."
good,Great people great place and fun location to work. Everyday is different and every customer is different. Customers are nice and appreciate what you do for them.
good,Home Depot work place is kind and will help with any questions asked. The work is easy to get with simple tasks explained by the employees to help train you. Furthermore the management is easy to talk to helps with any questions and will also enlighten you in information need for your knowledge at the Home Depot.
good,"I had a very nice time working at the Home Depot, they are accommodating to students who are in need of a flexible schedule. I had the chance to work at two different locations and in that aspect both were the same. Management on the other hand was hard to work for. They promote people who are not knowledgeable and are not professional towards their associates."
good,Home depot offers various opportunity to advance ones career with very flexible hours and the ability to transfer to any are within the store. It's one of the better jobs I've had.
good,"As a head cashier, i am responsibly for taking care of the front in, helping our cashiers and our lot associates. The people are very friendly and willing to help where needed. We have regular customers that come to the store daily and I enjoy everyone because they come with a story to tell you. You will enjoy working for Home Depot."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work, with advancement opportunities available right up to CEO. They treat their employees fairly and have superb benefits."
good,"Work Friendly, great people to be around with positive attitude and a desire to improve the company. Free forklift classes are offered to anybody looking forward to advance."
good,"The Basic job is good but all too often you must put up with customers - which many are truly dishonest and often worse.  Liked the people I worked with and for the most part the company - but scheduling was very non-standard - and stress of dealing with people who would purchase and item and then use it and then return it because they ""DID NOT REALLY LIKE IT"" -  Then the same people would come back and get the same tool (like a lawn mower) month after month.  I cannot handle dishonest people!  Lots of moving and lifting!"
good,Freight. Worked nights. Brought product from the trucks to the aisles to be stocked or put away. Worked with the same people almost every night and same manger.
good,"Not enough hours or money for me to live on .People and managers are great the culture of good customer care is great and all the co workers are excellent,all the management is excellent and great too along with the computer training is very helpful."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work depending on the position you have. Parts of the store operation are just unfair to any person holding the position and compensation does not even come close to making it justifiable, while other areas of the business outside the store carry a much better opportunity to thrive."
good,"It was tough to switch gears and learn the different types of paints and tools for use performing an interior job as it differed from the exterior jobs. But, once I got the general knowledge between the two it was easier to upsale on what brand of paint to suggest to customers that needed assistance with their do it yourself projects."
good,Needs more product training and stricter cell phone use polices but I could see this as a life time career except for the fact I'm trying to relocate.
good,The employee culture is friendly and happy place to work. Fulfilling customer needs is essential. Having a  fast paced environment with a lot of customers in the store makes the time go by faster. I feel welcomed by all members and happy to be a part of the family.
good,"Always a learning opportunity at Home Depot, with excellent job training, but typical retail working schedule. Days, nights, weekends, it makes it difficult with a family."
good,Great place to work lots of lifting so if you have a problem lifting stuff then this would not be the place for you. I worked the night shift so it was great and the people were friendly and helpful. You have to be able to work independently and as a team to make sure things get done. The manager was cool very easy going and easy to talk to if you had any concerns or issues.
good,Good people and enviroment. Fast passed which is good because it makes the shift go by quickly. Freight team is a temporary seasonal position and it is overnight shift.
good,Typical day is to support influx of products into store through Receiving providing leadership and guidance to both receiving and freight teams and overseeing all products coming into store.
good,"Pros"
good,"A typical day at work: Help customers and stock down shelves "
good,Retail Manager work a lot of hours.  Loved helping out people and solving problems.  Hard getting everything done with amount of people you had.  Good benefits
good,I started as a cashier and the went to returns. From returns I went to customer service to head cashier and to front end supervusor. It's a lot like babysitting when you work with mostly college kids
good,"Worked with really good people. Job was steady. "
good,THD creates a culture of family and promoting sales in the industry by providing good customer service. The best part is the people and relationships built while the job can be stressful at times as well.
good,Good part time job for students. The pay is low and hours few. The management and staff are friendly. Job is slow pace mostly focused on customer service.
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a nice place to work at. The hours are flexible and the job is generally rewarding and fun. Some departments require more labour and messy work however. The customers are generally kind and pleasant but there are some nasty people who can really get under your skin. The biggest issue has always been with management, from store managers all the way down to department supervisors. Far too many incompetent and unpleasant managers and it can really make or break your experience there."
good,There are many great people working at the Home Depot. The culture was varied depending on the current store management team. Strong managers make for a great work environment.
good,"fast paced, room for advancement.  Poor compensation given for expectations of the job.  Management is focused on providing customer care, not so much for employees."
good,Really a great and fun place to work.  The only challenge was that the salary was very low and did not allow for the proper way to provide for a family.
good,"The Company is great however, it is only as good as your direct leader.  Take the opportunity to find where you fit best and grow in that position.  Look for opportunities to increase your knowledge as the training is not consistent with the expectations."
good,"maintain and stock the hardware and tool aisles, helping customers to find what they need to complete the job they are working on, also helping with any task management has appointed to me and completing it in a timely manner"
good,"a typical day at work consisted of clocking in heading into your department and assisting customers or stocking shelves"
good,could stick around for while.would recommend for new job or starting as your first job would definitely learn a thing or two.can't say much about pay its pretty much the same.
good,Busy during the spring and summer season. Not enough employees during those peak times. Salary could be better I believe that is why its hard to keep people.
good,work with flooring customer advising various flooring possibilities for their home. Set up a home measuring plan with items customer has selected.Review customers' plan and make the sale. Fun working with a variety of age group customers was the best part of the job. No commission on the sale.
good,Home Depot was a good place to work with all the benefits you could get.  You are on your feet walking a lot so make sure you have good shoes .Electrical stayed busy with contractors and customers needs.
good,"good place to work; offer OT when available. Free luncheons and good benefits for the associates.'"
good,Home depot is a fast paced work environment. More professional employees and training needed. To advance an employee he must first be trained. Internal promotions will increase moral and sustainability.
good,Home depot is a family like company. They take care of each other as employees. I love to come ib and get to know the customers and help them with thier projects.
good,The Home Depot provides all the training you need to succeed as an associate. If you have the drive and commitment you will do well in this company. Management does not always get things right however their open door policy makes sure everyone has a voice.
good,"Working at graveyard shift is very fast work. I love organizing products and using the machinery everyday. The work is very demanding, but I liked working in a fast work environment."
good,4 years of woking in Home Depot Rapid Deployment Center. 55-60 hour work weeks.  Does allow advancement but there are glass ceilings in place. Learned leadership fundamentals.
good,"I love what I do and the people I get to interact with.  Most days fly right by because we are so busy."
good,"Great company, loyal associates, tangible shift from appreciation to should have done better regardless of achievements by district/regional management."
good,Its a good place to learn about how to repair your home.  Very hard to get fire from here. Just come to work and don't steal and you will be alright. I do feel they push credit cards a little to hard but other than that a good place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working with the associates and felt at ease within the work place. Supervision was very attentive to my needs and concerns. I received the proper equipment when ever I ask, needed to complete my assignments."
good,After many years working with the company management had changed and the store moved in a different direction. Things became a little difficult as expectations grew for certain people and i personally felt it was unfair.
good,"Entry level is not worth the time, unless you plan on advancing. Fantastic team work and friendly employees. Very flexible with hours for retail (will let you work 1 day a week with school)."
good,It's very dependent on which location you get but not all managers are the same. My store manager was a great person but some of the managers weren't.
good,get clocked in and start helping those customers other workers and managers are helpful and want everyone to do great. Loved working with customers. But you will always come second if they think they can make more money instead of what good fro the people
good,"Typical day starts out with clocking in and heading to Receiving to begin unloading the truck. After being given the rundown on what's going on in the store and new rules and procedures by our supervisor, we then begin putting together the floor layout of carts that hold department specific freight. Normally after the freight is done we'll roll it out onto the floor, then once all freight is emptied from Receiving we'll take our 15 Minute break. After break we'll do one of two things: Bay Directive or help stock shelfs. after the shift is up we'll clock out and head home."
good,"Great company to work for, many fields to use different skills and talents. Always training to learn more if you want to advance or move around. Lots of service and interactions with customers."
good,I love my customer base. Working and being able to help Customer sand build relationships was a wonderful experience. While working at The Home Depot I learned many different skills I can use anywhere else.
good,"The work can be fast paced and need to learn to balance your job duties with customer service. Management can depend by department, overall it was a fairly friendly environment."
good,"1) A typical day at work for me was all about customer satisfaction. Always meet or exceed the expectations of you (as an employee)."
good,i loved working for this company it was a really great job with wonderful people i really wish i would have worked for them for a longer period of time but due to special reasons i had to go
good,"A typical work day for me was to help customers with purchasing appliances. I really enjoyed working with customers and understanding their needs, but when it came down to management , they were hard to find, and when you did find some had attitudes about helping the associate and the customers. Management was not totally supportive."
good,"Depending on your department, you can have a lot to learn and maintain and after you grow with the knowledge, the job becomes boring. Decent pay and benefits and the opportunity to advance is good, generally. But, you can generally get a good sense of the jobs at Home Depot just by being a customer."
good,Home depot takes care of it's employees although a lot of dedication is required to look good in the eyes of your supervisors. The pay is good for anyone who first gets a job
good,"Employees and supervisors were approachable, was hard to get a hold of a manager and while working there for less than a year ive gone through 5 different managers. Moving up in that field was hard since they would rather hire outside people than those who are there and have experience. ive seen a lot of people quit for they have been offered a position and went through the training while they hired someone else for the same position."
good,The store I first worked in was high volume which was good for me because I like to stay busy at work.  After a while I transferred to a slower store in another state and it became more vexing because it wasn't very busy so it wasn't much to do there.
good,"A typical day at homedepot depending on what department you work in pretty much consists of providing customer service to the customers, working your department which includes checking shelves for out and filling them and doing shelf maintenance. Coworkers are all friendly and get along with one another. The pay could be better but it isn't horrible considering the benefits the company provides like vision and dental which are even available to part timers."
good,"I work at the home depot for 3 years now and overall, It has been a good experience. I am trained in all departments and trained on every machine in the store. managers are"
good,Helping customers are always a pleasure especially when they are satisfied with the service provided. Hardest part of the job is there are no set schedule.
good,"Unload floor / pallet load trucks."
good,"good people to work with, just not enough hours, or benefits. good job to start with just more interested in a career at this point in my and time in my life"
good,Home Depot was a great company to work for. If there were issues management usually listened and addressed those issues. However some felt that they under valued hard working employees.
good,As a cashier the job was mind numbingly slow at times and way too busy at others. The lead cashiers were mainly nice but some were power tripping. Seasonal work was hard but satisfying. Head management were also power tripping and had a seemingly hard time being kind to employees.
good,"Home depot is a great company that does its best to look out for everyone who works for them, the benefits even for part time employees is a very nice perk and management is friendly and approachable. They can be very accommodating to those you cant work full hours and odd schedules"
good,"It is a great first job, and you learn many things about homes you wouldn't know otherwise. The management is good, and the culture in the workplace is great."
good,"My job is typically assisting customers with great customer service cutting lumber to the customer's length and likeness. i also do mark downs restocking the shelves and also i operate the forklift,reach truck,stand up forklift pallet jack and more. The hardest part of the job is when there's no team work and the work place culture is cool and most of all i enjoy what i do at my job but again as i sad it's the lack of team work the makes your job hard."
good,On breaks playing ping pong with the associates is great! We have meetings that get us free lunch as well as extra snacks and ice cream. Very nice and place to work.
good,They treated you like family when you worked there but also they werent on top of the trainings. they would get upset if we didnt get the training done on time but they werent on top of letting anyone know. We would get penalize for those things.
good,wanting to move to another department is not what you know its if your personality fits the needs of the department that you are considering at the time.
good,"The Home Depot is a working warehouse. Tasks must get done while helping customers. Some days customer traffic would be slow others would be extremely busy. Regardless of how many customers needed help, all tasks were expected to get done by management."
good,the job itself was straight forward and decent. Some work place politics got in the way or it being more enjoyable and being long lasting. consistent hrs
good,There is a lot of hypocrisy and favoritism with management for certain people that they're friends with. I liked the people in my department but I did not like the DH's.
good,"I do not have anything really bad to say about Home Depot as a company. They do look out for their employees. Everything from the Homer Fund which is strictly there to help the employees who fall on hard times to 401k and stock options. They have a great pipe line to get people to the positions that they would like to have. They do a great job of building loyalty. They understand and appreciate the hard work that everyone does. That is not shown in compensation, however, advancement opportunities are everywhere. That would be the only complaint. Specially as a specialist you are required to do a lot more follow-up then what you are really compensated for. Specialist are, however, on the short list for management. So that's the advantage."
good,"Great place to work, the environment is friendly, there are a lot of young associates that are professional and some that are not, which make the supervisor's tend to treat us like children."
good,"The foundation of Home Depot is strong, it's a business that will surely never lose a step as long as the Seattle housing market continues to blow up and one that (in theory, anyways) is built on treating customers and associates as the most treasured entities in their business model."
good,A job is only what you make of it. If you approach your everyday in a positive attitude and remain positive nothing can take that from you. There will be times you mayhave to adjust but the experience is great
good,the work environment was an experience for me to help prepare me for future industries that I may be involve in. The people were enjoyable to work with and I learned a lot from them.
good,Working sales in The Home Depot is a battle of will with your customers. They make demands on a daily basis and you need to be strong enough to roll with the punches.
good,"I loved the opportunity to learn about the many products that the store sold.  I even help in the assembly of shelves and built storage binds at the banister road HD in 1997.  the working hours were very unstable some days you get off at 7 am and had to be back at work at 2 pm.  I worked in plumbing, hardware customer service, flooring, lawn and gardening, millwork, and switchboard, basket retriever, and deliveries.  Boy what an experience The hourly pay in Kansas City was very lucrative for this area."
good,A day of work is nonstop movement and always busy. I learned how to run a cash register and a mix bag of how to sell some products. Management is give lots of helpful tips.  The hardest part of the job was staying in one spot instead of moving around . The enjoyable part of the job for me was making sure customers left happy and satisfied with their experience shopping.
good,Load and unload delivery truck to customer's job sites. Organize items for will call and online orders for customers within the store.Participate in inventory and on going loss prevention exercises.
good,"Always busy helping customers or working in the store, high energy with positive energy. Long amounts of time on your feet, and 15 minute breaks 3 times a day."
good,Great experience being able to work for one of the biggest home decor chains. It was a learning curb for me dealing with new perspectives in a home. Tearing out old kitchen cabinets and building a home owners dream kitchen.
good,"You get what you put into your job, management requires heavy commitment and over 50 hours a week. Remember you are at a job, not a place to have fun it will not matter in the end."
good,To much time required covering other departments.Learned how to become a better salesperson.learned how better to organize and manage my work time.Covering multiple areas and customers at the same time was pretty difficult.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their projects.
good,I do sales and have customer interaction every day. Helping customers find the tools and accessories needed to do and finish  their projects. when not assisting customers we are usually busy stocking shelves or putting away returns.
good,Quick paced and great place to work for relaxed place to work and able to learn or advanced by on hands te aiming and certification for all the different machines.
good,"Home Depot was a nice experience as a job the work was busy with customer needs, unloading trucks, Forklift driving, Cleaning, but not enough workers to complete the required jobs and, management was not understanding of that with tell us to speed up"
good,Cooking out on holidays made up a little for working them.  Short staffed made having to work other department uncomfortable.  Heavy lifting and outdoor weather sometimes.
good,"Great work environment, friendly employees, fair management. Solid company to work for, crushes competition, encourages advancement from within. will teach you life skills."
good,"I believe the Garden Department offers opportunities to always learn.  Our customers have an insatiable desire to achieve and it’s very gratifying to have return customers seek me out for additional advice.  The spring, summer and fall present our peak periods of business while winter is our slowest period.  The workplace culture is diverse and young workers are difficult to retain because of attendance issues etc.  Management has their hands full monitoring the low performers, however, they recognize those who are hard workers with rewards such as Homer Awards.  The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy products and it’s stresses that employees “team” when objects are too heavy for one individual to lift.  For me the most enjoyable part of the job is the interpersonal relationships you gain in meeting new employees."
good,"Hours are limited after any holiday. When associates call out for illness, etc., the shift is not covered and makes it difficult to run the department alone during busy times."
good,"Great Company Morale, Paid Holidays, Vacation, and good medical benefits, success sharing twice a year, there’s also great opportunities for growth and development. The managers are very open to feedback and will usually take it into consideration to make changes as needed. Home Depot takes very good care of their employees. Associates are empowered to assist their customers and make decisions without always needing permission from leadership First. They are always implementing new Ideas to make the work-Life balance easier."
good,good company to work for fun quick pace team work coworkers friendly home depot was loud exciting every day to meet new customers help every one. home depot would teach you a lot of deco plumbing kitchen and bath.
good,very good place to work if you like to be hands-on and enjoy home improvement retail. the management is also very good and professional well the store that I worked in.
good,"It’s a great place to work depending on what department you’re in. Also, having a decent manager makes all the difference in the world. They can make it very hard or very easy to work there."
good,This was a fun place to have had a job. I would tell anyone in need of work to give this company your time. It was fun and helpful. As well as enjoyable for time to be spent.
good,They don’t pay the employees enough . Ther d poor management in most departments. They want you to work very hard and they take the credit for it. There are good benefits
good,"good benefits and family oriented.  job advancement  for those with the right qualfication, great learing progams , mangement  growth oppurtunitys and advancemen"
good,"Fast paced, constant movement.    No work life balance.  Constant pressure to acheieve number"
good,"Employees are friendly.  "
good,"typical day consisted of coming in and check computer for any classes needed to do, get the orders for the day, and then start pulling. At the end of the day manager checks orders going out for the next day and you go home. Most of management is easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job is all the lifting. the people you work with are great its like a family atmosphere"
good,"The dynamic of the job depends on the store, which includes customer, supervision, management and most of all your peers. Work is fun if the environment is conducive to such. If not, work is not fun and is more of a teeth-puller than an option"
good,Overall it is a great company that really cares about it's employees. Being retail as with ALL retail it does use 110% of you. There were many benefits that are not listed like a Ham at Christmas and meals for those working over the Holidays...all the holidays.
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work.  They are pretty decent about trying to accommodate for family events and the management really does want to do well and be good to you.  "
good,"I enjoy my part time employment at Home Depot and work with some incredible associates. My day to day job as a freight associate requires putting freight out on the shelves and in the overhead. The job is not demanding and does not require a higher education, but it does require common sense and the ability to streamline and minimize time walking around. I work mainly in the plumbing department and have learned a lot concerning bathroom installation, leaking faucets and fixing water problems. The hardest part of my job is walking on the concrete floor and lifting boxes that are over 50 pounds, even with the use of the electric ladder. I absolutely believe  the management team is always working to improve the associates' well being and the customers' experiences."
good,Decent place to work for someone young or going to school. They have decent opportunities to advance in the company regardless of education. Pay is not great but what do you expect when working this sort of job.
good,I was temp employee from Staffmark hiring agency. The managers for Staffmark were okay at best. The job itself was simple. You would go and get you tickets from the ticket desk. From there you scan your tickets and drive to your picks on an electric pallet jack. Pick items directly onto pallet then stage the pallets at the bay doors.
good,"A typical day was tiring but also challenging and fulfilling. I always had room for growth, and management was always willing to teach me more responsibilities when I could handle more. My supervisor was very encouraging and supportive-- team meeting helped a lot in fostering teamwork. There was lots of positive reinforcement as well as constructive criticism. I learned that I could excel quickly, and that my organizational skills were strong. The hardest part I experienced was that I didn't get sleep during dark hours, and it was taxing on me during inventory season. I enjoyed that the job allowed me to simultaneously work independently and with a team."
good,"MET has a set schedule, so it was very consistent with optional overtime around the busier times of the year; and benefits were good.  However, pay was minimal and management was not to keen to allow more.  There was also a power struggle between store and district management, so issues had a tendency to get looked over instead of taken care of."
good,"Busy days."
good,I believe working at The Home Depot is a good experience. The Environment is great. But the Home Depot isnt good in terms of raise and Salary/Hourly pay.
good,"My co-workers are a second family. Retail work is very demanding and stressful but we work as a team and that makes it much better. I love and enjoy being a supervisor/salesman. I supervise two departments that combine for sales little over 3 million yearly. That is a great accomplishment for me. The biggest issue is the scheduled shifts change week to week, there isn't any consistency."
good,As a cashier there would always be a steady flow of customers and you had to be ready to help everyone. As a floor associate you needed to be able to handle stocking shelves and also help customers carry or load some of the bigger purchases.
good,"Very Friendly group of people. Was nice to work for a short time, some people worked there for a very long time enjoyed the benefits. I did not recieve benefits because i was only working there for a short time. Was a good place to get experience."
good,at least when i worked there the management was just blah no advancement just another cog in the system to move boxes. some managers were better than others day vs night shift was not balanced well attitude was bad although it was falsely promoted as positive the whole time
good,"It was been, overall, a great experience working for this company. They take great care of their associates and workers and uphold good values. It is a heavy and physically intense job and it is not for everyone, but it is always enjoyable and there's always something to learn."
good,"Quality of life at Home Depot is dependent on where you end up working. When I started I loved the job. As soon as management changed throughout the store, the workplace became a poorly micromanaged mess. But again this was my personal experience at this particular location."
good,"Working at the call center, we of course are over the phone customer service. We had some really great times, but the negative experiences over the phone definitely starts to get ones morale and motivation down. The positives were fantastic though, working for such a huge company had its perks when it came to taking care of our people. Overall it is a good place to work if someone is able to handle irate customer about their online orders."
good,"It was stressful and management would not agree to one thing and would cause associates to become overwhelmed. There was too much micro managing going on in the store I worked in that Supervisors felt they couldn't do anything because management would step over Supervisors and their associates to do other thing that were important to them but to the store. I did ask for a raise and wanted to get $16.00 an hour for everything they were starting to ask of me, but it was denied. I will be honest, I believe that it all depends in what store you work in, because I do miss working for The Home Depot and I do wish to go back soon. There are so many benefits and the associates and all workers treat each other like family and help each other out. That was one thing I loved about it. It was GREAT!!!!!"
good,"Wish my hours were consistent with each other. I enjoy some of the people I work with, but there are some that aren't someone I want to interact with."
good,Company offers lots of great benefits to its associates.  They take excellent care of their customers. Positions are hard to advance to mainly due to longevity of employees.
good,"An overall good place to work. Days fly by with the number of customers.If you are up for a fast paced place to work, you will love it. Customer Service is very busy but a great department to work in."
good,They have a lot of flexible schedules. Very good about time off and willing to let you move up in the company.  Can move up within your own store or transfer to another if they have the job you want.
good,Rewarding and fun great place to work. Rotating shifts took some getting used to. Enjoyed working with the public in the electrical department answering questions and helping customers solve problems.
good,be prepared to work and get dirty. there is a lot of turnover and various departments to find a place in. Management does a good job at delegating work
good,Great work environment and company. No problem with management and coworkers are also easy to get along with. Work hours are nice and breaks as well as lunches allow for the associate to feel refreshed.
good,The General manager was spineless. He would say he would do something then not do it and avoid you for the next few weeks instead of telling you up front the rules or whatever his reason was.
good,"Working in any Home Depot store as a floor sales associate you are to cover as many different departments from Garden to Hardware to Lumber as needed and you learn as you go. Part time associates get the most flexibility in choosing the hours they want to work, FT associates may be scheduled to work a closing shift one night then have to open the very next morning without a say. During store hours an associate's main responsibility is to assist customers and when there are none there is plenty of cleaning, down stocking and general service to be done."
good,"Its not the best place to work if you are looking for a constant schedule. For students it is not in your best interest, although great culture and benefits"
good,"I worked in one of the departments with the highest turn over: the garden department. Although the work was stressful and high paced, I found a way to enjoy every shift."
good,"overall was ok, the job work life balance was awful, "
good,It is a very fast-paced job. it rarely slows down. Multiple positions and cross training allowed. The workers are really friendly and welcoming. Great discounts to other places and things.
good,"Worked there for two years just trying to get through school at the time.  Worked the front end as a cashier and then a head cashier. Could rekey locks if needed and knew a majority of departments within the store. I could also mix paint, cut carpet and worked the service desk"
good,"Typical day of work; work 5am to 1:30 PM. Merchandise product sections across the store, insuring sections are set to POG, all pricing tags are on the shelves, the section is decontaminated ( dusted, trash and or products not belonging in the specific section removed) and the filling of product stock from the overheads( filling low and out of stock items on the shelf)."
good,"As customer service is as varied as the customer dealt with, every day and experience was another opportunity to learn and develop.  Mostly with management guidance but sometimes alone. it was a good learning experience  for the timespan."
good,"Depending on your position you can learn a lot about certain things. I was in Home & Garden and had just moved to Arizona from Indiana.  So getting a chance to learn about flora of the surrounding area was very interesting and helped me to appreciate my home more. "
good,overall it was a good place to get some part time hours.  The management seamed pretty superficial at times but preety easy to work for.  the hours were mostly on the weekend and the customers could get quit aggitaded alot of the time becuase it got so crowed.
good,"- most enjoyable part of the job was the people to work with, everyone, for the most part was very easy to get along with and full of ideas."
good,"They provide you with many tools to succeed, and they offer great benefits.  Can be stressful at times, and management was a challenge sometimes.  I would recommend them."
good,"Not a bad place to work for. Hours are very flexible, the dress code is very laid back, however, the only drawback is that they put the schedule out like 3 weeks in advance so you have to put in for days off very early."
good,"load and unload trucks, move material from the receiving area throughout the store, operate forklifts, perform critical functions for maintaining proper on-hands and pricing for customers, and excellent customer service skills."
good,"Company respects work ethic of grownups, yet staffs like most companies, minimal.Employees do bond well like family. They have evolved to a set schedule which is good for families."
good,"This is a great place to work just wish they had more full-time positions to offer. They will give you the minimum about of hours if you let them. But at the end of the day, they are all good people"
good,"Very hard to grow as a prof in this place. Good star, but not for people with experience. Managers don't respect people with degree and background. I wish they would care about prof people more."
good,Fun and easy environment with good managment and great discounts on things outside of the company that will come in handy. Relatively easy job and interesting clientel
good,"Que es mui buena compañia "
good,"Good pay considering the work you are preforming, laid back people, the job would be absolutely amazing if there where no customers. I'd recommend it."
good,"Company likes to give out lunches whenever the store achieves a certain amount of days without an accident. Overall a good company to work at, but you have to deal with the typical retail questions."
good,"My only issue was a lack of available hours to work at times, as well as receiving minimal raises... The management are fair and willing to work with you on any possible issues."
good,"Great culture to work in. The atmosphere is very much like a family, and the company lives by the values that it sets. The downside is that management is very inconsistent across each store. Excellent place to gain knowledge and skills that will help you in managing a business."
good,"Worked overnights stocking merchandise, cleaning, baling, bundling, and moving freight. It was very labor intensive, we learned how to use heavy lift equipment.  It was overnights, so the store was closed, customer service was minimal.  Time went quickly, and we had an exceptional team."
good,A great place to learn about teamwork and getting adjusted to the working world. Employees are willing to help whenever needed and management is good with fixing a schedule.
good,"its an okay job.there are worse jobs,customers are cool for the most part,there is to much politics,to many meeting,performance reviews etc.. but overall it helped pay the bils."
good,"Always learning new things, because of the wide variety of customers we dealt with on a daily basis.  Management was very supportive of all the associates.  As we were typically the last people that customers dealt with before leaving the store, our goal was to always make sure they were smiling as they walked out the door.  "
good,They now pay their employees well. Over all it was a fun place to work with fun activities through out the year. Also has great Christmas parties with nice gifts and bonuses.
good,"Great place to learn about home improvement. "
good,It is a good place to work. They work really well with my work schedule while I am still in college. The people and regular customers are the best part of the job to me.
good,Developed and demonstrated competence with numerous products and vendors to communicate effectively and ensure customer satisfaction.  Restocked merchandise and maintained aisle assignment. Fun place to work the random shifts made the work live balance difficult.
good,I enjoyed my time while being at Home Depot. The managers I worked for were good to me. I learned many aspects of working in paint and hardware while I was there.
good,"I love it but is a place where you want to retire, if you are young and full of energy unless you want to go up the corporate ladder it should be just a temporary job."
good,Started as a Cashier and moved out onto the sales floor. There was constant training from the company and vendors. The company often implemented new goals and ideas quickly and most often times successfully. The only bad part about this job was the fact that the work schedules changed from one week to the next.
good,"Since, you are supplying supplies to contractors it can get pretty demanding and fast paced. These contractors on a tight schedule, therefore, when they arrive to the store you better have their merchandise ready."
good,"As a cashier I was responsible for cash handling, working as fast as possible, and sometimes stocking after hours. I enjoyed working in the garden department, and it was easy to get along with other employees."
good,It is a face pace working environment.  I learned a lot about home improvement and how to fix minor home projects. The hardest part was standing . The best part is helping customers.
good,"Only upper management enjoys benefits. Challenging work but one can acquire skills with perseverance.  Good camaraderie and great "
good,The expectations versus pay rate don't quite balance. I enjoyed working there but the opportunity to go full time or advance is on a very long time frame.
good,"It was a fun place to work, they were willing to help employees who did not bring food for lunch. You got to learn where the products were so that when a customer asked, you knew where to show them."
good,Good place to work if you can handle retail hours. Management both challenged and encouraged you. Most other Associates were helpful and happy to assist you during the training process.
good,"Good place to work pay is decent, found out a lot of things I didn’t know as far as home improvement. Also offer pretty good discount to employees and family."
good,Management is very focused on customer service and satisfying the customer.  You are giving the flexibility to make decisions in providing excellent customer service
good,"There is always something to do and keep you busy at the THD. The working environment is friendly. They feed you, take care of you when things happen in life, and are fun."
good,Customer service consultant to assist with special orders and deliveries to help with home improvement.We build a customer base and maintain consistent retail sales. Encourage customers to complete a survey to rate service and the potential of winning a $5000 gift card.This is a fast pace environment and the associates are training to drive forklift to move merchandise around the store.
good,"Lots of down tools to fix, have to work on customer service, have to cover for cashier work, have to cover for associate work, pay was a bit low for my job title and abilities and skills."
good,"A typical day starts with examining a bay to see what has to be down stocked. Then I would start to decontaminate each product item. If I am working in the electrical lighting I have to see if any light bulbs have to be changed The hardest part of job is going up and down ladders to down stock The management is very hands off. The work culture is friendly ,we all work together in the store to make the customer shopping experience as easy and successful as it can be."
good,"I worked Specialty Sales and enjoyed doing it, my department was mostly focused on Appliances though I had to also learning Plumbing, Hardware, Kitchen and Bath, and Flooring. When it came for my yearly raise from the minimum pay, I received one but a week later the whole company minimum was raised to the same pay as me. I felt this was unfair and management refused to make any adjustment so I left."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and they were very flexible with my schedule.  If it was for my personal issued I would had never left.  They make you feel like part of the family.  Great work environment.
good,"I wait on customers, run register and customer service, process returns/exchanges. The work is not hard, but the hours are different every week.  Sometimes work til close one night and open the next morning."
good,"Working for the Home Depot was a nice opportunity but it was retaill, which made the job stressful. The management team was good up until about a year ago and then it declined. Compensation could be better."
good,Met job starts at 5 am and gets off at 2 which is a great schedule. Level of work was about as expected in retail. Pace was very fast as home depot is a very busy place
good,"Great bennifits , Team workplace. Advancement from within. I would recommend all my past employers to a friend. Managment open door policy. liked being around and learning new departments."
good,Lots of potential for advancement. Great environment to learn various aspects in. Co-workers are like family. Management is good at times and not so good at times.
good,"It was nice working there because any help you needed they were always there to help either way. i learned good customer service skills. The job in particular was not hard at all. We had great managers who were always around when we needed them. overall, its a recomended place to work."
good,In my experience a good deal of flexibility with what your work needs can be meet.  Management is pretty good but like most places they think some of the worst workers are good despite everyone complaining about them.
good,Es muy buena empresa en la que aprendes a convivir con diferentes personas tanto como compañeros  y clientes
good,"Home Depot at West 23rd Street, Manhattan is a great place to work but you will start as a part timer. You must endure working on your feet throughout your shift. The pay is VERY LOW and the work load is physically demanding and often strenuous.  The management team are very professional and very nice people to work with.  I enjoy meeting various people and learning a lot of things."
good,"online lessons are required monthly to increase our product knowledge, it would be nice to get awarded for hard work a bit more often, we are short staffed much of the time which increases stress levels among employees"
good,I would come in and create a to do list of my department to see what needed to be done. Multitasking by helping customers and trying to get things done in the department. Also working clean to provide safety for all customers.
good,"Typical call center environment, but a bit more patient in terms of measuring performance. Culture is good and a positive place that drives performance. Management is good and does a good job of being visible to front line associates."
good,people are friendly and helpful there if you like to help people and you like to see the same faces home depot is a good job for you its not to stressful
good,"There are days where it is sometimes slow and busy. The most busiest time is in the summer. The hardest part of the job is being consistent with customer satisfaction, there will be days where no matter how many times you are nice, customers will be mean.It is something that most people adapt to as they work at the home depot. the staff is really nice and is willing to help out when asked."
good,"typical day started at 10 am too 7 pm, had to review department and straighten up the merchandise.  Meet and greet customers to determine the type of windows or doors they were interested in.workplace culture was to help the customer."
good,"at Home Depot El Paso, management do not care about employees who go above and beyond their duties and supervisors do not care about customers either."
good,At Depot I learned how to provide outstanding customer service and resolve customer issues. Ensuring all customers had a positive shopping experience.
good,"good job, loved the customers and the employees were helpful...very low pay for what you did.  management was great.  hours were very low until someone quit and then they worked you crazy hours"
good,Overall good job but low salary and high performance expectations. Store seems to perform well and caring about the importance of the employees welfare and growth
good,"Great place to learn how to sell.  A great place to receive product knowledge.  Some people who have worked there for a number of years don't seem to be pulling their own, although they are paid much more than the others.  Talent is not really recognized and used to its fullest potential.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that we are allowed to service our customers to their liking.  It seems, that recently, we don't have enough employees working at any one time to service those customers who need help."
good,"The work day consisted of making sure all potential customers were greeted and or answered on the phone."
good,manager need work with workers. a fast paced environment. must quick on your feet. simple kinda job must be a people person in order to be good at ths job.
good,"I operated the cash register designated throughout my shift as well as any duties needed to be performed"
good,es una empresa que si da siertas cosas pero acambio
good,"I learned very early working their that customer satisfaction is key in any job you are going to have, and that getting to know your coworkers can help make the day go by much faster. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and some of the customers harassing me."
good,Opportunity for advancement but have to give up day hours to obtain another position.  I still work there and will stay there until I find something that I prefer.  Overall a great place to work..
good,"I like the work pace the benefits I like working with people I'm a team player home Depot train you for all this "
good,I enjoyed giving good quality customer service at all times. Just to go in and see their smiles knowing that they were satisfied is really refreshing.
good,"Coworkers are expected to help each other out, be respectful toward one another, and learn other positions in the store. I liked these aspects of the job because it meant everyone had to work together and treat each other as equals. I never once had any trouble with coworkers or managers. Good work was rewarded and problems were addressed quickly, directly, and fairly. One day I forgot to wear appropriate work clothing. I was told to go back home and change clothes but that I didn't need to clock off because that wouldn't be fair to me. I was told it wasn't a big deal but simply to not let it happen again. Management advised me to keep a spare change of work clothes in my locker just in case. I thought that situation was dealt with in the best way possible."
good,typical overnight lumber stocker cleaned up my mess brought bunks of lumber inside rotated them and put them away alright company for a little extra income i worked there as seasonal help overnight.
good,"Home Depot is metric driven so everyone and thing is a number. They make you push for Credit Cards. If goals aren't met it is detrimental."
good,"Good people, great environment. feel welcome and comfortable at work. i started with little to no knowledge about home improvement methods and or handyman skills but have improved by leaps and bounds. learned quite a lot in the first few months."
good,"los horarios se ajustan muy bien, te capacitan diariamente, el apoyo de los compañeros de trabajo y la gerencia es bueno, tiene valores bien establecidos y todos los ponen en practica, en ocaciones el trabajo es algo estresante ya que en las horas pico de entrada de clientes no te das a basto, todo el mundo te tiende la mano para apoyarte, te hacen sentir en familia."
good,first set up for the night shift getting pallets and carts ready to unload truck. i learned how to work as a team player and helping out customers. management is excellent always there to help or listen. work culture is awesome feels like family and makes the day enjoyable. trying to help out every customer sometimes we don't have the right answer or product for them. helping each other as coworkers and the customers as well.
good,"A fun and easy going workplace with outgoing associates, typical days would consist of talking to the regular customers who are in and out of the store constantly, and scanning items finding the correct prices and making sure people leave the good deals."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work as long as you're in the right department. I did enjoy working for my supervisor.  She was a team player, always looking for ways to make the day easier, helped where ever she could.  She also got in the trenches when things got rough. They do make things convenient.  There is a CVS, on sight nurse, as well as a workout facility.  They do have cookouts during the year that everyone is invited to. The cafe has great food and they have free standing areas where you can purchase good food."
good,"Great company to work for! Very diverce company and gives back to it's employees and communities. Great benifits and I moved up pretty fast with hard work. Terrible management! Lots of issues with privacy and big turn over rate, the "" Aware "" line is not the most confidential line to call, they do not handle the situation and if you're in management you know who called the ""aware "" line on you and you still have a talk with that employee, iit has been my experience working in managment that most situations do not get resolved nor dose an investigation at  The Home Depot. Over all great place!"
good,I liked the people there but pay was decent and benefits were good but they took too much out of my pay check. They don’t pay out sick time and the scheduling is off.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, and learn. Can be very stressful. It is a great place to sharpen your skills. People skills. Work with others. Build friendships. Learn how to drive all different types of forklifts."
good,Rung up customers item also help customers find items for there homes did stock and lift garden items and answer customer questions about certain sales and items also call stock help when customers needed help with there heavy items.
good,"Great place to work, sense of family, and worth. Training on the job is all computer based. Easy to get the hang of. Other than the micromanagment that takes place it's a great place"
good,It's a good place to learn about Home maintenance and customer service. The pay is also great for a college student. I would not stay here for a career however.
good,i want to work at home depot if i got my contractor license they pay good right on time and exellent but the company that i been working is unfair payment sometimes delayed sometimes short i want to work fairly and honestly
good,Good company work for and tranning safety are nunber one priority.salaries arre competitive including bonuses and vacation paid. The company take carw of the customers and allowes wmployee to make dexision to make customers need including discounts on certain diacounted or markdowns items
good,"Once people get to know you, its like a family. We help out each other and the comminity too. Home depot takes pride in taking care of their associates."
good,"Home Depot was a very laid back work place. I enjoyed being able to meet so many different types of people. The company also provided 401K, and other insurances. Overall, my experience working at Home Depot was very successful and productive."
good,"All co workers where always there to help each other."
good,A typical day at work is busy helping customers with their purchases. I have learned patience and problem resolving with this job. The hardest part of the job is communicating with management and getting blamed by customers by something that is not my fault. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people's experience positive.
good,Part time role only.  Was able to move within areas of store to see different products.  Used what I had learned working with Lowe's stores in the past to aide in this role.
good,"I have no comment, the reason for my leaving was not a good one, I  did enjoy the experience of working with the company an my former co-workers. The management staff, were the greatest from day one! they provided me with excellent training for the future to work in retail and sales."
good,The hardest part about this job is that I was hired as a part time hourly worker.  Part time means that your employment is subjected to decreased/reduced hours based on the stores ability to generate money to pay for the amount of hours you are scheduled.  Your hours are constantly changing and your schedule is always inconsistent. What I've learned is that Part time also means that your chances of being employed for or past 12 months is non-existent.  Employers know that employment beyond the 12 month period involves the employee achieving certain milestones and possibly earning payment or compensation and/or benefits.  Employers know that it is not cost effective to retain a Part time employee past the 12 month period.  It is most advantageous to terminate the part time employee to avoid paying benefits and to Re-Hire and start the process all over again.  I love the Home Depot atmosphere and my Home Depot family.  I really felt that there were endless opportunities being employed at the Home Deport.  I was engaged and learning what it took to PROUDLY wear the ORANGE and bleed the ORANGE blood.  I worked hard and I was great co-worker...but I was also a Part time employee with an expiration date.
good,"It was nonprofessional. Very Political. Bad Pay. No advancement. You make good friends though. Now I'm Not on here to rate, I am here to look for a job."
good,This is a fast-paced environment which offers various opportunities for advancement.  Home Depot truly lives its values by taking care of its associates.  The IT organization is in the midst of transforming its software engineering into an iterative environment.
good,"being a sales associate is maintaining a calm work environment, its a very fast past job. you have to learn to multitask and juggle between any challenge that may be thrown at you. i myself am a very high past worker so i feel that working at the home depot keeps me busy enough to always be working on a project."
good,"Waiting on customers, stocking shelves and going to weekly meetings. Management had their favorites. Overall a nice place to work. Keeping departments in stock was big job and it was a personal challenge for myself that i did extremely well."
good,Great job and I loved what I did. Worked in the garden and I moved to that position surprisingly fast but the hours were up and down and you only knew what to expect around peak seasons. I loved the customers and level of responsibility and respect my team displayed at least. Other than that I to this wouldn't mind working there again if it came to it.
good,"This job was a balanced working environment , however I could only work part time so their were no benefits and it wasn't enough at the time to survive."
good,"Customer service from start to finish with lifting, pushing, pulling, and multiple body positions constantly needed.  Employee must reach out to suppliers and ensure products are delivered as expected."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to learn and grow.  They offer all kinds of educational support (both onsite learning and support for seeking higher education). The retail hours can be difficult, however, if you've proven yourself a valued team member; management tends to be supportive with the flexible schedule needed to pursue higher education. Lots of school of hard knocks type learning; real like application that can not be learned in a class room."
good,"There were times it was stressful but that is with anywhere you work, most of the time it was a fun place to work, lots of learning potential as they have you take small virtual classes for knowledge for the dept you work in to better help the customers"
good,I enjoyed working at home depot if you wanted to learn they would teach you being able to learn different things so that you could do it yourself projects was awesome. If you worked at one of the lower volume stores you have all the opportunity in the world to advance
good,"Manager had a habbit of always trying to cut hours and over work associates. A 8 hr project that requires 2 people he would want it done in 4 hours with 1 person. Manager would follow people on their break. Would call house and cell phone to discuss upcoming projects that were not due for a few weeks."
good,its a good company to work for. they offer opportunity for advancement. friendly environment. locations almost everywhere. recommended but they only hired partime
good,It has great benefits and pay sadly besides that communication is a rough area and how much the management is actually there for you. If you are in need of a accommodation or assistance make sure you speak to higher up and you have to hound them or your ignored if they listen you should be alright.
good,I worked at home depot for almost 8 years while I was there I learned a lot of different departments in the store and was very good at my job. The store I worked for had very poor management and did not treat there employees fairly. They did however pay good and had very good health benefits.
good,Home Depot is a good over all company to work for.  The company takes care of it's employees.  If sales are over plan for the quarter then you bonus.  All associates bonus including part time.  Home Depot offers every associate a percentage raise yearly.  Overall this company is good.
good,"Training is abundant at the home depot, customer service is number one so you are constantly looking for customers to assist in their projects or provide information to available services."
good,A lot of hard manual labor and repetitive tedious tasks. Management was good  and overall most employees were willing to work. Generally employees were all willing to work together to complete some of the more tiresome tasks.
good,"Responsabilidad con el trabajo, tener una buena calidad de produccion y esforsarnos por ser los mejores en ventas y calidad"
good,Working at The Home depot is a different experience as it is my first employment in the retail business. Most employees are great people to work with. Looking for a change and a better salary.
good,"Your daily functions are always changing. You have to learn your department and the two departments around yours. This means that you get to help out and fill-in for other departments, especially during low staffing periods. Pay is not as good other big box stores and as for the health benefits you are better off getting your own."
good,"Friendly and rewarding environment.  Good place and plenty of opportunities to move up the ranks if you are a hard worker who takes the time to help customers, learn about products, and practice strict safety procedures."
good,"Everything about working for Home Depot is pretty nice except the inconsistent hours. Very professional management, friendly co workers, fun at times and overall a cool experience."
good,Job was challenging everyday. Was able to learn about products I would not have had contact with everyday.  Employees were really fun to be around.  Pay was not up to scale.
good,"Being a cashier at Home Depot, for the most part is a straight forward job, I've learned a lot from working there and made new friends along the way. Management may not always be the greatest but if you just do your job, stay focused and friendly, you'll do great! Hard parts of being cashier is the not so friendly customers, but they can be found at any job!"
good,"good store to work for, the people are the best.  Smaller store but the employees make up for its age and quirky lay out.  Good location and can find most anything."
good,"Management needs improvement for the store to run at its best. They focused too much on meeting sales goals and did not always listen to employee feedback and ideas regarding customer trends and needs. Sometimes micromanaged too much. Great co-workers, great benefits, good workplace culture."
good,"My duties were to preform quick transactions and inform customers on new promotions and discounts opportunities on several home good items. Also, I was responsible for establishing a cleaning schedule for my department within the store."
good,"A typical day (well night really) is very busy, there are so many of us, we just scatter to our departments. I have learned a lot. Excellent Place to work, Employee moral is extremely high, fun place to work!!"
good,"Long hours, challenging workload. Need to be flexible and ready for anything. Will promote from within and cross train leaders. You get compensated for over time weekends worked."
good,Great Place to work. Only downside to working there was the pay. It was the perfect job for a single person that did not have a lot overhead. However for a family person that this was the only income it just didnt cut it.  I loved the people the atmosphere and the work was okay.
good,The Home Depot was my very first job while I was still in high school. I learned a lot of money management skills while working at the home depot. I learned how to operate a cash register as well. I worked my way up to Front End Supervisor and supervised up to 12 employees at one given shift.
good,"The store I worked at was tanking in productivity and sales. Most of the assistant managers didn't do their jobs very well and seemed to enjoy making things harder on the lower level employees, however, the main manager performed well as far as I knew. And not every Home Depot store is like this. And a few of the assistant managers at that store were relocated because of their actions (after I quit)."
good,"Come in, meet in the break room and stretch, then go out to the dock and start working.  I pull gaylords from the dock and place them on a line for my scanner to scan. I then take them to the designated areas if they are too big to fit on the conveyor belt.  Management was very nice but lots of manual labor and you have to stay on task so your scanner can meet their quota of scans for the day."
good,It was a relaxed work environment where you were given a goal but were not given a standard path that you had to take. I liked that I had a lot of control over my day to day activities while working at the Home Depot. This job really helped me learn how to talk to people I don't know in a comfortable manner.
good,Really good job to grow with. I enjoy the benefit they provide including quarterly bonuses. The get involved in the community and you truly feel like apart of a family working there. I would say that working at the Home Depot could easily be a career and not a just a job.
good,The home depot was a good place to work at. Although hours are limited they do honor requests for days off and will work around your schedule. Their benefits would seem great even though very few people are full time. The job demands very little in terms of skill and more in the way of customer service and dealing with upset customers. Don't work here unless you can deal with upset and angry customers. Management was definitely lacking and be prepared to keep track of your own progress and job duties.
good,"With patience, associates can move up easily with a great team. Benefits for all full-time and part-time associates. On the job training for most positions."
good,My experience was very positive and believe I would still continue to work at Home Depot if had been my desire to answer the call of duty and join the National Guard
good,Great place to work if you figure out how to manage your job work / life balance.  The benefits are great the culture is unbelievable.  Lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Great community of people/staff, but very stressful to meet weekly and monthly goals with the restrictions put upon you.  Most stores are understaffed, so having to cover multiple departments makes doing your job even more difficult.  Fantastic opportunity for a young designer to have a quick education on doing design quickly."
good,"Pay is ok as you start out. The benefits are amazing. 401k, stock purchase plan, many healthcare options. The workplace is very diverse. The sky is the limit. You can learn and learn and move up if that is what is wanted."
good,"Es una empresa excelente, con areas de oportunidad muy buenas."
good,I loved working there its more of a family environment. If you don't like people this would be the wrong job for you. Home Depot really shows appreciation to the employees.
good,Depending on which department you are listed in will depend on the degree of work you are performing. As an order puller you are highly active. You could be running around the store pulling orders as deliveries and/or Online orders. A very high-paced job listing but allows for the familiarity of all product and departments to providing exceptional Customer Service
good,"Learned something new everyday. Most co-workers were easy to get along with and helpful. Some days were hectic, but always able to accomplish jobs that had priority. Training by computer modules and hands-on experience. Interaction with customers usually good."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work and you learn a lot but The pay is just not there and the harder you work the more work management gives you, and they flat pay everyone. Theres jobs that require more physical work and you're risking getting hurt but they don't pay more and they don't pay you more to drive any of the equipment."
good,People are nice environment nice only bad part they hire you part time and want you to have open availability it's not the ideal situation other than that everyone is nice
good,This is a fun place to work. I have not had issues with people and they keep you wanting to be here. Promotions are attainable. Very nice place to work and gain knowledge.
good,Portage MI store I enjoyed all employees from management on down.  The Alamorgordo store the Upper management I did not care for much.  They do not appreciate the employees that are dedicated.
good,"If you're looking for retail, The Home Depot is not a bad company for which to work. The benefits were decent, the workplace atmosphere is fun and positive."
good,"worked here while going to school. it really worked out. The great flexible schedule, understanding managers. actually learned a lot of new skills that I did not possess previously. great for a part time job."
good,"Working at Home Depot is not a physically demanding job.  The hours are good.  As part of the MET crew the hours are 5:30am to 1:30pm.  The pay is low and the health insurance is not affordable.  I am working with no insurance due to the fact that if I get it, I would take home hardly any money."
good,"Good place to earn extra money, focus on your job you will get more opportunities to advance but is a stressful job. It was good working there the benefits are ok could be better"
good,"Just a slow paced kinda job. There are deadlines but as long as the task at hand got completed there wasnt much of a headache. Breaks were abundant, everyone got along (minus a few) and you just kinda poped in some headphone and went on your way."
good,"Good place to work and advance.  "
good,sort packages and deliver (in store) to each department. must work with co-workers to complete task on time. the management is good they show you how to complete the task then let you do it. the store has many workers and work well together. the pay is low and work is hard . when I see others accomplish there goals.
good,After 16 years with hd I couldn't get a transfer to a different state.i was on an loa when I tried to get a transfer from NC to NY .big dissappointment
good,The associates were nice and didn't mind helping each other. They treated the customers fair. The bonuses were deceit. Traffic on that side of town is always horrible.
good,"Great overall company to work for."
good,A good company with many opportunities to grow your career. Great work life balance that allows you to make your own schedule. They offer a lot of benefits to their employees
good,"The home depot in general is a good place to work. If you put in effort, you can move up but you either need to be in an area with lots of stores or be willing to move once you get above a supervisor level."
good,Plenty of advancement and job opportunity.  Can work in different departments to help ease monotony.  Can feel like you are working with family.  Profit sharing is a plus.
good,Its a great environment with room to advanced. But the drastic increase in sales makes it very hard and stressful place to work. As long as you show up every shift everything will be great.
good,"I enjoy the position I have but it becomes very stressful at times. Management does not communicate with each other.so that can make you r job stressful. Other than that's it's a fun place to work"
good,"Home Depot really cares about their customers and their brand.  That care was carried over onto how they required employees to treat the customers on the phone.  It was interesting and mostly fun.  I was given free reign to do the right thing, which is nice."
good,"I love every person that I work with at Home Depot. Management is great and fair; however, this job does not pay enough for the knowledge one is required to obtain in order to be efficient in their department."
good,Not too bad to work for. Company was just not for me.  HR manager at my store was awesome. overall I didn't mind the shifts I was working. I got a lot of Saturdays off! One of our head cashiers was awesome. Good starting pay compared to some other retailers in the area. Some things I didn't like was that I was part time. My front end supervisor liked to micromanage me.  Sales Floor associate need to be more helpful to cashiers. a lot of the customers are short tempered and hostile.
good,Not a bad place to work. Need more associates. They do treat you pretty well and the store in Portsmouth the associates and management team are good. Decent customers for the most part. Not enough staffing is a big issue.
good,"By far have loved the people at the store I have been working at.  They are friendly, knowledgeable and overall great environment.  Benefits package is very competative and benefits employee's."
good,"I've learned at this job in particular that you have to work for yourself. You don't work to impress others you work to impress and improve yourself. Working with this management team was difficult due to each persons views/interpretation of the rules and regulations. Everyone is on their own page and it is very easy to get caught up, because doing whats right for the customer and the team of associates is mislead by the management."
good,"it's a good place to work but you can be written up for not getting credit cards,  enough write ups and they can fire you.  I think it's a great part time job but full time is a mess of crazy ness."
good,"Although I have always surpassed the required sales goals, the job can be extremely demanding to meet the Manager's overall sales goals. I am familiar with cabinet companies, countertop options and the overall remodeling process from start to finish. I have a pleasant repor and am able to assist with backsplash and flooring as well as appliances to complete the intire project. I am called to assist customers with their color choices throughout the store because of my keen awareness color."
good,"I had a pleasant experience.  I was promoted twice to higher positions.  The management was fair, and they really were concerned about you putting forth an effort to help make a great name for the company.  There were occasionally fun activities for employees and their family members, and employees were rewarded for outstanding job performances."
good,"Very busy, lots of activity. the volume of the customers were very overwhelming. Not very organised,.................................................."
good,During my time with the company I was able to work with many difernt people from all walks of life and back grounds. I was able to obtain a number of new skills that have found useful in other jobs. I was able to work at 3 difernt locations in 2 state's so having the ability to move with the company was a great experiance as well. Its a fast paced inviroment that can be very labor intensive and demanding. There was a period of time when the upper managment was going through some changes and they did a lot of cut backs and there wasn't enough people working on the sales floor at times. But overall it seems as though the company has fixed those labor issues and is back to being a great place to work
good,"continue appointments daily 1-4 seven days a week if you want to work seven days a week. "
good,"Great place to be for those loving customer service. A typical day at home depot turns arround helping people (pros customers & DIYers) to find the right product to achieve their projects."
good,"Overall everyone I worked with were great. I had a lot of fun, and I felt like my job was safe. I wanted more, but I was unable to make the right friends to get there."
good,I've been with The Home Depot over 2 years as the Pro Loader working 7 am until 1pm on average loading mainly for contractors however also available store-wide to assist in any department with any customer. A lot of heavy lifting and keeping the store and products ready for each and every customer.
good,"If your looking for a great company to work for Home Depot will treat you like family, your co-workers are awesome to work with. If you love helping customers this may be a great place for you to work. Unlike most retail management appreciates their employees."
good,"Typical day is busy but also have times during your day when you can simply do ""busy work"".There's opportunity to work/learn in other departments. Management is nice & supportive"
good,"Some good days working here, didn't get along with a lot of them, they'd like to take credit for your work, almost always happened. Managers weren't so great either."
good,Great place for some. I need more and need to know that I have an opportunity to advance. would like a constant schedule. Really enjoy there ethics on customer service.
good,The homedepot was wonderful I would love to work there again. Every single employee is amazing in there own way and they make you feel like you are apart of a family.
good,"Outstanding company where the customer  are put first, associate advancement outstanding benefits fast pace great management team up and coming online business"
good,"Sometimes I feel new information does not get to the cashiers, in a timely manner. This is dependent upon which head cashier receives the message, from the lead cashier. Apparently this is done verbally, and it seems to me not all of the head cashiers are informed of a change. I feel the ""head cashier"" should provide a memo to the lead cashiers as well as the cashiers when there is a change in policy."
good,"The Home Depot is an outstanding company. The work environment is great, as well as the employees. It is a great place to work and build a long lasting career with."
good,The Corporate philosophy was good but sometimes the store management would import their own styles that didn't always provide a realistic work environment.
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a very great experience for me. The culture was fantastic, the workers were mostly fun and worked well with everyone and the management staff was, for the most part, very helping and very understanding."
good,"dont work here it sucks."
good,Home Depot was one of my first jobs out of school. Nice environment with fun  and interesting people. No real room for growth but it thought me the foundation of customer service and how to be attentive and understanding to customers.
good,"I worked for Euroview Glass installing showers for Home Depot customers. I enjoyed working with Home Depot customers and the company in general. They were very lenient when I needed a day off early for school and the hourly pay was also great. However, the only thing that might need some help is the customer service aspect of the company."
good,Fast paced work environment that is constantly changing. The managers seem to really care about their people. The Home Depot is a growing company with a strong retail future.
good,"good company , fun, learning many things there , the management team could be more clear on a few things and be on the same page as each other, store needs more communication"
good,"People are nice environment is good, but it is hard to get promotion as management promote there favorite most. steel toe shoes hurt alot but there insurance plan is great"
good,"Great company, I appreciate that this company took the time out to make all of their employees feel welcome. And even thought sometimes the work got really stressful management was always there to help."
good,"It was an ok job. This job, however, was way too far away from where I lived. The job itself was ok. The customers were mostly friendly, and the management was nice, very nice actually."
good,"again i had great co-workers, great work environment. Management wasn't so great. They really don't have the best pay or the best hours. learned a great deal about home improvement and gained leadership skills. also learned to be super patient with customers."
good,Working warehouse setting where respect and solving problems are key to success.  Limited opportunities for advancement and career stagnation are common.  Good work ethic and the willingness to approach and engage customers are respected by management.
good,"This was the first company that I worked for when we migrated here in Canada. I can say that the people were great, as well as the management. I worked as a Lot Associate and I could say that the worst part of the job was working in the winter. But I would recommend this company. Great place."
good,HD is a great place to work if you are willing to put in the work it can easily be made into a career.great benefits and 40K option. Tons of training and chanced to move up the ladder. The only down side to my particular experiance is the management team in my building.
good,While working at Home Depot I have learned quite a bit about tools and home repair techniques. My co-workers have assisted me in my training to further my knowledge of daily duties.
good,atypical workday consisted of making sure customers provided prompt and satisfying service. livable wages were paid and my immediate manager was very helpful in my development.
good,".Pros"
good,Home Depot DC was a great experience. I wasn't given much time to actually learn my job. I Still enjoyed the experience. my job was to unload the truck and use the rf to sort the materials.
good,The company has great values from its customer service initiative to its community outreach programs. they are a great place if you want to interact with people and learn what it means to be in customer service.
good,"I think that Home Depot is a great job as far as retail goes. I have only worked with MET during my entire time with Home Depot. Talking with other Home Depot associates from other stores it seems that every store is very different to work in. I enjoy the store I work at, although there can be issues, overall I think its quite good. Being a part of MET means that I work at one store but I am not a part of the store, this helps with scheduling and such. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is that I get weekends off, when I leave I don't get called into work or asked questions regarding work, I can not even think about work during my time off. The hardest part is that you always try to cram as many things into the weekend. Working Overnight MET is challenging in that you need to always keep track your time (to bill vendors), and a lot of projects can be totally messed up. Doing lessons and such is also difficult, working the 10 hours really inhibits what you can do during the week."
good,it was a great and new experience I learned a lot of new material along with skills and I met very humble and generous loving people while employed there.
good,"New employees welcomed into staff.  High turnover in some positions.  Opportunities for advancement,  Job and employment expectations clearly outline on corporate intranet."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Had to leave due to medical issues at the time.   Trying to go back and poor communication, ex: HR will not return phone calls.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and worked without hassel."
good,THD is a great company to work for provided you have the support and Coaching from your management team. The opportunities are endless in this organization.
good,I enjoy interacting with the customers as well as with the employees.  We are one big family in most cases and support each other.  Some co-workers I do not trust and some refuse to do their job fully by taking the not my job attitude.  Some leaders take extra smoking breaks calling them errands but we are not blind.  Some management treats the employees as though we are beneath them which is wrong.  They just have a title as we are all human beings.  The most difficult part is meeting the demands/goals of management which are often impossible.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of my shift.
good,"I worked for Home Depot several different time periods. On two occasions I won the ""Homer"" award for excellence in customer service. I worked well in the Home Depot team environment, and made sure everyone got praise when they deserved it."
good,"It depends on your managers, of course, but my time at the Home Depot was varied.  Every day was different, with different goals and different strategies depending on who was MOD that day.  However, advancement and even transfers are not easy, because someone may not like you for whatever reason.  If you work hard and are friendly and easy going, you'll go far."
good,Working for The Home Depot has a lot of beneficial. Working for this corporation gives you a lot of work experience. You start either as a lot associate or cashier and you work yourself in the company.
good,"The hotter days of the summer were a little hard to deal with, but the overall experience was not bad. Most of the people working there are nice and willing to help you out if you find yourself in a difficult situation or just cannot do something on your own. The job itself would get tedious at times, but it was an unspoken rule that everyone would respond that everything is good when asked. The job gave good exercise and mostly enjoyable."
good,Home Depot was a great starter job. In fact I was there for a long time but when it comes to taking care of family they kind of frown on you having issues at home and dealing with them while working for the company.
good,"everyday is different. associates bleed orange and want to have with what they do."
good,I was in receiving and I was always busy. this was a fun job. Management was big on promoting women. They were always there to support you when need be.
good,A nice job to have that can balance out your work schedule and life. The management was very helpful in working with everyones schedule. Very easy to move up in position.
good,"A great place to work but the scheduling and amount of associates on the sales floor needs great improvement. "
good,Its an ok place to work we are set at 27 hours only for part time associates and full time placement is extremely hard to come by at Home Depot.. All in all friendly Co workers.
good,"Enjoyed the experience; learned how to deal with unpleasant customers; learned how to work the cash register; learned the importance of meeting the needs of the customers; typical day involved assisting customers, helping customers locate items, checking out customers when ready to make purchases; hardest part of the job was dealing with the different customers' personalities; the most enjoyable part was seeing a satisfied customer"
good,Home Depot was a very nice workplace for the short time i was there. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers but also engaging with the regular customers.
good,"Hard long days, but good co workers. Customers aren't great most of the time and I find myself trying to avoid them as much as possible. Management staff is mostly very good."
good,it was alright they really could've paid more attention to there associates needs they listen but they ignore the issues if i had the opp i wouldve stayed
good,"In the garden department,  you are required to be a walking encyclopedia of knowledge. You have to be willing to learn about everything from lawnmowers to cleaning chemicals, pesticides, plants, soils and other seasonal items. Management can be hit and miss depending on who it is. I have had mystery managers,  managers who were always talking to customers and working the floor at the same time. Most recently,  there is one who likes to micro-manage garden to no end."
good,"Very many places for advancement, but have a hard time helping people advance. It is a Manuel labor job and requires you to work at a fast pace while maintaining good customer service."
good,"As a cashier/customer service, I was highly involved in making sure the customers had an enjoyable experience during their time at the store. Oftentimes, I worked outside in the seasonal department and enjoyed being outdoors with flowers and plants. Co workers truly looked out for one another and they became a second family."
good,"I find a typical day at work for me at the service desk to be enjoyable. This would be to interactions with customers and fellow associates. Assuming there are enough associates on the floor, the work load is manageable. The workplace culture I believe is a result of the associates themselves, and at my location I think it's great. Most of my coworkers are very nice, have a good sense of humor, and really get their job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with bugs in the computer interfaces (although I have sort of gotten used to them and found work arounds) and occasionally satisfying a customer's problem who's desired solution is out of my control."
good,If you are already experienced in hardware or plumbing  it is a great place to work.  However if you have no experience beyond the computer training you receive you will not be happy.
good,"Again, demanding, requiring most all of your time 5 days per week.  Never any calls or issues on off days which was nice.  As rewarding as your efforts earned."
good,I really enjoyed working here.  it was a place where u could have fun while u worked. There was a good customer base and i got along well with not only my co-workers but management as well. if they had given me full-time after 2 yrs i would have stayed
good,There really isn't much to say about Home Depot other than it is a well established business that takes care of their own. If you want to know more than simply ask them or apply for on of their man opening worldwide
good,There is always something to do on your shift. You will always learn more of what a product is or when you get new products to start selling. The management is always willing to help with any questions you may have.
good,Buen ambiente laboral en grupo como encargados y clientes y satisfecho
good,A typical day is greeting customers and helping with their purchases. I learned how to be a team player and work with others. The hardest part of the job is finding things to do when work is slow. The most enjoyable part is talking with customers and co-workers.
good,The Home depot is a fast paced and stressful job yet Management does not treat it as so. due to the unprofessional manner of the job it cannot be taken seriously and is simply another destination along the way.
good,I think that the Home Depot is a safe and dependable employer. The pay is not the greatest but the benefits if your full-time compensate for their pay scale.
good,"Working at home depot was honestly one of the best jobs I have ever had. If the pay was better I would have never left. I loved working there, I loved the people I worked with, I like the work I did, and I did not mind the customers. The management at my store was really a mixed bag however all the manager were nice. There is room to advance of course that does again depend on the store you work at."
good,"Never a dull day at the Home Depot. The core of working there is the customer is first, second, and third in their list of priorities. The scheduling is flexible and is great for college students."
good,"I was never offered an opportunity to move up in the company for the 17 years that I had worked, including winning Employee of the Year in 1993 and numerous customer service awards."
good,"The company is good overall. There is lots of room to grow with the company and to advance. Depending on what department you have, it could get very stressful."
good,"The companies philosophy and commitment to their values is excellent, the problem is as with most really large publicly held companies your work experience is completely dependent on the management team at the local level.  While there is a hotline to address employee concerns it can take a while to get the attention for a bad manager because complaints are considered part of the job, which to some extent are.  I worked there long enough to experience both excellent managers, some who could use some retraining and one who was great with numbers but horrible with people both staff and customers."
good,"This was a part time position that I had held while attending college as a full-time student. They were always willing to work with me in regards to my scheduling. The pay was decent for a part-time position. I learned how to use a variety of equipment, such as the forklifts used to transport the lumber around. Overall it was a great job for the time being."
good,Working at the Home Depot is good experience especially in home improvement. The management is good but needs you to be vocal about any accomplishments you feel are important. You need to make schedule changes far in advance as well.
good,"I learned many new skills for example, BDP(Bay Direct Packdown) which a lot of companies with warehouse stores use this skill to help organize and or reorganize bays given at random each week so that there are no old products and that new products just received go up in the over heads and the products already there get dropped down and stocked onto the shelves. the hardest part about my job was getting more hours and the advancement opportunities were poor. but what made the job enjoyable was the team that I was working with every day."
good,"The best thing about Home Depot Interiors is by far the culture of the company. the entire company is based around 8 core values, and those 8 core values are based around people."
good,"They treat employees and customers and each other with great respect. This makes it easy to work there. They also do not discriminate in hiring - e.g. race, age, gender, etc. They are great about that, and all have equal opportunities for advancement. The cons are the hours are constantly changing and can be terrible. You may be in at 6AM all of one week, then working 4PM to 11PM the next. The pay isn't so good either, but we really are treated well otherwise. I enjoy the job."
good,Working at home depot wasnt the easiest job in the world. I excelled at it because I learn fast and I'm a people person. but it is better to at least have some background in the department you are applying for
good,Hard working place great pay...vacation and sick days were excellent...long shifts and hard work but they feed you good and made you feel comfortable....large company
good,"Love the job.  So much going on most of the time.  Great co-worker environment.  Great leaders.  "
good,"Busy multi task customer  environment, remember slow periods will reduce hours. Very fair starting salary.  Very small pay raises without taking on new "
good,"My daily work activity is one of positivity and daily goal accomplishment. I am a people person, therefore my coworkers and customers make my day easy."
good,"There was so many friendly coworkers there, it wasn't hard to make friends in the workplace. Everyone was always helping each other out if one was struggling."
good,Random hours from 3pm until 10pm and then the manager would have been told by your super that you said you can stay until 1AM and managment would through fits if you didn't stay.
good,"Working at The Home Depot allows you to enjoy your time at work, and be efficient at the same time. There is never a dull moment, and management always has your back in troubling situations."
good,The only issues I encountered working for The Home Depot was that advancement was scarce in the company. There seemed to be favorites and cliques that management had. The job was enjoyable as I sold flooring and appliances.
good,The head cashier at my job location was terrible and management did nothing to control her attitudes. As long as you don't work with her it is fun and easy.
good,"A great place to meet and interact with all sorts of customers.  A place where you can feel you were a help to customers, providing information or advice of products and their usage.  The hardest part of this job was learning to be on your feet all day!  A cashier part-time job that had little possibility of going full-time, unfortunately.  They did offer dental and vision benefits after 90 days to part-time employees with a small payroll deduction, pay was bi-weekly."
good,"when I worked for home depot I saw that the company cared about its employees they always had free drinks for employees, they gave good compensation for coming in off of your scheduled time."
good,"For a retail-establishment, The Home Depot is actually pretty great."
good,"Home depot is not a bad place to work. Its's hard,but you can advance. however things have changed over the years so,anything is possible. I learned a lot of leadership skills and inventory management. The hardest part was the picking. They always get temps...but they never stay...no matter what they say."
good,Enjoyed my job for many years.  The last 3 years were rough on me physically due to the nature of the job but i did it. enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,"My days are made up of giving special order quotes to customers as well as setting up measures for door installs, and arranging for in-home consultations by my sales representatives to give information on window pricing and installation. "
good,Not enough associates to provide the quality of service to customers .The work life balance is poor no set schedule. Never the same days off. Other than health benefits being expensive other benefits are very good.
good,Arrive to work and clock-in.  Have a team meeting about the tasks for the day.  Stretch and communicate with each other about teaming up on certain tasks.
good,A fast paced retail environment with an extreme emphasis on customer service which enables employees to help multiple customers simultaneously wearing many different hats throughout the day.
good,"make 7 to 11 phone calls a day set appointments and commute 40 - 300 miles a day"
good,"My job was mostly in the lumber and building materials dept..I  was responsible for off loading trucks of lumber, drywall and concrete using a forklift. Ensure that product is in store in a timely and safe manner. Pick overstock using a Order picker and reach truck. Make sure store is clean and grand opening ready at the end of shift. I learned a great deal there considering I went from a part-time associate to Night shift manager in 6 years. The hardest part of the job was there was a large work load on the team and not a lot of employees to get the job done."
good,The employees here really made it feel like everyone was family. Because of that the customer's were great as well. I was able to gain a lot of experience here.
good,"Typical retail environment -- not too bad, not too good. A lot of physical requirements regardless of department; it kept me in shape, especially during the summer."
good,Great place to work with the general public.  Great place to acquire knowledge about home improvement.  Super friendly people to work with.  Just not very much money and very heavy lifting!
good,"Great Motto! do the right thing. I really enjoyed my time at the Home Depot. There was a lack of hours when I was working there so I became cross-trained in several departments. I also worked in paints,lumber and hardware. Employees are given a certain degree of autonomy to make price and substitutions when product not available."
good,A positive place to work.The employees that work there were very friendly and helpful. I've learned about organization and preparedness. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.
good,"Home Depot does reward you for your hard work. The managers were kind and fair. There is usually free food. The only problem is part timers do not have set schedules and it changes week to week, never the same."
good,"Working at home depot was a very lively experience. Each day was high energy, and filled with customers who need help and associates eager to jump in."
good,I like working with the public.  Meeting different people is always interesting and fun. Merchandising new products and learning about them. It's a great feeling when you can be the solution to a customer's problem.
good,"safe workplace"
good,"At the customer services desk, work is fast and ongoing. There is always something to take care of. I have learned how to multitask very well and remain calm."
good,I worked part time. Depending on schedule I would be there for 4-8 hours. I learned about large box retail practices as well as flooring estimates. Department management had high turnover. Work place culture was good. Most difficult part of job was assisting customers. I enjoyed the estimating and sales side.
good,Restock heavy product on shelves. This was a part time temp job that only lasted 90 days. Worked 2nd shift about 20 hrs a week.
good,Good part time job while working at school and maintaining a life outside of both. Pay was terrible for those working on machines in the lumber yard.
good,"a typical day at work concludes of counting money, separating money into different groups for different purposes and making sure the totals add up correctly. sending money to registers when they start to run out. it takes a little while to get all the details correct but once you learn it, it becomes repetitive so its not so easy to find advancement if you want it."
good,Lots of responsibility and consistent work available to those who are motivated.  Work life balance is a challenge and the compensation is not the best for the work desired.
good,What i liked about this job was me being able to meet and help people. Everyone i meet was nice and i also made a few friends while working here.
good,"every day was a different you got to meet different people,cultures.i enjoyed working with management typical day stocking shelfs, customer service. They dont have set schedules so each week was different"
good,"The pay is good and the people are friendly but the management is not so great. The turnover rate is really high. There is no progression. No matter what job you apply for, they will put you where they need you."
good,Call customers to schedule and/or confirm appointments. Management are friendly & helpful. I would say the hardest part of the day is when it's slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm able to help a customer resolve an issue with a 1 call resolution which makes the customer happy & come back to do more business with Home Depot.
good,"Home Depot prides themselves on teamwork and communication. The main focus is always on keeping customers and staff happy. Great community to be apart of, and admirable devotion to being involved in their residential communities. Regular donations to Habit for Humanity and The Orange Door Project for youth homeless. Associates are encouraged and expected to strive to learn more and take charge. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed number one."
good,"Home Depot isn't a bad place. It has friendly co-workers, and there is room for improvement. There are training courses that you have to take every month. A typical day at work varies. It is always something new to do. The hardest part of the job would be lifting concrete. Management is ok. I just disagree with the decrease in hours after the holidays.There is also a few minor things that overly complicate the job. We now have a trash schedule every 4 hours. In theory this seems right. The stinger comes in when the trash bags aren't big enough to fit the trash cans. We have to use to trash bags to fit a can while still being available to every single inquiry from customers and co-workers. It doesn't benefit the employees at all. The benefits package is good but with taxes being taken out it makes your checks a little thin."
good,"Buen trato a los empleados, "
good,I enjoyed working at THD. I do feel it is a 'good old boys' club. They offer good benefits and employee support. Vacation and personal time accural is awsome.
good,Home Depot is a good company but its not that i would work for for job security there not that type of company i work for them for 9 years they look after them selfs and not the workers
good,I have made good relations with contractor customers. I help them in their needs for jobs.  I can help them in finding products in our store.
good,Home Depot was enjoyable because of the satisfaction of helping customers every day. Representing the company to the best
good,"Great environment to work with."
good,"If you want to move up in your position, for example, cashier (because they initially hire as part time), you will have to wait forever. As far as the job environment, it's pretty laid back. My location (Wheatland RD in Dallas) was a joy to go to. Only problem I had was when it was time to get off, they can be untimely relieving you."
good,"home depot has really improved in the last few years, becoming more open and diverse as a company. Management has become better at focusing on associate lives as well as customers"
good,I recommend it to everyone fun place to work in u will learn alot from working here...u will learn how to operate different types of machines
good,The Home Depot is a great workplace that provides useful training to complete daily tasks serving customers in a variety of ways.
good,The Home Depot was filled with friendly co-workers who were never shy to give a helping hand. The atmosphere was great with hard working individuals in each department and in management. It was rewarding when you saw a smile pop up on a customers face after you had helped them find what they were looking for. The Home Depot was a great job!
good,"Almost everyone I worked with at the Home Depot were very helpful and friendly. We were understaffed at times and our manager expected too much out of us, we would have to stay overtime to finish our work even though it was against the rules to take overtime. We cared about our customers though and wanted to see every delivery fulfilled in time. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Overall, THD was a great place to work. Workplace culture and co-workers were decent. Benefits are average. The challenge for any newcomers to the IT department will be producing during the IT Transformation chaos."
good,"This particular Home Depot it's a great place to work management is pretty cool as long as you do your work And respect your customers I worked there for 13 years I was let go because I stopped a shoplifter apparently Home Depot policy States that only security can stop a shoplifter I didn't know that they should really be more forgiving about policies like this when you're trying to help the store Word to the wise don't stop a shoplifter tell security or management besides that great place to work for cookouts birthday parties everything ,fun crew to work with. Fast paste job."
good,"It was great when I started. But the hours started being too scattered out. Example, I would work like 4-10pm, but have to be back to open at 6am the following morning."
good,The management was very friendly and flexible.  The staff was hard working and goal orientated.   The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
good,"My decision to work at The Home Depot was based upon my availability during my school semester.  That being said, my work experience was exactly what I was expecting.  Be part of a team, ensure everything is neat and tidy and listen and help out all the customers.that may need your assistance."
good,have not work there long but like working here seems like they try to take care of there employees but most are part time very hard to get full time employment
good,"Depending on the store manager, this can be one of the best places to work or one of the worst places.  When I originally started, the store manager was super supportive which made for a friendly working atmosphere.  A good store manager will allow flexible hours if there is family health issue.  When my young daughter was diagnosed with cancer, I had a few weeks off, employees got together and pooled $$ to help my family, then I was able to work when my husband was home which was 7 days a week - but 5 hours per day.  KUDOS for working with me!  New store manager was not flexible or helpful."
good,"Good Company, but solving issues through HR can be difficult. Decent pay but slow advancement and can be a struggle to further career through them."
good,"A typical day at work was to seek after customers in the aisles, provide fast and friendly service to customers, and answer their questions. Help customers with paint orders."
good,"Good place to work very physical tasks pretty repetitive "
good,good places to work enjoy my time there.team work help a lot thur out the process. Being able to get promoted with in months was great .and the things that I learn thur out the time was great to
good,"At Home Depot, I very much enjoyed the team atmosphere and received great training. I was able to use my skills and was encouraged to expand them. It is a very inclusive place to work."
good,"Enjoyed working at the Home Depot, greeting customers, learning about the different type of products in the store, some days will be hectic with customers but that is how working retail is. I enjoyed it."
good,Home Depot has many job opportunities in different areas for you to choose from to best suit your job interests. The company is very willing to help you with scheduling.
good,Good place to work.   Alot of overtime at the time of employment.  Work life and home was a little out of balance due to online at the time of holidays.
good,"laid back job for people that like working with others, for me it was easy to move around ounce you learned the part of the store i worked in. overall it was a good environment."
good,"Place orders supervise departments"
good,"The ability to move up in this company is great. The long term benefits are definitely better than the short-term. However, keep in mind that Home Depot is part of corporate America, who always looks out for itself."
good,"Started as a cashier, the company offers many areas that allows for growth and advancement.  Worked with great leaders. Developed great leadership skills that allowed me to grow and move forward. Also engaged with many cultures."
good,A typical day at work started at 6:00am and involves directing and assisting customers in locating products and finalizing their sales
good,I work as a sales associate for about 2 years and had a ver positive experience there I was impressed with their schedule flexibility as I was going to school at the same time and they had many different route to upward mobility.
good,A typical day is working with customers or stocking items. I learned many skills. My co-workers were very helpful. The management was okay at times. At other times it was not great.
good,"over all nice place to work for there is worse place to work for but the  management have a tendency to to have they favorite employers who dont get in trouble no mater what they do and the none rfavorite seem to get in trouble no mater what they do "
good,love working here great friendly staff I just need more income to pay bills and support my family. love the food pantry to help us if we cant afford to but lunch or accidentally forget it one day.
good,"a place where people come and go, co workers don't stay long. i wanted to move up , be something more than a cashier but the opportunity never presented itself."
good,aprendi al trato directo con el cliente y promover los productos de la tienda.
good,The higher up you go the better they treat you. If you stay an hourly worker chances are that you will be just another number to them that they can easily replace.
good,The hardest part of my job at Home Depot was not being able to find orders that customers place. It could be the employee didn't follow-up with the order or the item was know longer available. The customer is upset and you have to try to calm them down. Either give them an option to order it again or a full refund.
good,"A lot of fun working with friendly people and a productive environment. I learned quite a lot about merchandising. The Crew Boss was open, friendly and encouraged us all the time."
good,"Obscenities, discriminatory language, or other language not suitable for a public forum"
good,THD is a great place to work if you are able to get to the RDC. If you don't drive it might not be the place for you. Co-workers go out of their way to help and encourage new and seasoned employees to do better when needed. Management is very friendly and make you feel like part of the team.
good,"Home Depot offers a good deal of opportunities to those who are hard workers and are willing to be patient and earn them, but it can take a while to move up, especially if management feels that you're still needed where you're at."
good,"Its a great place to work depending on your job title. Just be careful what you apply for. And make sure they have ample associates in your position"
good,good job layed back ddint have to do much pay is terrible heath benefits come for you people are miserable there but you can go there and work and make better
good,"Good company/sometimes hot, dusty and difficult but fulfilling employment/good training/good computer programs ... Easy to understand/custom offerings like flooring and cabinets however is not only difficult but not enough company support on manager level where training is concerned"
good,Nice job decent pay for the work depending on your title. Good coworkers but don't get too wrapped up in the home depot madness. Easy job to land.
good,"Any particular day there will be competitive fighting in break room. Supervisors and Managers hiding from customers, not being available for customer assistants."
good,"Very Good and i learn a lot in merchandising  , customer service. The awards program is very good.I have learnt a lot on products knowledge."
good,"it is a great place to learn a new skill or two. Only problem is, in order to move up with the company you have to become friends with the store manager. My store manager did not talk with any associate unless it was to hire or fire them."
good,"Customer serviced based, interaction with customers. Product knowledge is a plus, and finding and giving the customers the right product for the job. I learned a lot not only in the paint department but also from other departments in the stores. Contractors help you out with different products and give you options on how to use them."
good,"Helping customers, learning products, maintain and stocking shelves.   Management is great, depending on the store of course. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling.  The best is learning about products and helping customers with projects and solving problems."
good,"Ran cash register, enjoyed talking to customers, nice co-workers, training was long, management was easy to work with,"
good,"As a whole the company is ok to work for. Flexible work schedules, decent compensation. Comprehensive training to help associates succeed and gain confidence.  I am a part time associate and the flexibility allows me to work schedules that fit into my life."
good,Good people and good place. Time for change. Exploring options and a career I can be proud of. Figure out what I like and don't like.
good,Management allows employees to be socially active with customers to meet their sales needs and to encourage a positive result of shopping with Home Depot.
good,I loved home depot people i worked with were some of the best people i ever met very easy to work there if you can adjust to the weekly schedule change.
good,"Greet every customer with a smile and ensure to make sure each and everyone has a positive experience."
good,"Good work environment at the individuals stores, especially at the Auburn Home Depot. If you have a questionable background they may hire you, but that background can also cause you that job afer hire."
good,"Management could have been a lot better at the location I worked, otherwise, it was a great atmosphere with very nice coworkers."
good,A typical day was talking to hundreds of people throughout the day. I learned Marketing skills and sales skills. Management was fairly good. The most enjoyable part about the job was finding solution to customer problems.
good,I learned how to sell a credit card and how to deal with unpleseant customers and change the situation with a smile. It eas alwasy hard talking to upper managment because they found a way around what you wanted or were asking.
good,"While working at Home Depot, I was treated fairly and equally. The hardest part of being a cashier was the repetition but the best part was socializing with customers and making sure they left happy. I found near the end of my career at the Home Depot was that I wasn't given enough hours and enough pay in order to continue working there."
good,"I Liked the work place, if only they could provide full time opportunities to start off. average about 25-28 hrs a week. A Lot of room to advance, learn forklifts pretty quick. Great experience."
good,"i throughly enjoyed working for home depot for 2 and a half years. the customers are awsome and the standards of customer service they uphold are amazing. staff is very understanding if you have dissabilities, and the room for advancement is great to. the hardest part of the job would have to be making sure you are psycicaly fit to lift excess weight. the most enjoyable part is helping coustomers with there projects and having the self satisfaction of knowing you helped people alot of times there dream project. i highly recomend working for home depot if you enjoy customer service and taking that extra step to ensure there happy with there experience."
good,Co-workers were great! good opportunnity for growth within the company. Yearly raises are really low. Always had a lot of work function and team building events.
good,I liked the fact that you could work hard on something and always know that you had a friend at the desk next to you. I never had any trouble with any of the Agents in the office. I was respected and i respected them.
good,Great Company to work for as long as you get in to a store with a good management team at the store and district level. Bonuses for all hourly associates for successful stores. Unique culture that fosters to the associate with an inverted pyramid putting customers on the top and associates above the leadership.
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. Its just perfect for someone looking for a part time job and making 20-25 hours a week. I just need more hours than that. Another thing The Home Depot for cashiers or front end positions are ridiculous when it comes to hours so far. You have to go into work on your off days in order for you to receive the hours that you want.
good,"entrega y recepción de mercancía "
good,"The Home Depot helped me find many positions that fit my current lifestyle. The company has great opportunity for advancement. I learned a lot about myself, about the workplace policies and how to plan my finances for my future."
good,"I had a great time volunteering there , I didn't have a hard time with nothing it was great being there i learned a lot of good things and things that I didn't know how to do"
good,The company is good for someone who wants to start a career in retail management.The environment is warm. The customers are the best part of the job. You learn so much from the customers.
good,"Fun place to work with right leadership. Typical day includes waiting on customers, cleaning stocking, and rearranging. Management does show favoritism, which is con."
good,"I do miss this company, and the people who work there. Again many changes was happening to where my job title was getting removed and my option was to leave or transfer to covington. thats two hours away so couldn't do it."
good,"Home Depot prides itself on being one of the leaders in customer service for the retail industry. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, as well as the relationships I was able to build with my regular customers. The company cares about it's employees, and the benefits package was top notch in comparison to it's counterparts."
good,I enjoyed my time as a Home Depot Associate and wouldn't say anything too bad about the place. The management is very involved with the employees and do their part to make it an enjoyable and productive workplace.
good,Home Depot as a whOle is a great company. They are good at recognizing people and are great with keeping training available for other positions.
good,"Merchandising and project management while also assisting customers needs."
good,There are good opportunities at the Home Depot but the attitudes of other associates makes it a hard place to continue to  in.  There are those who do and those who tell others what to do....
good,"I love working for Home Depot.  Great management, upper and in-store.  It really felt like people cared for my career, and were always willing to help me advance.  Recognition was amazing.  Whenever I did well, I heard about it.  Worst part of the job is the work/life balance.  With an unpredictable schedule (As a department supervisor, I did not have a consistent schedule) it was really hard to plan for things outside of work.  Also, pay was barely enough to support myself.  I did well and got raises, but it really wasn't substantial."
good,"when i first started working at this company i enjoyed coming to work because of the hospitality. After a while the management and coworkers attitude changed which made me not feel comfortable working. "
good,Home Depot has many opportunities for the right people in the right branch.I was luck enough to have 3 great managers and work in 3 depts that taught me a lot.
good,Stable job that provided some benefits. Maintained a open communication with entire work staff and promoted a team atmosphere. Dedication to customers was unsurpassed by any other retail company out there.
good,Very good workplace with alot of benefits and chances for advancement but work/ home balance was an issue. Over all I would work for the company again.
good,"The Home Depot is a really great place to work. there's opportunity for advancement and there is so much to learn. store 2781 had a great atmosphere, I'd recommend them for employment but u go in as part time and have to work really smart and hard to be considered for full time also you must be highly energetic."
good,"I worked for Select Merchandising Services, a vendor/merchandiser company that services Home Depot stores, and other retail stores as well. My main duties were to service magazine racks, and candy at check lanes. I replenished all locations and rotated new product onto the shelves."
good,"I was a part-time sales associate at Home Depot for 5 years and while every job has it's ups and downs, for the most part, I enjoyed my position. Great culture and friendly colleagues. The only downfall was that getting a promotion or raise was often very difficult and recognition for going above and beyond was almost always unheard of. I was trained in 4 different departments as well as forklift certified and I never received a raise for my added skill set. I also wish there was more product training as often if asked about the quality of one product over another, we were unable to give customers a definitive answer."
good,el ambiente laboral es sano en tanto a las relaciones pero falta capacitacion
good,"Working at Home Depot has helped me learn communicating, sales, and  altogether hard work. I am respectful to everyone and always help my co workers at all times when possible. I follow all safety rules and strive to do and be the best. I work part time due to goi g to college."
good,Dealing with thousands of customers daily and assisting them as much as possible. Having great customer service so they can leave with the urge to coming back for a future event with a positive attitude towards our stadium.
good,"Unload overnight shipments,stock,stage,and put away merchandise onto shelves.Operate all machinery at warehouse.I ejoyed working for this company because chance of advancement."
good,"Work is 4 days on 3 days off usually 10 hrs a day"
good,"I have been with THD for four months. No, my pay is NOT what it should be for what I do (overnight MET) (a high school student working pt as a cashier makes the same!) BUT the people I work for AND with are GREAT. The best team I've EVER worked with.  I had a crazy emergency come up and they were nothing but supportive and understanding.  The Homer Grant was a life saver. Never have I been anywhere with such a thing. It made me even more happy to be Orange, knowing I was cared about as an individual!"
good,"getting recipe and mixing ingredients "
good,"handle customer service daily, ringing out customers daily, handling money. Open or close the registers daily. Get along with everyone, laugh have fun"
good,"Constantly busy place of business.  Learned how to deal with all different types of people both as customers and as co-workers.  Co-workers were very helpful and would help out anyone whom needed it.  The hardest part of the job was the hours, along with the rare upset customer.  I enjoyed helping people with projects they had in mind, and making sure they purchased the correct pieces to finish the project."
good,Home Depot is a good retailer to get experience. Most stores have advancement opportunities. Can be a fun and enjoyable work place.
good,"I would arrive at work at six am,prepare and print out all paperwork needed for delivery.Load the flatbed with a forklift,secure the load and have it signed off.after the truck left the area,we would start preparing for another load."
good,"I enjoyed working home depot in somerset, ma. the only negative part was traveling back and forth to word for 100 miles + per night."
good,"It is a fun place to work, they work well with their employees and customers. Too many issues with management and hours and scheduling."
good,Easy going job with nice coworkers. Advancement wasn't that difficult but the time it took for management to get back to workers dragged on.
good,"I loved coming to work! all my coworkers was nice and professional!! All the customers loved me! Majority of the time, they would come in the store specifically looking for me!"
good,"Short handed at The Home Depot I worked at, no time for training overall good Co. to work for if u can make it to a Management position They won't pay you for outside work experience that apply's to your Department if your a plummer don't expect more $ to work in plumbing dept.clerk is a clerk.Overstock and new items where a constant pain.The best part about working at the Depot was when things went well Management showed appreciation for a goal completed but still had some unattainable goals almost daily."
good,It was very difficult to keep up with the demand for sales associate help on busy days. My name was called so much I wanted to change my name. At time you have a see of people to attend to. What I liked about working at the home depot was it is a knowledge based company which meant to me they always gave me the proper training to answer the customers questions. I did not like having the pressure to stop and stock shelves because of managements requirements. I understand when there is down time you do that but not when you have customers to take care of. Good place to work but needs new supervisors for other reasons I do not want to go into.
good,Las promociones se dan si eres amigo de algun gerente ya que si no sabes nada no hay problema solo tienes que hacer lo que tu jefe diga pero sin cuestionar
good,"Learned from pushing carts and cleaning the lot to being a sales associate, pulling orders, delivering orders, and loading or unloading incoming material trucks into the stores departments."
good,"Upbeat and personable individuals with self-motivation and superior organizational skills fare well as sales associates. Occupying sales floors, workers filling associate positions oversee the overall cleanliness and presentation of stores and merchandise. Additionally, sales associates must interact with customers, answer questions, and offer product suggestions based on customer needs. Working knowledge of merchandise, or a capacity to learn about store products, may earn job candidates favor for hire. Other shift duties include replenishing stock as needed, relieving cashiers as necessary, and completing tasks as assigned by managers. Sales associates earn upwards of minimum wage."
good,Great work culture that creates a very social and positive work area while being focused on training and great service to customers. A lot of experience in organization and team building. Part time pay is quite little and benefits and minimal.
good,Good job to supplement income from other sources. Job is OK if you can tolerate changes in schedule and varying income. You must be able to deal with the public.
good,"Home Depot is a great work environment. Building relationships with your customers learning new things everyday made it easy to go to work. Also, being able to work  full time and have a life outside of work was great. A lot of management came and gone but for the most part they were fine. My co-workers were good at team work but there was a lot of space to improve. Overall working at Home Depot was outstanding and is something I will never regret."
good,"trabajas a tu ritmo, tus jefes son accesibles, tienes una hora de comida, hay motivacion."
good,"When I started at The Home Depot I was 20 years old with no intentions of starting a career. I have had many remodels and managers over the years, who believed in me. "
good,"The Home Depot is a fantastic company to work for.  The core values and respect people demonstrate day-to-day is second to none.  The company continues to be the number one customer service retailer in the world, and will be difficult to beat in the years to come."
good,"A very decent working environment, but acquiring the knowledge needed for advancement, such as transferring within the company, can be hard for someone who has other commitments, such as upcoming relocation or another job search."
good,"I was a head cashier and supervisor. Really great company. My managers wouldn't let me have graduation off (even though I was graduating). Ridiculous. "
good,"Many improvements can be made to safety, employee treatment, and managerial approach to employee communication."
good,"Working at the home Depot has its pros and cons.  The job itself was fairly easy and could be fast paced at times due to the freight you are receiving at that given time. The work environment requires you to be aware of forklift drivers and other operable vehicles. Also the work shifts were flexible.  It's a good place to work at,  if you are willing to do the work"
good,"I work for an amazing store manager named mitch rusk"
good,I loved this job it challenged me. I started out as a cashier there and moved up to the paint department with in a year. I won a customer service award at this job for outstanding service.
good,"A typical day at work, power hour 10am -2pm strictly customer service but that was not always accurate. I learned how to drive lift equipment, learned stuff about all our merchandise, how to go about projects. Management was interesting. My co-workers, most were amazing people. Hardest part, finding management to assist you. Overall the place was great to work at, if you worked with the right people. They work with the community."
good,Not a bad place to work just expect a lot of hours if salaried. Great compensation though in the form of bonus for those many hours worked
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is boring. With there always being some kind of task to handle. I learned to better manage time here at Home Depot. Management and co-works are always willing to answer any questions and lend a helping hand if needed, respectful and professional."
good,Home Depot definitely provided me with lots of training in whatever I was being trained for rather it be a forklift operator or a sales associate.
good,"I love Home Depot, only flaw with the company is moving up into management. i am looking for a job because i am a recently graduate and i need so start paying back some of these bills,"
good,"•	Performed yearly inventory audit"
good,"Very physical & customer service driven.  No two days are the same. Currently I supervise & work beside my team doing returns, signing out orders, handling deliveries and install queries. I have learned that working in a retail environment can be very satisfying & always interesting. Excellent support from co-workers & management.  The physicality of the job is taking it's tole.  Our customers are great & working with them to complete their projects is the best part of the job."
good,"At The Home Depot, you learn quickly the importance of excellent customer service.  As a supervisor, I also learned many leadership skills such as communication and team management."
good,"A typical day for me included constant stocking & loading throughout the day. This required the daily operation of the sit down & stand up forklift, as well as being able to lift & load items up to 100 lbs."
good,"The people are what keeps you at the job, when the managers aren't hating or undermining each other they don't communicate with you."
good,"Not every day was golden, but every now and then, it can amaze me, from my time on the safety committee, the events, the 'Home Depot Olympics"", good hours and lots of friends. Do not regret it."
good,"Great Benefits, growth potential, Hard work, ..new hires are all kids and work ethic is poor. As such they go threw alot of people..the ones who can pass a drug test and background check rarely make it. Its a shame. The Home Depot was one of the good guys once upon a time, fair starting salary, more training. All the good people leave and they bad stay. That being said...I was one of the ""older people"" as I was there 8 yrs. I loved my job and was on my way to advancing in the company as I was finally at a place in my life where this was possible..I had all of my Managers support and couldnt wait to see how far I could go and then the rug was pulled out from under me due to a stupid error in judgement, along with 5 others and after that everyone started going..in a yr the store has turned over 90% of their associates."
good,THD was an excellent culture and really believes in growth and development of its associates. great benefits and perks to working for The Home Depot.
good,My position at Home Depot is a very fun and interactive role. I meet new people everyday. I assist customer and process orders.
good,"Its a good place to work if you're a college student or looking for a job right out of High School. The people are great, management could be better but other than that it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Learn you put in the work and ask to be move up, they will gladly give it to you. Only draw back is full-time is a first come first serve so you wait too long to ask you may not get it, but overall the job is awesome for me it pays my bills and car note plus have plenty of money left over. But just think if you wanna work freight you coming in doing nothing that why people quit, they think its easy its not. Freight gets alot of work to do in short periods of time. hen people call off alot."
good,"Good place to work. Busy and a lot to learn. Met a lot of really nice and interesting associates and customers. "
good,"Home Depot is all about change.  Things are constantly changing with brick & mortar stores.  Moving towards meeting the needs of customers shopping online- ecommerce, etc."
good,"A typical day at work involved juggling 2 portable phones with 3 lines each and often having all the lines full with employees and/or customers constantly pulling you on one direction or another to address immediate issues.  Interviewed hundreds of candidates annually. It was a great learning environment.  I participated in a lot of training, learned a lot and eventually conducted many training sessions with employees covering many topics. They were growing and expanding at a fast rate and it appeared to me that they often promoted many people before they were ready for management.  Many managers and supervisors struggled to communicate professionally and effectively to with their co-workers and subordinates. They also struggled with balancing the expectations of running their assigned areas and serving as the manager on duty and often dodged their manager on duty responsibilities which dumped those responsibilities onto other managers. This caused those that cared to be taken advantage of.  The more you gave, the more they would take.  Since Managers were rewarded on the store's performance, the ones that cared felt they carried the ones that didn't care.  The hardest part was seeing the company act opposite to their core values. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"I like this job as pro sales associate and learned so much on my customers and co-workers. the hardest part the we don't have the merchandise for my customer request for it now "
good,"My typical day is walking in with 5 minutes to spare as I prepare myself for my shift, once i'm ready I get in contact with my micro manager and he lets me know what needs to be done that night and how quick it should be completed and I find my work and begin to stock. Nothing about the job is hard to be, everything is fairly easy and repetitive but it gives me a sense of independence which i'm use to with some of my previous jobs which gives me lea way to come up with my own ideas to complete a project in the mentioned time."
good,Company has a great reputation of developing talent within its walls and helping its associates succeed. The Home Depot will allow its associates to develop their management skills by allowing their associates to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions for Customers on a daily basis
good,"I loved many of my co-workers. Some became good family friends."
good,I worked on the retail side of the company so everyday was something new. Management was very limited in their ability to promote from within.
good,"I worked as an LP for 1 year, and the management gave us a lot of freedom, but they expect high productivity from your side. The don't play around with the rules, if you have a mistake, you'd probably fired right in the spot."
good,Home Depot overnight stocking merchandise and organizing the sales floor to create a pleasant and safe shopping environment.
good,I looked forward to going to work every day. I enjoyed meeting and working with new people throughout my day. It was great to learn about the company and the variety of different products they had to offer. I was very disappointed when the seasonal work came to an end. Unfortunately the specific store I worked for could not keep on any seasonal employees due to lack of sales caused by local construction. I would work for them again anytime.
good,"Responsibilities included: processed third party subpoenas that concerned Home Depot Associates; logged subpoena request in ""queweb"" database to keep track of research and requested information. request and copy personnel files; processed and distribute wage settlements checks; research wage claim that was receive by the department of labor. Run reports and cross train with other employees."
good,It's a good place to work. They give you incentives. Prizes when you do a good job. Patches for a job well done. They keep you informed with changes and things when they have the mandatory meetings.
good,Lots of variety of people who work there. Lots of chances to cross train in more than one department depending on your interests.
good,"Home Depot cared for the associates and help them grow through the years, however, minimum staffing put pressure on scheduled associates which at the end become worn out."
good,"The associates are all very friendly and willing to help each other if they are able to. A typical day in receiving is usually very busy, especially in the Spring with all of the garden items coming in. Deliveries are seem to be continuous throughout the morning and afternoon.  All in all a nice place to work at."
good,A typical day at Home Depot is adventurous because each customers comes in with different problems that they're trying to solve and that's where we the sale association step in and provide wonder customer service.
good,"I have been working at The Home Depot part-time "
good,Home depot is a vast company that allows you to become the master of your home along with interacting with so many personalities. It is a company that allows you the chance to grow whether it is within 1 year or 20.
good,I would say that it is a good company to work for never a dull moment you get to work with some great people and meet some great customers there is room to grown with the company not a bad experience some of the management could use some work
good,Home Depot is a good place to work. I just wanted a little more of a challenge. The employees were very nice and a met a few friends.
good,"es una empresa muy buena la cual cuida a sus asociados"
good,Home Depot was a very fun place to work and the people are very high in integrity and honesty.  The work load is tremendous but the benefits are pretty good.  I would suggest Home Depot as a great position for young people or anyone starting a new career.
good,Helping customers find what they need to complete or start a home improvement project. Supervisors and management are great to work with.
good,"Working with Home Depot made the time go pass. You helped out the customers with questions on products, pulled orders or always dropping pallets for departments if you were forklift certified."
good,"Unloading Delivery Trucks, stocking inventory learning new floor plans, Team environment where  we all depended on each other, physically demanding job but spirits where always high in the work place."
good,i loved working for home depot got to meet a lot of great people also gave me knowledge on tools and products i never knew before
good,"Awesome co-workers"
good,"It was exciting to help customers see their dreams come to fruition. Each time a customer got a new kitchen or bathroom, I  felt like I received a new kitchen or bathroom myself. It is a very fulfilling position."
good,"I love my job, I get to meet a lot of interesting people. The only problem is, I need a full time job to support myself. Flexible hours, and the employees are always nice and helpful. I would love to get hired into lost prevention but there are no available positions."
good,"I feel as though home depot management is very selective. They promote associates based on favoritism. It is hard to speak to someone when you're having issues and even harder to get them to care. As a cashier, you will be faced with needy customers all day long. Most customers a pleasurable though. Only work here to gain valuable experience, great benefits, and OK starting pay. Do not make this a long term career unless you were lucky enough to be a favorite."
good,had a great time working here great staff made sum good friends n management is great work with me they were very flexible and accommodating to me
good,"it's a good place to work. but could use some improvements, updating security. and also do better at schedules. due to some people who do have families."
good,I worked on both the day shift and the night shift. I feel in love with most of the people I worked with! I liked it well enough that I stayed for for years.I mostly liked the work but it was back breaking work. A lot of heavy lifting. We always seemed to be short staffed. But seemed to be able to make the best of it.
good,Home Depot is a great company with many benefits and opportunities for advancement. Each store can have a different feel based on who the store manger and assistant managers are. The negative of Home Depot is that it is retail so it is rare to have a set schedule or get weekends off.
good,"Home Depot RDC is a good place to work, the benefits are great, they pay is good, and the hours are mostly steady. They promote from within. Most of the supervisors started out at the bottom."
good,The Home Depot overall is a great place to work. The opportunity for advancement within the store level is above average. Relationships between co-workers and managers is something that I enjoy. However opportunity to advance to the corporate office is rather difficult. Having obtained a degree and relative work experience it seems that has little effect on consideration for positions with corporate Home Depot. Day to day the job is something I rather enjoy and getting to see customers who are happy with their installation purchases make it worthwhile.
good,This job was short term along the lines of working for a staffing company. I was able to utilize existing management skill while working as a lead in this warehouse. It was a total difference from my prior experience as a manager in retail but I definitely loved the quick-paced environment. There was little to no downtime so the job was done on time and everyone did their share.
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work. Typical day at work is normal like every other cashier job elsewhere. Hardest part of the job is having to stand for extended hours and being moved from one register to another. Great co-workers but advancement in the company is directed to a selected few!
good,revisión de áreas seguridad limpieza capacitación constante atención cliente y productos  la parte mas dificil es que el departamento depende de otras áreas lo que mas me gusto capacitación
good,"Let me start by saying I really do love my job. I've worked in two separate departments, but Service Desk has been the most fulfilling. When the company says that customer service is number one - they mean it. My store in particular does everything in its power to take care of the customer, and I love being able to do that. The pay is way above minimum wage, even as a cashier. And we have some pretty great benefits (my eye insurance is AWESOME). My coworkers are some of the best people I've met; they make my days at work so much easier. Yeah, sometimes we have those unbearable customers; the people you don't want to help, but are required to. My biggest issue is management. From what I've gathered over my two years, they focus more on what's going wrong and what can be improved instead of praising associates for what we've succeeded on. They tend to jump on the smallest of issues while ignoring the blaring problems. Now, the actual managers are not mean, or rude, or anything like that. It just seems like that's the way they are taught to proceed. "
good,Worked in 6 departments. Learned skills and information about departments I did not have a lot of expertise in before working there. Enjoy being with people and make it fun whatever the day brings. A big smile goes a long way and can be contagious.
good,Home Depot is a good employer that could be great. If it would move beyond just looking at big data for its scheduling it would accommodate its employees lives and schedules. As a part-time employee through college it provided a source of income that wasn't always consistent.
good,"Company provides good training and ability to advance to a certain degree."
good,"Report to work station. Daily you would learn something new."
good,it was overall an okay job. It became very stressful and challenging when many of our employees decide to quit. the company had good pay and good management.
good,Working for Home Depot was a great place to work for. I learned more about home improvement and how to assist customers with home issues. Had a great management team and the co-workers were pleasant.
good,"great place to work. fast paced, great if you like personal shopping experience. employees are committed to customer service."
good,I am a team player as well as a good positive worker. I build moral when it comes to working as a team. Being a nursery specialist it was my job to work with coworkers and customers about the value of horticulture and landscaping. I would deal with around 30-40 customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job I would say is making sure the products were properly shelved and merchandised we had over 200-300 products that needed to be organized daily.
good,"Work in one of the very top stores in Home Depot which demands a significant commitment to addressing customer questions and meeting their particular needs in a fast paced environment."
good,It is a great place to work with opportunities for advancement. Associates and managers have a team player attitude. I enjoy interacting with customers and co-workers on a daily basis
good,"I enjoyed working here.  It was good for a part time job.  Was trying to advance, and no opportunities were available till right after I left for a full time job with benefits.  Worked in lawn & garden during the busy season.  Learned a lot and enjoyed the work.  You are enabled to do what you need to do to make the sale.  There is no commission though, which stunk since I sold at least 10 tractors and 12 lawn mowers in the few short months I was there.  Pay isn't the greatest and really no benefits until you go full time (department supervisor) for the most part.  Also I have seen bad reviews due to employee attitude.  Yes there were a few who brought issues to work and just had a I don't care attitude, but if you enjoy doing everything you can to help the customer, they appreciate it, and it's extremely rewarding."
good,"Great company to work for, great co-workers, and great management."
good,"This employer provides a friendly and accepting enviornment to work in.  I feel welcome by my co-workers and management.  I go to work and am almost entirely self-tasking.  I've learned many skills and useful information about home ownership.  The management is quick to respond to schedule adjustments for childcare, medical appointments, ect."
good,"Overall a great place to work."
good,"I had few difficulties working at HD. My involvement with management was positive, I maintained good relations with my managers, one has even remained a friend after I left. However the structuring of HD is similar to Walmart, from my experience. Both are massive corporations, with little genuine care for their employees, only willing to go so in helping employees as it is beneficial for profits and quotas. I enjoyed the people I worked with more than I enjoyed the company itself; you are frequently reminded you are expendable, especially being in an at-will state. If you keep this in mind and realize it goes with the territory, you are better off. Otherwise, enjoy the people, work hard, and keep your head down."
good,Easy atmosphere for learning and growing. Must be determined to push for what you want. Must be a self starter to learn. You can learn all you want.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot has employees interacting customers (sometimes more than one at a time) and daily tasks. It can be challenging at times and slow others."
good,"In a typical day, I might greet as many as 200 customers in a four hour shift.  I set myself to learn where every item a customer might ask for would be located, and I update that information, if the location changes.  My immediate supervisor is my greatest help, with updates on what merchandise will be moved in the coming week, and where it will be moved to.  My co-workers are also very helpful, and have been welcoming since my very first day on the job.  The hardest parts of the job are finding out which things are the most asked for items, and greeting every single customer who walks in the front door.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with customers and co-workers, and knowing I left my area better than I found it."
good,"You must love customer service type job to appreciate Home Depot. Customers come first! If you are willing to have an open schedule, when there is a full time position open, this is the place to be."
good,"Needs more diversity in management. At some point, this company needs a Union to protect the associates and to give fare increases in raises."
good,"The hours are ok but if you want to move to up in the company, they over work you and you don't get paid much even if you advance."
good,"A typical day is filled with many different opportunities to help customers complete their projects. I have learned so much about painting, staining, and home improvement related projects. My co-workers were great at helping me learn all I needed to know. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people create a home they love."
good,"Decent benefits, nice coworkers and good customer service. It's very hard to get fired though and that can be a problem with bad coworkers who have a negative effect on the work atmosphere."
good,this is a very busy place with tons of work to do. pay is low in comparison what you do. there is room to move up. you can learn tons of stuff about different products
good,Allows the associates to show their best work.  This is highlighted when a customer requests meeting a manager of the day to show their appreciation on the outstanding help the associate provided and ask what the company can do to show their appreciation of the associate's excellence.
good,Requesting the money for the tills in the morning was pretty easy. Watching the cashiers get excited over playing games and contest prizes always made the day enjoyable.
good,"Co workers are all great to work with, one of the reasons I like working for Home Depot. The jobs are challenging every day witch I like. Management at the Depot are fair if you do you job. Day at work consist of taken care of the customers and there needs. Hardest part of the job for Home Depot is taken care of all the customers because there is to little help to cover the store."
good,"This is a good company to work for , lots of customer experience daily, enjoy working with customer helping to assist them in home improvements as needed."
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for but they are straying to far away from the values that originally made them so successful.  They originally paid associates fairly and hired people that were knowledgeable, or trained people to be good at they position they were placed into.  They used to have hands on training with trainers that has now turned into a video of someone talking to you about a quarter of information that is needed."
good,It is a really easy job and has a lot of advancement opportunities although the attendance policy is horrible and the some of leadership is bad. Other than that it's super easy and a decent place to work with great benefits.
good,"Good working environment, advancement is possible with proper training provided, Wages could be improved according to skills and experience."
good,I loved working here. The people I worked with were so warm and welcoming. It's so rare to be able to work in an environment where the employees truly care about what they do.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to start in the workforce. There is definite potential for job growth, and the culture is relitively upbeat.I came into this job optimistic at eightteen and felt incredibly lucky to have earned the promotion that I did as early as I did. I was very grateful for the opportunity as it most likely geared me toward my current position with NFM."
good,"The environment is great! But poor management, all managers are friends with department supervisors in and out of work so they're never wrong."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work with good management and great company culture. Id work there again no problem. Training is adequate for the job as well
good,Strong focus on customer service.  Given time and information to become a specialist in your area.  Fellow associate are supportive and friendly.
good,"Home depo was good place to work, they taught me many different kind of products and how to use them.Nice place to find anything for your home."
good,I've enjoyed working at The Home Depot. The Home Depot has a really nice work environment. A typical day includes talking with customers and finding the best piece of hardware to complete a project
good,Cons: lacks innovation...Many of the policies and procedures are outdated as it relates to managing employees.  Too many one trick pony type roles and responsibilities.
good,"Home Depot is a fairly good company for which to work."
good,"loved meeting new people, seeing smiles and heping customers, when i worked there it was a friendly fun environment to be around."
good,"busy day, makes time fly by. great co workers. very understanding of your family life. can make your own hours. you learn something new every day and make great friends"
good,"THD IT need a plan, flying by the seat of there pants. they are hiring people w/out office space. "
good,"It can be challenging hard work, very pleased at the end of my shift knowing that I did a great job and also helped in resolving some customers issues and to see the smile on the customers face when you have helped them. Also getting the friendly greetings in the morning  and through out the day from fellow co-workers in the store and being part of the solution in helping are community."
good,"I enjoy/ enjoyed working at home depot. You meet good people, management does a decent job and I've gained a lot of communication skills dealing with customers alone. I've also gained on organization skills through stocking product and managing the overheads, as well as gaining team work skills through tasks with other coworkers."
good,Fun going to work.  Is very strong in team work.  Meeting the public and serving them. Training is available at all times. Management is there to help and assist you. Clean enviroment
good,The Home Depot is a company with a nice work atmosphere where employees receive the adecuate training to perform their jobs succesfully.
good,This was a great place to work. The hours were good and they were very organized. The only 2 bad things about this place is you're likely to stay in the same position you started in for a long time. They rarely promote employees even if they've been with the company for a long time. Also the pay could be better. It wasn't horrible but it definitely could have been better.
good,I learned how to get the customers in and out as quick as i can. I also learned a lot of the other departments to better myself with helping the customers.
good,this is a very good company to work for it just really needs to work on the management that run the building. but other than that I have had a great experience working with this company. and I'm glad I worked for them as long as I did.
good,"The Home Depot can be a great place to work.  The benefits are outstanding, the work environment is typical of a big box retailer, the employees are like family, and the earnings potential is high."
good,Good products that are easy to sell without having to lie about their abilities. Associates are easy to get along with. Training is easily comprehensible and thorough although it's better to know your product through first hand experience. Raises and bonuses seem to be on a base of favoritism which is a little frustrating.
good,A typical day at work is met with cleaning up receiving. Processing return to vendor items and assuring all rtv items have been processed and not on the reports. Going over store purchase journal that was taught to me by my supervisor. Running the department when my supervisor is off or on vacation.
good,The environment was very friendly and fast-paced. However the shift times were the only problem ! The management and co-workers were a blast of fun !
good,Customers are all great and associates work well together and they are a huge team. Some of the management team needs a little work but over all pretty good. i learn new things each day. The hardest part of my job is when there is no coverage you have to be pulled in many different directions to help each and everyone of my customers.
good,learned about customer service and how to run a cash register also how to down stock product for the customers and also how to mix paint and to color match paint
good,"I check emails, check in-store customer appointment books, check online customers design appointments. Call to follow up with the customers for design meetings, design updates, layout options, tour the Cabinets display to educate customers about different cabinets vendors and manufactures products sold at The Home Depot. Help the client in the selection of Cabinets, quality, finishes, appliances, Vanity and bath features. Assist the customer and educate about different Countertop material, quality, color, and Manufacturers. Set customer expectations on the process in deliveries and installations procedures. Sale the whole project."
good,"Decent place to work, typical day involves unloading the incoming freight from the truck and sorting/taking it to it's designated department."
good,"For a big company it really feels as if you apart of an extended family. It has an inverted pyramid when it comes to people the employees, the CEO is at the bottom and the sales associates at the top. They take care of all of their associates."
good,The company as a whole is great. Managers have favorites and hold positions for them. Managers are slow about allowing transfers.
good,"Learned: customer service, placing and receiving product shipments, project management, problem solving and purchasing."
good,"Home Depot is a very fun working environment where everyone is treated as equals, and voices and opinions are heard. Typically, customers are great, working to help customers who appreciate our efforts make coming to work very pleasant."
good,"from start to finish of every shift i was kept busy pulling orders, delivering customer orders. i dealt with customers face to face assisting them to find whatever they may need through out the store and also helping out other employees if needed."
good,I worked with a great group of people.  I learned something every month from our product knowledge classes.  Best group of truck drivers I have ever worked with.
good,"During my time at Home Depot as a Customer Service Respresentative I was responsible for inventory management, ordering products, point-of-purchase setup and display, new product promotions, product demonstrations, and customer satisfaction. I was also subjected to various situations where I was required to first identify with the customer, then find out their needs, educate the customer, and then determine a solution that would meet their needs. This job taught me time-management, resourcefulness, and how to communicate effectively with a diverse group of people."
good,I loved to work at Home Depot but when i transfer it was a mess between the Hiring staff and I in both locations Michigan & North Carolina
good,"The management in the Harriman store was wonderful. When I left, they told me I would always have a job there. The Johnson City store was another story. The were nasty and self serving."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work, but like any job there are good days and bad days. The work enviroment can be hectic at times due to fact that it is a working warehouse. Working there we had a family like connection among us, and like a family there will be ups and downs. Although this is a great company to work for, i believe improvement needs to be made among management. There is room to grow but that is also a problem because there is a lack of communication among managers and supervisors. It can be difficult to do your job when being told five different things by five different managers."
good,the day is full of customer service which is the priority at this job as many others. each day is very different with many different levels of experience to be taught and learned.
good,As a manger I have learned to be able to take care of associate's and be able to take care of associates.  I have learned from my associates and peers to be able to do my job and be an affective leader. My most important time in my job is where I can become a mentor for my associates and be able to motivate and lead them.
good,"Hardest part of the job is customer satisfaction, but if you are patient and work hard, this is not a problem. Management is friendly and supportive."
good,"A typical day at work was restocking merchandise, putting up freight, keeping a clean department, ordering stock and helping customers. I learned a lot about customer service and how to keep customers happy and I also learned great supervisory and management skills. Most of the management were very helpful and easy to work with but a few were very difficult to work with. My co-workers were great but just like any other place, some were productive and some were lazy. The hardest part of the job was making sure I had all products in stock and keeping a clean and organized department. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great team to work with and the productivity they provided me with."
good,"A typical day at work on Cash/Returns:"
good,"Overall the Home Depot has done a good job with this program. They treat it like a secret weapon, and it should be. The merchandisers at Home Depot are the best in the business, though their priority is obviously servicing Home depots needs first. The upper management is fair, not particularly personal, and at times it seems as if they prefer to keep their merchandising teams separate from store associates. That can create some dissent in the work place at times, but it's manageable. The pay is acceptable, but not competitive for a metro area market. The benefits are pretty good. The work environment is hectic and frustrating depending on how well staffed the location is you are working in, but if well staffed, the work is not terribly complicated.  A good team can make this job fun, and most Home Depot locations encourage group activities like store bbq's and fundraisers."
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot is a fast paced day helping upwards of hundreds of people per day resolve home and business needs and educate them on our newest products. I have learned how to communicate with people from multiple cultures and linguistic backgrounds and solve problems with difficult customers. I work with some of the best people I have met, my coworkers are excellent and hard working. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help a customer or customers have a quick and painless experience in the store. When I can give them all of the knowledge that they need and the products to fulfill their jobs it is very satisfying. Also, I have been able to volunteer my time with Team Depot making life a little easier for a Veteran of our nations military. It brings personal joy to give back to someone who risked everything for this country."
good,"Remove merchandise from boxes and place on shelves. Make sure products are properly aligned and in stock. Use inventory management hardware to find/relocate products."
good,"At The Home Depot, I as my coworkers in the Front End Department do all that we can to provide great customer service. We have learned how to help each other in the areas where one another lack and also have became great team members. As a returns associate, I have learned about the vast amount of delinquency that occurs right in front of us in our store and I also have learned how to deal with certain situations that may often be intimidating and rather scary. But, on the brighter side of being an employee in The Home Depot, we don't only receive great benefits and online exclusives to thousands of stores but we also learn so much about how contractors and do-it-yourself customers do what they do and what time and money is needed into accomplishing such projects. As for management, we have a couple of managers that are top notch in all they do which motivates us to continue working our hardest in stores."
good,"Flat stack the lumber areas, Help customers with find items that they are looking for, Put Away all returns, Clean up the work area, throw trash away"
good,"As a pro associate my job is  to interact with customers/contractors.  I must deal with all situations in the store, every department. I assist in helping customers with large projects such basement renovations or building deck and fences, also responsible for deck and fence designs. "
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work "
good,"Typical day for me was ringing people up. Occasionally I'd do computer based training, process returns, or do various projects. "
good,Great benefits are given to both full time and part time employees. Helped customer service and interpersonal skills. Co-workers were always willing to help new employees. Great training that helps new employees adjust to new work environment.
good,"Produce quotes"
good,"I currently work on the freight team, and we have to work as a team to accomplish our tasks and goals. It can be a very fun place to work."
good,good place to grow if your new to merchandising or sales. lots of education and training for new associates. lots of responsibilities and customers to help. You wont get bored easily. Lots to learn.
good,"The company was great, awesome people and customers all around. always something to do. Listen to the employees and helped build moral. Hardest part of the job was when there was no coverage at all and you had customers at the desk but managers where right there to pick up where it was needed. The best part of the job was i got to stay busy as long as I was there."
good,Challenging job with many tasks and much responsibility.  Fun work environment and always learning new things.  A work environment that promoted empowerment which I think is awesome.
good,i worked for home depot for apox five years some personal issues come about wich made my attendance suffer however those issues are now resolved i was a key player in the daily tasks was given tasks and was able to complete these tasks
good,"Very busy day no matter what day of the week, management needs improvement. Coworkers were really like a family and understanding. I learned how to put customer service first and how to be the best cashier to my availability. hardest part was dealing with over 150 customers a day and most enjoyable part was the kind and lovable customers."
good,The only thing I have bad to say about Home Depot is they hire people and throw them to the wolves without proper training and the new people half the time can not go to a manager because they do not know the answer anymore
good,"Greyhound lines was a great entry level job for students as well as part time job for older adults. Management was great, hours were flexible, and overtime was always available for employees."
good,They are a great company to work for just need a management change. There are a lot of good people who have been there for a long time that makes it a fun place to work. The benefits are great and pay is not to bad
good,"Every one here made you feel like you had known them for a long time. We worked well as a team, being able to go to one another with any issues we had and being able to solve them effectively and efficently"
good,I learned a lot of new things because I have never worked in a outside department before. I had a great supervisor and he was really helpful. The best part about the job was the pay and the interaction with the customers that I experienced on the daily basis.
good,great place to work. very busy. long hours. managers are ok. learned a lot about customer service. my co workers are ok. been here for over 7 years.
good,"As far as retail jobs go, I think this has been a great experience.  The corporate culture is great, but the culture from store to store depends on management.  The trickle down really affects the attitudes of associates and you can really see it when you look at how associates treat one another.  I've worked with great store managers and the store atmosphere was fantastic, we all cared about each other and our store would do really well.  I've worked with not so great store managers and associates seem to turn on one another and the store does poorly.  Just do your job, try to work in different departments, or maybe try transferring before deciding to give up on it.  I have worked for other big box retailers and Home Depot is by far the best one."
good,"same as any call center, not special, but decent pay, no else to say, great co workers , nothing is hard about the job, apac is a decent company with many programs to work for not just these two"
good,no complaints but the job could have warned the associate when certain positions in the store were getting cut or stopped.
good,"this job is fairly easy...however it doesn't challenge you, its boring,the co workers are nice but changing your schedule is like puling teeth and i need something a little more flexible"
good,"At the customer service desk, we assist customers with BOPIS orders, will call orders, phone sales, and truck rentals.  It is an extremely busy department.  The management and co-workers are great and work as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the other associates and being able to help the customers efficiently with their orders/problems."
good,"This company is very awesome. They have many benefits, you work at your own pace. We get one hour breaks when we work very long shifts, we have the chance of moving to other departments to advance our knowledge."
good,"Price changes, inventory, order stock, customer service, backup cashier/customer service, shipping/receiving, good employees, learned about inventory/stocking"
good,"im not sure if it's like this during the day but i noticed so much negativity during the night. back talking, clicks, and hostile negative people. work wise, work is distributed very unevenly and unfairly."
good,"Home Depot is a wild/crazy machine. Up and down hours unless you work for operations with Mon-Fri hours. Pro Desk is the best position thus far at Home Depot. Establishing friendships and knowledge from the local contractors. Management teams can be rocky, one squad is there for a few years then it gets a refresh/reset with a new team. "
good,"Benefits were great, not as good as in past. Some of policies as of recent have pushed management to get worse with employees. It should not be such a hard place to work. It used to be a fun place to work in the beginning. Always having something fun going on. There have been less and less of that with the company wanting to spend less and less money on employees."
good,"I liked at Home Depot the coworkers and customers, and always received good compliments too.  The Christmas decorations were beautiful. During the holiday, they always chose nice places for our Christmas party  too"
good,The typical day starts with logging in and being available to take or make calls. There are daily meetings which are designed to let us know how many calls are expected for the day. 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches are strongly monitored. Staff must constantly be aware of the many emails that are submitted daily.
good,"This is one of the busiest stores during major seasons, so you will always be needed. They will work with your schedule, but usually they'll always need you on weekends. Very easy to switch with coworkers, though. Just let the head cashier know and they'll pencil your switch."
good,"liked working there, things could have been better. management needs some work. loved the customers and the co workers."
good,Like any retail job the hours are not the best. What makes this job great are the co-workers and assistant managers! If you are fun loving and can deal with angry customers this would be a perfect job.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work; I have become proficient in customer service, as well as many common annual and perennial plant types that are common in this area of Tennessee. I have enjoyed the comradery I share with my fellow coworkers; there is a sense of great accomplishment at the end of each day (we have long work days). Being new to the area, The Home Depot has been a wonderful opportunity to make new friends!"
good,"As a technician, I learned about most aspects of an electrician's job, a handy man's job and a flooring installer's job. These are skills you only learn on the job or when working closely with people that do the job on a regular basis. "
good,"As a Sales Associate in Garden, the job was fairly easy. Keep the shelves stocked, help customers find what they are looking for, give them some information about the products, and maybe help them load something up. And, for 10.25/hr that wasn't bad. I learned a lot about landscaping that I didn't know before, and I learned a thing or two about plants and how to take care of them. Management was down right terrible. They never communicated with each other or the employees. All they care about is driving sales so that they can have fat bonuses, what they should be worried about is having a good job environment for their workers. The co-workers were okay, but they gossiped a lot and talked about people behind their backs and would never say anything to that persons face. The hardest part of the job was that it's pretty boring. They say ""Find ways to stay busy"" but there are a lot of times when there is really nothing to do. The most enjoyable part of the job, was when the store was a little busy but not over the top busy. That was when you could be kept busy while maintaining your sanity."
good,"Typical day at work is crazy. It takes alot to be able to handle the ""Special Services"" Desk. Multitasking is a MUST, great communication with customers and assoicates as well. Management was fair, all co-workers were nice in my store. Some were resistant to helping at times... The hardest part of my job was being left alone up there with no one to help or one or two new cashiers to train at the desk while I was taking care of 2 of my own customers and one for each of them. The most enjoyable part of my job was my front end co-workers and weekly customers. They were very supportive and funny."
good,"This is a retail home improvement store with a great atmosphere to work in, and great people to work with. As a Cashier, a typical day for me includes ringing up customers at the cash registers, bagging customer purchases, seeking out customers and offering friendly service, answering customer questions or finding the answer for the customer, communicating customer requests to appropriate management, and maintaining a high level of professionalism and friendliness at all times. Management is very helpful and responsive to questions and requests, and co-workers are very friendly and a joy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the atmosphere created by co-workers and managers alike, as they are all friendly and great to talk to. The hardest part is helping the occasional challenging customer, however that has taught me how to better manage anxiety and tailor my response to such customers by being as helpful as I can while avoiding confrontation, or asking management to step in when appropriate. I would recommend Home Depot as a great employer for someone who enjoys a friendly retail customer service environment."
good,I learned a LOT at Home Depot - a very good organization that was going through significant leadership changes while I was there.
good,"I enjoyed the diversity and being able to help the customers and the people I worked with.  I enjoy being around diverse environment (Gardening, Electrical, Hardware, etc.)"
good,"Home Depot like most companies of this size has its own culture."
good,"Overall Home Depot has given me a lot. I get to meet new people everyday and see regulars who become more friends than customers. I have learned more about tools, and electrical and selling doors and windows that I would have laughed at anyone who have told me this eleven years ago."
good,"Fast paced enjoy working with the public I have learned how to grow grass and flowers, also how put down floor tile. knowing the products first hand."
good,"I enjoy my time at the Home Depot, I have never worked retail and haven't realized how demanding the job can sometimes be. I've learned a lot about myself as well as my strengths and weaknesses. As a sales associate, you have to know how to talk people, have patience,manage time, and be a team player. "
good,Strong corporate culture and legacy. Willing to take prudent risks supported by successful test and learn. Fierce competitor!
good,"I enjoyed working with others, multitasking and helping customers. Could have used full time hours at the time. The day goes by fast, your constantly moving and helping others. Which I enjoy."
good,Home Depot is a good job.  The management and people you work with are amazing people.  The job itself can be demanding but nothing you can't handle.  It is a physical job.  A lot of heavy lifting.  The only con is low pay.
good,I liked working here I met a lot of great people and I enjoyed the customers. I would greet the customers daily as they walked into the store.
good,"A great place to work if advancement is not on your agenda.  The management was very helpful and friendly.  My co-workers were great to work with, and I learned how to be part of a productive team.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the fluctuating hours.  The most enjoyable aspect was helping the customers."
good,I assisted customers with choosing the right cabinets that would go with the integrity of their home or finding their personal style and making it work.  I assisted with every detail of their remodel.  I enjoyed making them happy at the end of the project.
good,"Work days are very busy. I learned how to access all situations properly. Management are extremely busy but always create time for their workers. Co-workers worry about themselves. The hardest part of the job is the affect outside situations have on the co-workers that create problems during work. The most enjoyable part of the job is constantly being rewarded for reaching daily, weekly and monthly goals."
good,"Everyone is very nice and welcoming. The employees really matter even to upper management, which is rare in many large companies."
good,"One can learn a lot while working for the home depot. minimal professional feedback is delivered and management priorities are hard to follow and seem very unproductive and illogical at times. apparently this is common in a retail environment, however, supervisor positions will regularly open up usually starting from around $13/hr, and they will also bonus double. it is not the worst place to work, but keep in mind different positions have different responsibilities at the associate level. This regularly seems unfair, but if someone wants to make a career out of this place, it will always be an option."
good,"High Customer Service, people oriented, household and construction industry. Enjoyed co-workers and some management."
good,There are many roles on plays while working at Home Depot and you both meet and work with a wide range of characters.  There is always something to learn in this business due to  the many different departments and the knowledge and skills required in each.
good,"Honestly working here isn't that bad, you always stay busy even if there isn't customers. The money is decent and there is room to move up. Just like in one of the motto, after a while you literally ""bleed orange."""
good,"The people were wonderful, the work was constant and the customers were challenging and fun to work for at all times."
good,Typical retail experience. The management was good. The co- workers were great. This was only a summer job for me but a great place to work.
good,Working at the Home Depot allows associates to really connect with the customers. Walking customers to the products they need as well as giving them knowledge about the product will assure they leave the store happy. Customer service is key.
good,"HR Call center environment, 60+ hour work weeks, limited work-life balance in this department. Hardest part of the job is working 24 hours/day, based on investigations, throughout all US and PR stores. Most enjoyable part applying HR knowledge to resolve investigations."
good,"Great place to work and learn a lot on home improvement. Awesome benefit package........."
good,A typical day working for the homedepot is awarding to me because I enjoy helping and meeting new people and figuring out needs throughout the store and their projects. I learned a tremendous amount knowledge about the products being sold at the store. The managers are very knowledgeable and are always willing to help when i have to ask questions about anything pertaining to personal and customers needs. All co workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job might be standing on your feet all day.
good,"Pricing team included three people for the entire store who were responsible for prices changes. This included getting accurate counts on the items that were on that days list. List may have as little as 20 price changes to as many 50, all of which needed to be done by the end of the day."
good,"It would be pretty busy most of the time. I learned a lot. I learned where everything went, that I did not know where things went, how to scan and check to see if we have certain items in the store, or when they will be in. The management is pretty good. The co-workers are basically like family. They like to joke around, but be serious when the work is put first. The hardest part, is when your new at the job, and not for sure where anything goes at first. Most enjoyable, is getting the hang of everything, and making your co-workers and customers laugh or happy with what they need."
good,"Very busy, Non-stop, plenty of work to be done. Very Customer Service oriented. Learned many aspects of the business, both internal and external.  Many fun people to work with. Hardest part of the job was accomplishing everything that truly needed to be done. Most enjoyable were the many cookouts and sponsored community events."
good,It is a great job within a fast-paced work environment. This job requires you to be able to change gears quickly and work as a team.
good,"good management team, fun environment, hard to get a set schedule, advancement can be slow, good pay, offer good benefits"
good,"Home Depot gave me the opportunity to learn various home improvement departments. I was able to move around in the company to learn and challenge my abilities. It was always nice to know that I was educated enough to help our customers and to be requested, by name, when customers came into my store."
good,"The Oregon City Home Depot has a very good foundation of knowledgeable specialists in all the departments. There are quite a few people who have worked at the store since it was opened as well as former managers and assistant managers who have since decided to work as regular associates. The staff has a great deal of knowledge of the company and also the products and most go out of their way to help their customers. Because of that, the Oregon City store really excels."
good,"Very fun job to work for. You have opportunities to make new friends and, at the same time, hone your skills in a fast, fast work place. Once you clock in it is all about customer service from the get go. The hardest part of the job is the retail flex hours but you eventually get used to it. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and associates alike. A position of leadership is extremely rewarding and it can motivate you to do more. Very enjoyable job."
good,Home depot has a diverse population of employees. Everyone is very helpful and works as a team! All the employees care about customer service and will go beyond their expectations to help out customers.
good,Great place to work for especially while going to school.  They offer tuition reimbursement witch can be of great help.  Another great incentive is that you can always transfer to another location since they have so many.
good,The hardest part of my job is when we aren't busy. I enjoy working with most of my coworkers. The customers that come in to shop here are very unique.
good,i worked here for almost 14 years . i met alot of people and learned many new things . i went from the plumbing department to shipping and receiving to working the contractors desk . i pulled orders for customers will calls and deliveries . was in charge of other order pullers in the position .
good,"morning announcements, morning stretches, assign work to associates, assign special projects to assoicates, check their work , manage time."
good,Started in call center and advanced to Enterprise Customer service specialist. I handled an assigned customer base consisting of Multiple branch customer who did a large volume of business. Also handled e-commerce customers and large Home Depot stores. Worked in a department that consisted of 5 hand selected representatives so teamwork was very important. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. We were allowed to work with very little supervision.
good,The job was great for experience in cash handling and sales. I felt like it helped me learn plenty about the corporate environment and how to be professional.
good,"pretty good place to work."
good,I guess depending on which Home Depot you work at will give you more acquainted with the ones who work there. at time it can be fun but more stressful then anything.
good,"As a lot attendant my main task is organizing shopping carts and loading merchandise for customers. That, along with occasional extra tasks are the make-up of my day. It's nice sometimes because I can really get 'in the zone' with my work, but it can sometimes become monotonous on slower business days."
good,Hours could be standardized to create more work/life balance  Giving employees 2 consecutive days off would help. General manager is very effective and people oriented.
good,Flexible when it comes to part timers and a very diverse work place . Gain knowledge when it comes to do it yourself projects
good,"-Sales/customer service"
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot because I helped turn around a department that needed to be ran properly. I also enjoyed helping customers and my co-workers and making it a pleasant environment.
good,"I was trained on each appliance to better serve the customers with their specific needs, I custom ordered appliances when needed and would follow up to make sure they were happy with it.  I answered phone calls about complaints and did my best to address any problems promptly. I started learning about working in other departments also."
good,"Ring up customer purchases, call departments to find out prices if there isn't a code to scan.Excellent customer service, answer phones, work in garden area, returns and call center when scheduled. Work in other departments when asked."
good,"Started as Bay Integrity associate using hand held phone/computer to get daily work log and price changes.  Changed labels, scanned all outs in assigned department.  Worked steadily and tried to get as much finished as possible each day. While acknowledging customers and giving excellent customer service.  They finally did away with that job and I went onto the floor in a department.  Was expected to pack down merchandise daily, give excellent customer service and any and every other thing managers needed done.  I did learn how to give excellent customer service by acknowledging the customer and offering to help at all times. The management was easy to talk to and get along with.  The co-workers were human in every way.  Some were excellent and some were lazy.  The hardest part of the job for me was the lack of time to do training and anyone who didn't do their job made the next persons day harder.  I loved interacting with the customers and being able to help them."
good,Paid better then most places for a cashier job and for someone starting out.  Friendly staff and flexible with hours. Also they will train for other departments.
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,"Typical day at work involves constantly restocking shelves, cleaning, and helping customers find what they came in for. A lot of walking back and forth. Constantly delivering in customer service and hoping that you have what they need in stock."
good,"Home depot is a great company!"
good,"- Respectful and supportive management."
good,"Corporate policy for employees is good such as the Homer Fund, which is available to all associates to help with medical bills or even household expenses (mortgage and utilities) when needed.  The store in which the associate works raises money which is met by the fund 3 to 1."
good,"I liked working at The Home Depot but a lot of times, it was slow. I would fulfill that time by cleaning, organizing or putting go backs away, but I just wanted something to where I could be moving around more, interacting more with the customers rather than just checking them out. It was too easy and I prefer more of a challenge. I loved my coworkers and loved the activities we'd do as a team though."
good,"The Home Depot is a fast paced environment requiring a great deal of flexibility and decisiveness on a daily basis.  With high customer traffic and a large pool of employees, everyday presents new challenges on both the customer side and human resource side of the business.  Time management is of the utmost importance to ensure the ""typical"" daily tasks get accomplished while reacting to and resolving any issues as they pop up.The schedule tends to be extremely variable depending on business needs largely controlled by seasonality.  At times this can make it very challenging to balance work and life outside of the store.  Regardless, in this job associates have the opportunity to touch many lives and form emotional connections with their customers by helping them improve their homes and complete projects."
good,"As a supervisor, I am responsible for merchandising throughout the entire store. This involves a great partnership with store management as well as outside vendors. I am responsible for a team of ten associates. Some responsibilities include: Price changes throughout the entire store, Ensuring over 1300 bays within the store are set 100% to P.O.G., Coaching, training, Associate recognition or rewards, Ordering P.O.P, Outstanding customer service, associate reviews, Hiring and hours control. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a customer smile whether it be helping the customer find everything they need to complete their project, or simply saying something nice to help them get through their day."
good,"Working at the home depot was great experience and got to meet great co-workers. The management was great to work with when you needed help with something they helped you. Got to learn how to work with a forklift,reach, and order picker."
good,"After your 60 day probation, even part timers are eligible for benefits (sick time, vacation time). At first it will be overwhelming especially if you are not into home improvement, however, it is inevitable that you will learn tons. HR (ASMs) is usually very understanding and you can go to them about anything. They have what they call the Homer Fund which is a relief fund that helps employee during a life crisis (ie. terminally ill relative, fire, death in family). The only thing I disliked was how my hours changed during the seasons even though I was not a seasonal associate. The beginning of September I'd have almost 30 hours and the next couple weeks I'd be down to 12 hours. If you have a passion for home improvement and the public, Home Depot may be the place for you."
good,"Home depot was always fun to work for. Every day the management were happy and very positive. A typical day for me there was just going in, being welcomed, clocking in and getting to work. The person on shift that was leaving would always let me know what happened throughout the morning shift. I learned alot working for home depot. Such as information about plants, lumber, tools, ect. I really enjoyed everything about the job, they just didnt offer full time or benefits."
good,Very good place to work for. You gain lots of knowledge working there.  You can work part time or full time. Boses will work with you.
good,Greeting customers and meeting them to fulfill there projects.  Learn how to deal with difficult situations and solve.
good,"I really loved home depot it was actually my very first job, it gave me the opportunity to communicate and talk to different people but most of all being an employee at home depot allowed me to learn new things."
good,"At The Home Depot a typical work day consists of sales, store prep and clean up. They are dedicated to 100% customer service as they know they are not going to be around without the customers.  I would clock into work and get out on the sales floor immediately. It is a very typical retail based company. You come in work 2 hours and get a 15 minute break (if you need it or not). This was the hardest part of my job because i would feel like we are leaving a project and slowing down the process with every timed break that we may not even want.  Lunches are very structured so if you are are to be to lunch at noon, you have to be to lunch by noon or you would be written up.  Management is very good on keep on a schedule. I do understand how important a schedule is in this instance, because there are those there just to collect their paychecks. Overall I did love the job and the customer aspect of it. Watching someone leave very happy with their new deck or dream power tool was very rewarding as you loaded the product into their car."
good,home depot is a good work palace with a very diverse staffing and good business environment i learned how to operate and table saw and power saw and also learned how to work a forklift.
good,"Very flexible hours. Good pay and excellent benefits. Customers can be very difficult, the coworkers work well together."
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. They have high energy and encourage you to grow in the business. There is always room at the top in The Home Depot.
good,"Home Depot has opened doors for further advancement of my career and I am grateful for that. The people at store #3481 are some of the most level-headed and kind people I have met and management there is superb. A typical day included living up to the company's expectation for superior customer service and making connections with various professional and DIY clients."
good,"Typical day would be helping customers find products, help loading, and stocking.  I learned many customer service skills and ways of managing time at work around customers needs. Most managers were really friendly and easy to talk with. Co-workers were excellent and friendly. Hardest part would be working on understaffed days and the best part would be dealing with the nice customers who were very thankful and nice."
good,I am a cashier. My typical day at work involves ringing up customers. I am very friendly and efficient . Each day I learn something at Home Depot from my conversation with the customer. My co-workers are nice and my manager is also. The job is not really difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers . Sometimes the customers bring in their dogs. I really like  seeing all the different dogs.
good,"During my tenure with The Home Depot, the culture had changed over time from a blue jeans kind of mentality to Corporate America and all about business. Hard work and dedication no longer warranted advancement through the management hierarchy therefore, I had reached my maximum potential and decided to pursue a higher education."
good,Being an assistant manager means working an inconsistent schedule including a 10 hour day. The training I received was excellent regarding all aspects of the retail industry. Being a part of the management team was always challenging as far as dealing with the staff and unhappy customers. My co-workers in management were excellent. We were a team that could always be relied on. The hardest part of the job was not having two days off in a row and very few weekends off. The best part was the job security I felt i had there.
good,The Merchandising team really needs a training curriculum.  The idea of training is just follow coworkers and hope for the best.  The pay is also extremely low.  They do try to work with your schedule if you are part time.
good,I enjoyed my time at Home Depot.  We had some good department heads and some great co-workers.  I learned a lot about tools throughout Home Depot.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and finding the right product for them.
good,"Great place to work hard and be rewarded.  Good policies, safe place to work, friendly people.  Many opportunities to work nationwide, advance, and laterally transfer.  Being part of a team is what keeps this company thriving."
good,Great people to work with on a day to day basis each department helps everyone.
good,"*Constantly moving when it is busy it can be tough at times with certain  employees and if by yourself."
good,"I would get 2-3 leads every day to help people realize their home improvement projects come to completion. I would go from meeting them for the first time to writing a contract for their home project such as roofing, gutters, windows, doors, siding, sun-rooms, insulation, decks, porches, etc. The most enjoyable part was closing the sale and earning their trust to work on their home."
good,"as a delivery supervisor my days were very hectic and demanding. this helped me grow and learn a lot about myself. I learned so much from them. I learned all the tow motor vehicles and also most of the tools and equipment to better serve customers."
good,Lots of work involved with stocking and facing shelves. Customer Service is a must. Management is decent but care more about the budget than employees sometimes. Co workers friendly.
good,"The Home Depot was a decent place to work. Everyone there was friendly and there was hardly ever any strife. A typical day there was me standing at a register and ringing up items for customers. It was not a difficult job at all. The hardest part was just how boring it could be. The most enjoyable part was the people, I love working with people, and I met some excellent people at that job."
good,"Home Depot is a well organized corporation that runs their stores pleasantly. The amount of work is fair and they supply their employees with the resources they need to get through their day smoothly. Back braces, steel toe boots, gloves, etc. can all be compensated after purchase and uniforms are practically given away (I still have 6 shirts and 3 aprons). Management is overall very fair. If you work hard you will be recognized and awarded with a ""Homer Award"". The hardest part of the job would be knowing your stuff. You will be taught what you need to know for your department but it's up to you to remember everything and apply the knowledge to customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the atmosphere created by the staff. It's almost like a 2nd family for those who aren't in it for the money."
good,Mostly load purchasers from contractors. When have time load purchases from other customers. Help out other associates when needed. Clear the parking lot of carts. Work  weakdays only from 7 am - 4 pm.
good,Making sure that the daily operations of the warehouse and service department ran efficiently.
good,"A typical day at work involves a primary focus on customer service, while training and developing associates throughout relevant situations to provide a hands on learning environment. I constantly maintain product stock counts to ensure our company's automatic replenish ordering systems works properly. "
good,"Home depot has a good work environment. It is relaxed and fast paced, so It is very enjoyable. Good management."
good,"The home depot is a well operated walk in warehouse, people can be and are most of the time and helpful, as an employee there for almost a year I enjoyed working with everyone and its a good place for a first real job."

good,The job was not hard I got to meet a lot of new people around the tyler area. I also learned different thing about the work place.
good,scanning an verify correct products an amounts an printing off stickers an placing them an shipping them off to correct stores.I enjoyed the people I worked with .
good,fun 3rd shift job. co-workers were fun to work with managers were laid back but on point
good,"Learned so much and it was my very first job."
good,"Work as a third party representative at The Homedepot for their vendors taking on tasks for building and ensuring displays properly set to planogram and their product information.  Work with two teams of ten, executing a four cycle store every week.  The job is an early one but we are finished early in the day. We work hard physically and mentally and are normally recognized for it.  We have extended breaks for our demand and have every bay we service or project completed on very strict time sensitivity. My team of 20 works in a store with over 200 and do our best to maintain the best Met to store relationship to help ensure both of our needs are met.  We have mandatory group stretches and meetings a couple times per week.  My job is unique and work in very close proximity to the rest of my team members but it can help us complete our work faster and ensure we are completing our projects in a very safe yet efficient manner."
good,"Started out as a customer service garden associate answering customer questions about plants and products. "
good,"Working at home depot has been a good experience, but I would not want to make a career out of it. The company does not pay associates well, or offer may employees with full time hours."
good,"Project Coordinator entailed contacting new customers to set expectations for material delivery and installation scheduling. Ordering materials, confirming their arrival and scheduling delivery. Also scheduled with customer and installer the date(s) of projects, handled payments, collections and warranty issues."
good,Assist the supervisor with loading and unloading of trucks helping out coworkers with packing out freight to different departments.
good,When i worked there the people i worked with were great. Though when i was tasked with my jobs for the day there was not much to do. I had enough of a case load for about only four hours.
good,Daily interactions with store associates that helped me build great relationships and solid network.
good,good job with good benefits. I got along with other employees like a family environment
good,The Home Depot has given me many valuable skills that will be beneficial to me in any future careers. I have made lasting relationships with my coworkers and I find each day to be different and rewarding as well as challenging.
good,I spent almost 19 years with The Home Depot. At the end of it all it I went a lot of places and did a lot of things but I hit the end of my road with the company. Overall I am grateful for the career I had with THD.
good,Overall its a good job with everyday being a little different. If you really want to learn something and take the initiative there will usually always be someone willing to teach you. Working on the concrete floors can be a bit difficult if you have back issues. Getting bonuses for meeting and exceeding sales plan twice a year is nice though.
good,This job can stressful but also rewarding. I love learning about the various departments; in which enhanced my sales skills.
good,"A typical day with this employer consisted of placing orders, "
good,I like making customers happy when they enter and leave. hardest part is when co workers are not reliable.
good,I Liked my job at The Home Depot. Working at home depot had been a great opportunity and I really appreciated the opportunity.
good,"I worked with company in 1989 to1994, at that time the management was good and most co-workers were helpful however some were very rude, my typical day was ringing up customers items also doing the returns and as I grew with the company I became the assistant head cashier. The enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers. As time went on though I noticed how the company was changing from the loyalty to the full time employees like myself to having mostly part time employees to avoid providing employee benefits programs."
good,over all great company to work for but management just dont support there staff
good,"I wouldn't go back, The management was horrible when i left, They had switched it up. I was a wonderful place to work until then. This is not why i left, they had cut my hours!!1"
good,"Working at Tim Horton's gave me a lot of experience working with all sorts of people. I had to deal with different types of customers and co-workers. I became very good at multitasking because it was very rare that I was only doing one task, I always had to pay attention to my surroundings."
good,Always busy 10  hours shifts location is great near freeway only issue is transfers from warehouse to another warehouse.
good,"hard workers get promoted"
good,"Fast! is a way to describe a day at home depot."
good,If you are looking for a place to bust your butt then this is the place to be at.
good,Long hours.  Some times you will have to close the building then turn around and open building next morning.  Good team of managers.
good,"I met some very nice people here, very work oriented environment.  Expectations are known so there are no surprises."
good,"Great company to work for and will work with you if you want to advance in your career. I've learned how to talk to customers and find what they need, how operations work and how vendors relate to The Home Depot."
good,"It was a fun place, helped a lot of people. I was able to learn new stuff both in English and Spanish. The supervisor worked with all of our schedules, it was a fun seasonal job that i enjoyed very much."
good,Good place to work with good people where you can have long relationships.
good,"I like a up tempo workplace that keeps me busy and constantly working, Home Depot provided that."
good,"As is with most large retails, management sets the tone for the store and it's ""culture"". Yes, work hard and be compensated, but do not make the mistake of taking your authority to heart."
good,"Not bad place to work if you can deal with the cold. Overall, its a good job and the employees were great bunch of guys to work with."
good,"Working at The Home Depot has provided me with very useable and useful skills that i can apply to any and all work place environments. The management is fair and understanding and the other associates are all friendly and very helpful. The hardest part about my job would have to be helping the customers find exactly what they are looking for, considering half the time they are not sure themselves. However, helping customers find the product they are looking for and knowing that you helped that person accomplish a goal is the better part of this job."
good,"Home Depot is a wonderful place to work and i personally liked working is as i am a civil contractor and there are products which are used in building or a house."
good,"This store is always really busy, which is great! It keeps you going through out the day. They really focus on team building and leadership skills in the store."
good,"I loved the associates that I worked with and I loved the ability to take classes and improve my own skills. As a Head Cashier, I made a good hourly wage but it was difficult to ever get a raise. Because I worked there for so many years, I saw changes in management and in the company itself. I am a firm believer in praise! Praise for doing the right thing, for providing good customer service and for being a good employee. Sometimes these these things were present and many times, they were not. One of the Core Values is, ""Take care of the associates and they will take care of the store."" Sometimes, I saw this happening and sometimes, I did not. I felt there was never enough praise for a ""job well done"". I stated that many times to management, but I did not feel it helped. I bought stock because we could buy it at a reduced rate and some of what we put into a 401K account was matched by the company. As a single mom I had never had any savings...finally, with this second job at Home Depot, I had some savings...I will always be truly thankful for that!"
good,"I had a great time working for the Home Depot. It was an exciting job. I learned many new skills; logistics, forklift operator, shipping and receiving, ect. promotions was rare, but because of the relationships with my formed associates it made it worthwhile. However, i got hurt on the job, they keep me on as long as they could but my condition lasted longer than their patience. I do not regret working for them for I learned so much about logistics."
good,A typical day involves giving customers home improvement advice and ringing up customers. Ive learned excellent communication skills and how to work in a team. The management is reasonable and run things in an intelligent manner. My co-workers are the friendliest group of people Ive been around. The hardest part of the job is when customers seek very specific home improvement advice that is beyond the scope of my expertise.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to give customers the advice they need to make home improvements.
good,The job sucks. The people make it worth it. Compensation is not equal to work.
good,Compensation isn't that great but they do provide overtime. Culture is great as well. Management need some improvement but willing to work with you. Co-workers are the heart of the company. The most enjoyable part of my job here is the exercise it provides while at work.
good,"As a Sgt. I directed a team for serving criminal warrants, mostly felony warrants. It was a dangerous job but a rewarding job to know that you got some of these people off the streets."
good,"Home depot is an okay place to work. The reason why i say this is not because there is no health insurance for part time workers anymore but more of the overall attitude of workers there. Don't get me wrong there are really nice workers there and are quite enjoyable to work with but others, Ive felt like it was hard to approach them for a question if i had it or a problem."
good,"The only reason why I left was because I had to work every weekend. If that wasn't the case, I would still be there."
good,"Maintaining a clean work area and providing premiere customer service."
good,"I just liked my orange apron"
good,"I kind of like working there. Just was a lot of mess type people being in others business. What I like the most was taking the planogram and going on the floor getting the job done. We built different things for displays. The Manager was a nice guy like he cared about his work group. Well I learn how to use all different types of tools, build everything and also paint."
good,"Good place to work, just too far from home. Management will help do any job and work any department to help associates when needed."
good,a typical day at work was to unload trucks and place product in proper storage space. I learned how to prioritize and work well with my co- workers. There was nothing really hard about this job I would have liked more hours to learn more.
good,a typical day is a little slower than what i like to work. management is good.
good,"Fast pace environment, friendly staff and interesting customers. You learn something new everyday."
good,"communicating with customers via chat and also on the phones, learned the different products involved in outdoor home goods, management worked well with the employees, my co-workers were a good team to work with, the hardest part of the job was not getting more in depth training on some products, the most enjoyable was learning about the different products"
good,"My typical day can vary depending on the day. Early in the mornings, I am often in contact with contractors and assist them in finding the materials they need for whatever job they are working on at the time.  I also work with private individuals who are doing home projects themselves."
good,"Started off working as a cashier, finally after a whole year was promoted to the sales floor to the kitchen&bath department. "
good,"Excellent management."
good,good place to work but health benifits package sucks and pay is not so great.
good,"Home Depot is a good Co. to work for if you are retired, part time, Or are just starting in the work force."
good,"Job was enjoyable. Manager approaches towards required work needs drastic improvements. As a whole I enjoyed working for the company, local managers played favorites to often though. Local store also did not have ENOUGH full time positions available. If they did I probably would have stayed with this company longer than I did."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consists of heavy Customer Interaction, Performing Cash, credit and check transactions .Management was helpful to a certain extent. Hardest part is long hours where that if we were short we didn't get breaks and lunch until late. I love interacting with people and making sure their cashiering experience was an enjoyable one."
good,Ces une entreprise en pleine évolution qui donne un service client firts. Avec des opportunités d'avancement.
good,"It's a good company to work for, but has several management and organizational issues at my particular location."
good,Must be open and friendly to make the leads required for the week which is like 20 leads a week within 3 days of work. I learned a lot about the home depot install programs and a lot of co workers were willing to help me learn about all the programs and all the departments that the programs coexist with. The hardest part of this job is getting the leads a lot of people do not want to have someone come out to their house they would prefer to do the install themselves.
good,"Home Depot is not the greatest job in the world. The supervisor are every mean and rude. But they do have great benefits, paid vacations and bonuses."
good,Strong company provided all the tools three calls at homes and paperwork preparation. Hardest part of job was sundays and late nites.
good,"We were a team oriented workplace. If you needed help with anything  another person in your dept. or even mgmt. was always willing to help. Cust. service was srtessed everyday. I learned 7 depts. electrical,paint,garden,hardware,lumber,bldg. materials,& millwork. I received many awards for cust service. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers figure out a solution to their particular problem or project. The hardest part of the job was trying to cover several depts. when we were shorthanded. But like a stated previously someone was usually avaiable to help out."
good,"I help customers find products they are looking for. Talk to them about their projects and what they might be needing to begin or finish the project.  Recommend products for different problems. "
good,GREAT PEOPLE GREAT WORKPLACE AND FUN… Always worked the games that were going on at staples center. Met a lot of good people in and out of my experience there...
good,"Provided quality customer service. Successfully handled cutting keys, sales of keys, locks, and related merchandise. Was instrumental in inventory control and product sales, rejecting items when necessary. Wrote, designed and produced inventory reports, sales invoices, and ordered merchandise."
good,Great place to work. lots of thinks are learned while working everyday.
good,This job is very busy. It trains anassociate how to care for customers and make an intentional decision on how to care for one another.
good,I am currently a MET(Merchandising Execution Team) Associate. The shift begins 5 AM and ends at 1:45 PM with a 45-min lunch at 11 AM (lunchtime length varies between stores). We mostly front-face merchandise and change price tags with the occasional opportunity to build displays and reset merchandise. Co-workers get along relatively well and management is understandable when things happen in the personal lives of associates. Work can be very redundant when only front-facing all day.
good,el ambiente de trabajo en la empresa en la que labore era muy bueno los compañeros se ayudaban y se tenia el apoyo de jefes y gerentes cuando uno lo necesitaba
good,"Merchandising product, Resetting store, pricing and providing great customer service"
good,"I had multiple tasks working here, lifting 75+lbs merchandise, keeping up to date with all the new products and techniques to help provide accurate information to efficiently complete home improvement projects. Restock shelves, maintain a clutter free parking lot along with store aisles."
good,"manager of growing company"
good,Loved the customers and enjoyed driving the forklifts. The co-workers were great and everyday were different people to help. I would definitely go back to Home Depot in the future.
good,The Home Depot has been  a fairly decent place to work. I have no complaints about the time I have spent there so far. I am still employed with this company.
good,"when helping a customer with the needs of there home project, to see them smile after i have helped them and i get a thank you is the best part of my job. helping them to accomplish they goals."
good,"I was a cashier and the best part about my position was being able to help customers from every department. I also enjoyed being able to see the many different types of product that our store carried. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and hearing about there home projects that our store was helping them complete. The management team was very friendly and helpful and always made you feel like a valued employee, as well as the other co-workers. I learned something new everyday from each and every department expanding my knowledge in home improvement."
good,"its a good work place to learn for around home projects but the thing I didn't like that some managements had preferred people .. like their ""go to"" and that would always be a problem if trying to solve a problem... sometimes helpful"
good,It was a fun place to work in the summer. The and co workers will always have pros and cons but for a college/university student i believe that the lot position is perfect for the summer.
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for.  Balancing work life and home life can be a real challenge.
good,"The job required working in various departments other than primary. Enjoyed the opportunity to interact with and help customers solve problems, particularly in the plumbing areas'. Most co-workers were of a similar age to me and had a varied background. Spent much of downtime stocking shelves and racks. Found it very difficult to implement improvements, based on a lifetime of experience. This was the most frustrating part, as a function of past responsibilities."
good,It's a lot of physical labor that eventually will take a toll on your body. The pay is decent for the area. I don't think there is a lot of job advancement opportunities. They tend to bring a lot of management from other locations instead of promoting from within. There is really no real concern from employee well-being. Focus is more on numbers and production...
good,Great company with excellent internal career advancements and positive culture.
good,"A typical day would involve taking inventory of products and customer service. I was in the paint department so most of my knowledge involves paint products and proper procedure when painting. My co-workers varied from fellow university students to retired career workers. The hardest part of the job was customer service during the busy months of summer, i.e. trying to help everyone in an orderly fashion."
good,"Fast pace family oriented environment, that puts customer service first with respect."
good,A new store open within 20 miles and people were in transition of transferring to new store which made morale low. Management was changing as well which made it even more difficult. It was more than enough to learn and working directly with customers was great!!
good,"It can be a fun place to work. I have learned a lot from customer service to restocking shelves,driving forklifts,etc.My co-workers are fun and helpful .The hardest part of my job i would say is trying too get use too the graveyard shift.The most enjoyable part of my job is the people i work with."
good,"Being that the time of the shift is from 8pm-1am, there is a lot of tolerance for being laid back with chatting with your co workers, but also a knowledge of having work ethic so that you can still maintain good performance. There's room for every kind of person, and people are easy to get along with. The work can be repetitive but it is good to try and have a better perspective on what you are doing so that you do not become bored easily - which people have fallen into. The supervisor can be serious with the work at hand, but knows how to joke around and have a good time. As far as during work, the management can be a good influence on the associates so that we can stay energized."
good,Working at Home Depot is an exercise in the customer service gauntlet. Sometimes customer service begins in the parking lot with regulars stopping to chat with you or asking questions. You will interact with all types of personalities and with all different request for help. Over all customers really made the day go by faster and nine times out of ten made it an enjoyable day.
good,"At Home Depot as a cashier, i use to serve more than 100 customers a day. Every customer was different from the other buying a different product. The best thing about this job was i get to interact with many different people coming from different race & culture, professions etc. Some customers were very satisfied with the service/products, others were not. As i said every customer was different from the other, i learned how to manage people and their queries. Gathering information about different products and learning new procedures was also a great/enjoyable experience for me. Co-workers were friendly and helped me performing my job duties efficiently."
good,"Home Depot is one of the largest retailers in the home improvement industry.  Providing everything a homeowner and contractor alike will need in home renovations and more.  They also provide excellent opportunities for part time employees to balance their work and home life through flexible scheduling.  With on-going training within each department, a Home Depot sales associate is provided with the most update and thorough product and application training anyone can find within a company."
good,It was great to work with Home Depot as it was an international process.
good,"The Home Depot is overall a very good place to work.  I've worked the day shift with customers as well as nighttime stocking shifts.  As a retail store, it is a solid company to work for.  My concern is that there is such an emphasis on profits (which, don't get me wrong, are very important), even to the exclusion of what I consider fair pay for the work expected.  The Home Depot has some very high standards for work safety and customer service, and I feel the pay should reflect that as well."
good,Everyone was very kind and was willing to help whenever I needed it.
good,enjoyed working with peers and customers. Helped customers with equipment problems
good,Worked here for a little bit. No complaints. Good people and easy work.
good,i worked multiple departments and learned a lot from the company.
good,"A typical day at work is being prepared mentally, physically for the upcoming day knowing which associate is going to be there to help with projects and or tasks. Paperwork needing to be done or to do that day and or on the hand held device to do daily orders. "
good,"A typical day would be managing  all operations and driving sales and customer service in order to drive numbers and be profitable by controlling operating expenses. I am a great leader, motivator and trainer which is the key to great team building!! The most enjoyable part of my day is delivering great customer service, building a successful team!"
good,"I enjoyed the work atmosphere at Home Depot and the people I worked with.  They were very customer oriented.  Management was very supportive.  I was award ""Rookie of the Month"" and ""Rookie of the Quarter"" for my first three months at Home Depot."
good,working in a big company is so competitive and there is no security in your job
good,"I am a merchandiser for the Home Depot. I serve as a representative of the vendors, to the company, customers, and fellow associates. I work daily with technology to implement product changes, to update and manage inventory and pricing standards. The biggest role I play is to communicate with management and fellow associates as well as resolving any issues that can arise. The job is team-focused and I like that."
good,Home Depot is a great company with great knowledgeable employees.
good,a lot of drama and favoritism. great benefits. hard to move up in company. basically need to be somebody on the management teams   best friend or butt kisser and be back stabbing to move up in the company. alot of sneakiness and back stabbers. unfair discipline procedures.
good,"A typical day consist of filling empty products, friendly customer service and great team work. I enjoy helping the customers to the point that they are so thankful and I educate them a lot for their specific projects, knowing I have really helped them is rewarding. The hardest part for me is getting the hours I need, I currently attend college and that mean I need part time hours but more than 9-15m at least 20+ would be nice and is actually needed in my case topay bills."
good,"A great place to start off, would like to see more growth within the company but can not complain about the environment and hospitality."
good,You learn a lot working for home depot. The work environment itself is great. You have a lot of space to breathe and work on your own. No need for babysitters like other jobs. Management isn't amazing but better than other places.
good,Stock and organize shelves and displays. Assist customers with purchases including problem solving with the various obstacles faced in home repair. Encourage and support other staff members in various other areas like plumbing and building materials.
good,"Basically I was a cashier dealing with clients making card payments, or daily shopping then I was moved to returns learned that very quickly and was also a returns cashier, had a lot of safety meetings and company did appreciate our hard work the only down fall you could not get your 40 hrs."
good,Good Company to work for. Been there for years and have gained a ton of knowledge.
good,"Full-time Cashier / Returns Cashier / Cashier in lumber as well when needed. Directly working with customers gives me a great accomplishment feeling.  To satisfy the Customer is the whole reason I was a Cashier. The only downfall of the job is I had to be available anytime. Days and swing shifts, any days of week and be able to work in any area needed. No set place.  Was hard because I couldn't get familiar enough with the department before I would have to go to another.  Management was great and co-workers too. "
good,It has excellent opportunities for changing positions and learning different departments of the store. Management is good but likes to play favorites . Hardest part of the job is sometimes being scheduled with those that have a poor ethic. Most enjoyable is having customers to ask for you by name.
good,"Typical day is full and busy, usually understaffed considering the amount of people shopping at the store. Always keep your smile, co-workers are great. It's my home away from home... almost."
good,"Learned alot about flooring. "
good,a typical day at work was all about customer service .it was the number one thing to do . I learned to always take care of your employees and they will take care of you. management needs to learn to develop and promote faster. the hardest part of the job was doing as much as the managers and not receiving the pay or promotion .the best part of the job was the people i worked with .
good,I loved working at The Home Depot. I enjoyed helping customers and finding solutions to their needs and answering their questions. I learned a lot from this company and their training programs. Management was amazing and they always had an open door policy. You get a real sense of family when it comes to the employees and that makes you look forward to going into work everyday.
good,"Home Depot is a very good place to work. The work relationship between associates and managers is very good and very amicable. Working for the first time in retail sales, I've learned a great deal about product presentation and visual marketing. The hardest part of the job is the long hours on my feet and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and hearing about their projects."
good,Home depot is a great place to work if you don't have kids and you open to work anything.
good,"A typical day at work was good"
good,"When I first worked at Home Depot I really liked the environment it brought. The associates were friendly, and the benefits are good in Home Depot. However, now in 2014 part timers no longer have medical benefits, but still have 401k, dental, travel and shopping discount, vision, retirement plan, stock plans available, and job security placement incase you need to leave, and there is even a program for needy people who need money to afford rent. Co-workers act like they live there, because theres associates who have stayed in the company for 10-15 years. The managers are strict, and they don't treat employees very well, sometimes can overwork you if they know your good, or don't let you move up to other positions available because they don't like you enough. Good thing about being a cashier is that we have the most appreciation in the store, there is always food, celebration, flexibility. My most enjoyable part of my day is being in the garden, I love being outside and be around nature."
good,I had a customer that was upset and didn't know how to get her family history book fix.  So I walk with her and ask some questions about the book and what need to be done.  She told me she went to another story and bought more pages to put in the book. She also  told me she ask them to help her. The reason she need help was she had arthritis. So I stop and put the book together. I use some of our tools to make it wider for her. She was so happy. She offer to pay me I told her to just pray for me.
good,Dept. Heads worked well together and never hesitated to help each other.  Respect for our work was well earned and deserved.
good,perfect spot to learn about to construction life. many knowledgeable associates and staff members
good,Everyday is different and fast paced.  I like coming into work and on one level knowing what needs to be done but also solving problems and helping others with theirs.  Co-workers are always willing to help and enjoy coming to work.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, co-workers are very friendly. The entire Home Depot staff are extremely productive in working towards uplifting the objectives of the company and helping to satisfy our customers."
good,Everyone in the company is like a big family and supports each other. My job is 100% commission so you have to make a lot of sales.
good,There was something always to do to make the work day go by faster.
good,"Productive and fun place with Gym. "
good,"I like this job, the people I work with & the type of work I do. I do merchendising,pricing,stocking, cleaning, store displays & coustomer service"
good,"When i went to work my days will be the same i will have good day every day. "
good,you can gain so much more knowledge from you're fellow associates.
good,Great place to work at and usually busy. There are many things to learn at the home depot because of the many products they provide. Management is great with support and experience and always assists associates. Co-workers are great also. The hardest part of the job is not having a customer to assist because that's the most enjoyable.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, I learned a lot while there. I made some good friends, both customers and coworkers. The one thing that was emphasized time and again was customer service."
good,"A typical day in my workplace is very fast paced, but fun with great associates. I learn something new every day. Management is great and they are always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is advancing and moving, but the workplace itself is very enjoyable"
good,"a typical day at home depot was keeping the lot clean at all times of carts/trash. What i learned was help when you can with customers loading, but always do your job description. management are all good people. very helpful people. All of my co-workers are very helpful in helping me find what the customers are looking for. The hardest part of the job is understanding the layout of home depot and everything heavy. The most enjoyable part is all the faces that say i'm happy and satisfied with my perchise."
good,"I worked for homedepot for approximately 6 months. While working there i have learned a lot of things bout products, people, and especially the work force-- considering this was my first job. At Homedepot they taught me that the customer is always right even when we, the employees, didn't want them to be. I met some amazing helpful co-worker while being there and am still in contact with more than half of them. My job as a cashier was to be able to be available for all of our customers, handle money, returns, markdowns. Returns was my favorite part of the job because it was always steady work and just something to do. The only bad thing that i have to say about the homedepot store, specifically #0679 is that its management is not as strong as its employees. There were only a selected few of that i could trust as managers to: 1. Assist with a troubling customer 2. Answer customer calls when appropriate 3. Sustain employer-employee confidentiality. My only advice for them is to be as strong as their employees because they are the most fascinating team of employees that really do put customer's first and I will always take that with me wherever I go."
good,"A typical work day starts off with checking on all hazmat safety, also checking on forklift safety standards, check on the freight that's coming in for the work day, create daily task lists for each associate, the most enjoyable part of the job is that the day is a constant flow and the only rest time is lunch time. Before you know it your day will be over. I was also part of the Infocus team captain which was a safety captain. This is a group that walks the store and ensures that everyone is working safely when it comes to lifting, as well as using all equipment, the team also responds to hazmat spills."
good,"I've learned that a key factor is building relationships."
good,"I provided customer service to Home Depot customers, multiple stores, vendors and installers.Address issues concerning status of special orders. Follow up with information on the status of products and reconciled errors, acted as liaison between customers, vendors and installers."
good,"My overall review of this job is positive, however I do not like working outside (garden center) in extreme hot and cold weather. The pay is comparable to most retail businesses, but I would rather make more if at all possible.  I am a hard worker, easy to get along with and dependable."
good,J'ai apprecier travailler pour Home d/pot. Tout est un travaille d'/quipe les employ/s s'aident les un et les autres et la compagnie nous fournit des outils et des formations que les conseillers ont besion a leur disposition.
good,i preformed special orders for customers put stock away cleaned up at the end of day.
good,"a typical work day at home depot goes by very fast right after our start up meeting we get straight to work even tho we're one team with one go we all push ourselves each day to see who can load the most and help hit plan. Ive learned alot and i;m still learning here more about leadership and building friendships with co workers the management changes alot ive seen so many supervisors and stuff come and go but overall they treat us all the same, the hardest part of the job is getting there I commute 85 miles round-trip 5 days a week and the most enjoyable part of the job is just the environment."
good,It is a pretty laid back job and most of the managers are cool. Only thing I honestly dislike about it is that they don't give you many work hours.
good,In the short time that I have been there I have seen received a lot of training for the job and my managers are great.
good,"Home Depot excels at building strong bonds between its employees. Management can be a little over barring, but that's the nature of fast-pace retail. Lots to learn and no two days are the same. Great job for starting a career or income while in school."
good,"The Home Depot was one of my favorite jobs and I formed friendships with my co-workers there that I still cherish. I give this company a lot of credit for not only my professional knowledge and growth, but also my personal development. Under the original store management I was encouraged to explore and learn as much as possible. A normal day as a cashier was simply to provide extraordinary customer service, keep your register clean and mention credit or sales promotions while processing sales or return transactions. When I became a Head Cashier, which was their version of a shift manager, I cross trained in six different departments, as well as being trained to train all new associates for the store. The best parts of the job were definitely the closeness of the employees and the friendly attitude of the customer base. I think the hardest part of the job for me was helping to train new supervisors while being ""groomed"" for the position myself and never seeing it come to fruition."
good,"Millworks Sales Specialist"
good,This job was great for me when it came to learning and for advancement. Would make for a good part time job after I retire in the future.
good,a typical day is a lot of running around and supervising got promoted almost 2 years ago been with the company alomst 4 years now
good,needs to pay more attention to associates that actually work hard and compensate them
good,the people there were kind an i realliy enjoyed working there. the work was hard but satisfying.
good,"All the employee's are friendly to each other making a great environment, employee's are always updated on what's going on in the store and when we prevent shrink there are special events for the store employees."
good,ok Home depot is a good company to work for but there a big disconnect between the Home Depot HQ in ATL and the stores that are all over the US and the international markets. Some of the stores where good to work and other not so much. Some of the employees where put in positions of MTG that shouldn't been inn.  when there was more qualified like the young adults and some of the other adults in the store that maybe had a digree in bussiness MGT. could have been promoted with then. there was also some Work place bullying and favoritism. you had to yes person to get anything done. me I was not i lead my own path and did the write things and well that a another story.
good,"I was given the opportunity to learn kitchen and bath design through job specific training and education. Along with my background in graphic design, I was able to excel in the position. The position was the most rewarding one of my career. I was able to excel in sales and provide top notch customer service to my clients, earning repeat business from a number of them."
good,"Co-workers alright but too much gossip and deceit. My duties was very manageable, like it."
good,Help associates and management in daily activities.  Training new associates and managers in different programs.  Write schedules up to 120 associates and managers.  Hardest part of the job is taking time for oneself.  It is very demanding every moment of everyday.  It is enjoyable to be able to help so many people each and everyday.
good,"I enjoyed working with people and having the position of head cashier . I learned a lot of different things while working there that will be useful in different areas of work,"
good,"its a secure job, not difficult just doesn't pay very well."
good,"pros: The working environment is great. Everyone is friendly. pay rate is not that bad either"
good,"Diariamente hay nuevos retos, y siempre se busca la mejora continua, se ve el trabajo como es y hay ambiente de respeto entre los compañeros."
good,I was lucky to have the position that i had because it was one of the most independent positions in the company.
good,"Lots of customer contact/ able to assist in helping resolve problems Learn about new products, safety issues, and customer service."
good,Great company if one is between jobs / careers.  The pay is not good but the culture is fun and management makes it rewarding. The benefits are very good but the salary makes it tough to pay for the health care or 401(k) contribution.
good,"A typical day in retail would consist of great customer service. I would make sure that the schedule was correct and that we had enough employees for that day. I was the Front -End manager, the hardest part of my job was makin sure that everyone had all the observations and reports done in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was all the customer engagement. I had great co-workers that helped on the floor."
good,"Exciting and challenging when it came down to the investigation part of it. Trying to understand patterns of shoplifters who would be considered career criminals, who have a history of getting away and have caused significant loss proves to be a mental stimulant. Having the opportunity to strategize and execute contingency plains with those who have back grounds within law enforcement is a plus."
good,"In charge of projects."
good,"A typical day at work starts as 5am. I go in and stage the registers tills, putting all the money in the register for todays work. Once done I have to check the days schedule to see what the cashiers coverage is and plan out everyone lunches and breaks. When I'm done with that I have to handle paper work that consist of voids, and markdown approvals. Throughout the day I make sure everyone has their breaks and lunches, send up money to book keeping if their is too much money in the register, give the cashiers money if the register is running low. I also handle any problems that customers may have from solving issues, looking up a lost receipts, markdowns approvals or coupons just to name a few. The hardest part of the job is learning everyone's personalities and learning how to handle them, however the most enjoyable part of the job is also learning everyone personality and working as a team."
good,"Recommended, selected and help locate merchandise based on customer needs. Head of in-home gardening, ordering displaying in-home products."
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for.  There is always opportunity for advancement if you work hard.  The employees are very friendly and most are concerned with high standards of customer service.
good,"My day typically begins by doing the opening checklist for my department and restocking the shelves from the overhead. In Kitchen and baths the means pulling down full toilets, vanities and appliances from racks that can reach up to 25 feet off the ground. Due to the limitations of the equipment, I usually have to resort to moving toilets, which weigh around 70 pounds on average, and appliances which can weigh up to several hundred pounds, by myself. I also operate every machine the Home Depot uses, from the forklifts to the paint mixers to the saws. "
good,At The Home Depot all managers are focussed on putting Customers at the top of their priority list.  The culture strives to put the customer ahead of all other concerns.  A focus on maximizing In-Stock position helps to create a positive shopping experience for the customer and in the last few years a greater focus has been put on increasing the quantity and variety of merchandise on the sales floor.
good,"Log in cash register . Stand in race track greet customers . Cash out customers.  Stock products."
good,"A typical work day is started 5am. I would empty the safe from the previous days intake. Send tills out for current business day. Print all reports for management and for filing. I would balance the vault and research any discrepancies. Make sure all the registers and computers are up and running, if not trouble shoot and place a service call on them. Process time and attendance. Order supplies. File paperwork, fax paperwork. Research over/short report. Reconcile chargebacks. I've learned how to read reports, how to cut wire, mix paint, cut keys, customer service. I had a good rapport with the management team. All of my co-workers loved me. I was the go to person whenever they need anything. The hardest part of my job was nothing. I enjoyed what I did."
good,"not a bad job to have, will work but not the worst place to work"
good,"I would work all different shifts,  mostly in Tool Rental where I'd wait on customers, loan out and take back tools and trucks and heavy equipment.  I had to ""turn"" the tools (making them ready for the next rental by cleaning or repairing)."
good,ok place to work jus need more money and hours good part time full of good oriented people
good,"Sales associates at the Home Depot are required to help customers with all of their home-improvement needs, whatever the project may be. The majority of the work day is spent making yourself readily available to help and actively seeking customers to inquire about their need of assistance. Throughout my career at the Home Depot, I have learned a great deal not only about the products, but about how to interact with customers on a down-to-earth basis. When you're helping people with their personal projects, you can really get to know who they are personally. The Management is very professional and deal with the employees on a personal level. The hardest part of the job is probably the walking. You are on your feet on concrete floors for many hours a day. It can be tiring, depending on how much walking you do in any given day. Creating satisfied and returned customers is by far the best part of the job."
good,provide customer service also learned inventory control co-workers were great and the hardest part was being part-time and the low pay most enjoyable was working with customers.
good,"Work hands on with customers."
good,A typical day at the home depot would be fast pace mostly during the day and weekends. What I have learned at the depot is that I need to be patient with my customers and not to rush but move quickly and carefully so that I could stay accurate on measurements and the money that I am handling. The hardest part of my job is heavy duty weight that we have to continuously lift throughout the day dealing with contractors. Most enjoyable thing is my Job period I love what I do and I love the team. Management is like every other place they do their job making sure that the customers is taking care of and the employees as well.
good,"Customer service relating to all plumbing needs."
good,"Effectively managed the Hardware/Tool and Garden departments, including maintaining department inventory.  Oversaw the ordering of IMA, and monitored vendor activities.  Communicated and interacted with other management daily regarding store functions to maximize profits.  Set POP in the department and supervised vendors in the department. Increase sales by over 33% in 4 months"
good,At Home Depot you really had to work for your money. There was so many customers it was kind of hard to tend to every customer. I was a lot associate. Which meant I brought carts in and helped customers load merchandise. Sometimes I dealt with rude customers and sometimes I dealt with really nice customers.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  I liked helping customer find what they needed.
good,"A typical day at work started off as slow, then customers all come in at one time. I've learned to always have respect for customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was customers being rude. The most enjoyable part was having family gathering where all of us come together as a family"
good,"A typical day at work includes signing out motor equipment, RF gun and radio, then scanning a product and taking it to the lane the RF gun tells you to take it to"
good,The Home Depot is a fun and exciting place to work with many incentives and appreciation activities.
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot for me would be, clocking in for work. Next, i would walk to my locker and retrieve me orange apron. I would walk to my work station locate the head Cashier so she could mark me down as present. Than, i would log on to the the cash register, turn my aisle light on, walk down the aisle, and, wait for the customers. During that time i would greet and welcome the passerbyers. What I've learned at this job is customer service skills, I've learned to speak to people, I've learned to operate a machine cash register. My co-workers were all very nice people. The hardest part of my job was to scan certain merchandise for example lumber, that was a tricky task because you were required to count all the lumber, locate the barcode, and sometimes you would even have to measure the height. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know that you have helped someone with whatever their purchase was, offering them the lowest price around and just my professionalism."
good,it was not a bad experience except for the fact that i was constantly hit on by fellow coworkers that knew i was married.
good,"The workplace is great and I love working with customers. I have learned how to operate machinery, 20/20 design systems, and how ordering and operations work. The only con I have is that some of the managers have favorites and recognize people for next to nothing where others go out of their way without acknowledgement."
good,"Home Depot is a wonderful company to work for. I don't believe they take care of their associates as well as they did in the past, based on the 10 year associates I worked with. Great associate training from the beginning, poor management training."
good,Management sometimes felt out of touch with what was happening in the store. Each store manager is different and some stores are run better than others. It is a great part time job but it is tough to make it to full-time. The daily work is fair and people are given appropriate responsibility for their positions.
good,"Great friendly place to work for, loved working with customers every single moment of everday"
good,"Always busy with a project, very nice employees, company has very good values. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Working at The Home Depot was my best work experience thus far, it is a company that you can grow in. They work with your schedule no matter how busy your life is. I would not mind working there in a permanent  position."
good,"Home Depot is certainly one of the greatest company in the world , there is no doubt, i mean the excitemnt of working is there. unfortunately big companies have big natural problems. My point and daily goals were to get as many sales for my departmentas a  flooring specialist. hard department to work in , very unsafe , very challenging. PK  is the key of success , lot to learn and of course customer relations is adequate. A good manager is very important, a supervisor even more mportant.  Now as a whole a company that elevate your knowledge in the maintenance of household.  A great company culture if managers are able to forefront their leadership talents. I passed my treshold everyweek at least over 18% imade sure of that and thanks for being bilingual and exposed to diversity."
good,"I enjoyed learning about the different products sold there and how to do several projects at home. The job itself gave me experience with managing reports, customer service, sales, etc."
good,"At the Home Depot, opportunities abound to expand beyond your current skillset / career path.  As a fast-paced retail environment, the ability to think at a broad-spectrum big-picture level is a definite springboard for advancement."
good,"As a Cashier my days were sometimes crazy busy. Early morning is when contractors typically come to Home Depot to get their supplies for the day---a LOT of supplies! They are also returning any supplies they did not use. Special sales and promotions bring a lot of DIYers in on the weekend to purchase materials for their projects. Cashiers are standing the whole shift, counting quantities of lumber, nuts & bolts, plumbing parts, etc and ringing them up as fast as they can while being friendly and helpful to the customer. And there is always that small obscure item without a price or a name that a customer wants to buy, so you have to find out what department it came from and what it is. I learned from a co-worker to keep a small notebook with such items catalogued so I didn't always have to bother the department workers to get a price. I would wander through the store looking for such items and jot them down in my notebook. It was very handy for helping the customer in a timely manner. Because of the number of cashiers our breaks were carefully orchestrated by our supervisors so that everybody got their breaks and lunches on time. We went on break when we were told to, and were expected back at our station precisely on time. There were a lot of ""managers"" there also. We had our front end manager, then there were the head cashiers who were considered managers since they managed the cashiers' breaks and stations. Then there was the store general manager, but there were several assistant managers. Then there were the department managers. A bit confusing! When I was hired I was told"
good,"I really enjoy working with the management and other associates as well. We all got along without overstepping the line between employee and manager. I also enjoy helping the customers get the service they needed, and the pay scale was very high for a retail company and the area I was in.The hours are not consistent, I would work the morning shift one day, and be coming in till the evening or closing on other days."
good,"Be ready for a fast pace and highly competitive workplace. Bring your ""A"" game and be sure to challenge the status quo. Plan on being challenged right back. But, don't give in. Stick to your guns and your principles. Success is rewarded very highly. Failure is not an option."
good,"my experience at The Home Depot was great. I learned so many things from the other cashiers, and the managers are great managers as well. I have learned how to do returns, and how to multi-task."
good,"Worked in electrical, garden, paint, and tools. I had to be trained in each one. I assisted the costumers when they came in, for either asking questions or wanting to buy something. I had to restock the shelves. My main objective was to help the customers and be a good sales person for the company."
good,Earned 9.50 per hour. I loved working here and was great at my job. but they laid me off because they didn't want to make me permanent and give me benefits.
good,"A day in the life of a sales consultant for The Home Depot is very challenging.  Very rare that any two days are alike.  From self generating leads to running appointments.  Being surrounded by other talented sales persons and managers has made my time at The Home Depot very enjoyable.  Every day starts and ends with the customer.  Very hard to designate any difficult areas of the position, although, some scheduling conflicts do occur.  But once those issues are handled professionally, the days are very positive by the interactions with the customers"
good,"Busy, low employee moral, sensitivity training needed.Internal customer service is low. Corp is committed to customer satisfaction and employee training."
good,Great learning opportunities.  Solid company with constant changes and improvements.
good,Sitting at your cubicle processing high volume inbound and outbound calls.
good,"Pull merchandise to sales floor, stock shelves, back stocked, handle returned merchandise, assist department manger’s on maintaining departments, communicate to associates of changes within my department and kept department clean. Good co-workers, gained job skills and the job was fairly just really physical."
good,"A Typical day would be fast and busy, my co-workers where easy to get along with. I learned how to move quickly in a fast paced environment . the hardest part of my job would be dealing with the heat and humidity of the day . the most enjoyable part of my job would be the pay check."
good,A typical day at work was usually go in and perform regular tasks until customers started to come in from there we help the customers with working with the customers and fellow employees I would get to learn a lot of nifty things. The hardest part of the job was when dealing with customers that you could not satisfy. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with friendly people or solving a customers problem.
good,"it's a good place to work at. I just wish they gave more hoursCompensation / Benefits"
good,"great work environment"

good,"Work At the Home Depot consist of helping customers all day making sure they found every item they needed in order to complete whatever project they are working on. I learn many things while working here as in: using the cash register, how to do inventory, how to make orders, as well and gain knowledge to the products we carried. Our management were a great team they decided what needed to be done. As a team we pull it together and out every task done.Our co-workers were all fun to be around. We also had weekly meetings to make sure everybody was on the same page. The hardest park of the job was being under staff  at busy hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing customers walk out happy."
good,good place to work.....did not have issues with management
good,"Not having worked for The Home Depot before, and having read and heard all the current horror stories about abysmal working conditions and manager/employee relations I was expecting more of the same terrible corporate culture. "
good,"The Home Depot is a fun place to work. The employees are more like a family. Everyone is kind and friendly. "
good,Home Depot Store Support Center is a great place to work. Coworkers and management are very supportive & educated. The environment of the office is fun & creative. A good balance of productivity and enjoyment. 
good,"In my experience, The Home Depot has been a very kind and welcoming job experience with a cohesive atmosphere. The supervisors work with you and ask you to do things they would not have any problem doing themselves. The benefits are manageable given all the potential injuries one could sustain in an environment filled with fork lifts, compactors, awkward, heavy items and the like. Fortunately, there is a huge emphasis placed on safety. The pay scale is the most disheartening thing about working for THD but other than that, you can expect a healthy and fun experience."
good,Had fun talking to all the customers and helping them out with anything they needed. Co workers were always a plus because they were all nice to talk to also. Management never was their if we needed them. 
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work, with opportunity to advance if given the chance. "
good,as a company goes it had its good and bad but over all was a challenging and stressful place to work. I personaly did well in the inviroment . management needs a lot of help have no regaurd for their people. sometimes came across as  really disrespectful. was ready to move on with no hard feelings when I left.
good,"From starting out as an associate and working my way up in to part of management I have learned every outlook about customer service from an associate, to a supervisor to an Assistant Store Manager and now I use that experience to ensure customers are well taking care of. The experience have made my days easier and more enjoyable."

good,Great place to work with good benefits and chances for advancement. Parties are thrown for all employees 4 times a year with awards and bonuses handed out.
good,On time on point staying focused on task on being #1. Maintaining accurate and safty work place at all times.
good,They mad work fun. Until we hired this lady she was trying to get me fired and she succeeded at it. I had four Operation Associate of the month awards. Still this wasn't good enough for them. I still would be working there the management were great and most of the people there too. I liked to work with the customers and give them great service.
good,Home Depot is a home improvement store. I was a cashier at Home Depot and often assisted in the paint department. There is a lot of opportunity to learn new things about different departments here.
good,The people are always friendly.   I love greeting people. i really enjoyed working for Home Depot 
good,"A typical day at work involves making myself familiar with who is working and what is expected of me by which manager is present. It is looking over and guiding and training cashiers and other team members on their jobs and expectations of the day. It is doing paper work, orders, sales, inventory and customer assistance. It is a full and exciting day each day."
good,"A typical work day consist of stocking merchandise and helping customers with paint orders. I have learned the differences in paint finishes and about wood finishes. The management is sometimes dis-organized but all in all they are ok. some of my co-workers are hard working, and some are harder to work with than others, but I manage"

good,"Daily over site of contractor service dept."
good,the job was really fun and i met lots of people. i just didn't like some f the attitudes most of the customers would have or the way they would talk about things like i didn't know anything.
good,"I was trained in all aspects of operations my time at home depot.  So i did everything under the sun, and liked the variety of it.  My husband came to work there after I had been there for five years.  The position he had cut me off at the knees and I was unable to work in the positions that i enjoyed.  I ended up leaving because of the lack of growth.  Management at Home depot is tough.  They are quick to reprimand you but not so quick with a compliment.  You did not feel your efforts were ever appreciated."
good,"learned how to work with construction materials"
good,"Real demanding job because we worked over night, but I really enjoyed the people I worked."
good,this was a good company to work for ive learned alot dealing with the heavy equipment and material that was used for shipping items out of the warehouse

good,"My job consists of working outside all day lifting and loading heavy merchandise. I love doing physical work so the job suits me, however we are usually understaffed. This causes customers to be angry, because there's not enough service to be offered to them."
good,"Mainly kept shelves stocked, and helped customers with loading.  They are willing to work with school schedules. "
good,"The general day there mainly depends on what day it is. my co-workers are nice for the most part. Management is lenant depending on the situation and sometimes can or cannot be helpful when needed. I control the front end, meaning the money and cashiers and lines, this is hard when we do not have coverage which has been a big problem at my store lately. Overall its a great and flexible place for a college student like myself."
good,Dealing mostly with contractors from every field gave me many new and different ways of doing things in all fields of the construction trade. The most difficult was not being able to get special order material fast enough sometimes costing sales.
good,Just like all jobs this one had its ups and downs. All of my co-workers were really nice and caring. We all functioned like a family. But we did not get paid enough for how much of our life we were sacrificing.
good,A typical work day was helping customers and making sure merchandise is set.  I learned that each place is different and has a different culture.  The hardest and enjoyable part of the job was the commission the ablility to make your own paycheck. 
good,"Working here for me was a mixed bag. Some days I loved it because everything flowed or I got to work the whole day and was never bored, other days I was upset that there were people sitting around doing nothing while I was working like a dog to make ends meet. Typical retail experience."
good,its an ok 2nd job but not enough hours to support me. Management could be better but friendly co workers
good,"Developed features, end caps and promotions through detailed report analysis and the identification of trends, problems and solutions . Demonstrated extensive knowledge and expertise in the management of a store, with full managerial ability for budgets and employees. "

good,"Excellent Benefits, Family friendly place to work, Pay rate can be better."
good,"A typical day at work as a Head Cashier involves working with both cashiers and customers for the entirety of your shift. I have learned that I need strong leadership capabilities and good leadership skills.  I have to communicate well with the employees and customers. I have learned how to be a good supervisor and how to work well with people. I have learned to complete tasks in a timely manner so that I may accomplish all my duties for the day. Most coworkers are enjoyable to be around and like working with The Home Depot. Some managers are great to work with, others are not, but it's like that almost anywhere you work. I have had to learn how to work with different people because everyone is different.  The hardest part of my job for me is not being able to stop theft in the store. We are not allowed to stop an individual who is walking out of our store without paying for their items. I have studied Criminal Justice for over 2 years and it is difficult to just let a criminal walk away.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet so many new people. It's one of the greatest aspects of customer service."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced high volume customer service and organization. I learned how to focus on the customers and respond to their needs. I'm also the face of the company, being the first person they encounter, and the last. My co-workers are responsive to the customers needs as well as the company needs, communication skills are very effective as a team, eager to meet our customers needs. The hardest part would be trying to meet everyone's needs without a hand from former employees, being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of this company is they reconize your best efforts to for fill the need of excellent customer service. They are also very friendly people. "
good,"I had to work a flexible schedule, where I would work a floor shift while doing various reports, ordering and tracking orders. Help upper management with issues with customers and at the registers. I also helped open and close the store, count down the vault as well as help control inventory through asset protection and shrink minimization."
good,Great company when i was in college. very secure pay and loyal to employees. just need to move on
good,I have enjoyed working for Home Depot. I am proud to work for a company that is always doing Team Depot projects helping give back to the community and also helps employees in need through the Homer Fund. I loved working in bookkeeping as that is the kind of work I love but when the company downsized I was put on the floor Head Cashiering. I have bad feet due to diabetes and it is hard standing on concrete all day. In bookkeeping I could sit and stand equal times. As I get older it is more difficult to stand and walk all day.
good,People would greet me when i walked into work. Customers would ask me where things were or which product would be better. I get to see the customers face when they are happy and cant wait to get home and get the project done. That was the best part of the job. The hardest is when I did not know where the product was and some people were on their lunch break. Also when we did not have the product and they got upset and left. At the end of the day I would count the money at the register then clock out. Other co-workers would say good-bye and have a good night.
good,the culture for associates varies by store and by district. as long as you work for results of the store and have a cookie cutter frame of mind then you'll be ok
good,"A challenging place to work, fast paced, and customer service oriented job. The company has shifted its focus back on to the customer."
good,"Home Depot has been a great place to work for the past 13 years. It has been a reliable part time job with flexible scheduling,"
good,We always have to jump straight into work there was always something to. I learned about different types of flowers and what makes you garden much beautiful...
good,"Nice company to work for, company does a lot for the associates. Not a great place to work if you are a manager"
good,"Work at customer service and or returns, sometimes a self check outs. Ive learned the different products that customers use and what they are used for there projects. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to help you out."
good,"There was no typical day at HD, I would go in with a agenda and then have several other things to deal with but that's what made it enjoyable-the challenge. I leaned multiple departments which made me flexible to help throughout the store and I also learned how to manage many different types of people. I was always fortunate to work with a strong management team that would always help each other out. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with an upset customer that did not want to resolve the issue. What I enjoyed most was the many friends that I made in 9 different stores in 2 states"
good,"come in and down stock the sales floors, clean and fix all displays, take care of showroom, order carpet samples and stock samples for showroom, update all information cards in department, find and stock new items for store, help out customers find what they are looking for. hardest part about this job was trying to finish everything in time."
good,"Typical day was managing both AP and Operations to some degree with both Corporate and district mandated responsibilities with daily weekly and monthly routine as well as daily issues which arose.Hardest part was work life balance and once business took a hit cuts were on every ones mind. Most enjoyable was my interaction with the store staff ,the partnerships I built and the overall complexity of my job."
good,"Prepared merchandise for deliveries with use of several types of machinery, including forklift, and electric pallet jack. Unloaded incoming freight and distributed throughout the store. Learned valuable skills in customer service and how to handle difficult situations. The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking. What made the job enjoyable was working with my co-workers and the feeling of satisfying customers."
good,"Design, review and sale kitchen and bath products. Design kitchen and baths. Sale the design, appliances, floors, counter tops, and fixtures. Help in other departments when needed."
good,"I enjoyed working at the depot, I was looking to find a higher paying job, I loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the public."
good,It was nice working for a company that when you requested time off you were able to count on getting the time off.
good,Good company to work for. Was very sorry to see it close all 53 stores.
good,"I love the Depot, was fun working there. my co-workers were great. working the front end made time go by faster, will get customers that was not happy either with long lines, or can't find what they are looking for. Can't really say there was a hard part of the job, with home depot you are moving 24/7 which I found to be a good thing, but when you get that down time when its not as busy you enjoy it."
good,"A typical day at work would be a shift from 2-11 or 3-11 for me. I would either be on a register on the front end or at the returns desk. I've learned that in this world you really have to be extremely patient with customers and co-workers and not let a job stress you out, you should never let a job break your spirit. A lot of customers try to take out their frustrations on employees but you have to brush everything off. Management tries to work with you schedule wise but I think they could do better in a lot of aspects. The hardest part in my day would be dealing with certain customers. They just expect you to bend over backwards for them and that's not going to happen. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with certain co-workers who make you enjoy work."
good,not that bad to work just the hours go up and down way too much and i go to school so i cant do that i would need set hours.
good,"This job is a dream if you like hard work. In a 9 hour shift, you have to have initiative and learn to operate the necessary machines for the job."
good,Freight handling
good,A typical day at work is all about customer service for me. I love all the people I work with and they have taught me so much. The hardest part of my job is trying to help people who don't really know what they are looking for. I enjoy the tight group I have with my department and how we all help each other out when we need it.
good,"A typical work day would require me to greet and assist customers with their shopping needs. Help my supervisor with his inventory paper work. Most of the managers and co-workers are easy going and helpful. The hardest part about the job is that when you go above and beyond your duties, you do not always get the recognition from managers. The part I enjoy most about the job is helping the customers in acquiring what they need to complete their projects."
good,A typical day at work was helping customers. I learn alo about the hardware business.
good,Bussiness was not very diverse. They do make acomedations for the handi-cap. Employees often help one and other. The bussiness tends to work around resonable schedules.
good,Home Depot is always trying to better its associates. For full time and part time there are many benefits for one to take advantage of. It is shift work so you do need to be available and work your life around the schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you create with co workers. However there are many hard parts of the job including un-reasonable customers or how management (this is dependent on the present manager) can treat you. But I can never talk bad about Home Depot as it has helped me grow over the last 6 years.
good,"Home Depot has many stores and many employees to operate them your challenge is to get all you can from the experience. things have changed drasticly over the years but, it is and has been a company that offers a good wage and benifit package."
good,Lot's to do and be a part of. Being a GM puts you at the core of everything that goes on. My proudest moment in my career as I was promoted to my 1st GM job. Learned a lot about Business
good,its really nice helping a customer out usually you get really nice customers that are understanding when you dont know something you also get the jerks customers where they think just cause your a girl you dont know nothing.they throw you in a training room where you have hours of computer training to do it gets very boring and once you complete your training they just love to throw people out on the floor which sucks because sometimes a coworker isnt around to help you out with questions a customer might have
good,Home Depot offers a great workplace environment. I have been with the Company since 2006. My current position as a Human Resources Staffing Coordinator offers many challanges and a heavy work load on a daily basis. Catering to the needs of every individual associate has enabled me to develop excellent people skills along with buliding positive relationships. The most enjoyable part fo this job is being to help others and motivate the associates to perform to the best of their abilities.
good,Typical day at work would be merchandising products and collaborating with team members to help create a better work experience.
good,"Above all, being a part of the team at the Home Depot has really grown some trust and created a personable atmosphere. With the company knowing I have a degree in IT, much of my co-workers and bosses ask for my help with anything that involves computers. I really get a smile out of that -- gives me the sense of satisfaction that I'm truly needed in more ways than one. Being a manager is probably the most enjoyable and the hardest part of the job. One really has to come to terms with a mixing customer imbalance, and also be able to be more problem-solving than in most employment positions."
good,Great place for people orientated person. Customer service strong.
good,Our store is a great place to work due to our caring and dedicated associates.
good,"Very busy position, where I was responsible for selling and for maintaining shelf stock for a large department. I learned a lot and received a wonderful training from Home Depot. I enjoyed working there and was treated well."
good,I became a flooring expert and was able to explain to customers the most efficent method and or materials needed to complete their projects
good,"Relaxed environment, fast paced on busy days. learn to take the words from customers, then learn to react with small rebutles."
good,"If there is a customer i ask them if they need any help, and make the store look nice."
good,"There is a lot of back and forth thru departments. During the chrismas season there was a lot of heavy lifting of trees plus other items. Plenty of consulting with customers. I learned how to thread pipe, cut chain, different procedures on safety while loading and moving. My coworkers were very interesting, there's always someone around to help you. Everyone is very friendly. Management is all over and hands on which I like alot. The hardest part would be lifting the heavy items. The most enjoyable part would be the people I worked with and the fact there is always something to do."
good,"Pay is fair but the job overall is fun and high paced. As a department manager there is a lot to be completed and kept up with. Sales, markdowns, variances, gross margin, inventory, price changes, scheduling conflicts, customer service levels."
good,"It was a good place to work, But large amount staff turn over. I learned a lot about decor, blinds and more experience in other departments."
good,"like all retail went to part time employees, not good for a long term future, or i would go gack to work for them"
good,"a fun place to work, made lots of friends that i still have today, pay was great, most of the management was superior"
good,"I never stopped working for the company, but I finally stopped working for some specific managers. I started as a temp associate, left as an assistant manager in my last two stores after 13 years. There's very little I didn't do from overnight resets to corporate buyer walks, and EVERYTHING in between. In 4 different stores over those years I always found something to like and be a productive part of. Depot is a great career path and provides all the typical options of any other company that size. Personally, it made me a lot of money in my 401k. Day to day, it is what you bring to work that matters, good or bad. It's a job in an effective company that will pay the bills. If you're looking for something you love, go to a tech school and learn IT, become a nurse, or find a trade you really like. Speaking for myself The Home Depot was a great career, but only one typical ""job"" in a big world. Sometimes I had to fight to have a good day no matter how hard I tried. It's always positive interaction with people and the personal satisfaction gained from doing the job well that keeps anyone clocking in...bureaucracy is what it is."
good,"this is a great place to work, but if you dont plan this being your future i wouldnt move up the ladder because once you make it past entry level they require that you be available at all times. other then that the benefits are great and the pay is good"
good,I enjoyed retail sales and helping customers! No bad places to work.
good,"Good place to work. Learned good customer service, Cool co-workers who are fun to be around, and are the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"I loved working at the home depot, i loved the people i worked with and the customers( most of the time). It was a great enviroment, always contests for prizes or extra money in paycheck. I wish a cashier got paid more there because i would do that my whole life ! haha!"
good,I have never worked retail but I did enjoy working at Home Depot. Very good environment to work in.
good,"Never a typical day at work, too many variables in a ""trade"" dep't. with making sales to non-trade customers. Took a while to learn the questions needed to ask customers, to find out what product was required for their DIY project. Co-workers great to work with. Really great feeling, when return customers thanked you after the fact, when their DIY was completed without a hitch based on advice you had given them."
good,The best part of working with Home Depot is the customer service. I love helping people find things that they may need to complete their projects. Even if that means to call other store and have them bring the product to us or for us to pick it up for the customer.
good,"I worked for this company a year and six months. Home Depot Is a great job. I showed a lot of dedication to this job to only get let down when it was all said and done. I caught 2 buses and walked a mile to and from work each and everyday. Cashiering is cool I would do it again. I had very cool co workers. I loved seeing my regular customers and more importantly the kids. If I was having a bad day and customer came in with there kids, they would really make my day."
good,Days at work was just greeting and ringing out customers. At the end of the shift I cleaned and went home. My co-workers were great and very friendly. the hardest part of the job was working in the garden in 90 degree weather. the most enjoyable part was seeing my customers smile.
good,"Labeling, price changes, price accuracy, shelf maintenance accuracy, changed price labels and signage. I learned how to price, cross-merchandising, sequencing bays, how to read and work planograms, how to stay organized."
good,"nice people to work with, management was very , they do take care of their employees"
good,"Fun work, customers could be very demanding at times."
good,The company i have nothing bad to say. customers comming in at lunch being rude cutting in front of customers you are trying to help another story.
good,Fun job that kept you busy all day long with the customer service and the stocking. I like being outside and on my own to an extent.
good,Home Depot is a fun place to work to. People are very friendly and you get to have fun while working. I learned that doing your job properly and fast is important and also good customer service. The management in Home Depot is pretty okay. Co workers are very fun to be with. The hardest part of the job is when you have to stay for hours in a cold place where you can't work properly and get sick. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers happy after they shop.
good,loved working for HD... took 5 years of my life away... and they dont give you much life outside of work but great fun working with that family...
good,always busy but very fun team based company. Management was great if u had any issues you could always contact them.
good,My day cosist of setting up displays to push sales.I have a 5am to 2 pm shift and only workewd weekdays.
good,Great Benefits and Stock options.
good,"My day starts at 4:00 am, I start my day by filling merchandise for the first hour of the day, then I go back into the vault and attend to bookkeeping issues for the next 4 hours or so then it is back on the floor to provide customer service in all areas of the store until shift ends at 12:30"
good,Home Depot is an ok place to work but is seems like the only way you can advance is by being best freinds with management
good,Working with customers is what it is. Sometimes you'll have a supportive sup and sometimes not. Benefits are good.
good,"Job was good and the training was good. There was always a ""team"" effort with projects. Management seemed to care about the workers. I would have stayed with the company if they could have given me the salary I needed to support my family."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Home Depot , unfortunatly they was not able to give me nearly as many hours as i wanted . I only hear good feedback about the way i did my job , yet aveged about 16 hours a week for the past few month i was employed with them"
good,"I absolutely enjoy the people that I work with at The Home Depot. I have grown to accept them as my extended family. Working at the Home Depot isn't absolutely easy but it is pretty simple. You must be ready to work and cater to customers. Your advancement is what you make of it, you have to strive to be someone that they can see long term potential in, as well as you may want to take it upon yourself to train yourself further. One thing that I have come to learn about the company is that a closed mouth doesn't get fed, so you must be able to speak up when you see room for opportunity."
good,The training was great. I was a regional trainer and loved that component of my job. The work load was not short term goal orientated and not specific. The manager side was top heavy and did not allow for an even work life balance. If you took time off for such things like the birth of a child if you have the wrong supervisor. They would see that as a lack of commitment to the company. The job security was always held over managers heads and you were looked down on if you expected your supervisors to have the same commitment to supporting you that they expected from you. It is an A typical retail enviroment.
good,"The home depot is a good place to work overall. My particular store does not give current associates enough room and time to grow, especially the ones that want to grow and advance.The customers are great most of the time. My co workers are awesome. They help the day go by faster with their sense of humor. I don't get many hours there, but I try to get as much as they will allow me to get. All in all the customers and co workers make home depot a good place to work from my experience."
good,It was a very nice place to work. If you speak english sometimes other nationalities would make fun of me because I didn't speak their language. I liked that I learned alot.
good,"i loved working there, Unfortunately the schedule would fluctuate so I couldn't find a second job."
good,I worked at Home Depot for almost 6 years. When i left i was a dept supervisor that could not get promoted to the next level. The last shift i worked was 14 hrs straight with no break. Upper level management doesn't get it.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot, establishment filled with caring co workers, loyal customers who kno u by name and come to you in their Dier Need. A Hard part of the day always starts when you run into a difficult shopper. Striving to fly above in beyond different attitudes and moods of the public may be a hard task at times but the best part of the day is running into a loyal customer whose happy they can come to you from previous experiences."
good,"It was an okay job. I gained a great deal of information. Helping customers meant a great deal to me. Knowing that I've helped someone to improve on one of their biggest asset, their home, is a great feeling."
good,7am to whenever you hit your quota
good,I enjoyed working for home depot the associates were friendly and nice.
good,Helping customers with upgrading their homes. Learned to definitely have patience when dealing with people everyday. Management was good people to work for and with on a day to day basis. Co-workers were very fun and caring people to work with. They were all about helping people like myself. Hardest part of the job was closing every weekend for almost three months straight at one point. Most enjoyable was being able to talk to management and your problem was never ignored.
good,"Overall, I had mostly good days working at The Home Depot. I've learned how to work the register. My co-workers were awesome, kept the atmosphere alive, also made work exciting and motivated."
good,"Sales is the main day to day work. I learned all about home improvment. The management mentality is to enpower the employee allowing us to make decisions on our own, very usefull. The co-workers is what made going to work everyday a joy. The hardest part is the unreliable hours and no set shifts are allowed."
good,Great team to work with daily. The hardest thing is balancing the schedule with your family life. No set hours or days off.
good,Great company to work for. I'd probably still be there if I wouldn't have had an offer i couldn't refuse from another company.
good,"Working from 4:00am to 1:00 pm Monday thru Friday was my dream hours. Love working early in the day. The team I worked with was the ultimate daily duty. When one needed help in their dept. the others came in to help without being asked. Purchasing for 3 departments on a daily basis was challenging because we were limited on who and quantity we could order from, to keep the shelves stocked. Then we would be creative and request other stores to share their products to help us with our inventory levels. Most stores were cooperative."
good,"Arrive at Work, clock in and report to the sales floor and along the way greet the customer and assist anyone who needs help. Report to the Information desk and inform the Supervisor that I am ready for duty. Begin to assist clients by taking computer and phone orders, cashiering and refunding merchandise for damaged or discontinued merchandise. At work it was a family atmosphere everyone expressed concern with assisting coworkers and customers in having an enjoyable experience. The management were always approachable and on the sales floor to lend a hand if you had a question or concern. The most enjoyable part of my job was it did not feel like work. I enjoyed the frequent customer who knew you on a first name basis."
good,great co- workers
good,"I learn mostly different kind of house utilities such as hardware, plumbing stuff, painting, gardening and more."
good,A typical day at HD was could be slow and finding something to do was always a task. I learned to work in all departments within the store. Management could be helpful at times but it was hard to always get them when needed. Co-workers were helpful with their departments. Hardest part of the job was to make sure you did your orders correctly for the customer. Most enjoyable part was making sure you did your job correctly and getting to know the customer you just helped .
good,"A typical day at work was to help customers, which was not such an easy task when it comes to home improvement people can be very picky and very disrespectful to who is helping them, as for the managment they were ok, never really saw them, there always in there office, the co workers were all super nice and friendly."
good,"have been able to get so much experience in all forms of marketing mediums, just for the fact that THD has such a large budget"
good,"a typical day at work is me being super busy and the only register open getting all the customers!the hardest part of the job is being the only register open on a super busy day, because cutomers get irritated and upset. the most enjoyable thing about the job is the activites we get to do and the environment is fun"
good,la carga y descarga de unidades
good,Well and typical day at work would be coming into work getting ready for the new and old customers. the things i learned from work at these businesses was come in prepared and leave the games at home or go home without a job to good back to at the end of the day customers comes frist. Some of my co-workers were friendly but some of them were lazy. The hardest part of my job was knowing how to help the customer the best way i could and making sure my job was complete. My most enjoyable part of the job was when i help the customer get wat they needed and that they left me with a smile on their face and wanting to come back for my help again the future. Management was ok just needs to work on some areas to iimprove their skills
good,I love working in the garden. I enjoy assisting people with their projects. I have learned so much about plants and gardening. My co-workers are some of the best people I have ever worked with. The hardest part of the job is knowing all there is to no about the products we sell. I really enjoy when people are are so thankful that you helped them with a problem or project.
good,I am fortunate enough to have a full time position with set hours.
good,The management team in my store is strong but could use better judgement when hiring new department supervisors. the company trains supervisors to deliberate and delegate rather than to lead by example. Most co-workers pull their own weight.
good,It was my first real job. I got to learn a lot of differant fields and meet some great people at the same time.
good,"There are some days I leave there happy and some I leave upset, not due to management due to customers, you know they are always right. Our ASM's at our store are great they is noting that you can not talk to them about they are there to listen to you about your day at work. I have meet some great people working here"
good,"i can say that home depot is a good starter job for anyone, if you are looking to move up it may take a while, especially if you have management and department heads who cant find their butts half of the time. co workers were fantastic, some of the customers were okay depends on the mood of the customer. all in all home depot like i said is a great starter job but if you like retail then stick with it me personally i don't care for retail."
good,Home depot is a good job and has oppurtunity for advancement
good,"It can be a good place to work at times. I feel that they don't pay enough for the work you do. I am considered a flooring ""specialist"" but I received no pay increase for becoming one. I get a tacked on Sales Per Hour goal and no monetary gain to show for it?"
good,"At Home Depot there is not a typical day as an assistant manager. Most of the day consists of developing associates, solving customer issues, monitoring inventory and keeping the store functioning at its best."
good,"My typical day at work consist of input and updating customers orders , following up with vendors , speaking directly with vendors , some cashiering , answer phones , file paper work ."
good,"As of the current time, I have worked for the Home Depot for 8 years, 5 months, and 10 days. I worked myself up from an entry level part time cashier position in a matter of 1 year, and have been a supervisor since. While the position is not nearly as enjoyable as it used to be, I must say that the business logistics, metrics, and analytical information we are exposed to is beneficial and is a business skill that transcends many different fields of interest."
good,Processing sales contracts from start of sale to end of installation of projects. Dispatched and routed technicians. Maintained proper logs of warehouse inventory.
good,"When arriving at work, I would have to get till from head cashier. After I counted the till, I would open up my register and assist customers with purchasing items from store. At the end of my shift, I would count my till and send it back to the vault. The hardest part of that job was getting backed up with it was really busy. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers and co-workers."
good,The Home Depot is a relaxed and fun atomosphere to be in. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers which is not very common. The employees are overall great to be around which makes being at work that much more enjoyable.
good,Overall THD is a good company to work for. They are very customer oriented and give each employee the power to make the customer happy.
good,Very fast paced day's which I enjoy and prefer. Mixing paint and solving customer's home improvement questions. Paint department is a team environment. Everyone works together to service customers as quick as possible. The management team at my store are very good as leaders. The hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable. Working in a fast paced department and on the go all the time. I enjoy working with customers to solve their needs. The hardest part of this job is being on your feet for several hours.
good,"Home Depot was a good place to work, good benefits, and a good work ethic. The hardest part of my job was staying busy, since I mainly worked outside I could only push carts for so long before having to wait for something else to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,i loved working at home depot great complany to work for but mostly for the younger generation because you hardly get any hours in the wfallm through winter months...i moved up to my current position rather quickly but never really was taught my full position...i asked a lot of questions and learned myself...i loved managing others and keeping the front end up to par....there was no hard part to the job i maintained the front end very well....loved my employees and managers
good,"The job I do I like, The pay Sinks, advancement is hard, You have to be a brown noser to get anywhere."
good,"Home Depot provides great benefits, but limits the an individual to advance within the business."
good,The home depot was a very fun place to work. There was no day like any other as it was something new each and every day!
good,Great thing about inventory management is that you have set hours and if you like to work on your own then it is perfect.
good,The work pace was steady which seemed to make the shift go by quickly. I learned how to operate an RF scanner. The Management was very attentive to issues and very helpful. My co-workers were very diverse and we all worked well together. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different codes for the RF scanner. Meeting the daily goals for the shift was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I would say that home depot is a very nice place to work. you really learn a good bit from the web based service.
good,Giving world class customer service. Working in a fast pace retail store ringing out customers items.
good,"I enjoyed learning about various tools and dealing with customers. I also enjoyed working with my peers, who were very encouraging and helpful."
good,They come a long way from what I was use to in the pass I think they looked at some of right things that Lowes has done as far as cleaner looking stores.
good,I looked forward to going to work every day and working with my teammates
good,on any average day you can be sure you will do everything you possible can to provide excellent customer service
good,"I work night shift so, it's all work. But the time flies by, which I like. Also night management allows you to make decisions on a neede bases. the hardest part of the job is sometimes there are not enough help so it's on you to move heavy equiptment n your own. The good thing about that is learning to use and operate the moving machines ."
good,"This job consist of completely satisfying the customers 24/7 100% of the time. I, myself, enjoyed working with this company. There are many opportunities for advancement and to increase your knowledge in the home improvement department. The only disadvantage with this job is the pay. Over a years time, my pay rate only increased by $0.45 and i had learned 2 departments of the store."
good,The company is an okay place to work for. Working here is a great opportunity to learn customer service skills.
good,Just a good place to work and meet people who look to you for help in all of their home projects is the most enjoyable part of the job. and working with my cowork.
good,"A fast-paced work place. Good team members, very knowlegdeable. Good place to meet new people and learn about home improvement."
good,"I don't know if polarizing would be the proper term but if you talk to people in the corporate office they seem to be unhappy in their current role and haven't figured out how to get out or they've drunk the kool-aid and are over the moon about THD, there seems to be no middle ground. A lot of your experience here will be determined by the manager of the group you join as is the case in most organizations. If you land in an area with a manager that has an interest in developing her/his associates the sky's the limit!"
good,Home Depot as a company is amazing! The benefits and the programs they have in place to take care of their employee's are just wonderful!
good,no complains good and fun place to work for....have fun meeting people
good,"The Home Depot was a generaly decent place to work. I enjoyed and got along with all of my coworkers and managers. I didn't like how I had to stand at a register for hours on end. I learned alot of running a front end of a retail store. Dealing with angry customers with no help was very stressful, or having to figure out how to work the service desk on my own. The management didn't really help out alot with cashiers."
good,"Answered incoming calls from vendors, customers, installers and Home Depot Stores"
good,"Typical day is spent addressing service issues for customers, monitoring metrics, meetings, and mainly driving customer service in all areas of the building."
good,Good company to work for and great values. Slow growth opportunities.
good,Your job is always dynamic and enjoyable. The people that you work with are always fun and willing to help you excel. A family atmosphere and fair compensation for your work.
good,"A Typical day at work consists of running reports, ordering, transferring in product that is needed. Listening to customers and recommending the best way to build their dream, solve their problems and educated them in basic home improvement. I have learned how to time manage and get a long list of things done in eight short hours. The hardest part of the job is often the time management especially when you are busy with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you building someone's dream."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. There is a variety of things to keep one busy in the course of the day so you do not get bored, no matter which department you are in.The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer, the most enjoyable part was the smiles of the ones that were."
good,learned the value of a great work enviroment
good,I worked in two departments at the store I was at. I also answered the phone and sold credit cards and for that when review time came I was told that I wasn't in my department long enough!
good,"The hardest part of the day is standing on your feet for 8+ hours. The training is extensive but very important. Once you complete your CBT, it will make your hands on training easier to apply. The managers are extremely helpful and friendly. If you need help, all you have to do is ask your co-workers for help and they will help you the best they can. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you get to talk to people and get ideas for your own home improvement plans."
good,"I was at HD for 8 years as a part time employee at two different stores. When I started the benefits were great even for part time employees; basically 50% of the full time benefits, including dollar bonuses, and bonuses of HD stock. My 4th year at HD about 75% of the part time benefits were no longer offered."
good,Great job for self driving people. Management desires a lot with little support. Learned merchandising and operations
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for but it depends on what kind of a boss you have. Some store managers believe on work/life balance others only believe in theirs. I worked for a few companies but the majority of store managers for home depot believe that something is owed to them and so they will work shorter days than some full time associates. ASM's are stuck doing all the work. Pay is great and full bonuses rock at any level. If you're dedicated but have little experience the home depot will teach you real life scenarios. Better than school at times. I know many managers that get promoted through depot and then end up leaving for better pay and less stress because many companies know that if you have what it takes to run a home depot. You have what it takes to be in just about any retail company.
good,Working with approximately with 15-20 co-workers to prepare store for the opening of the next business day.
good,lots to do always busy
good,I wanted to jump back into the retail field and I could not have found a better place to work for.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work with good benefits. I would prefer that management was more involved in day to day duties so they know exactly what is going on. I believe things would change if everyone had a handle on what was going on. There are alot of wonderful people working there.
good,It's a good place to work but management can improve their management skills with us associates. Home depot offer great benefits for the fulltime employees
good,"Home Depot is a good company, they have good benefits, you will meet all kinds of people, and the regular's that come in are nice and great people. that you get to know while. the assocates are good and fun."
good,Great Company Just looking for full time jobs. the culture is great and awsome associates to work with.
good,"great people all around. okay pay but great bonuses, paid weekly, stay busy environment."
good,"Great and stable company. has a diversified group of employees. Management is very accessible to every employee, ready to assist in solving customer issues. ."
good,It provided one with the opportunity to learn a craft quickly and effectively. With a flexible schedule for school and personal life.
good,Enjoyed working for Home Depot. I was laid off for placing my till in my locker at the end of my shift.
good,"The company has good values and standards and I think that is reflected in it's employees. People who aren't nice just don't last that long there. Coworkers and customers are both very friendly and fun to work with, which is the only reason I'm still there. Management needs a little work though and they don't give raises if they don't have to!"
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work, people are friendly, and the training provided is satisfactory"
good,The companies exponential growth from the 1990s has caught up with it in recent years. They still provide a great foundation for someone starting off their career. Mid level and Senior executives will find it a difficult culture when coming from outside venues.
good,"Most every employee is wonderful to work around, especially the managers. Never had to work outside of my published availability. Retail isn't for me but I enjoy the people I work with and being able to help people with their home needs."
good,"I found this a good and challenging work environment, very structured, and they provided plenty of training opportunities. The pay was fair and the benefits were exceptional."
good,Dont be afraid to ask questions in any field the management will help anyway they can. For example I didn't know anything the first day and they were patient with me teaching how things were properly done and showed me other positions that didn't even apply to my job.
good,fasted paced customer service job heavy lifting required management is almost non existent benefits are good employees are very expendable to this company
good,"Home Depot is a decent company to work for, as they generally work with their employees in a fair manner."
good,The Home Depot has great benefits. They typically start new associates as part-time. With hard work and dedication you will be brought in full time when a full time position becomes available.
good,It's good place to have part time. The management is friendly (Gerrard square location) and understanding. Usually you won't get much hours during slow season.
good,This is a flexible work place. Very good for students that have a busy schedule. This job is very low stress and one of the easiest places i've worked.
good,"If you love for time to fly while working then this is for you! It’s a busy atmosphere where you need to preform accurately and quickly, while maintaining great customer service"
good,They had flexible hours. The staff was great to work with and was extremely friendly to work with. Most of the supervisors were very knowledgeable about their departments and the contents in them.
good,Great benefits and supportive corporate culture but that also comes with negatives as well - Fast-paced work environment that strives to stay on top of technology leading to too many teams working in silos and not consulting each other.
good,"During the spring and summer, work is fast paced which can be very stressful, especially in garden or lumber department. Store and assistant managers are understanding and respectful, but like any workplace they expect work productivity to be high. Management can vary from store to store and can affect everyone's feelings of the company. The work culture can best be described as ""scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"". People respect you if you help them out and they'll return the favor. After all the stress, what kept me there were my amazing co-workers."
good,I have had a good experience at Home Depot. The overall culture is very friendly and management does a nice job to work with you on scheduling your shifts and accommodates requests for days off quickly.
good,"Home Depot affords you the opportunity to advance without have any experience. The growth potential is great, but the support may not always be there."
good,"Great benefits and good job security. They provide a lot of tools to succeed. The downside is the company is so big they sometimes lose sight of the customer first moniker and they often make uninformed decisions from the corporate level that they think will improve sales, only to be detrimental to sales. A lot of things beyond your control that affect customer service that can adversely affect your income."
good,I found that all the associates treat each other like family. Its a calm work environment. Hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time and sometimes missing your break.
good,"Working at The Home Depot wasn't bad but it wasn't fulfilling. Working overnight, you'll unload cargo with a small crew and then stocked the shelves. Good place to make money and work for a temporary thing."
good,"If you are in to home improvement, handiwork, gardening, or you just like to shop for your home, while you work then this job is for you. Everyday you will learn something new from other associations, departments heads, and customers. I knew nothing about anything in this store but after a year of working there I was a handyman lol. The work isn't to hard but you will get your hands dirty. This job is great to put on your resume"
good,"The job at home depot is not bad, it's actually pretty easy. The only problem is I've been working for a month and there has been way too many problems with my check. First time they dated my check wrong and the second time they only put half of the money I was owed. This is after a months work and I still haven't been able to cash my full check"
good,"I was a supervisor for 7 years,My Job was to make sure my department was stock on merchandise making sure we had products for customers and providing the best customer service and not only that but to lead my associates by example"
good,"I work as a Customer Order Specialist. This position is Monday-Friday, from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm with weekends off. It is one of only five positions that have weekends off. A good place to work but doesn't pay very well. Fun place to work."
good,"Great environment , friendly customers makes the job easier to assist, i learned to be more customer friendly and learned more about hard warhardware."
good,It’s a good place to work but the head cashiers some of them just rude! But the job itself was really nice and I miss working there. The pay was good. They always treating each week with something fun and new. Giving to you as well on holidays
good,Come in on time and ready to show great costumer servace but if yoi should need any help. Any and all the leads are ready to geting you a haping hand.
good,"I was happy with the way Home Depot moved me up to a manager.  I felt like they cared about my career.  It was a very good company to work for, I would probably go back."
good,"I work as a flooring associate and my day consists of helping customers with tile,flooring or carpet as well as filling the aisles with products. Even though I am a flooring associate, I am also responsible for an extra 3 aisles that's for decorations which consists of blinds, totes and indoor storage units like closets."
good,"I enjoy working with Home Depot, this great company works to improve employee morale, lots of teamwork and always willing to help or support each other"
good,I enjoyed my time at the Home Depot. They were always willing to train me on new equipment. I feel like i learned skills I could take to my next employer.
good,"A good place to work. Must learn the store to be able to guide customers. Must be fast learner and an active employee."
good,The Home Depot is an excellent environment for those with desire to grow in personal development within a positive work environment.  Success sharing and stock engagement along with excellent benefits add to the experience.
good,"I worked as a sales specialist being a kitchen designer, therefore my customer was spending a good deal of money for their project.  I would collaborate with other department associates to ensure my client got the assistance and information they needed.  My manager at the time was very supportive and grateful to his staff.  The hardest part of my job was when I was sitting in a design appointment and other customers wanted help and there wasn't another associate around immediately to help.  The general public can be very rude and demanding and it takes skill to manage them tactfully.  The most enjoyable part was working with customers who valued what you were helping them with."
good,"Se preocupan por la capacitacion constante del empleado,buenas prestaciones, buen sueldo."
good,"Home depot is a great place to advance in the company.  Retired, invested in the stocks, 401 k. Great benefits.  Healthy environment.  Great place to work at."
good,"Overall i felt as though the coworkers made home depot as great as it was. There was definitely moments where things got hard but the other associates with help you get through those"
good,J'ai aimé et je continue d'aimer de travailler pour cette entreprise.Une direction disponible en tout temps et des collègues géniaux.
good,"The coworkers at Home Depot are fantastic generally, and most of the management are solid, dependable people. Many times, however, important information regarding advancement, your work quality, and company policy updates can take a long time to filter down, if they do at all."
good,"This is a good place to work for your first job but i would only be there to gain experience only because pay is limited, if you are not a store manager or assistant manager, department supervisors only gain a dollar more than minimum wage employees"
good,"Best job I've had, though not without its caveats. Wages aren't amazing. Work is often straightforward and fun. Physically demanding. Wear good shoes."
good,I have been working at home depot for just about a year now and i havnt got many complaints. it is the perfect job to have while transitioning into adulthood and figuring out your true career path. Perfect for students and or people who enjoy having a healthy work-life balance.
good,My job has it's moments and honestly it all come down on your management team. They either make it or break it for you. overall i enjoy working there and have learned so much.
good,"Good mix of culture of people, close to home, flexible hours, management was a little hard to work with when it came to scheduling but they got my hours correct when I needed it the most."
good,The company values its customer and expects the employees to exceed the buyers expectations. Employee development and morale are key for the success of the company.
good,L’environnement de travail est agréable et parfait pour des étudiants.
good,The job is very demanding and does not offer enough pay to its associates. Does events and activities for employees but does not offer employees discount for the store.
good,Love the other employees love seeing and helping the customers the best I can. Great pay. It was a awesome experience and I learned quite a bit. I enjoyed working there.
good,"I have work for HD several time in my career. That has to tell you something. It also must tell you something that I have left several times. Work life balance and in store recognition, competition has always been a challenge. But the people make the job. With out my teammates I would have never come back."
good,"I am an excellent worker, great personality. I am a people person, once u get to know me and the quality of my work, it's hard to let me go, i am good at what i do. Not every company can find hard working people like me."
good,Everyone was always rallied together to take on whatever anyone needed. From raising money to help another associate to just being a listening ear through the programs they offered.
good,"This is a very large organization. They are highly customer focused, have very competent professional management, and solid and consistent corporate support. Downside are the wages. Can cross train in multiple departments. Decent company match to 401K after 1 year of employment."
good,"i transferred to HD in Warrenton from Issaquah WA. Liked garden center and cashiering."
good,Home Depot is a great company. Everything was ran efficiently. They also had great benefits even for part time associates. I would have continued working there if not for the conflict in my school schedule at the time.
good,You meet new people every day and don't know what they are there for and you always work in the same area and have some expertise in certain areas. You have fun doing what you do and its hard at times but over all its great.
good,"The retail machine is the same no matter where you go. What makes Home Depot stand apart from the rest is the employee community, the activities that you are engaged in and the overall attitude about taking care of their own. There are lots of activities to engage the employees and to try to foster and maintain a positive community for their workers, which is great. Benefits for part-timers is a great plus as well."
good,"working at the home depot gives you a lot experience for customer service as well you learn how to do things like electrical or plumbing. management is really terrible some times. especially when supervisor or managers are promoted and new manages come to the store, since every manager works different they want you do your work in like their way."
good,"Home Depot its not a bad job to work, However, it's not the greatest job. Some days can be tough, especially around the holidays when they are having sales, insanely busy. For the type of work being done at the home depot, Its hard on your body and by this I feel as though they can and should pay more."
good,I'm dependable. The positions I worked in I always made sure no matter who did it we got the job done. Teamwork is a big part of working in retail and other jobs. People person through and through. Very helpful in any way so can be. I take my job seriously especially when it comes to respecting others. Customers and employees.
good,"My day typically involves cleaning, straightening up and restocking the products in the outdoor garden section of the store.  Additionally, I will help customers locate whatever products they may need as well as aid them in loading said product whenever needed."
good,You dont get  benifits as part time at home depot at lowes you do and home depot is more family oriented lowes you cant smoke home depot u lowes u get paid more but lowes got me to smoke less but in all reality lowes is the better company and the way they are changeing is just like home depot
good,"Rewarding and challenging work. The job requires a significant amount of daily, weekly and monthly time which didn't always have a culture for embracing family time."
good,Was good for the most part. There is some problems within management and how they go about things. Overall was very flexible with me being in college and I would go back. I ended up leaving because they wouldn’t approve a transfer in time for when I needed to move.
good,I got promoted within 6 months of working there and I fell in love with my coworkers who quickly turned into my Home Depot family. It’s a relaxed place to work with lots of support and flexible hours.
good,aprender claramente como manejar el dinero en cantidades grandes.
good,It was a great experience working at Home Depot. I learned a lot of things working there . All of my Coworkers were wonderful inside and out . Great company overall.
good,"Home Depot is a great company with a strong history.  If you enjoy helping others then this is a great fit for you.  I would recommend this for younger people needing work experience.  Great advancement opportunities for those that choose to take it seriously, just like any other job."
good,It was ok I enjoyed it management wasn’t that great loved the employees. A typical day at work would be get up fo in at 3 in the morning do what you had to do go home.
good,Enjoyed working there I just took my career in another direction great job for someone fresh out of high school I like that I received sick days overall a good job
good,I liked the people I worked with and we worked as a team. Upper management was always available for questions or even for personal conversation. You had a computer information video every month with a quick test at the end. So you were always kept up with changes and learning.
good,always will be walking. heavy lifting and interacting with customers. not very big on keeping promises. late always getting off shift. always be ready to answer questions.
good,"I worked as a truck driver for Home Depot delivering drop and hook trailers in surrounding PA states. The job was very laid back and easygoing, perhaps too laid back at time. Dispatchers and drivers would often come late. Despite those setbacks, I could not complain about the other aspects of the job that provided me a wonderful work experience."
good,"Honestly, the boss is great one of the best I've ever had. Granted it is a retail job so you'll have to deal with all kinds of customers and situations that can be draining and a hassle. Overall not a bad place but if you want to achieve more there you'll have to work for it."
good,"Working with employees was fantastic however the management overall was a mess. I wouldn't recommend it for a long term job, but if you wanted to work as a part time job they will accommodate you well with the schedules."
good,"Good Place to work overall, some of the supervisors are ill experienced and  incompetent in their roles. But the company itself really care for the well being of their employees. they have several great programs in place to help employees in need."
good,"I worked for Home Depot Exteriors, which is treated likr a separate entity completely. No connectivity or support from stores at all. Very disheartening when you rely on stores for scheduling appointments and vetting leads."
good,"ppl who worked there their whole life get away with anything. too much pressure for new employees. Good ppl in management, but their hands are tight . Big companies like that don't recognize if you put a lot of effort."
good,"Job security , good job for associates. Moving up decreases work life balance , pay is no longer competitive. A great company motto and value wheel. Would be nice if that's what the company really lived by"
good,"I enjoyed my time at home depot. I met many great people and learned many new skill sets that I use today. It's a great work environment, the paint department especially. I would definitely recommend Home depot to a friend looking for a job."
good,Working there was really about knowing the business and building your own skill.  No one hovers over you but you do need to stay busy. As long as you do the basics which is keep it safe and clean them you're good.
good,"I believe that this position would be ideal for anyone willing to perform a second job. The compensation is ok to supplement another job salary and the benefits the company offer are satisfactory. If you are in college, the hours for a part time associate would be highly advantageous. The job is very labor intensive and requires a moderate degree of physical activity."
good,"My time at Home Depot was a great experience. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the management team. "
good,"Loved my entire time working here. Everybody was very helpful and kind, from Employees to Management. Pay was pretty good for the job I was hired for, they just didn't have advancement in my department when I needed it, so I had to relocate. Had no qualms or issues when I had an emergency. Satisfying work with opportunities to work both independently and as part of a team."
good,The pay is just below average but I made some great friendships. Benefits were great. Work was fun. I would work there again if the pay was better. No bad memories of Home Depot.
good,If you like helping others and have a background in home improvement this is a great place to work. The employees all get along well and I admire a company that hires diversity as well as individuals with disabilites.
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot. Is one handling all the orders/ deliveries that are upcoming. We have to make sure that all the orders are put together so they can be delivered the next day. I have to be able to multi-task with doing my assignments, and while also helping customers."
good,I worked for Home Depot for 2 years while putting myself through school. It was a great learning experience as you are mostly working with an outgoing and encouraging staff.
good,"While working as a cashier there is not much to do, you have to wait at the end of the register for customers to come by and see if they need any help or if they are ready to be checked out. Once you have a customer you are to ring them out and follow all the rules and protocols that you are given during your monthly training. Once a month you are given a test cart to see if you are ringing out items correctly. You will either pass the test cart or will fail it."
good,This is a really fun environment to work in. But sometimes their are  some arguments. With that said is a very good place to work in and the benefits are really good.
good,"I work as a pro loader provide great customer service to all customers with a smile, reviews e every six months and good raise. Knowledge depot online every month on what to do if i where to work inside the store for a new better position."
good,"Fun place to work for sure. Great culture great people and you can learn a lot here as your first job, management will always be cr ap but if you're able to work and do things on your own helping customers and focusing on them everything will be okay, at the end of the day its all about the customers not you, that's something i learned working there for about 3 years and then leaving due to the pay being unsatisfactory for the position i was in."
good,It was a great change of pace from the healthcare scene.  No stress just have a work ethic and show up on time.  Its like getting paid to work out... Admittedly some days longer than you wanted.  Walked into work smiling and out of work smiling.  Could use a tad more coaching on some of the more important tasks before cutting new employees loose but a nice place to be.
good,"good place to work, busy shifts and plenty of things to keep employees on their toes any given day. Break room was always a fairly comfortable area to relax during busy shifts and down time."
good,Management was accommodating. No real complaints. They treated me well during difficult times. I was given more hours when needed or wanted. Given the opportunity I would work for Home Depot again.
good,"I learned how to be more confident in my customer service skills and how to utilize my skills on a daily basis, which helped me grew and develop the I learned from The Home Depot into other career opportunities."
good,"Very good benefits. Choose your own hours, like closer to opening shift. Machine operator, forklift experience, customer service experience, problem solving experience."
good,"the company offer its employees a great place to work , fun atmosphere in a fast pace environment giving each employee the oppertunity to grow with and work"
good,"A good place to work, with a lot of diversity. A faced paced environment, with a lot of physical labor. On your feet all day but the pay rate is not that great."
good,"Really wasn't that bad of a job, just was fast-paced repetitive lifting of boxes in a hot or cold warehouse depending on the season. with two thirty  minute breaks, one in which is unpaid for a lunch time."
good,"Fun place to work ,if you have the right management, and associates to work with. A lot of favoritism was shown at our store. You can move up in the company if you no the right people."
good,"Working retail is really hard, as the hours are completely full-flex.  Home Depot culture is very strong though, and as of 2015, they were still offering annual pay raises and decent health benefits. Although the overall cooporation is good, the specific store politics (at least in the 3 I worked in) can become very biased and stressful."
good,"Home Depot on a whole is a good place to work. If you get injured on the job, not so much. As long as you're healthy, they are pretty accommodating. Once you get injured they could care less. They do whatever they can to minimize your injury."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company overall with excellent benefits and promise of a values-related culture. In distribution, it is very fast-paced and not much care for a work-life balance. This is something I heard of the company years prior to joining the team but soon found it to be true. Each location is different, but my experience was not one of fairness or inclusiveness."
good,"I loved my job there, the pay was great and the benefits were awesome, however they had stopped hiring seasonal workers for the busy season and just hired all part-timers. So, when the slow season came around there were only so many hours to go around and too many associates. They hardly ever want to give anyone full-time because they don't want to pay you benefits. I had to pick up a second job and then i eventually left for that second job which I made much better money and hours at."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work.  They treat their employees very well, however, the pay isn't the best.  The ability to earn enough to support a family is just not there unless you become an Assistant manager or above."
good,"Home Depot is a great starter job, more recommend for younger people to learn about tools and life skills, the only thing I would say is some managers treat poorly while others treat fairly. Forklift drivers should be paid a little more."
good,The manager at the time I worked at THD was a vindictive person.  She should make a mistake and blame it on other people.  Several people were fire because of her.
good,"Bar none, the best employee training . The company matched employee fund is truly for employees in need.  Employees take care of employees backed by the Depot."
good,"I think working here has been a good experience with a few issues. Most of the management is fair. If you call out more than 3 times and have not earned sick leave, they will let you go. The training is really good. Most people are nice and they have different positions.  Work schedules change a lot."
good,"Tienen un regimen estricto mucho mas canijo que pensaba, no te peles por que te cortan. I no hay mucho mas que desir."
good,"Home Depot is a good job for college students or older people. It can be long term for those who enjoy that type of work. Management at the particular store I worked at definitely played favorites. Contractors can be jerks, so you need to be tough at times."
good,Multiple positions available at this retail company. Reasonably flexible with associate hours. Need to be prepared for high level of customer service and interaction.
good,"My time at home depot was unfortunately  cut short by a job that supposedly was going to offer me full time, good benefits and pay, and a fulfilling career. I recieved none of these things from that job. Would go back to home depot, but now live too far away for it to be a viable option."
good,"As a full time you ll get benefits and more chances to get promoted, a set schedule, and more vacation/sick time. You also get more holiday pay than part timers, and a optional longer lunch. If your a part time, you can easily set your schedule online to when your available which is nice for the ever changing student schedule. But the scheduler doesn't always stick between those blocks and over works in the summer and hardly gives you any hours in the winter."
good,The typical work day at home depot is very fast paced. You have to stay busy in order to avoid time gaps as you are required to perform at 95% level or better.
good,Was working with Home Depot for over three years and never had a problem until management started to slowly change. I left because I wanted to grow my career in computer science. Good career for anyone who wants a short gig!
good,"L'équipe étaient bien structuré, tout le monde savais se qu'il avait à faire. Une équipe dynamique. Le service à la clientèle était à la hauteur des exigences des clients."
good,"If you’re looking for something very basic, part time, and gives the bare minimum, you’ve found it. They give you great hours the first few weeks, but you are very expendable, great summer job."
good,Faced paced corporation with ample opportunity for individual growth and future advancement. Communication can be somewhat strained due to undefined roles in various management positions.
good,A cashier job at HomeDepot is not as stressful as some other places. Depending on the day depended on the type of customers you will see. Mornings is more construction worker who often do not need any help. In the evenings you see more DIYers. Those customers often need more assistance.
good,"great company for college kids the concrete is very hard on the body. scheduling could be better, building is a warehouse could be a little more clutter-free, they are great about safety and making sure you go home the same way you came"
good,the job was easy but labor induced. I would get done with my job before lunch and would go around helping others finish up their workload because it would help us leave early.
good,"I have a lot more to offer potential employers than just physical labor, but that went unrecognized by my management team. "
good,"Stock up shelves, have inventory ready for customers, I have to answer questions for customers and help them load product in their cars."
good,"The Home Depot was very strict with hours especially making sure everyone got a 15-minute break. Which is nice if you're worried about getting a break, and maybe a little annoying if you wanted more hours, overall really nice job."
good,Home Depot has its ups and downs but overall it was a great place to work I would tell a friend to apply because they really take care of you as a person
good,"I enjoyed working here but it seems the promotion rate was for "" The boys"".  I enjoyed the work hours and all the equipment I learned to operate and maintain. My supervisor was awesome too. Recieving is my specialty and I enjoyed the face pace and my unloading and skills was fun."
good,"lots of great people ,.wonderful learning experience  ,success sharing events with checks were nice ,customers would bring their dogs in ,most were well behaved .mostly i fouund them a nice distraction ."
good,Good company. Enjoyed my co-workers. Was promoted to supervisor after 6 months. Store manager inspired me and motivated everyone. Miss working for him.
good,"A wonderful place to work with a fantastic overnight crew, where hard work is recognized by your fellow employees and management irrespective of your department or role. Opportunities exist for contract extensions based upon your performance."
good,I Loved it there. I always enjoyed my time worked at Home Depot. Besides the pay I honestly feel that this place is a great way to really get a start. Its a great job if you are willing to work hard
good,"Overall I do like this company and I reccomend it to most people. Of course that depends on the store you work in and the Home Depot I worked at was one of the top performing in the region. They train you really well and oare generally very good about transferring departments or stores, letting you learn different departments, and grooming you for management. Even with part time they give you some limited insurance options and you have paid time off. My only issue is management in my store often took advantage of harder working people, and would even block certain people from transferring if they felt they ""needed "" them."
good,Home Depot was a great workplace for part time and full time workers. Everyone that I worked with was always willing to help and work as hard as they could. I loved the people I worked with and the work was hard enough to keep me occupied and it was fast paced which makes the job more enjoyable.
good,Great atmosphere however lacked in career advancement opp. which is a shame. The store was always very hot and management never did anything to fix it despite numerous customer complaints.
good,I love it but moved out of town and had to quit. Mostly great co workers. As a training store for new store managers you had to be good at adapting to changes.
good,"good management. easy going culture, but have to still make sure you get your work done. Managers take care of their subordinates. Company provides lots of free food."
good,The job was really easy to learn and had plenty of refresher courses once or twice a month via online training. And agian whenever a new product came out. The employees are normally great and management is a hand toss good and bad. But they dont always agree so you have to kinda let them argue it out before you know what to do. Garden is a large department so be ready for plenty of physical labor.
good,"Wages should be raised. Communication with management was poor. Learned how to do a lot such as lift trucks, receiving skills, order fulfillment. Hardest part of the job is dealing with poor training for other associates. No one really knew how to do there jobs to the fullest. Over all nice people. Fun tasks. Enjoy working there. Never dull moment. Fast paced. Learn a lot about OSHA rules and HAZMAT."
good,It is a productive and fun place to work. My team members are very skillful. Homedepot uses robust technoloies in BigData. Though I am currently working here I would like to work here for more time if I suppose I get opportunity in the future again.
good,"I can't say enough about the commitment to servant leadership here. Also there was an absolute drive to promote from within that is admirable.where else can a part time employee get benefits,and potentially have their tuition reimbursed??"
good,"Love what I do! Mgmt is absolutely awesome! They treat you fair and have your back. Only negative working here is the compensation and moving to FT. Other than that, it's awesome!"
good,"Retail is different everyday. A person cannot choose retail, retail chooses you. It is fast paced at times and stressful at times but people make it fun"
good,I worked in garden so it was a bit more difficult than some just with loading mulch and rock and such. But very rewording to help customers. There was a lot of pulling product down which I enjoyed organizing the shelves and such.
good,Home depot was a very professional place to work if you're in this industry.  They provide training for employees especially supervisor level and above
good,This is a good place to work. there are plenty of nice people there to work with you. the hours are very flexible unless you want the weekend off then good luck. there are no easy accessible benefits but there are some for full and part time.
good,"Great place to work, I would have still been working there if I was able to transfer when I moved. Great management team, as well as co-workers. Regretfully left, it was a great environment."
good,"Rendering Excellent customer service"
good,When I worked there it was awesome benefits great management awesome...  I worked there for 10 years I learned a lot.i was a cashier I was a customer service representative and I also counted the vault
good,"- Enjoyable work place which provide a working enviroment with workmates."
good,NIce place to work. For the most part a enjoyable place to work.  Downfall is big turnover in management.  One you prove yourself to one manager they leave and process starts all over again.  Very difficult to advance.
good,"walk in 20 to 30 min early to get a sense of what im dealing with for the day, greet the cashiers clock in see if other departments need any help before i went to tend to the lot and carts."
good,"I think Home depot working as a merchandiser was great.  Supervisor was the best. Them team was,very close and was great interacting on a daily basis. Supervisor really was,for his team"
good,The Home Depot is an amazing company and being an employer of choice is top priority.  However the higher you move up the less work life balance you have.
good,Excellent management team.  Employees care about each other and are willing to help you on and off the job.  Pay scale could be improved.  Part time associates work schedule should be more consistent
good,The Home Depot was a great place to grow and really learn both sides of warehouse work as you could learn all departments within the building  and you could also learn the business side and how it was thriving.
good,"My typical workday consists of helping customers design their kitchens and/or bathrooms.  Sometimes this is a long process so I will work with customers over several weeks.  There is extensive training involved to be a Flooring and Appliance Specialist. The hardest part of my job is that the scheduling is inconsistent. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people, both the customers and the other employees within the Home Depot."
good,This is the best place i have ever worked. i would absolutely work here again. the staff was fun to work with and everyone worked together well. the management was professional and understanding.
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a great experience, from helping customers weather it was a small task or a large task, to filling in stock on the shelves. I also have cashiering experience to help customers more than just on the floor picking out there materials. And even helping customers over in tool rental"
good,"paint is a fun area and easy"
good,Unloading the supplies from the back of the trucks onto the cart and then stocking the shelves as well as helping people who have questions and need help finding things.
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers and providing great customer service. Customers will need assistance in locating products and services in the store. Maintaining a neat, organized, and in stock department is very important. There is a team atmosphere, and coworkers get along well."
good,"Good family atmosphere. Very slow at times. Too many workers, not enough hours for part timers. Yet constantly hiring. They like to promote but takes a long time to get full-time or advancement because so many transfers there and most people don't leave their full-time positions."
good,Asking for certain times off can be a challenge.  Some managers understand health problems and some think why are you working if you are getting handicapped.  A person usually has to work until they can afford to be off for their surgery or whatever medical need they have.  Who pays the bills?
good,If you did a good job things were great.  Not too many places give you paid time off for part-time employment.  This was a second job so they worked around my full-time job hours too.
good,"Evaluated inventory stock."
good,I work with the customers and management to assist the customer complete their projects. The management has changed a lot but they have all be impressed with my customer service skills.
good,"Great working environment . everyone is very friendly, and welcoming. the job is amazing and easy . Very diverse working environment . i could stay at this job forever"
good,This position provided a great opportunity prior to having a medical issue which prevented me from continuing with the company.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to work here.
good,"Home depot, you can always learn something, somewhere. You don't have a rotating shift or stability on days off. It's completely random. For a month you could have a Friday and a weekend day off and then close every Saturday and Sunday and get a Tuesday and Thursday off."
good,This job will truly depend on store to store as to what exactly management is like. The Company as a whole wants to take care of its associates and customers they say it and mean it. They want to take care of their community
good,On a typical day is very fast paced...I come in and unload the truck...which is timed..only get a few hours to unload...sometimes we don't have enough people to unload...we are supposed to have 6 people to unload...we only have 3-4 people....that makes it hard to get done on time...
good,I enjoyed my time working at Home Depot overall the management was great. All the associates were nice and friendly. The work environment was great but It was only part-time.
good,Good coworkers but the front end supervisor and some of the ASMs are blatantly awful to work with. Constantly being talked down to and blamed for the smallest things. Also if you live in the area the pay is definitely not worth the stress. Avoid this position if you can.
good,This is a great place to start your career especially if you are looking to advance rather quickly. It is a friendly environment and the company genuinely cares about their employees.
good,Lack of proper staffing creates additional work for others. The service desk is always busy. The amount of return items is difficult to keep up with. Most of the workers are helpful.
good,"Hard to find qualified employees which live in the area, employees living out of the area have hard time affording a living with hourly wages offered."
good,"Very enjoyable and fast paced. Would not have left. If family issues had not arrived and I needed more time of than my manager could allow. My family issues are resolved and I look forward to working for Home Depot again. If given the chance,"
good,"I worked a night shift job, requiring little to no customer interaction. New assignments were issued with each location requiring a lot of learning and adapting. It was a physically demanding job. I enjoyed it, but I know its not for everyone."
good,"It was a great first job for someone who is in school. The employee's are good to work with, the management staff is okay. They balance your schedule well if you have other things to do outside of work."
good,"For the most part, working at Home Depot was an enjoyable experience. They provided in depth training for the department i was working in and gave me everything i needed to succeed at my job. I started work as a cashier and was promoted to aisle associate within the month. From aisle associate, I was promoted to flooring sales specialist within two months. The coworkers are my store were very welcoming and i got along with everyone there. The only real downside was that the store would often times be understaffed. The lack of employees and volume of customers who needed help would lead to stress some days, but it was still manageable."
good,"Enjoyed working at Home Depot especially the associates. We all worked hard but had fun until new management came in and turned place upside down."
good,"I learned a little more about customers and their needs at this job. The hardest part about working is the fact that there aren't that many hours given due to the amount of younger workers applying for the position I'm currently in. As well as the advancement of technology, self check-out stations are soon being placed inside the facility and workers, I feel, will soon be let off due to this unfortunate occurrence."
good,"really enjoyed the job, managers and department heads did their best to accommodate multiple personal issues i was dealing with. mostly simple tasks that are easily understood."
good,"Great Company to Work for,it just need a little bit more of Organization To work as a Team starting with Management Supervisor, And Stuff members. to Drive a Better Customer Service!! Good Schedule Flexibility,Good Benefits."
good,Great place to work but sometimes you feel like a minnow in the ocean. The SSC (headquarters) is about a happy and healthy employee but likes to keep you captive.
good,It’s a very good place to work. It’s mostly people who are in college or retired veterans who are all very down to earth people. Very fast pace. Overall it’s enjoyable
good,"Home Depot was a good job with good benefits. It is a really big store, but once you know it is easy to localize anything. Work environment is comfortable to work in"
good,Home Depot was a good place to work only issues were the hours. Besides that it was an enjoyable place to work. If I had gotten more hours there I would have stayed.
good,It ain’t a bad place to work.  Just don’t have great benefits.  If they had better benefits to give you more time with your family and contribute more to the 401k everything would be better.
good,"With over 400K employees @ 2200+ stores, HD manages (from a front line employee perspective) to generally satisfy both customers and workers... not perfect but a good try.  Trying to cope with the 'new retail' of the Internet...and a very tight labor market.  "
good,"Overall good place to work. Great people and opportunity for advancement if you are hardworking and plan to make a career out of it. If you are a full-time employee the benefits are awesome, part-time has a few benefits as well."
good,"Managers and coworkers always made sure that the task were fullfilled and that the workers were hydrated."
good,"On a typical day you would handle customers and stock the shelves. The management is very good at helping with any issues you might have. Everyone works together to make sure store is clean, stocked and customers can find everything they need. The least enjoyable part is the lack of pay for the amount of work you do."
good,"Good place to work, pay is not where it needs to be for the work that was required.Enjoyed working with the customers and the day to day operations of the job."
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers with daily needs,organizing products on the shelf, and retrieving the product a customer would require assistance with a forklift. The workplace was a corroborative work space with other employees, where the entire store would work together to solve problems for customers entering the store. The hardest part of the job was to let a customer know that we either didn't have the product they were looking for or we had just ran out of the product that they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of working for the Home Depot was interacting with customers daily as needs could vary from day to day."
good,i like the enviroment and the people customers respected your opinions and appreciated the help in a majpr way that made you smile and feel like a job well done
good,I feel I am worth more than what they’re paying me for the jobs that I perform and the skills that I provide for the company Home Depot is great with flexibility for my schedule but I would’ve loved for the income to work for me while I work for the company
good,Hours could be a bit more predictable and consistent.  Could improve on locating products in overhead management.  Company is big on making sure store is safe environment for staff and customers.  Staff is friendly and helpful.
good,"I spent only a few months with the company, but I definitely noticed that the long time workers around me seemed to be happy with their jobs. The environment was very friendly and the company seemed to take notice of hard workers."
good,"Alright job"
good,Great high school job. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get involved in the work force. Loads of opportunities for all back rounds. They work around school as week
good,It was a great experience mostly . Peer are so respectful and willing to help any one . Most supervisor are supportive and caring . Over all great job
good,"First year was great until I transferred stores, management is a make or break. Overall great work environment and co-workers are like family. I would recommend it but be careful"
good,"Hard, busy work.  Most customers were very nice and some even helpful when helping other customers.  Everyone liked working as a team no matter what job title you had or they had in the store.  Nice place to work."
good,"I worked at THD for a year and really loved my job at first. That was until I realized that there was some bias towards, could be unintentional, towards promoting associates for full time. "
good,"For me a typical day at Home Depot is just getting buggies, and helping customers load your typical 9-6 job. When working at the Home Depot i have learned to better strengthen my customer service. The managers at the Home Depot are pretty chill and make sure everything is going according to plan in the store including the store managers. The hardest part working at Home depot is on the weekends when it gets incredibly busy. The most enjoyable part is just being able to get my job done and go in different departments and help and learn different things."
good,"Working with the public can be stressful, will need to learn to de-escalate various situations. Management always willing to back up your decisions. Most of management lets you make own decisions."
good,"Part time work. I started in professional sales and moved to customer plumbing sales.  Helping customers after major storms in Baton Rouge, LA. Showing new products"
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot. Again, I worked in the Garden center and we also backed up the Electrical Dept. which I felt OK doing. Every department backed up the one next to them. They also posted your work schedule 3 weeks out. Or course, you had to make time off requests in advance of the schedule being posted. Co-workers were always very helpful, even from other departments. The culture was more liberal than Wilco and I felt more comfortable there. They had 5 store assistant managers and a supervisor for each department. My supervisor was very unpredicatable and you never knew what mood she was going to be in day to day. She was eventually let go. This is a good company."
good,"Great people, great company, flexible hours. Tons of training resources available, everyone is helpful and so nice. loved my time working at the Home Depot"
good,retail customers are very needy. pay is low and raises are less than 4%.  job duties are different every day.  mostly people call out sick alot and other associates are forced to do jobs of 3 people
good,"Too many changes being made over the past 9 months to corporate policy. They do not give good communication for the new changes and expect everyone to assume we all know about it. Love who I work with, with exception to a few bad apples. Some managers will write you up for anything and everything. One major issue, if you get written up, it stays on your employee record for 6 months. You are not able to transfer, change, or try to move positions, or switch from part time to full time, until that record falls off. I keep trying to get full time, and when I have a chance, I get written up for things that do not exist. This is what I do not like about the company. They want to you excel, but will write up for anything and everything, whether there is proof or not of some wrong doing."
good,"Home Depot is a great Work place to work with also they have a great work culture, the people there are great to work with and people help each other when needed."
good,Nice place to work just wish I didnt have to wait 6 months to advance. The profit sharing was a excellent perk. People were very friendly and easy to work with
good,"There is really not much I can say about the company because it was only seasonal for me. However, during that time, I did enjoy my peers. I also enjoyed interacting with the customes ."
good,"The people are what make working at Home Depot great. Home Depot strives to hire people who are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Chances for advancement are easy to come by if you work hard but the hours for department heads and managers are terrible, which meant I didn't want to advance."
good,Working at Home Depot can be a great opportunity to learn new skills. I worked there for about 3 months before I was promoted to head cashier. There’s a good mix of people at the Home Depot.
good,"It is a good job to get some better knowledge of basic skills. Your department supervisor can really make or break how you enjoy working. Low yearly raises. Usually short staffed and you can be left alone in your department very early on with little knowledge. Benefits package is good for full-time, and somewhat decent for part-time."
good,"I would recommend working at Home Depot. I work part time and receive accumulated personal time off and paid vacation time. "
good,"I have been currently working with Home Depot for about one year and five months and at first I absolutely was loving the job. After I got moved into the paint department and things started to get a little more fast-paced and you start learning more more about other departments. After I got moved on to the service desk I started to learn more about online orders and handling customer questions and solving problems.  Over time things start getting more stressful especially in the paint department, sometimes you’ll be scheduled by yourself on very busy days and you can’t seem to figure out how you’re going to get everyone’s orders in and get them done on time. Besides that it’s a pretty good job and a first time job for most people as well. Management and coworkers are always super nice and always eager to help whenever Someone needs it regardless of the department they work in."
good,"A lot to learn. I don't quite feel prepared to run solo, but I have been put in a position to do so. I like the associates and the managers. The managers and associates are personable and supportive."
good,"My position was as a cashier. A typical day would be talking and checking in with you head cashier or department supervisor, and you get placed at different areas in the store where they had cash registers, based on your strengths. Learned how to better effectively diffuse an escalating situation, there is a fair share of difficult customers. The management is all friendly and inviting, and you can feel that they genuinely care about your well-being."
good,I feel some of the managers at the time could have been a little nicer to the customers and could have worked with the employees better. Usually wasn't in the same area when working during the spring and summer months.
good,"I enjoyed stocking and replacing, making, and checking prices. The hardest part of  the job was trying to figure out what contractors, painters, DYI customers, etc. were looking for."
good,"Good benefits for just being part time, and good pay including bonuses and holiday pay. Weird work culture due to big age gaps between employees but great hours."
good,The jobs there are demanding so if you can't handle fast paced or dealing with customers this job will not be for you. There is always someone needing help so you need to be able to deal with customers. Management is iffy some days but it gets so busy that they can't possible deal with each and every issue as soon as it arises. If you work hard you do get compensated but if you call out a lot or just poor attendance this will not be the job for you!
good,"The culture among employee's is very nice, most people are willing to help you and teach you. Its a lot of person to person contact. You don't have to know the store but at least who can get the information the customer needs."
good,it is a good job for sure it pays good and there is a lot of opportunity honestly it is a good job if you are not a cashier because if you are a cashier you have very little chance of switching departments and trying something different.
good,"The pay is good but as you move up there is less chance for you to enjoy it. Home Depot is like College, you get what you put into it. "
good,Learn the best way to interact with customers. Learn the product. After that you will do just fine. Everyone has a role of making things work so just do your part and you will succeed.
good,My time at Home Depot was good and bad. When management did not have to worry about going above and beyond it was fine. When something did not go as planned it became stressful
good,I loved many of the years with a great management team. Then they moved them around and the new management was a joke. They did not follow the values I had come to love. I learned a lot while I was there and made many friends. I'm grateful for my time however I wish the district and corporate leaders would pay attention and listen when all the employees are complaining. That is disheartening.
good,"Nothing to say, it's retail. You know how you get treated.  Some of the management was not very good, and lots of people got tired of being treated like dogs."
good,when I first started I was poor at the job and took time to get used to working there but they took thier time and got me used to the position and what was exspected Its hands down the best place ive worked at so far with just over all fairness in thier policys and the way they treat thier employees or might have just been my manaver that was like that but whould love to work thier agine If given the opertunity.
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot, however I was offered a better opportunity at Rapid Response monitoring (increased salary and more benefits) and decided to advance my career with them."
good,"Working at Home Depot was a good experience. I developed customer service skills and knowledge of the construction industry. Many of the employees are unmotivated which can be frustrating, but if you are willing to work and enjoy helping customers , this is good place to work."
good,Not a bad place to work part time for extra money. Nice co workers. Paid personal time. Great customers. Enjoyed my time there. Relocated to another area and different job.
good,Working at the home depot can be fun but stressful. Work life balance is hard to maintain due to stress that can sometime be required to have long term tasks completed
good,For me a typical work day was one that had a steady flow of customer to assist. I enjoy working with people and helping them to fulfil their desired reason for visiting on that day and if everything went well not only would I help them with the project of the day but pave the way and help them with their future projects. I gained a lot of product knowledge and some computer programs. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my regular workload while assisting 1-3 additional departments due to lack of coverage.
good,"Okay company to work for. Would recommend to work there part time but not full time unless you want to be promoted within the company. The benefits are great. Home Depot offers associates discounts, 401k, stocks, and bonuses."
good,Product knowledge is key to working at Home Depot. Training is given but does get easier once working for a while. The managers are real easy to talk to if in need of anything. Working around your scheduled is a little difficult if full-time  but they will try their best to help you if they can.
good,"Loved the job but the management is pathetic. HR’s, Supervisors, And managers are very friendly at first but overtime became very unprofessional. Got Fired for not being able to reschedule my doctors appointment resulting me having 10.5 points which where the termination is proceeded. HR’s said one thing about the FMLA and says another thing the next day. Supervisor was never comprehensive. Manager gets an attitude for no reason. Unprofessional management."
good,"mejores horarios, y una capacitación mejor a los líderes"
good,Good place to work. The employees are all very friendly and easy to get along with. I worked in both shipping and receiving and as a cashier. I enjoyed both. They both have their own stress factors but if you keep a level head you can get past the problem and have a great day.
good,"in the Airdrie location i never actually had a bad experience with the supervisors or managers in the store, the workload was always reasonable, while the hours may have been less than stellar, it quite possibly the best part time job i ever had."
good,"For a cashier you get paid very well at The Home Depot. The job is very simple and the most that is asked of you is to sell sell sell credit card applications to everyone. "
good,"The HD strives to keep it's associates happy, their families, assiciates and customers safe and are always teaching their employees how to do better at their jobs. They offer chances to move to other departments throughout the store, but hours are limited unless you are willing to work whatever they offer. No overtime for part-time or full time employees for the most part unless it's necessary as sometimes turnover is high and then those that are established employees have to pull in the extra hours until new hires are trained and working on the floor which takes quite some time from the interview process through the training to actual working on their own. But they always strive and stress the core values on a monthly basis through continued computer training classes and keep everyone up to date as to what is happening with the store, so for the most part it is a good place to work, but the wages are lacking and many feel it's just not worth all of the training and things they go through to stick with it."
good,"The people including most of the management were great.. When the new District Manager came things changed for the worse.. There really was too much pressure to get credit cards, leads,pro extra, etc."
good,"Good place to work, but be ready to put 100% effort in. The most challenging part is dealing with difficult customers but if you have any experiencing in customer service you won’t have a problem"
good,My experience as a store sign artist or sign maker was most enjoying job I ever had had because I'm a talented artist. I won for my syore most of the awards in our store walk inspections.
good,I worked there for 13 years. I started out as a cashier and than went over nights because I needed a second job so I could live. I was not making enough to pay all my bills. I got hurt on the job and was out on fml and when I got back from leave they told me I could no longer work over nights I was put into garden and that was the only place I could work. When new hires were getting hired they started making more money than I did after being there for 13 years.
good,"Lots of fun here! Though they never used me to my full potential. I had worked previously for Home Depot, so knowledge of a lot of areas. Need to make sure they provide water to staff outside during hot spring/summer times."
good,i work as part of the MET and i used to like it some times because it gets boring if you keep doing it over and over. The culture was fine no problems if u keep your life to your self.
good,"I worked here in high school and it was a good experience. If you do your job you won't be micromanaged, if not you most likely will be or won't last long."
good,"I never had a problem at the Home Depot until I was trying to promote to assistant manager. You had to take a test. I took their test it was a three part test. I scored really high in two of the three areas. Three weeks later I was called to the store mangers office with the allegation that I cheated. He asked if I would take it again. Sure I said, scored just as well as before, but was never promoted."
good,"Not a bad place to work for. I am a positive individual, so attitude helps to enjoy anything you do in life. The problem with the job I had as a measure technician is that you put a lot of mileage on your vehicle, wear and tear was harsh (35,000) in one year, driving through tough terrain sometimes. I bought a regular cab Tacoma for this job, but the pay is not enough to keep up with the maintenance and wear and tear of any vehicle. As rich as Home Depot is, they should provide small trucks (Old Ford Rangers), so personal transportation is not destroyed in some of the areas serviced."
good,"This was an excellent organization with some advancement opportunities. Pay was so-so, especially for the area resulting in a higher turn over rate among the associates."
good,"freight employee "
good,I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with but the manager's attitude was as if I was a nobody because I was just temporary and everyone else was hired on.
good,"I worked at home depot during college, they worked with my school college. I learned a lot about home improvement while I worked there and it helped me out in life after I left."
good,Other than feeling as if your always working alone in your department the training offered is very well structured and detailed. Very strick on safety and catious of what could happen with no hesitation of  thinking of how to prevent and cenerio of injury.
good,"A typical day for me would look like first, walking each idle in my department making sure they were clean and presentable before we opened the store. If the idles were dirty I had about 30 mins before the store opened to get the idle organized. After that was done I was given a list of goals my department manager wanted me to accomplish before my shift was over. I would began working on the goals while also assisting customers with store items, or getting items that were stock up on the overhead of the store in my department. I learned early on that I didn't have to figure things out on my own fellow colleagues would help assist me whenever I had a question about something. Which taught me the value of teamwork, so I could help others when it was my turn to assist them. I also learned that management was very consistent with explaining to us the weekly goals for the department, which show me the importance of being a manager and leading a team. The hardest thing about the job was knowing where each item was in the store, without looking at my store item finder on the device I was given, The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers, and giving them a great customer service experience while shopping at homedepot."
good,"If you want to excel in your job and work hard for it, this is the place to do it. You are always recognized for your hard work. Management is fantastic."
good,For a single person or a student this is a great place to work. Not to raise a family. Frequent training provided great product knowledge and in return good customer support. The job was not hard at all.
good,"Wonderful Management and the work keeps you busy, there is never nothing to do...unless you work at a cash register. If you hate standing around, or you plan to steadily move up in the company, Home Depot is a great place."
good,The job was a fast paced but tedious in detail. Lower management typically was amazing. However the higher management tends to not care about the average person. Over all I enjoyed working here as long as higher management was not around.
good,"Everyone was amazing, helpful, and very kind. The work was very fast paced and there was rarely time for breaks. If you can't work hard and break a sweat, this is not the place for you."
good,"I always could go to classes since I knew my schedule ahead of time. Management encouraged my growth but my focus was more on school.  Management varies by store, so don't let a bad experience at one store stop you."
good,The people that you worked with and (some) for made it enjoyable. Tough to move up it is based on manager and how much you kiss up to the store manager.
good,"Great place to work at with wonderful friendly employees, except most jobs are only part time and I need full time work. Friendly customers but very fast paced on Saturdays. Management is very helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. You receive immediate recognition when you perform a good job that day."
good,Made many friends at home Depot developing great relationships with associates + developing product knowledge in different departments  in the do it yourself culture.
good,"It really wasn't a bad job at all. I didn't stick around long enough to move around, but there was the opportunity. It was also different from your average retail position, there was always something happening like little demonstrations, and it was a really good way to meet local contractors."
good,"I enjoyed working here.  I was a flooring specialist that included doing inventory, sales and customer service.  I also ran workshops for customers interested in laying their own tile."
good,"Overall, The Home Depot if a good place to work. It’s culture is a model for all companies to model after. Advancement is possible if you are positive. You can transfer to other stores in state or out of state. There is always a place for advancement."
good,Excellent work environment great management and customer service experience I would recommend everyone to shop there it a fun place they even have kids work shop
good,I think this company is a great place to work. I enjoyed working within the stores and creating such an amazing bond fellow coworkers and managers. I moved up with them and became very expendable. Not the type of work life balance I wanted but I did it anyway. I worked remotely from home and was a great benefit but found myself workin twice as much and affecting my family life. I feel the pay for the work performed should have been better but the benefits are very good. I still hold the Home Depot in high regards an amazing company. Just need to utilize all their training to better yourself and grow. Will always be home to me.
good,"My typical day started with checking for what deliveries and order I need to fulfill. I would prioritize them and fulfill each order accordingly. This often involves asking for help from other employees due to the need to use machines such as the Reach lift, Fork lift, electric ladder and others."
good,"It was a good experience to work for Home Depot. It allowed me to learn alot about home improvement and to work with others to fulfill customer needs. managment were good and the store manager was young and ambitious and a pretty good guy. hardest part of the job was the outside work, pulling orders, and the very fast paced weekends. most enjoyable was meeting good coworkers and quartely parties and bonuses"
good,"Picking products from shelves or inventory to complete orders. Staging the products and locating the orders depending on if being picked up by the customer or delivered by HD. Preparing deliveries for shipment via flatbed or box truck. "
good,"Really stressful place to work in, a lot of customers are very rude, when it came to ask questions about what to use for the house and what to buy. I provided the best customer service I could and they liked it bu my some did not."
good,I started as a cashier and moved to designer in 2 years. I found this is true for most long time employees.   Full time employees have set shifts.  Benefits are great.
good,"The atmosphere of Home Depot is generally pretty fun. You learn to get along with those in your department fairly well and build relationships with frequent customers (the PROs). Though it may be fun, it can be stressful at times during the retail holidays like Labor Day and Black Friday but that is to be expected from a retail job anywhere."
good,"the culture of customer focus and service is great and very admirable.  The management and leadership seem so focused on their own advancement and promotion, that they do not reach out to other associates to mentor, guide and build them up for future growth.  This is not everyone, but many."
good,its a good job to start with because you will learn a lot of skills and get benefits too if you stay long enough you can get full time. overall its a great company to be with.
good,"The home Depot is an excellent job to learn and grow in product knowledge and would be a great first job for anyone. Friendly competition, cookouts, bonuses , and prizes for achieving high marks. For part timers it's hard to get full time and would depend on your stores hour threshold."
good,"I really like working at the Home Depot.  Hours can sometimes be a bummer.  Some managers are good, some are not.  I left because of a manager.  Was a good pay for me."
good,Good working environment worked around my school schedule. Would get busy at certain times of the year and fast paced. Made work go by fast with lost to do
good,"Retail is retail so there's always something to complain about, but I had very few complaints at Home Depot compared to my previous retail jobs. Pay was quite fair for the different roles in the store."
good,"met very helpful managers, they willing to teach that I need, we all feel like family, sometimes we have a hard time with customers but we can able to fill their satisfaction."
good,Overall good place to work for. Pay could be better. Advancement seems to stall once your ready for salary positions. Tend to run lean on staff. Good place to start or as a filler job during retirement.
good,"I almost don’t even want to complain because i’ve heard some horror stories about other places, but there are things the home depot could improve on. "
good,"The first thing i learned at Home Depot was that even though you work in one dept, you need to be able to help customers in ALL departments"
good,Buena oportunidad cuando tenian medio tiempo daba oportunidad para terminar estudios me gusta que te hagan salir un poco de el estres cuando havian juntas y daban reconociemientos
good,"I feel as though The Home Depot was a great job and I would recommend it to anyone, they show great teamwork and leadership skills and it really is a place you can thrive."
good,Some departments are harder to work in and some not so hard. The people you work with will determine how happy you are. Management usually takes the customers side but not against associates.
good,"I enjoyed working there just that I needed more pay for the work that i do. I was building rankings, tearing bats down and putting them together, putting together all kinds of lights and wiring them for display. Also building shower displays for less money."
good,Many aspects of the job are enjoyable but too often the politics of the workplace interfere with day to day operations. The company has a great culture and has cultivated that over time but too long can cause someone to become burnt out.
good,"I enjoyed it. It was easy to get guidance from some managers, others I would avoid for help. Some people moved up without the proper experience, so it was a bit of a popularity game but I knew my job and what I was doing."
good,"My job was commission-only, in-home sales of high end closet and kitchen renovation products & services. Good opportunity for people with solid sales abilities. I was not a strong salesperson, and was unable to make a consistent living. The company provided the necessary tools (not Home Depot, but a Home Depot owned contractor network) to do the job, including weekly sales meetings to help with the sales process."
good,This was a very good place to start my career.  I was able to move up in position and take on increasing responsiblity.  Pay is pretty good for this industry.
good,"Good place to work if you have a propensity toward DIY and customer service.  It (like other big-box stores) gets a bad rap because they can be under staffed and sometimes hires young inexperienced employees with a poor work ethic or general lack of knowledge about items within their given department. That would be the oversight of management.  If you posses good DIY skills and imagination with the desire to help others complete simple projects or repairs and those with larger goals you will enjoy this work. If you like teaching, learning new things, building new skills and perhaps have the desire to go in a management trajectory, this is a great place to do that. Incentives, encouragement and support for further education and training for future growth within the company is heavily  promoted. I love home Depot. I'd rather receive a Home Depot gift card than one from a clothing store or restaurant any day. They virtually have everything for any project large or small and if they don't have it, they'll order it. Great experience."
good,"Management was very helpful and willing to step up an assist during busy times or when you had a question regarding customer service. Coworkers were great, Customers were friendly and nice to work with."
good,"You are empowered to take care of a situation yourself.  It can be physically demanding at times but their is always someone readily available to help when needed.  I love taking care of the customers and my fellow associates,"
good,"it is busy from the time it opened till  right before closing. I took returns(was at the service desk) also sales but the main job was to assist customers when they had ordered merchandise and came to pick up, processed on pc, made sure item was in, retrieved, printed out paper work to be signed by customer, gave customer copy, put our copy in file bin. processed returns/exchanges"
good,"I have worked at Home Depot for 6 years.  I work as a MET team member and not a regular associate."
good,"Worked for Home Depot for 2 years through many different Temp Services. Were very friendly and great place to work for as long you work hard. Expectations of a worker were fair and quality equipment to allow to perform smoothly and safely. As a  Temp was not provided benefits,but heard from hired on employees that they were good."
good,Working here gave me a great customer service experience. I was a manager there for 3 years and the company was great. They were good and promoting and keeping their employees trained. The workplace culture was embraced and the management was great. We had a great team at Home depot.
good,"Is very competitive environment that forces a lot of people to bend the rules to accomplish metrics, leaving work balance out the equation and I lot of politics"
good,"Honestly its different at every home depot but if you land at the right one, the can treat you like family. By what I've seen at the home Depot I work at, you have your friends and your enemies. Pick and choose your battles."
good,"A typical day in the RDC is very intense and fast paced. Requires significant attention to detail and lots of initiative. "
good,"The most flexible and understanding oppurtunity. Was able to develop multiple relationships within the work place, whether it be with customers, managers, or fellow coworkers."
good,nice coworkers with a tv in the breakroom. flexible breaks.the home depot did teach me about lumber and how to drive lift equipment. it was a great learning expierence
good,"The job is ok but I want further my career in the field that I went to school for in the medical field. I enjoy my job some days, it depends who's working."
good,a day at work is typically slow for me. i finish my work pretty fast then i just have to wait for more work until its time to leave. i work in the back office so its pretty secluded
good,Great company to work for with solid ethics. They take care of their people and work hard to give back to the community. They want to hear your feedback and encourage them to think outside the box to take care of the customer. The only draw back is you work long hours and have no work life balance.
good,"Product knowledge and great customer service will help you on the sakes floor, but on the other side which is down stocking and lifting you gotta be a strong individual who is dedicated and motivated to move around and move up. Only if the hourly pay was good for the heavy part of the job."
good,The culture is amazing and the values are reflected throughout the daily activities on the job. Leadership was good to me and the programs offered to employees really help in those times of hardship. Good place to work.
good,"Very fun place to work, coworkers are great and environment was great to work in and you meet a lot of different people working at The Home Depot can be relaxed at times"
good,"Place is decent for what it is. It has its ups and downs all said. Thankfully though, there is room for growth in this company. Just don't expect to get paid as much as you would with their competitors."
good,"I enjoy  working with everyone, it is like a family.  It takes me 45 minutes to get to work and when the weather doesn't co-operate, it is almost impossible."
good,"Cashier & stocker . Unloading the truck and putting away merchandise , also money handling meeting and greeting customers ensuring satisfaction. Loved this job"
good,Probably the best company I worked at. Other than the low pay rate it was a very good experience and great working environment. I have no complaints at all. Great starting job.
good,Great place to work and it has a family oriented environment. Flexible hours if you have another job or going to school. Great benefits and compensation for full timers.
good,Great Company to work for a very family oriented company. Ideal place to build your people skills and leadership. Many opportunities to invest but a little slow to promote in the company.
good,"best experience is learning how to communicate with customers and vendors. good working environment, co-workers are willing to help and assist. good mangement"
good,"Everyday was something new. Enjoyed assisting customers and building relationships with regular customers. Learned many skills related to construction and tools.Management was okay but didn't appreciate members as individuals just as a team.Hardest part of the job was defusing an upset customer, and the most enjoyable was helping people learn."
good,"In our specific store, there is a team effort and everyone gets along for the most part.  Customers will be customers, which is not the stores fault.  Managers come and go, some better ... some challenging."
good,I enjoy the home depot but my position soured my feelings because of miscommunication between mangers and workforce. I was part-time but was forced to do 30-40 hours a week and that wasn’t working for me .
good,Low pay for one of the top 5 retailers. Was paid $11 hr. If i stayed that would of been under the new minimum wage. From talking to other leads in the store the rate of advancement was slow as well .
good,Was a supportive and fun company to work for. I took another position because at the time was really in need of a higher paying job. Would apply again if given the opportunity
good,It is a good place to Work pay no  good 40 hours a week good benefits 401k medical dental plan vision I Work  from 5am to 2pm 2day off I get paid sick time vacation time
good,Enjoyed working with great customers but company lacked advantage for older workers to advance and thrive in today’s economy.  It was great having responsibility for safety issues and providing a fun place for kids to enjoy crafts.
good,It was a good experience for temporary job.  I would not recommend it as a primary job for someone with a family or a single income family.  Not a great fit for me at my level of experience.
good,I like working there other than a couple of co-workers the management was friendly and nice I still see some of the workers  they would do cookouts and ice cream for the workers
good,"I relocated and transferred positions from my previous employer. they had stepped me down to part time. For health insurance, I need full time so I took a large pay cut to come to home depot (even though the cost of living is significantly more). Anywho, the job is nice. coworkers are very welcoming. The new store manager is shaping up the store really well. Transferring from a similar position I haven't learned very much. I am currently applying for other positions within store to make up for the pay decrease. The hardest part of the job is the turnover of peers. a lot of people have cycled thru in this brief time, making everyone else pickup the slack. It seems to mellowing out and we're slowly becoming fully staffed."
good,Management for the most part is really laid back as long you are doing your work. The environment is really friendly and so are the customers. And you have the opportunity to advance if you want to make a career here.
good,The time I worked for Home Depot Distribution Center was good.  The managers and my coworkers were very nice and supportive.  Opportunity to advance was good.
good,"Great place for the target hirable demographic that the Home Depot survives on, retired folk that don't need money and just want something to keep them busy.  They pay just enough to survive and spout a lot of jargon and propaganda that sounds great until you've been there long enough to see through the facade.  Usually your fellow employees are pretty decent people, of course there are exceptions to that."
good,I genuinely enjoyed my time with the home depot it was a great learning opportunity. I enjoyed my co workers and management team. I believe the home depot is a good company to work for.
good,"They are flexible with scheduling and the store manager seems to really care about your education if you are attending college while working here. I enjoyed my coworkers and I get along with management. It is a very physically demanding job especially in order fullfillment. i walk on average 8-10 miles per 6 hour shift plus all the lifting. I do enjoy it, though at 40yrs old it is taking a toll on my body. If you don't mind manual labor it's a good place to work while going to school."
good,"The Home Depot gave me my first ever expirience and retail. I met a lot of amazing, talented and riven individuals who all enjoy working together for a common goal. The most enjoyable part of the job were definetely the way they treat the associates -- in terms of rewards and get togethers. Almost like company bonding. Hardest part of the job personally? Was my issues with scheduling."
good,"Nice place, just not enough hours to stay working there I would enjoy working there again if offered a full time job   enjoyed working with all fellow employees."
good,"Overall, I would say that my time at Home Depot has been a great one and it feels like a family atmosphere. The mission of the company is typically followed and I truly appreciate the willingness to help me with difficult customers or to help lift something heavy."
good,"Mostly, a receiving associate unloads trucks, counts product, and does various administrative tasks related to vendor returns and truck scheduling. There is a no mistakes tolerated culture, and expectations tend to be on the unrealistic side, however compensation tends to be more than fair. As almost all jobs in the retail sphere your managers will make your experience good or bad not really the company itself."
good,"Home Depot has great benefits. Work hours vary from day to day if desired,  however opportunity to specify availability exists. Very limited opportunity for advancement. Good leadership by management. Enormous amount of walking in certain departments."
good,"Very fast paced, you have to be focused and try your best to make sure you get done what is needed done. A spacious break room, two 20 minute paid breaks and a 30 minute unpaid break for lunch. Safety plays an important roll in the Home Depot."
good,I acquired many basic customer service skills that have helped me in my current life. I learned about the functions of retail and have been able to use that in other jobs. I did learn about home improvement which has helped some of my other interests.
good,"Always have assistance and team work from multiple departments, and cross training in several departments. I learned multiple areas such as head cashier, service desk, scheduling, vault and more which has aided in my career skill set."
good,The Home Depot is one to the best companies I have worked for. They are true to their mission and they really care about their employees regardless of their employment status. The environment was enjoyable and there was always room to learn new skills and develop professionally.
good,"Changing their 100% commission pay scale hurt all summer long, they have changed it back.My sales doesn't match my income do to an install manager forgetting about my area which lead to canceled jobs/sales. The management team worked hard to help with issues and communication was at a high level. I would stay with my Job if I didn't move 2 hours away. The same position isn't available to me in the Home Depot that is closes to me now. Its a great company to work for."
good,"Was a great place to work, accidentally overslept and lost my last point. Only issue was lack of loaders forced me outside when i had carpal tunnel in my left hand"
good,"The store I work in is pretty decent overall. Its not a bad place to work at while attending school, but I woulnt make a career out of it since I do not hace an interest working in retail. My job title keeps me busy and I like that since it makes the day go by faster."
good,"most everyone who works there smokes weed. always coming to work high. people sucked, never did their job. some of the people where really cool to work with tho."
good,I enjoy working as a bookkeeper however my degree and background of employment is in chemical dependency. I would like to offer my skills and education in this field.
good,"Good job for a high schooler to work as a cashier, etc. Not a lot of opportunities to move up within the company and salary is lacking as well. Great coworkers."
good,"The benefits are great but you have to work full time for low wages to get them"
good,"I enjoy helping others finish projects and solve problems. Some days are fast paced and others are slower, making every day different and keeping things fresh."
good,"A typical day at home depot in my department can be very difficult. I had to help many customers who need help finding the right Lumber, Concrete, Shingles, Gutters, and cutting lumber while also taking calls and answering people questions when they called the lumber department. I have learned many things such as being patient, Multi-tasking, Cutting wood, Learning different types of lumber, Concrete, and shingles. They work culture was good but could also used some improvement suck as other people in other departments, staying in their department and not coming over to mine to hang out. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to exceed my mangers expectations. He was very picky with how he wanted everything. The most enjoyable part of the job, was talking to all the customers about what their carrier, and what they are building. I have herd many stories and I like hearing them."
good,"you learn a lot working there from both your co-workers and your customers! overall it was a very good experience however the management id chaotic there is NO medical Absences or even doctors notes accepted, and the pay is not worth the about of physical labor  you are expected to preform, most people there are great people to work with! however sadly they do not have the highest moral regarding the store due them being over worked stressed with unreasonable expectations and UNDERPAID. I have maid many lasting friendships thanks to my time at home depot and I greatly value everything i learned there, however i would never opt to work there again."
good,"This was a great place too start out. They took a girl with almost no experience and hired her anyways. The management is great and does their best to take care of their employees. They are always willing to train people more and want you too keep working up in the company. They offer good benefits and options for a 401k. Also they are very accommodating when asking for time off. The environment is often very stressful however. Customers expect everything while they often treat you badly. Not too mention that you don't get the recognition or thanks often enough to make up for the stress. Another big issue is the lack of raise for going into one of the most difficult and stressful parts of the company: The Special Services Department. The scheduling was also an issue for me, it is never consistent and although the schedule is published 3 weeks in advance; you never know when or what days you will be working on that schedule. I have enjoyed my time at this company and appreciate them greatly, however this not a place I can stay at long-term."
good,fix the carts in the parking lot and also helped out other departments with different task. worked in the plumbing department and stock the shelves and helped out the costumers with questions on basic things.
good,"The communication between my manager and myself was not clear and often confusing.  I would be scheduled one place and then find out I was switched with another associate without any knowledge. Due to this confusion and the poor management style, I chose to leave this job for another job."
good,nice and friendly place to work at and once you know your department(s) its very easy to connect with the customers and help them with their projects.
good,"not enough hours in winter months, there was great leadership there."
good,it is a good place to work. you can't grow in this store because you have to no people if you know what i mean.........................................
good,"Awesome place to work, we was one big happy family, moved fast paced as a unit, supervisors was great left was great, benefits was great, the salary is somewhat mediocre. All in all nice company."
good,If you looking for a chilling place to work at. Night shift is a cool place to work. Everyone friendly and coworker work their stuff. Management is a bit...bad. But you can get by that you can easily enjoy.
good,Your pretty free to do what you wish they want as many people as they can on forklifts but they are really slow at getting you your raises unless you press it a lot
good,"Fun place to work, competive pay, nice people, close proximitiy, great customers.  Good hours, incompetent management, good products good services, good benefits"
good,The tasks I am expected to complete make me feel accomplished and give me opportunities to learn new things. The work environment has a family atmosphere and safety is valued.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in meeting random and some of the most amazing customers. Like for me I liked meeting the nice old people because I could be having a bad day and they would say the most nice humble things to keep me smiling. I learned a lot of from that store , learned how fun it is to work with some of my team membersand know new things about them , learned how to do deliveries. I was a fast learner so everything was pretty easy to adjust to. The working environment was very different for me I met a lot of new team members who came from different environments and they we’re truly amazing to meet. The most hardest part of the job was when they were like a bunch of customers on Line waiting to be checked out and they would only 3 cashiers including myself, because people would call out or whoever made  the schedules didn’t make them right where enough people would work when needed. I mostly felt bad for the customers because they would have to be waiting on line for so long but I was a fast worker so that was the best part for them . The most enjoyable part was when my shift was getting ready to be over and I was able to finally go home ."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers & working with knowledgeable associates."
good,"the flyer is the main task within the marketing department and the entire organization centres itself around the production of the weekly flyer."
good,Ok pay and full time work with rare overtime. A good manager makes or breaks a store. Good management harbors good associates and results. Poor management vice versatile. Definite room for advancement
good,If you have coworkers you enjoy the job is easy and fun. If you don't then problems arise cause teamwork is occasionally needed to have a stable pace. Otherwise job was okay and not bad.
good,"Rossford Home Depot is a decent place to work. All my coworkers are a great bunch, and very helpful. Management has a habit, though, of not being as supportive, and the company as a whole is on a schedule diet, meaning that if you're part time, your hours might vary wildly."
good,When you first apply you apply for a department you're interested in and that is what you get trained for only.  So you lack the knowledge of other departments.
good,I enjoyed my job. At times it was very busy and then we would have down time as with any type business.  Working at Home Depot was a very demanding but enjoyable experience . Made many new friends and meet a lot of nice people.
good,"Great company to start off with if your looking for a starter job no matter the position. Pay is fair, and customers are great. In all a great work environment."
good,"Once the doors are open for business anything can happen.  The store is constantly trying to maintain a customer friendly atmosphere.  However, that takes a lot of teamwork.  I learned many things from plumbing/kitchen & bath, building materials and hardware that helped me in rebuilding my first home.  Mfor the most anagement is mostly very supportive.  The workplace culture is a team oriented focus with customer service as the main goal.  However, anytime you have that many employees/personalities there are going to be some hiccups.  The most difficult part of the job was being understaffed as a major focus was put on minimizing labor hours.  The most enjoyable part was working with most of the people especially the one's that want to make the best of the time spent at work.  If you have to be there you might as well try to make the best working environment possible."
good,"I had that job when i was in Puerto Rico, it was only a part time job so i couldnt tell about benefits because i didnt have any. I quit because i moved to Texas ."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers (kind,rude) with anything they needed assistance with either finding a product or questions on a product and finding the right associate to help them further in needed to be. Also trying to promote setting a free in estimate on cabinet refacing making sure to make quota everyday. The hard thing is trying to help not only your customers but Home Depot customers and having to memorize not just one section but the whole store. You also do meet a lot of  interesting people and learn a lot on new thing and each location is a whole different crowed of people. You also learn how to have patients and learn how to read people and better understand how to help others in the future."
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,The workplace culture was excellent when I was there. The management promoted employees and it was an enjoyable place to work. I was able to learn a lot regarding leadership skills.
good,Good place to work as a hobby job. Management treats employees with respect. Interesting problem solving opportunities for customers. Hours are usually evenings and weekend.
good,"This job was great for pay and location, though the stress level is much higher and the large space makes for a more intense job. Some managers were great while others needed some work."
good,The Home Depot was fun to work at but also difficult. The only real downside for me was working nights and weekends but that comes with retail. Home Depot was good to me and they had a motivating work environment that rewarded those who worked hard.
good,"I learned a lot, but the hardest workers get taken advantage of typically. A lot of lift truck training, and a lot of unique experiences with much to learn."
good,"Employees were fun to work with and enjoyed my time with them, the pay is not very great and could help their employees by paying them more. Give good benefits to their employees"
good,Lots of standing and concrete floors.  The environment is what you make it.  Aim to be positive and uplifting....it is retail.  Happy customers; happy work environment.
good,"The Home Depot was very faced paced, which I enjoyed. I learned how patience. The management was awesome and there was a balance of diversity and workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was being constantly on your feet for hours at a time, but you get used to it. The most enjoyable part of my job at the service desk were the customers and interacting with them."
good,"Very good adaptation period. The middle level of job culture. Can pay more. Every co-worker tries to help you. When you are new."
good,I enjoyed the position with this company. Management team was supportive and enjoyed going to work. Only reason I left is they didnt have a part time position after I took a full time position with a nother company
good,"I have to imagine that working at Home Depot is similar to every other retail job, it is not a particularly mentally stimulating job.  When there are no customers the days tend to drag but when there are a large number of customers the day passes at a reasonable rate."
good,"A typical day in my department would have you dealing with customers, both happy and angry ones. We strive to resolve issues that a customer has as well as to help set up deliveries and will calls. I've learned how to best dissolve uncomfortable situations with irate customers. I'd say the hardest part of my job is just the constant bickering of others for you to handle and the most enjoyable part is when you have a few moment to just talk with another co-worker. Overall, The Home Depot is a really good place to work."
good,"The Home Depot prides itself with training and benefits. For every aspect of your job you are trained, be it on or off site. Flexible hours and  types of work."
good,great customers and ring up customers orders.keep my station clean and organize. answer customers questions. get customers help if i can not assist them.
good,Great work environment. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Hours are flexible great for a collage students or for those who are looking to advance into management. There are always places for advancement.
good,"its retail, lots of customers and associate interaction. lots of dependency with other departments, depending which one you work for. have to be able to problem solve on the spot"
good,"My schedule here was never the same except for days that I eliminated from my eligibility."
good,"a good place to work if you stayed busy which wasn't hard to do working the night shift, and you know where to stock when its being put ion the floor sometimes the unloader didn't place items in the right department"
good,working at the home depot was different everyday and fun. The employees acted more like family and worked well with each other. it was great opportunity to learn new and unexpected skills.
good,"THD is a great company to work for. I've been with the MET division of the company for over 4 years, most of that full time. In general, we set and maintain most products in the stores, including cleaning, pricing, building displays, as well as customer service. Most associates are incredible people that strive to bring out the best in each other and customers. The benefits THD offers it's employees are really amazing. One of the favorites is our ""Success Share"" program (profit sharing, basically). Twice a year, each individual store has a ""party"" to celebrate our hard work together, as a team. Another favorite is our ""homer fund"". It is a way we help each other. Just one part of this program allows employees the opportunity to donate money via payroll deduction or one time giving. This money goes directly to the associate in need. The best part is we help each other but, Home Depot also triples the donation before giving it out. There are all kinds of ways to save money and lots of resources to utilize. That being said, that division also needs more resources to continue to be successful. The job has changed, added many more tasks with little incentive or additional resources to succeed. The employees are the heart and soul and most work really hard and are dedicated to the company core values. They deserve to be able to make a real living, feeding their families and paying their bills. That is currently difficult to impossible for most hourly employees."
good,Great people but just wasn't enough to pay the mortgage. My hours were everywhere and I had to find rides to work when I couldn't drive myself due to one car in the family
good,It's a fun place to work thats usually pretty busy. Pay isn't to great and you work holidays and evenings.  There are no discounts but they do profit sharing which can turn out to be a decent amount sometimes.
good,"Not bad could be better, but every company has their flaws. Management could be a bit more understanding of what his associates go through on the day to day. Every associate should be held to the same standard not just night shift workers."
good,"A friendly working environment which also comes with a great management team. You get to learn a whole lot there, which also helps you to build you confidence."
good,"Cuida la seguridad de clientes ínternos y externos. "
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for.  There are plenty of opportunities for career advancement with the store you are working.  If you are a current assistant manager you would not be able to move up to store manager without relocating.  Home Depot is a fun environment to work in.  Most customers are generally happy because they are looking to do DIY projects and improve their homes.
good,"It's a high pace environment with a lot to learn. With the right leaders it's an absolute joy. However, can be depressing otherwise. The work itself is not too difficult, but requires motivation."
good,"Typical day of work can be stressful but not overwhelming."
good,"Hourly associates work any where from 12-40hrs per week. Salary Managers work 55hrs"
good,"Typical work day started at 5:00 A.M. and end at 1:30 P.M., during the day one would either service bays in the aisles, do projects, or assist customers with any questions they had. I learned customer service skills, how to meet customer's needs and how to manage time properly to ensure a task is done on time. Management of the store itself was done well, but the supervisor of my team specifically could have better, they took matters very personal and would take it out on those who opposed them. The workplace culture was very good, no one ever truly hated working there, but the hardest part of the job was having to ensure a project or task gets done when it is coming close to the end of the shift and customers stop you to ask you questions, customers come first of course so the task must wait but will still need to be done before you leave. That was overshadowed though by everyone that worked there, everyone got along and always had good attitudes, that was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot , my daily work detail  was to take inventory and stock our shelves, order merchandise, and merchandise our main display areas. and or Course water the plants. I also provided how to workshops to our customers."
good,Overall The Home Depot was a good place to work except for the base hourly pay and the pay raises were very low. The work environment was always good and was fairly disbursed among associates.
good,"Honestly, Home Depot is a great place to work at when you are a student. They are very flexible and help with also giving you hours around your schedule."
good,j'ai beaucoup aimer home dépôt le personnel est compréhensif et s'inquiet de notre expérience a l'emplois
good,"I enjoyed working for The Home Depot. I learned a lot about the departments I worked in, including skills I still use to this day. They were very team orientated and had some awesome policies including a company wide profit sharing bonus yearly."
good,There is always something to do in HD. Everyone is friendly except for the occasional grouchy customer. This is a great job if you're new to the workforce.
good,I learned a lot and gain a lot of home improvement skills. I made a some friends and a lot of good people. Home Depot always took care to make sure the work environment was good. Meaning safe and clean.
good,The home Depot has been a fair working environment however it seems that management has a hard time in dealing with toxic behavior and tends to take a very long time to deal with bullying and harassment in the workplace.
good,You have to be a team player. Work shift is set and nice paid holidays off. Shifts are 5am to 1:30pm half hour lunch Monday-Friday. Physical work and you will get dirty crawling around in and out of bays. Pay increases will never reach what the store side makes. Cart pushers and cashiers make more starting pay than MET team associates make.
good,"nice place to work, nice employees"
good,I felt that working there was not bad except the harder you worked the less they paid attention. I made alot of friends there which was good but their was still alot of politics there.
good,home depot was a good place to work. I learned a lot about installations how to create special orders. you can definitely leave with knowledge of home repairs
good,"My main role was to offer customer service while simultaneously making sure my department was ready for opening the next day. This included putting new freight away, front facing and replenishing product, taking trash to receiving, sweeping the floor, and making sure all the aisles in my department were clear of carts and products."
good,Has a lot of growth potential.   Able to go to various departments and learn various tasks and product knowledge. Very challenging yet rewarding.   Can sometimes be stressful.
good,I started out in the lumber department and was promoted to the pro desk for pro sales.i learned some much about sales building and contractors needs for projects I worked with a great motivating team and loved it!
good,Home Depot is a good company overall. However when you break it down to certain teams its where you lose your advancements. If you are on MET then you have rare to no advancement opportunities and if there are openings they only go to favorites. There is a lot of favoritism and if you aren't the favorite then you might as well be the worst employee ever. But overall the company offers great perks and does take care of its people.You have a fast paced environment and if you are a good employee you never have downtime so it makes the days go by quickly.
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot; get to meet and assisted customers. I have pick up my customer skill  while working at home depot. Also I have learned a lot about Hardware and Home improvement.
good,The hardest part of the job is fulfilling customers needs with under staffing in the evenings . There needs to be more staff in the evening when people are shopping not working .
good,"Tons of benefits and opportunity, however can be stressful and taxing on your physical, mental, and personal life/health, especially when you work full-time overnight."
good,"fast past learning. it was enjoyable to work there because of the people. you have to put in your part to learn more than one thing. develop more than one specialty like pluming, floors and hardwood"
good,Like any job there are ups and downs many specific to your location. But Home Depot as a whole is a decent company to work for though it can be a lot of work at times.
good,"I love Home Depot because they work with your hours as a part-time employee, and the nice customer/contractors you meet. There is nothing like an employees discount."
good,The work itself is not too difficult once you figure out what needs to be done. However hours are not always set and management can sometime contradict each other to the point of slowing everything to a halt. Also work load depends entirely on the season.
good,"Good training programs, everyone was easy going. very safe work environment. Had some very good managers but had couple who needed more training. Great co-workers to work with"
good,The job within itself was great. Working in the garden department is always night if you have an admiration for the plant life. However once you take a deeper look into the management you see that it's not as structured as it could be but other than that it's a very good company and they work well with your schedule.
good,"I got a small pay raise after being hired on for over a year and they even let me keep my pay when I transferred to Texas. The hours were good, but the work wasn't easy and sometimes the tension in the air with co-workers was thick. Not a bad experience though."
good,"Where I work is a good location. Everyone gets along well though like any batch there are one or two sours. Customers by norm are good with the occasional bad ones that really test ones ability to maintain sense of professionalism and composure. As a con on occasion there may seem like only 8 associates in the whole store. This tends to annoy customers wanting help and overworks to frustration the available associates. Otherwise always new products and lots of services some associates and customers are unaware of. The hardest part is meeting the demands of 4 to 5 customers at one time. The most fun is talking with customers and other associates that are lively, intelligent and entertaining."
good,Over all this is a fun job. You learn a lot about the products in the department(s) you work in and it's fun to help people figure out solutions to their project issues.  Management is generally pretty good and tend to be flexible.
good,"Best thing about THD is the people, coworkers and customers. A typical day revolves around managing your department and helping customers. There are specific duties required depending on the shift your are on.  Shifts typically rotate. Additionally you will most likely working for secondary departments as well"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buena filosofia de trabajo...empresa incluyente y capacitaciones constantes."
good,"I love my job at Home Depot, but I need more hours and that’s just not something my store can do right now. It’s a very friendly place with great people, it’s just not enough to support my family."
good,"Great company to work for with great morals & Values. Always in it for the customer and the military. Isn't a single time that one could say that the store level associates, online support staff weren't in it to enhance the customer experience and the overall value of good old customer service to someone either in the stores or out in the neighborhoods through their Community service programs."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work if it's the only type of job you can get. I would say that it can be hard to get full time though. You do get decent benefits but you only get a few as a part-time associate.
good,"Its a wonderful job for a person who is retired.  My day is -"
good,Overall friendly place to work you learn a lot about construction plumbing and much more. Its great because store associates work well together with vendors.
good,Home Depot has some amazing benefits. However they just recently changed their labor module so if you are not full time you can expect to only get between 18 and 20 hours a week.
good,I had the best experience that helped me become better at jobs after working for HomeDepot. customer care goes hand and hand both in private sector as well as retail. the ability to advance is strictly in your own hands.
good,"The company was a great company but they didnt take care of their employees as they stated. I was due for a raise at 6 months and 1 year and received both. However, when my son's mother passed away, I needed day shift instead of graveyard shift. They did not cooperate with my situation so I found new employment with day shift hours."
good,"Working there was  a lot of fun and I learned alot.The people i worked with were very nice, alot of customers were regulars. Fun activities made the days go  faster."
good,"The culture of Home Depot is diverse and inclusive. All walks of life are welcomed and the company strives to mirror its community it serves. The customer at the Home Depot is top priority and the associate is the impetus of customer service at all times. Home improvement skills are learned as well as problem solving and working as a team to complete projects. Nepotism is encouraged and favoritism occurs, however strong relationships are made. Work-life balance is poor in that much of your life is sacrificed for the company.  At times there are managers that are really good and knowledgeable and sometimes they are completely not fit for the position. There hardly any task that is difficult if one chooses to learn and the best part of the job is knowing that one can personally make a difference in the life of someone else."
good,"No day is the same working at The Home Depot. Every day brings challenging new experiences and new learning experiences as well. Working at The Home Depot, by providing customer service and helping customers achieve their projects, you also learn how to be handy yourself."
good,"I have enjoyed working here for the most part. My coworkers are all pretty much very nice to work with. Managers are okay as long as you do your job.  They really don’t bother you at all unless you are good at opening credit card applications, otherwise they don’t notice you. Being a cashier here is very easy, and enjoyable I really like seeing my customers everyday!"
good,"Duties included unloading delivery trucks and trailers, relocating and placing merchandise, operating powered lift equipment, and maintaining a safe and clean work environment."
good,tuve experiencia nuevas como manejar montacargas y gruas aerias
good,"Only worked 4 hr shifts stocking shelves for what I had to do it wasn't bad at all, just unload the truck run the product to each aisle and stock the shelves"
good,"Customer Service, Cashier, Head Cashier managed the Cashiers, good the Cash drawers ready each day. Worked with Paint. Stocked Cleaned, Open and closed store."
good,"its a good place for students to work during school, theyre flexible with scheduling, not a good job to live off of. they give bonuses 2 times a year."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to get back into the sale field, staff is nice very friendly always willing to help and teach you what you need to know. They have training classes every month."
good,"Hours were good, they had once a month where they catered and had a huge party, It would get very slow during hours and they would still expect you to get a 95% or more for loading when they was literally no work to do."
good,"This is a job that required hard work and to keep the job you need to stay busy and complete projects.  The wage is poor for store associates, but it is the prevailing wage in Durham, so it is what it is.  The other associates tend to be friendly and I enjoy working with them.  The managers are friendly and tend to be supportive if you request unpaid time off for legitimate purposes such as family, health and unpaid vacations.  There are few benefits for a part time assoicate but this is also the seeming standard in Durham."
good,"There aren't full time positions available, so the compensation isn't really much to be considered livable but as a teen, it'll be good. So, if you need a job & a livable wage, you'd have to get a second jobs, which they'll gladly work around your schedule."
good,Home Depot is one of the best places I've worked at. Everyone did their job in a timely fashion and helped their colleagues. I learned more about tools and how to better my communication skills. I would say the hardest part about my job was loading heat pressured 16 by 16 posts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the possibility of advancement.
good,The store I currently work at is definitely a great place to work. Every associate is friendly and they all help each other out. My only complaint is that sometimes the management can be a little unreliable and staffing is usually very problematic.
good,"Fast paced work environment with customers and forklift machines."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work to gain warehouse and fast pace training. You will learn a lot about construction products and home improvement.
good,There is always something to do even when you are not assigned a specific task. Management always values customer service and teaches good examples of how to work a sales based job.
good,"I've been with Home Depot for many years through many changes through many managers company usually stays the same however lately it is making a big transition that most people are not happy with, it changes their work-life balance."
good,"Home Depot is not for the faint of heart or lazy.  It is hard hones work.  The compensation is not skills based, however they gladly take advantage of extensive skills by promoting their old values of hiring experienced contractors."
good,excellent company to work for. definitely allowed advancement. management was a bit unprofessional. Needed to pay attention to the employees more as far as whats needed to make the work environment a little better
good,Open minded person of execution with an acute learning agility. Able to communicate effectively with superiors and subordinates alike. A natural team builder able to build “esprit de corps” in the organization. Great affinity in all areas of technology to help achieve the most productive experience for both the clients and the firm in an environment that is conducive to personal and professional growth.
good,Like title. It all depends on the crew and your managers at the store that will determine your overall experience. Customer side is the same across food and retail.
good,"good day usually, i got to work meet my coworkers. we get doing the straps on the trucks each person a truck. i throw the straps over the trucks then tighten them"
good,"Good company and good place to work, the benefit is OK only."
good,"the best part of the job was the cool co-workers, The hardest part of the day is the stress levels to get things done Depending on store management is fair"
good,"If I had to open the store which happen quite often,  I would have to make sure all the till were ready for our cashiers and the service desk.  Make sure we had all opening employees.  "
good,"Friendly associates, very active environment. The customers are professionals mixed with many DIY doers, it made my job even more interesting. Being in the paint department, not only was it a task but, constantly changing. Color mixing made my job fun."
good,Home Depot is the only company I have worked for that offers the benefits that they do and take care of their people. Their motive is taking care of each other whether it be employees and or the customers. They give back in the community and always have an open for policy.
good,"The working environment was always fast paced, having to make sure that everyone was checked out and ready to go. The managers where nice and always checking up on us and asking how we where doing. Everyone knew everyone so that was a plus"
good,I really enjoyed the work I did at the home depot . As well as the team I worked with.  I liked being a team player.  And wanted to go to work every day.  I was happy with the pay I was receiving at that time.   My mangers were very helpful. And fair
good,A great job for college students and retirees. The management is all way ready answer any questions you may have. The corporate officers will come down hard on you even f you  make a minor mistake.
good,"I am a hard worker, very productive, gets tasks done quickly, always helpful to customers and or associates, Will ask questions if needed help, will also answer questions if it helps a customer find what they need"
good,"Employees are over worked, stressed to make company profitable, and lack team concept. Employees are not willing to assist one another due to low personnel at times. Customers are not assisted enough due to low personnel on property. Learned to operate lift equipment, operate computer equipment, safety responsibilities and failures.  The most enjoyable part of the business was having satisfied customers and being able to complete duties while providing  superior customer service."
good,The Company has a great culture of taking care of their people.  In return the expectation is for you to be highly productive.  The Benefits that are provided will out way the stress that they put on their managers and associates.
good,This is a great place for advancement if you don't mind moving and could care less for consecutive days off. ASM's seem unhappy and overworked. A new labor model has been initiated. It is too early to see how it will affect the work environment.
good,The people here are great! but they do not pay very well. This is a great place to work if you are a college student trying to make ends meat while enrolled.
good,"Honestly I really liked my experience working here. Everyone treats you like family and they aren’t affriad to help you out. If you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty or work with your hands, this place is right for you. There will be times when you will be asked to work on your own or in different departments, but don’t be afraid because they will teach you everything you’ll need to make your work experience simple and easy."
good,"There is a great ""Orange"" culture at the Home Depot that consist of the company taking care of their associates and the communities around the stores."
good,Home Depot is a really good company to work for unless your in my Measuring Department.  I had the worse manager in history plus he did not tell me the truth about my territory or responsibilities.  He was very absent in my needs and sent me to unsafe areas which he constantly said he would correct.  Home Depot would be perfect with the right manager.
good,Overall a good place to work when your in school but they're very unfair on advancement in the company because I was there for a longer period of time than other people and new comers that started in my same position got the job I desired.
good,"This company provides the opportunity to have a career and advance within that career, if that's what you are looking for. The culture is productive, yet fun, the company works hard, then they play hard."
good,"The job is fairly straightforward: check out customers as they come to the register.  There is also an extremely large emphasis placed on persuading shoppers to open up a Home Depot Credit Card.  Safety is a top priority at the Home Depot, and even part timers get health benefits to an extent.  The job itself is not too difficult or demanding. "
good,as anyplace there is stressful people who work there. Aside from everything else I would have to say my biggest complaint is how they select people for positions and who they choose.
good,"I worked as a part time sales associate in Lawn and Garden for 2 years. It was good for a year and then I started to really get tired of it, but that goes for just about any job."
good,Good job overall. Always stay busy and always things to do. Sometimes stressful but the reward for the wins are amazing. Love the culture and the employees.
good,like working with my fellow employees. Loved working with my customers and making sure they left the store happy and will return asking for me. And when they took the time to write on the survey their shopping experience.
good,With my experience at Homedepot.is a great place to meet. People.  and get to no customers.  I don't think management has a clue to what clerks that deal with customers.that outrage and disrespectful. For the pay that we get should be more.
good,"Basically, come to work, do your job, be on time, get out. If you are a young kid and need a job while you're in school go for it."
good,"I truly enjoy working at the Home Depot, sadly scheduling and management are inconsistent and untrustworthy. Otherwise, it's a good and enjoyable place of employment. The hardest part of the Job is standing on the cement floors all day, that really affects your knees and back. Everything else is common everyday light lifting and social interaction with customers. I love this because I am very customer focused."
good,"We would come in go put on our aprons and proceed to the receiving area. The night before our supervisor would let us now if we had a pallet load or a full truck to unload when we came in. Once in receiving we unloaded the trucks and put merchandise on carts to take to proper areas of the floor. It was great learning how to drive a forklift, electric pallet jack, and order picker. It was great seeing how big stores like Home Depot operate behind the scene. I was very proud to say I worked at Home Depot seeing how much some employees volunteered there own time to help others, like when we went to Houston to help get there stores back together. Being a part of the week was extremely special. The hardest part of the job was getting up on the order picker and storing merchandise in the overhead bens, merchandise that was over 60 pounds. But management was great, and the crew I worked with helped me learn all the equipment and fast and efficient methods to get the job done with the least amount of effort in the least amount of time."
good,"Nothing bad to say about Home depot.this job got me through college and I cant complain, the only problem was the pay. I was only there to pay for school, once i got half way done i found a job in my field. You can go far at home Depot if your willing to put in the time."
good,"Typical day at work  included working with associates across the country, facilitating and talking about our culture, customers - working through our challenges and celebrating our successes."
good,Good company to work for. Some good benefits. Good employees and associates. Convenient I live not too far from the company. We don’t get any discounts.
good,"Home Depot is a friendly environment that is fast paced and competitive. There is however little hours and it is hard to advance, it is also hard to count on the hours because they change day to day."
good,I like working here it's close to home and the people I work with are great. They did a great job when I had to go on maternity leave to have my daughter. The people I work with are all so friendly and honestly make my day when it gets super busy.
good,En general es una buena empresa pero por todas las actividades realizadas se requería un mejor salario
good,Good to interact with other people in this environment. many different varieties of people. relaxed environment. and much room to improve yourself and build character as an associate in the workplace. conducive to learning.
good,"I sometimes would work in departments to help them put up stock, I worked as a cashier I also helped train, new people that were coming to work for home Depot."
good,"A normal day would consist of Helping customers out, dropping down items from the overheads, and making sure to ask customers about the programs home depot has to offer."
good,I worked with The Home Depot for 2 years and I think I had it much simpler than many other associates. When you become close to management you can really talk about your schedule to them and they will do what they can to accommodate for you.This was very important and a huge reason why I stayed with them for 2 years. The main reason I left was because of the hard work environment and very heavy labor required to complete the task. Since I was one of the only overnight lift drivers during the weekend I had to be everywhere and do just about everything. This was very stressful and by the end of my shift I was overwhelmingly tired.
good,"Can work in different departments and easily advance in store. Always working customer service, making sure they find the items they need and ordering anything they might need. Down stocking and making sure product is on shelves and organizing the shelving and making it look good. Become very knowledgeable about home improvement and home maintenance. The environment is very fun to work in and the managers are friendly. Weekends get busy and job pace is much faster than week days."
good,the job is a good starting point for a career in logistic. the pay is decent for the work but it can be a little over board at times but its ok. even with that being said its better out there.
good,A lot of unorganized supervisor and management and too many changes to the environment of the work place and non where for the employees the environment
good,"arrived to work, corrected shopping carts to stock the bays, helped load and unload product at the loading bay, helped people with sod, and plant purchases,"
good,A typical day consisted of answering Customer Inquiries concerning the delivery date and time of their appliance; purchasing a major appliance; and contacting the service department to repair an appliance for a Customer.
good,A typical day at work consists of getting your station ready making sure it is clean and money is counted. Greet customers as they enter and direct them to the appropriate section of the store to meet their needs. Coworkers can laugh and talk as long as it stays appropriate. Most customers are pleasant and patient. The hardest part of the job is swing shifts and inconsistent scheduling. The most enjoyable part is the customers.
good,"The Home Depot provide training in every department and gave me the confidence to help customers. "
good,"Fast paced job. Management was not helpful, if you needed help. they gave you a work list that you had to complete while helping customers. You need get help from your department co-workers."
good,"Home Depot is a very laid back place to work, though it can be slow paced at times. Although, during the summer months the work picks up a little. Learned a lot about different household products."
good,Great place to work and really worth it and great opportunity to move up into salaried management in addition the success sharing very Christian .Im glad they do it
good,What kept me at The Home Depot was the job culture-- we're like a big family with great grandparents to young cousins lol. It's great to be able to work with the wise older group to the younger high school kids that you can mentor :)
good,I learned how to run a department while working at homedepot. I learned about every productin my department as well ad other departments. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as well as the customers
good,"Work very hard all week to get everything done. Worked extra hours but I was rewarded with salary increases, stock and bonus. Good Management focused with a good focus on employees."
good,"Received a lot of professional development in my time with the company, but to get ahead you really have to be a yes sir kind of person. Benefit package has excellent options but rate of pay means you have to be selective of the which benefits you can afford. Home Depot provides training for the position you are assigned to work and then will gradually cross train you for other departments to support the store."
good,"Great people to work with and around, awesome advancement opportunities to other departments including Supervisor and or Assistant manager roles at The HomeDepot"
good,I was given opportunity to advance then that job ended but there was no place at the time for me to go. the people that work there are friendly and easy to get along with. I still know some of these people today through facebook
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Great place to work full or part time. High passed, never a dull moment. Excellent place to practice sales techniques"
good,"I started out in the lumber run, but also helped in hardware, electrical,appliances, basically anywhere I was needed. I was certified on both forklifts and the reach. They were necessary for the unloading of lumber trucks, drywall trucks, concrete trucks and for loading up various vehicles as well. I had fun at Home Depot and was instrumental in building various displays for the store and for the kids workshops. It was also nice to talk to customers about various projects they were involved with."
good,"Definitely a hands on job, caring and knowledgeable co-workers, great learning place. I was able to learn a lot from customers and my co-workers about different things for my home. I've made some great friends, had memorable customers (in good ways and bad), had some very awesome management (and a few not so great). Everyone I work with is genuinely caring for one another in all aspects. And if you really want to work hard, they will give you some physically demanding work, but they also care about your safety while doing it."
good,"As far as the pay, co-workers/management, and work expected goes, it was great. Faster-paced, but not breakneck speed, and the people telling you what to do were pretty cool, so long as you did your job and didn't slack off.  Not really any benefits for part-timers, but that's to be expected. I'm sure if I stuck around, I probably could've moved up a bit."
good,"Home Depot is a great company, we take care of each other like family. We have great training plan. Great coworker. I work at Home Depot in Palm Coast for almost 3 years before move to South Carolina. Both stores have an excellent management board."
good,bonne motivation de l'équipe de ventes pour atteindre les objectifs assignés.
good,Providing great customer service and always trying your best to satisfy the customer on their flooring needs. I learned so much about carpeting styles as well as hardwood flooring styles. You change supervisors every six months so you get to view different manger skills. The workplace culture was very diverse at Home-depot. The hardest part of the job for me finding the best place to put a carpet seam to make sure the customer carpet was perfect until I got more training. Speaking with the customers and making sure they were satisfy was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"It's a early rise job. Most warehouse jobs I feel are the same every day, were this has multiple challenges throughout. The people for my shift are easy to work with and like to have a little fun too. It's not easy. It's physically demanding for the people that actually do it right. I would recommend this job to someone who needs a job."
good,It is a awesome company to work for I would love to stay there forever great workers great company I want to move up in the company I wish I didn't have to work every weekend
good,"I worked at a Home Depot that was in a very rural area and it was a highly coveted job as there were not very many jobs in the area. I enjoyed learning about all of the departments  and took every online course that they had to offer so I could be as knowledgable"
good,"Just like many jobs, you can expect to be pushed a little to strive for greatness and the job itself does at times get a little hectic when you haven’t met the goal yet but the coworkers there are great. Positive vibes, you get to meet different people. Expect to be on your feet all day. Working your own lane is usually not good enough. You’re expected to do your own work and help others in need. It boosts your performance and their numbers."
good,"Our customers come first , we are family and we take care of each other . The work is fast paced and different daily. You can move up quickly if you desire to do so."
good,Great company until it consumes your whole life as a manager.  I had many awesome mentors that helped me on my journey as a leader.  I believed in their mission.
good,"good place to work friendly staff professional would recommend to a friend, set up displays, teamwork,fair,fun,on feet all day, friends you make, mgmt always willing to help during crises"
good,"HD use to pride itself on Customer service and knowledge in the aisles.  Much of that was lost in the mid 2000's, but they still manage to keep a firm hold on an ever expanding PRO business."
good,If you love working with the public than this is the job for you.  If you love helping people than this is for you.  Home Depot is not a Hard Job for anyone.
good,"Home Depot trains their people well. The culture is one of appreciation and respect, and the management team works well together. I enjoy most aspects of the job, and I manage a great team. Unfortunately, the job doesn't pay well."
good,"Great people, great place, but the pay is terrible and the annual ""raises"" are usually only about $0.30 a year unless you get a bigger promotion. Worked there for a long time and it got me by, but it's not something i'd consider for a real career unless you have a passion for retail services."
good,"What I experienced was that my coworkers were so amazing and I loved working with them, but working with the customers was difficult at times, but my supportive coworkers helped me through it until I felt I was experienced enough to help them on my own to the best of my ability."
good,"asst.of customers,management at time was so so  but other employee will to help because at time  you be over taxed with customers,but did enjoy helping the customers"
good,"16 years with The Home Depot and not a wasted moment. For a customer facing company, they've been top-notch in their approach to providing excellent customer service, clean shopping and safety above all else. They're benefit packages are comprehensive and also available for part-time associates. For management of a retail business, they offer ample advancement opportunities. I would recommend them for employment, for sure!"
good,The work place is not as good now as it was when I first started there. This is because the management changed every year that I was there. That is not good because the employees did get use to one before the changed it. I did love my job .
good,"I learned a lot at the company about myself and working with others.  Customers are so much more crazy than I ever thought they could be.  It was difficult at the service desk to navigate past that, but I eventually did way better at handling it.  Thought about quitting because of how much the customers lie, manipulate, and confuse.  It can be like high school sometimes and that was also hard to deal with."
good,Contractor sales by phone
good,"Get in at 9 pm and work trucks the entire night. "
good,"I enjoyed working here.  My associates were really nice, I had good training, and learned a lot.  I sometimes was scheduled for more hours than I wanted.  It was difficult standing on concrete and it was a long walk to the rest and break rooms."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Home Depot as a Cashier. I had the opportunity to work register at the front of the store as well as in the Garden center.
good,I enjoyed my time working there.Lots of varied tasks and opportunities to interact with customers! A team environment that made it a good place to be.
good,"Working for The Home Depot provides great balance of working hard & playing hard.  The culture is all about doing what is best for the consumer and the field.  The company is truly about an inverted pyramid, and the ability to do what is best for the customer at all times.  Be ready to drive what the field wants, even at the detriment of hitting your personal metrics or targets.  But it is an awesome company to grow and learn at."
good,"It's a good place to work, the employees are friendly,  good incentives. I don't have a lot to say about the company I've only been working there for 16 months."
good,"No a very difficult job, mostly have to interact with customers. Working the night shift entailed lots of hard labor. The labor consisted of stock shelves and organizing the store."
good,some days are harder then others some workers are there for paycheck there are chances to move up but finding time to for learning for the next step. management is great my job is very demaining refilling lumber department in summer season but I'm usually on my own once the store closes thats nice sometime could use some help
good,i know each home depot environment is different but the one i worked was full of kind people. There are gonna be nasty people somewhere but most of the employees i worked were kind.
good,"It was a good job at first and me being part time I didn’t expect 40 hours a week. So I was working around 20-28 hours a week but the one time I worked 31 hours in a week, they cut my hours in half for the next 3 weeks so I was working 14 and 15 hours a week which is a lot less than preferred."
good,It was a fun place to work. There was always enough work for productivity and as well as work for general maintainance of the store without becoming over burdened.
good,"Excellent place to work and advance your resume. Many opportunities to add volunteering, community work, and different leadership duties to your resume, if you seek out these opportunities"
good,"Productive place to work, I was able to help people with their home projects and ideas. Did stocking of the department. Keep inventory on the computer and smartphone."
good,"The Home Depot as a company is a great place to work for. Providing benefits for part time and full time employees. stock, 401, medical, homer fund, and tutition assistance programs are all great benefits. Your promotions and growth are not always set by performance though, this is a downfall as a store and managers. not the company. Its a very clicky environment. If you speak up, you're seen as a problem and not a solution. but if you don't speak up, your un seen. "
good,Fue una empresa con un ambiente laboral bueno el trato al cliente fue algo dificil pero claro con paciencia y esfuerzo al atendenr y saber de los productos me hiso sentir muy bien lo que paso aqui yo renuncie por itme a otra empresa pensando me pagarian mejor
good,A typical day starts and end with customer assistance. You learn a variety of different products from different departments in the store. Advancement will be determined on your work ethic and knowledge of the store operations.
good,home Depot is a good company to work for. Many do not know that the company has a lot to offer to many company's and people that are going to buy a house in the near future.
good,I will recommend anyone looking for a job to apply at the Home Depot if they just wanted a job it's just the pay is not that good. Benefits of excellent in the vacation is as nice as well flexible work hours
good,Had a great time here but moved and new store where the managers were a need of more training and were nfit to their roles had to move to a better job
good,This can be a career if you are willing to spend multiple years trying to advance. You will build great friendships while working here.  itis a large coproration so that can have it's down falls but overall a fun place to work.
good,"Good place with great employees, its the associates who make the job manageable but like all retail customers slowly wear on you and make it difficult."
good,- Typical day at work: Always busy on a typical day at Home Depot 
good,You do the same thing everyday so if that's what you like than it's a great job. You learn quite a bit when you're there and the management for the most part was great. You get bonuses yearly and the christmas gift wasn't bad like some retail places of work.
good,"I enjoyed working there. It's a great place to start. If you can spare 6-7 hours a day for a second job, it's a great second job. There is room to grow there."
good,"I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot due to it's friendly staff, the management was reasonable and willing to help out with any home-life complications. The job was a good workout and I learned many good skills in home improvement/ maintenance."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job involves working with the public. I would like to see managers be more flexible working with all employees. Need more cashiers during peak periods.
good,thing be going good into the management want you to do everything in the job knowing you haven't been in training yet in they have some people they like to pick on some people they don't say nothing to them at all
good,Home Depot is a great place to work with tons of opportunity for advancement. This of course is contingent upon the area you are interested in. Overall it's a pleasing and friendly environment.
good,Management never came out of the office. They need to listen to employees more and spend time with them. Home Depot management will do a lot better if they gain the knowledge of the sales floor.
good,"Easy job, especially as a part time employee. Company works around school and additional job schedules well. Great on the job training. Good workplace culture."
good,"I think when it comes to a down to earth and honest working place that The Home Depot shows this in its work culture. "
good,I enjoyed being employed with The Home Depot.  This company is fair to its employees and values integrity.  I honestly felt that the managers valued the employees and there was an ambiance of respect and integrity with the company.
good,"Parking lot has a lot of extra work piled onto the already busy weekends and usually not enough to do the jobs management and other departments can't get to themselves."
good,"i enjoyed working there, i did not like the inconsistent schedule working early shifts then late shifts. the management was very open to the needs and concerns of employees."
good,It was an okay place to work with a lot of potential to be great at learning new innovative ideas. I have seen a lot and help with many various projects.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.You learned about everybody's position,witch i thought was a very smart business move,just in case you were needed to fill in for another team member.I was really sad when there was a death in my family and i could no longer keep this job."
good,"Home Depot will challenge you to become an expert in whatever you work with. The management is friendly and makes sure you are taken care of if you ever need anything. The crew there makes it feel more like a family than a job. Even though I am gone, I still go there frequently and still enjoy interacting with people who are true members of the community."
good,The work ambiance at The Home Depot is very nice. I just wish they would pay their employees better.
good,"The Home Depot offers many outstanding benefits and opportunities for advancement. My co-workers are the best I ever worked with, it is like a second family. They have an excellent system in place to learn other jobs in the store and encourage their employees to do so. The hardest part of the job was trying to get credit card applications. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers."
good,The hours are given to those who work hard for them. The management are willing to give overtime if requested. Management is a bit iffy at times but its not too bad.
good,Firstly the management was shady in the last store I worked not going into it enough was said. Work was tedious at times but the day went by quickly depending on the amount of freight that came in and how the crew went about it. Me I'm a bit OCD on organisation and how I went about work. The absolute hardest part for me at the start was not finishing what I started then I got used to how to perform certain ways to maximize work duties quicker and more effective.
good,"At the home depot I learned how to be part of a team. You constantly have to work with others, so communication is key. There were times when we were short staffed in management department. Floor supervisors to be exact, but my co-workers and I pulled together in those moments to really drive the company forward."
good,Very unstable. But training is top priority. Each associate is highly involved in each departments profit and loss analysis. You go in with no understanding of running a business and come out an expert.
good,"Unfortunately I am not able to secure a full time potions as I would like. But we do have a caring team of superiors.Over all its a well paying job. Annual raises are nice, as well as the bonus checks for reaching our goals."
good,I enjoyed helping people. Benefits are pretty good with 401k and company match. Sick/personal time off plus vacation time. I worked with a great staff and understanding mgmt. They prepare you for the sales floor before putting you on the floor. Plenty of product knowledge classes to help you help customers
good,"You learn a lot and they train you well. There are monthly and yearly classes you must take. The bad part is scheduling. Close at 12 am and work at 8 am sometimes."
good,"Home depot had a great work culture and management when I worked there. They are a pretty great company to go with if you need a part time job or something that doesn't require any special skills or work experience."
good,"Trabajo estable buen salario , mucho trabajo , el cual te deja experiencia y aprendizaje"
good,Every day is different. Customers are always surprising you with different problems that you get to solve. There is also have a great training program and also a great safety program.
good,"I started working in the Out bound Fluid area loading the trucks with a Retractable Divert . It called wall building . I then moved to the Inbound side of the warehouse , where I'd unload the trucks with a retractable belt system . Sometimes they'd bring the trailer load out on to what we call the skates and I'd put the product on the rollers. I am now in what's called Cart build where I wand the products from the divert on to a cart . The cart then get staged then put in to the assigned trailer. There is advancement opportunity but your always at the same rate . I'd like to make the money my work is worth. I fell if I work hard and give my all to a company it should be worth something then to not even be looked at for a raise . I'm honest and I go to work to work not to find ways out of working ."
good,"The people are very friendly. The compensation is good for the work you do for the most part. Good atmosphere, great benefits. They do make it a little hard to have a personal life considering they monitor employees social media accounts."
good,delivery around laguna batangas tagaytay the management are good open overtime the haredest part is if the weather is not good like rainy season is hard
good,"I worked at The Home Depot for a year and a half. The management team was very welcoming and accommodating. Advancement at this company, however, was experience based rather than being vested in capability and merit."
good,looking for a set part/full time job then this is for you. always hiring and in various departments. great for students and veterans. not a lot of opportunity to move up in company.
good,Enjoyed the job and the people involved. Wouldn't mind working here again. All employees start as part time and have to compete to achieve a full time job. Great job overall!
good,Working at the Home Depot was fast-paced. Doing overnight stock was a good way for you to learn how to set up merchandise.  Reconstructing planograms of course you're lifting boxes climbing up ladders so it's also a great workout. Overall my experience there was excellent. Had great co-workers we worked as a team and awesome management.
good,great company to work for if you a student. they will work around your schedule as much as possible. they do train people in there company well on equipment
good,"This is a fun place to work.  Those who are willing to go the extra mile will have no trouble advancing in the company.  Management is accessible, coworkers are a ton of fun."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, hay compañerismo pero falta mas organizacion"
good,"I employed Full time at Home Depot (Rt.22 E, Union, NJ) since October 2004-Sept 2008."
good,Great place to work and shop. They truly care about there employee and will work with you if you are having hard ship in your personal life. I would work there again.
good,"overall good time. work life balance was ok, management was ok as well. of course some favorites but all companies got favs. low pay could be higher. decent hours for part time"
good,"A pretty good place to work. Security and police have improved since ive worked there. A typical day at work, when I have hours, are spent helping customers about garden products."
good,"While you 'may' get tossed out into the wolves on your first day, you often begin to understand the natural flow of things and learn how to adapt to every situation that's thrown at you."
good,"At home depot I was a cashier/customer Service Representative."
good,"I loved learning from this position, because I have gained so much knowledge of the tools, drywall and etc...I see that it prepared me for a greater position in life..."
good,"Expect work for their money but understand limitations, ideals and strengths. Respect employee individuality. Encourage joint efforts and lending a hand. Management will listen to what an employee has to say. Expects smiles, greetings and thank-you."
good,"Enjoyed working at home depot.  Management was fair and interactive.  People were fun to work with.  Wage was good for the position I was in.  Tried to advance to a better position, but not able to."
good,I worked for the pro desk and it opened up opportunities for me because I was constantly seeing contractors and working with them on a regular basis. They will.also offer you forklift training which is good experience for almost any contractor or warehouse job. Carreer advancement can be easy for some and difficult for others.
good,Online ordering and taking orders for customers. Shipping and receiving. Workplace culture was good. Clean environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow coworkers.
good,I learned a lot about retail management in this role. I've had numerous roles in retail however I'd never been on the supervisory/HR/management side. Home Depot is a great company to work for and takes extreme care of it's employees
good,This is a good place to work if your schedule is very flexible. I would work 8am to 5pm one day and 3pm to 12am the next. There are managers and supervisors constantly roaming the store so its hard to relax. Someone is always watching. At the time I feel like I should have been paid more. Overtime doesn't exist! A manager would walk the store with a clipboard and tell employees with overtime to leave early!
good,Home depot is a great place to work. It is the leadership that needs to be adjusted a little and then it would be perfect. The employees who work here are great and are always willing to help customers and one another.
good,"The Home Depot in Eagle has excellent leadership from the store manager, assistant managers and department supervisors. Training is frequently available to assist with professional growth."
good,"Overall morale was great! The managers had effective communication with each other as well as with team members, realistic expectations and always looking for feedback from their employees. Gave fair reviews, recognized honest efforts."
good,Great place to work. Didn't like getting only every third weekend off. I did enjoy working at The Home Depot. Hours just didn't fit with my family life. I would work there again.
good,I liked working there and interacting with customers. My bosses were pretty nice. Get some good shoes because walking on he concrete all day can hurt your joints.
good,I loved helping customers with their home projects. As I learned the merchandise I was able to provide my expertise to the customers. Management was fair at the time of my employment. The work environment was generally okay. The hardest part was learning all that my job description entailed. I enjoyed providing good customer service.
good,"I can't speak to the company as a whole, only for the store I worked in. Management seemed to be clicky. They spent too much time trying to be popular than doing a good job. Getting a weekend off seemed to be tabu. If someone took time off, instead of someone picking up the slack, it got put off until the associate returned."
good,Only problem is low pay and one hour lunch is to long the people and work place is good I like the location and both the met supervisor and store managers are good
good,It is fun working there. Providing customer service is good. Home Depot is good at taking care of their employees. Safe place to work and people are friendly.
good,"I was outstanding at my work but was overlooked when it came to advancement there,I was always on time and always dependable at my work and I was friendly"
good,i enojy working their but they cut hours never have a fixed schedule  and seem like they dont apprecite the hard work i put into the company i dont see my self advancing.
good,"Excellent supervisor."
good,It's a small town where I live so half the time you just stand there waiting for someone to come in as a cashier. It was never super busy. Just a constant in and out. Not hard. Good first job.
good,"As a manager I was on my feet 8 hours a day.  Stressful environment to keep department in stock and team motivated.  Managed 3 different departments, plumbing, electrical and flooring."
good,"Great place to work, management really cares about their employees and challenges them to prosper, they really want to see their employees increase to management roles."
good,"the customers are good hard working people and are a pleasure to work with.  Management is easy to access, willing to listen, and very helpful when needed. My fellow co-workers are supportive, very helpful, and easy to work with."
good,Job good just pay increases sucks . Work with the met team and love it because it's a team effort and atmosphere.  We look after one another and there for one another.  It's just the store associates and the met team needs more communication with one another.
good,"Home Depot is big on safety. I was able to get a few certificates during my time of employment. They are very flexible the scheduling  and usually, there's always room for growth."
good,"- My typical day at work: punctual arrival, clocking-in, check in with manager on duty for assigned location for the day"
good,"I am a cashier at the Home Depot and it is a decent job. Everyday is more or less the same, working at the cash register day in and day out. I personally don't mind the job at all, but you can start to get a little restless. The managers at my store are pretty nice, however, at times it seems they care more about the customers and their numbers than they do about their employees. A few times our head cashiers have told us that we're literally not allowed to talk that the front end. All of my co-workers and I get along great, so that's a benefit to working there. I think the hardest part of the job would probably be just having to ""look busy"" when there really isn't anything left to do, during certain seasons we are extremely slow so it can get boring. Overall its not a bad place to work for, however there are certain things I'm not comfortable with or right within my store, so I ultimately am making the decision to find a new job."
good,"I learned a lot working here and work with a great group of people. When I first started I enjoyed the first group of managers because they was very strict with us versus the new management, they seem like they hired people who really didn't want to work and seem like they allowed certain things to continue without  consequences"
good,"Did merchandising and traveled all of Northern Nevada to help with the Home Depot stores. Did resets, restocking, customer service. I worked in plumbing, but didn't know anything."
good,i met some cool people working there. we all got along and we had great communication. Social skills were all there and never really got into with one another.
good,Great environment to work in. The most enjoyable part was the customer service. It feels really good to see a smile on their face and say thank you so much for your help.
good,"The management is not intrusive and there is no typical day. Your day revolves around what the customers need at the current time, the work changes a lot depending on the time of year."
good,"My fondest memories are my team members. Contracters who come in are sometimes hard to deal with. They demand specific nessecities that can't always be met, so they take it out on the employees. But, when you have a close nit team like I did, you learn to shrug that stress off and take it one customer experience at a time."
good,clock in put on apron customer service first always. Follow direction given by upper management. Best part is the people you work with the worst part is the positive.
good,I enjoyed the customers I dealt with and loved my fellow associates but there was a ton of political stuff to endure during my tenure with Home Depot.
good,"I worked at Lowe's a few years before working for Home Depot and feel that Home Depot was the better employer. Management was attentive to employee needs and requests for advancement in skills. There was a sense of team work and a good group of hard working people. Home Depot provided vests, box cutters, healthcare plans, 401K and stock investment options with matching. Overall, I enjoyed working here."
good,"There are always going to be drawbacks to any job. However, Home Depot is a relatively good work environment with a very friendly workforce. Managerial staff can sometimes be a bit rude but their HR people are very good at handling these situations as they arise. The pay is also pretty good."
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot as a Front End Cashier was a nice interaction with the customers. Most were contractors and handymen and needed to get out quickly so a good pace was important. Over time, There's not too much to learn previously being a cashier, but how to size up the customer and how to speak and react to people. I had gotten along with 3 out of 5 of the managers in the store (One Store Director and 4 Assistant Store Managers). The most difficult part of the job was being asked where certain items were, especially not being well versed in tool names and accessory items, nor not knowing the layout of the store very well. The most enjoyable aspect were the co-workers who were fun and friendly to talk with. Overall, I would recommend this job opposed to higher level positions in the store. The store manager tends to play favorites."
good,"Overall I didn't have a problem on homebody the employees where too much nice everybody was treated equal, overall the task was straightforward and clear"
good,had a great work experience working with co workers everyone had a positive attitude really fun environment just wish management was a bit more understanding
good,"Lots of work to do each day.  Work hours were too late at night.  Once you worked the job, and learned it it was good  Lots to learn."
good,"Pretty much organizing the shelves that were assigned to you by your supervisor, daily maintenance of the equipment we use, management are not always the best, i personally don't find anything to be arduous in the work area, and most enjoyable would be the team work as you work in groups all the different departments."
good,At the Home Depot you won't find your self being bored there is always customers to help and projects to work on the top thing about working there is the other associates they have all different backgrounds and make the day fun
good,It's a great place to work. You can learn many skills that you can use in the work place and in your home life. And there are many opportunities for growth within the company.
good,"The folks I worked with were all wonderful people, but management had a tendency to neglect maintaining basic safety standards and practices. This was largely due to the fact that the store was constantly understaffed, meaning the managers had to forgo the more nuanced aspects of their jobs to fill in gaps everywhere around the store. Personally, I liked the work I did, I liked my coworkers, and I liked my managers, but I cannot forgive the egregious mishandling of scheduling and safety practices. Beyond that, I never really earned a fair wage relative to my work responsibilities. Still, for all my gripes, this was not a terrible place to work, it was just physically stressful for a number of reasons."
good,"Typical Day: Lots of physical labor, loading block, soils, carrying heavy products on ladder."
good,"If you wanted to learn another department finding the right person was to key, but there was always an opportunity. Typical day was usually fast paced, always something to do. Management overall was okay, but rarely on the same page day to day. Management could been more supportive and associate oriented. You get to work with all ages from different parts of the country. The hardest part was finding enough people to help in different parts of the store when there was a higher ratio of customer to associates. Most enjoyable part was the people and the feeling of being productive."
good,It a good place to work for. As long as we have good management on our side then the work load will be easy and the work environment can be fun. There are bonuses every 6 months and we compete with other store for a bigger bonus.
good,"HomeDepot is a company that really takes care of its employees. There is plenty of training available to all associates. You can move throughout the departments to learn other areas and better yourself. They offer good benefits, including discounts on stock options."
good,The hardest part is making sure customers have everything they need. The work place culture is very relaxed and usually try to keep a fun work atmosphere. I learned a lot about home improvement which helped me with selling and with at home maintenance issues.
good,Started the day with an overlook of my departments then i would check my report for the sales of the previous day and print out all reports for the morning department managers meeting.after meeting i would have a department meeting with my associates to go over the plan for the department. help customers with a there needs..
good,This is a great job but when it comes to getting information about employment advancement it is very difficult with vague answers. Where you can feel like the speed of the process depends on who you know.
good,The employees were great to work with. Good personalities and never a dull moment. My manager was good as well. The only problem was the low pay. I couldn't affourd to pay bills.
good,"good place to work, a pretty nonrestrictive dress code, pays not bad for the work, and can go far in the company. they have a huge focus on safety, and rightly so."
good,Home depot is an excellent place to work with good management and leadership from the top down .They offer flexible hours and the work is fast pave therefore the time doesn't stand still.
good,"has it's ups and downs, friendly outgoing people, learned about power tools, retail, receiving, etc, great management to work under, same as everyday just beat the goal set for the day, hardest part was doing managerial stuff for employee pay, most enjoyable part of the job was going to work and seeing the smiles on both customers and associates faces."
good,"Overnight Freight has it's pluses and minuses. If you aren't interested in the much of the direct customer service aspect of retail it works out pretty well. Overnight freight shift starts right as the store is closing so most of the customers have already left the store and we left before the store opened in the morning. It is a physically demanding job with quotas to meet, and there are thousands of pieces of inventory to stock on the shelves nightly as well as straightening up the mess made by customers and employees throughout the day, but by morning we would have the entire store restocked and straightened up ready for another day of home improvement. I also got the opportunity to be certified on several pieces of equipment for moving freight, forklift, cherrypicker, scissorlift, power pallet jack and a couple others."
good,"."
good,The Home Depot is a fun place to work if you like to interact with many different people from all different cultures. The work can be stressful and physical.
good,Overall Home Depot is a good place to work. I learned a lot about customer service and customer service system. I learned a lot about construction and DIY repairs around the house.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot. "
good,Home Depot was a great place to work for but the hours just kept going down even though I was hired to 27 weekly and they kept hiring more people!! I won several awards & Cashier of the Month twice & it was not my work ethic. Had to quit because I leave out of town & hours were not supporting the gas money & time I was spending going there. Miss working there.
good,I thought I had a great time for the most part at home depot . Management had over all good communication . Everybody who works their seem happy and willing to always help. Mostly good energy and good feelings working their .
good,"I was there for 5 years, 18 - 23 years old. It was simple at first, then we got bad managers. Many people would quick but I stuck around, it was a chill environment. I would advise to just be a listener and do things at a steady pace. Many people would work very hard just to end up walking around and looking like they were being lazy. You have to adapt to your home depots style."
good,"Home depot is all about customer service, its important to make sure customers have that WOW experience that keep them coming back for more. The part time hours could have been better,Department head needed to stop showing so much favoritism and promote the ones who work their butts off instead of giving someone who didn't deserve it a raise and full time."
good,"Was very relaxed when I beginning working, now the company is micromanaging now. It is flexible with your school hours or any emergency. Very lenient about you being tardy. Great holiday pay."
good,"Overall, it was a very good place to work. The benefits package is second to none. "
good,"This is a good company for a part time position. They have great health benefits. The 401k isn't to bad, Just show up and read the labels and you'll go far!"
good,I really loved my time at The Home Depot.  I would have stayed and retired from there if they had not downsized/offshored my department.  I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"Home Depot used to be a great place for retired tradespeople to work part-time and to share their knowledge.  With expansion in the late 1990s, the talent was spread too thin at new stores, and fewer associates have long-term experience in the departments they serve in the store.  "
good,"Fast paced, if monotonous work. Great coworkers, make your own schedule as long as you don't work more than 20 hours. Occasional opportunities to work up to 40 hours."
good,"The home depot was definitely a good place to work in my experience. I got to work with a lot of different people, meet a lot of customers and professional customers at that. The managers were fair but they also had their favorites. It is a great place to work for all types of people including veterans."
good,The work wasn't too difficult but there was a heavy emphasis on computer skills. If you can handle the male dominated environment then you'll do just fine.
good,Worked to the best of my ability and when the immediate management was informed of my medical condition they were very condescending and not very helpful.  Upper management was never notified of my medical needs or condition.
good,"Very fast paced with excellent benefits. Co- workers are friendly and always willing to assist each other.  Always have incentives, and for employess."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot consists of ringing up customers, processing returns, processing orders, answering phones, placing special orders for customers as well as checking them out, verifying that customers renting equipment or making purchases are using items for legitimate projects, most people are nice, management is helpful most of the time but at times hesitant to help, busy, can be stressful due to customers not adhering or disliking company policies, you see a lot of theft which makes you leery of a lot of customers.  You do have your ""regular"" customers that come in and make you realize not all customers are bad or shady, and they are also friendly and kind.  Generally there isn't a lot of down time if you are doing the job correctly, however a lot of people receive recognition when other people go the extra mile and aren't recognized for their contributions.  Overall it isn't a bad place to work but you have to realize that there isn't much room for advancement and people are hired on a part time basis only."
good,Learned alot about how to put up drywall and alot about carpentry. I also learned alot about tools to use in the workplace. I met alot of nice people who were very helpful of showing me what to do.
good,Home depot was a typical customer service job. There was a fair amount of physical labor and dealing with the average consumer and their shenanigans. It was ok as far as retail jobs go. Management was mostly fair. Don't expect to advance unless you have a lot of charisma and buddy up with someone in management.
good,"To summarize my experience:"
good,"Home depot is a job of constant lifting building relationships with co worker and dealing with all incoming customer"
good,Home deopt is a great place to work for not really any room for full time possions so if you want part time job this your place to go. Mangment and cowrkers are great treat there employees good! They aprication for us with pizza party or sub sandwiches
good,"Fun place to work loved being a designer, the management needs to back their employees in stressfull situations. Loved working with the public. The learning experence was nice."
good,"Great company was promoted twice, had great training, had great benefits.  Had a lot of weekend a night hours for full time employees. "
good,Decent place to work and management is very good. Wages are just ok and their is not enough full time employment opportunities available. Full time benefits are excellent put it is very difficult to get full time employment
good,"no dan fondo de ahorro, no se descansa los fines de semana, pero el trabajo no es de presión"
good,"The Home Depot merchandising teams have a perfect pattern for stocking and cleaning up the aisles every day, and in different parts of the store every day. By the time the week is out, they have gone through and maintained each section consisting of a certain number of aisles per day. It's a very efficient system, and makes workflow go by very smoothly."
good,busy day many customers. Once you clock in you are overwhelmed with tasks and customers.  Hardest part of the job was to find enough room for merchandise to be stored.
good,"Logging in"
good,"If you enjoy approaching, sharing information, discussing products with customers,in a fast paced environment it's great. If you don't mind being surrounded by customers needing help, it;'s great.  If you don't, DON'T.  If you care about Hone Depot, they will care about you. Team work is essential considering heavy lifting and moving of stock. They try making employees happy by things like lots of food, like BBQ's, during holiday times and special events. As in life, it is what you make it. You must wear comfortable shoes. The pay sucks and full-time positions are few and far between. Great part-time job with dental and vision benefits available."
good,"I have worked for THD off and on for almost 6 years, each time when I left the company to try a new career they welcomed me back with open arms. The company really does try to take care of their associates with their benefits they offer from employer match 401K, discount employee stock purchase plans, success sharing (store bonus check split among associates based on profit from stores sales) I could go on and on about the benefits, which they will go over when your hired on. If you really want to move up in the company then you can as long as you put in the hard work."
good,Great work culture and extremely supportive management.  Individual development is given high priority and opportunities to expand and develop new skills is encouraged.
good,"Our head cashiers tell me which register to handle and I check out customers. I learned techniques for what to do or say so customers check out easily and leave happy. My superiors gave me recognition when it was due and got along with me very well, while also making sure I treated the customers well and followed the rules. Everyone at Home Depot is really nice and I liked talking to my co-workers during breaks. Sometimes it would be difficult to help a customer find something in the store when they ask. But the thing I enjoy most is when I check a customer out and it goes so smoothly; they love me, I get along with them, and my manager sees me doing a good job."
good,"while working at the Home Depot I've picked up on a lot of knowledge that I wouldn't have obtained through college, and it would have taken longer for me to gain that knowledge just going through my life."
good,The home depot MET team is a fun job. We move through the whole store and get to know all employees in the store. Hardest part of the job is the holiday resets with only a few people allowed to work on it at a time.
good,Good place to work.  Good pay. great insurance. Co-workers were helpful and knowledgeable.  management was good.  The retail hours were not that great for a persons social life.
good,"I worked on the MET team, very relaxed pace, not a hard job at all,  Hours were Monday-Friday 6AM - 3PM so it is an early start but it gives you some time in the afternoon to do other things.  Good job to tide you over"
good,"The Home Depot is either a hit or a miss when working, based on the store location and the community. The team you work with for me was a group effort, but when it came to advancing my knowledge or use for the company,it wasn't up to me. As many times as i had tried to improve my usefulness for the company i was either declined or ignored. Including request to be authorized to operate machinery such as a electric ladder, fork life or 'ballymore'. The store i was located in treated their customers fairly, as well as the associates, but even someone as dedicated to their work as I isn't able to work a sporadic and unreliable work schedule. In the eyes of my co-workers and managers I was a hard worker, sometimes trying 'too hard'."
good,"Lots of physical work, the company give you opportunities to learn different departments, educate you on different roles. Advancement placement. They have the best customers."
good,"Depending on store management ,  can be a fun and motivating place to work . Most stores take care of each other, like family. Their core values are great and 401 k is a great return on investment"
good,"Good points: Good coworkers, friendly environment, mandatory breaks and lunch, had quarterly incentives if the store makes it's goals. Decent pay for a retail job $10/hr and you do get health care and sick time once the probation is over and you start getting vacation time after your there for one year.  "
good,"I worked for HD for nine years, part time, as I had young children and wanted only to work opposite my husband's M-F 8-4 schedule. Working nights and weekends was stressful, physically demanding, but rewarding too. I was able to run the Kid's Workshop for a couple of years and cross train into different areas of the store. My one real disappointment came when we moved from MI to WA. I had worked for nine years, starting at $8/hr. and reaching $11/hr. When I transferred to WA, the cost of living was more and they were hiring new cahiers in at $10/hr., but would not consider giving me a raise to bring me to equivalent pay of equivalent employees."
good,"start work at 9 oclock do our exercise and then pack out the freight that comes on the truck that day, at 11 oclock take a 15min break come back and finish packing out the freight once the freight is packed out anything that is left over pick it up and put it in the overhead after we do  shelf maintenance and clean up the store"
good,"It is important to know that the Home Depot is a very good placer people to work, you will have the support of the staffs, management need to be a little more involved."
good,"The company's adaptation to the market place changes are unpresidented, the evaluation process is daily. A traditional day has no precursor as one's focus is ever changing with the times. The culture is the key to their success in such a large organization."
good,It was a good place to work. If you like coffee its always hot in the breakroom. The managers at the Ithaca store are nice and are willing to listen to suggestions.
good,A typical day at home depot is very productive with set tasks to accomplish. The crew works well in a team to complete daily tasks and provide customer service to its patrons.
good,"The job paid good. 14.25/hr finished at 14.75/hr. It was just a drag most of the days. No windows, no music, just work. And the work is easy so its nothing to start daydreaming into space and the next thing ya know only 20mins have gone by. The supervisors here are total cheerleaders. I'm convinced that they dont even have a soul. Everything is ""Home Depot"" this home depot that. But I would recommend working here....IF you dont have a job or are doing similar work for less pay."
good,As only a Home Depot employee for a year the atmosphere was pretty great as well as with the customers. Only thing was there was not enough hours in a work week for me to have a steady paycheck.
good,I had fun with the other employees there. As a part time worker I was able to work around classes and was scheduled hours and days requested. Management changed frequently.
good,"the job does train you and test you to be sure you understand but at the same time they don't make it easy to ask questions, one you go to the floor someone will work with you but they are more concerned about making their numbers than training you"
good,"It's a big box retail, its always busy.  Home Depot believes in its values and it filters to its associates.  Operating at a high level all of the time can burn some people out."
good,"A typical day at  Home Depot was relaxing at times and stressful at times. I learned a lot about inventory management, customer relations, personnel  management and hazmat handling"
good,Home depot is a good company to work for.  A typical day at Home Depot would be all about customer service.  Our main goal is to make sure every customer leaves with what they came for.
good,"Everyday is basically the same but all the employees are very friendly and so are most of the customers. They have many ways of rewarding hard work including financially. If you decide to stick around you'll find that there are opportunities to advance your knowledge, gain more skills and even relocate within the store and out."
good,"Give customer service to people that needed paint issues resolved."
good,Had a great experience working learned alot from all the managers. Customers that come in the store would tell my boss they like my work. Always can in with a positive attitude and make sure all my work was done correctly
good,"Easy job, some days you're running around but most of the time you're just going through the motions. Standing all the time and walking everywhere. Overall it was a great experience."
good,"The home depot have a great and safe working environment,  friendly and hard working people the work as a team to get the  job done, every 6 months the company give extra money is the store does great in sales, good health and future denifits"
good,the review was great it was very out spoken and detailed overall it was great very glad that they want my feed back  the company is a great company to work for and I would recommend any one to work for the company they put their associated first and they make sure they meet the needs of the customer and always accommodated the customer so that they leave the store happy happy and willing to come and shop again
good,I worked at Home Depot briefly and had a graveyard shift. I enjoyed my coworkers and learning new skills. I handled inventory and restock primarily. I liked learning how to use a fork lift.
good,"I love Home Depot, however, was not aware that hours would  be until 4:00 am usually and very physical work.  Would love to still be there had maybe returns or cashier or something else was open at that time."
good,"Home Depot is great to work for.  But since all workers, except department mgrs. are part-time, get approx. 15-20 hrs in slow season. A little more during summer. Get part-time dental and vision but no medical. Always seem to be short handed. Can't live on 20 hrs."
good,"I like the company overall but I have had 3 managers over me in the months I have been there. They should require the managers to be more qualified for roles they put them in instead of ""waiting for them to get up to speed"". It makes the job much more stressful when you are working under someone who knows nothing of their role or how to do it."
good,"I worked at Home Depot for a year and a half, although a great store with many friendly associates the management at the time was poor. Unfair treatment, no raises, unwilling to help out fellow associates, not a team player,   Although you do learn a lot of the technical skills each department offes"
good,Untrained employees in understaffed specialty departments. To have customers searching for advice or help in serious matter in their home would best be served by people who know what they are talking about. Not employees who watch a few videos on the topic.
good,"Somewhat busy throughout the day, before I knew it my shift was over. Some days would be relaxed while others were very busy, especially on weekends Great retail experience with helpful staff. Hardest part of this job would be rude customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is working well with others and meeting new people."
good,It is a fast paced demanding environment.  Always pushing to grow and do new things to drive sales with in the store.  You work when they want you to work.  It is Retail1
good,At home depot i learned a lot and learned what team work really means. I drove the forklift loading and unloading items into customers cars and trucks.
good,Productive fast paced some time just to repetitive work at times you are promised things and they did not come true. moving up the chain is to pull your teeth out.
good,The job was very hot because i worked during the summertime. I did a mans job as far as lifting and hard work wasnt a typical sales job. I picked up and loaded and unloaded heavy blocks stone rocks and mulch when it was raining or sun was shining with a full 102 degree temperatures outside. Never complained or took time off for sickness of any kind.
good,"como jefe de departamento existe capacitación constante en distintas areas administrativas elaboración de horarios, planes de ventas, planes de merma, inventario, desarrollo de personal   , crecimiento laboral rápido, se crean valores de respeto, cooperación , excelente servicio al cliente se da."
good,I don't have many complaints. It is hard work at first but with other people helping you to be successful it becomes pretty simple. They offer multiple breaks per shift and a nice clean lounge area
good,Enjoy working with the home depot. Great employees friendly work environment. Good staffing. Great customers. Good benefits. Easy going. Good advancement opportunities
good,"This is an alright company to work for if your just starting out and need to build some experience. Got excellent benefits with health, dental, and vision insurance. Many discount with companies. Provides good retirement options with stock purchasing and 401k"
good,"Family environment on the job, fulfilling, customer service oriented company, 11 hour shifts, open availability required, good benefits, good pay, company gives back to community"
good,"Nice place to work at, environment was friendly, management varied. the hardest part of the job would be standing for periods of time. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands and fixing tools."
good,Most of the time it was enjoyable but it did have its moments. I gained a d great deal of knowledge and was able to call upon prior work experience for the department I was in.
good,"Working here was fun for the time being, I built great relationships with both customers and employees. Leaders in the work place are respectable, you always serve the customer, and try to go beyond expectations to make yourself, your leaders and customers happier."
good,I enjoyed working there over 20yrs.  Have good benefits.  Decent pay for retail.  Long hours and stressful.  Family and job balance is tough.  Overall not a bad place to work
good,"You get to work and depending on the day it may fast or slow."
good,"Training programs are provided and training in all other departments."
good,"good for a first job. I would recommend this job for any age. it could possibly turn into your career. but management, benefits and hours has to get better."
good,"Loved loved loved working for Home Depot!  Management is engaged, and makes you feel good about yourself often.  "
good,"I enjoyed working with Home Depot Management was supportive, staff was helpful and generally worked as a second family to each other. I would have stayed if it were not for it's pay and hours it was not enough."
good,Great place to work my only issue is not full time position. Good part time hours but with me having a family I need full time hours and its hard to get full time without being there a long time at part time.
good,"Your job expectations depend on your position. At times you are short-handed and must make due between your daily duties and the responsibilities that will arise. In locations that are more corporate controlled, the stress will run high at times and the expectations management has of you will seem unrealistic. Do not be afraid to ask for help and make friends in the company."
good,The Home Depot was a very good company to work for.  They offered good insurance and stock options with a good 401k plan.  Some positions should be paid based on an hourly rate as well as sales.
good,"Everyone i worked with was extremely nice and mostly laid back. The only problem i had was how little training in each department the cashiers are given, when customer's ask them the most questions. The cashiers are only taught how to ring up customers. so they can't help with any technical questions the customers have."
good,A typical day at home depot involves a lot of trouble shooting and running around.  There are problems around every turn that you have to figure out how to solve.  It is a challenging job but the customers make it worth it.  Most of the customers are regular contractors who you become friends with.  This is the most rewarding part of the job.  Home Depot as a company works very well with their employees and takes care of them the best they can.
good,"Everyday Life Man Our name, The Home Depot, says it all. We've created a one-stop shop to help our customers build a home. We couldn't have done it without the culture and feeling of home and family among the associates in our stores, distribution centers and corporate office, a feeling that's evident in everyday life at ... personally it has a good work environment vibe."
good,"Good place to work to start off for experience. Can be flexible with schedule needs. If you apply for a cashier position, getting 2 credit cards minimum opened is wanted."
good,I held a few positions and each one had both good and bad points. /I came from a small company where I wore many hats.. Home Depot seemed to have a very tired employee hierarchy.
good,"The Home Depot is a average starter job for people who want to get started with work, when i was working there they tough me the skills i need to further improve with costumers and for myself. they work with your scheduled  and are kind and polite."
good,Great place to work but some times they hire people in management positions that don't fully understand what is going on. All the see is numbers and don't fully or care to realize that its harder to get to those numbers
good,Its a fun place to work and I had a good crew with me but sometimes the schedules was unbalance. The paid rate was not fair and the annually rates were not good.
good,A repetitive job. Always doing the same thing in a different area of the store. Can get very hard to do your own job. if the Store side associates are not assisting customer and you have to.
good,It was fun but to little hours and not enough pay for myself and family my position was an on call for just about everything but never was able although I felt I was never able to complete my duties a manager due to work hours
good,It has been over ten years since I worked for Home Depot and feel that my perspective may be skewed or at least not a current overview of the work environment.
good,"good place to work, lots of nice employees, plenty of room for advancement.hardest part is the work schedule, never seem to have weekends off , even being part time. The good part is meeting all types of people and helping them solve their problems."
good,Home Depot was a good job but very physical in the receiving dept. The people I worked with made it a fun job and were willing to offer help when you needed it. Unfortunately a few people who worked there for many years treated new employees unkind.
good,"se mantiene un ambiente laboral tranquilo, pero en cuestiones de personal administrativo falta un poco mas de participacion de la gente"
good,"I enjoyed the workplace, people I worked with, and supervisor I had on overnight freight. Money for freight Team was not high enough, and when I was promised a raise if I stayed with the company, instead of quitting, it never happened. That is what led to me quitting."
good,"THD was awesome to work for starting Day One at Orientation! Was trained, advised, warned of dangers, proper handling of shop-lifters, ready to go on the floor after 2 week’s paid training at normal wage. I was very impressed with the three week in advance scheduling and the ample time to have it changed if need be. The Managerial support was dedicated to making this THD the best on the planet, not ignoring complaints, but addressing them quickly and directly. I left this job for personal difficulties. Would love to work there again."
good,If you like customer service and are charismatic than you might want to work here.Best part of Home depot are the co-workers worst part is the customers.Also not so good for your tendon and joint health if you work a physical job there.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for overall.  As with any company, there are great leaders and poor leaders. Unfortunately, I have poor leadership and it makes doing my job extremely difficult. The people on my team have been in their roles for years and only knows that aspect of the business. I have worked in several areas of business over my career and often try to offer an outside perspective but it falls on death ears. I enjoy working with the employees and vendor but not so much with the team members I encounter."
good,"You can just look at the store and know that working there is going to be hard, physical work but it's hard to imagine the toll that standing/walking on those cement floors while carrying heavy products does to a body over time. "
good,"Overall the company is great, great things to take advantage of. but  the base pay overall is lacking for most people. This is based on my particular store tho. Some locations are better about compensation."
good,"Well, I moved a bunch a boxes. Management did some smart things, but also some not so smart things. The hardest part was trying to keep up under the new LM system with nothing to account for everything outside scanning."
good,"good people, atmosphere. morning 15 minute meeting, and stretch. stock shelves, make new displays. 15 min break, paid, lunch break 1/2 hour, mid afternoon stretch, 15 minute break paid."
good,"My tenure at Home Depot was rather short as I was recruited for a position more aligned to my long term career path. However, during that time, I did not find any concerns about the company or the environment"
good,"Warehouse style retail environment.  Customer service is priority, no matter how unpleasant a guest may be. Most training for any department is provided at store.  Company values its associates, but the store will ultimately determine level of support and advancement opportunities for individuals.  Profit sharing, as well as numerous benefit and discount programs available. Vacation time and PTO with somewhat flexible schedule."
good,"If you love a warehouse feel and love customer service this is the job for you. Everyone there, including the managers, are friendly and nice. I worked in the stocking department so I stocked the shelves and it was a fun and interesting job."
good,The Home Depot is an amazing place to work. They are great when we have natural disasters and when you have life events out of your control which may cause financial burdens. During the hurricanes they paid associates who were unable to report to work. when I had close family member that died they helped with burial expenses. The is a lot of politics when it comes to being promoted and being able to advance outside of your position. They would rather hire someone from outside the company more than give associates from within a raise that's more than 13% their current pay rate
good,Customer service in Home Depot is a plus and is a very fast pace environment. Working as Customer service specialist has there good and bad days but for all everything ends good.
good,A very good organization to work for they offer full benefits and cares about there employees. It's a family oriented environment which makes for a good work culture amongst employee/managers.
good,"If you enjoy tools, talking to people, and building then this place is for you. It is possible to advance in many ways if you wish. You can also transfer to new locations."
good,"The job can be stressful at busy time but makes the day go fast.  I work with some incredible people who make the job fun.  Sometimes equipment failures are a problem but overall I love the job.  I consider it my ""FUN JOB""."
good,"Typical day at work involved interacting with customers for complete satisfaction of the customer. I learned how to give customer service, working with other employees and team work, and how to work in the paint department as well as various other positions in store such as Lumber, Garden, parking lot, and loading/unloading trucks. "
good,"I say this is more a job for someone who's a bit older and is finically secure and feel the need to pick up a hobby, or young individuals who attended university until they need to create expiernce for their major. I will say as a part timer one has very very flexible working hours. But it is hard to advance in the store or even getting pay raises one believes they deserve."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is all the people that you get to work with and all the new people that you get to meet throughout the time that you are there. The hardest part is when you have to try and find someone for coverage when someone calls out or does not show up.
good,"Typical work day was down stocking, inventory, greeting customers and helping them to find what they were needing, I learned to be patients, to think on my feet, and  to breathe a lot. Management was demanding, relentless, and unforgiving.  The workplace culture was competitive and fast moving, with little down time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with inpatient customers. The enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers that were happy for the help."
good,"es una empresa que de inicio de día comienza con capacitación a los empleados seguido de motivación"
good,"Working for Home Depot have been a great career enhancement. On a daily base I worked with agents providing feedback. Also assist customer with issues from order to delivery, The culture of the company is very relaxed and uplifting."
good,"Even though I'm ready to explore the workforce else where, Home Depot has taught me so much about myself and what is expected of you in the corporate America. They do care about their workers (sometimes it feels as if they don't but they do have us in mind) Pay is ok it could always be more but it is decent (for a college student anyway). We receive bonuses twice a year and have paid vacations. The call center environment can take a toll on you because the customers expect so much from Home Depot. Its a very demanding environment. If you have the option definitely work at the SSC in Vinnings. The environment is 100% more relaxed than the call center. Most important thing about Home Depot is its always changing."
good,A rather boring temporary job. If you enjoy sporadic periods of heavy work followed by the more common day of doing two or three orders then having nothing else to do then this would fit you. You are thrown to the wolves after lackluster computer training.
good,"Overall it is a really good to work.  The company has a lot services offered to employees for life assistance, including discounted stock purchase, open communication with HR, discount purchase sites with partnered suppliers, legal services.  I personally on used a few and these and the many other offers.  "
good,"While not the worst place I've worked, also not the best. Salary compensation is somewhat lacking. Co-workers are friendly. Caring environment. Career opportunities exist if you want to work lots of hours."
good,"mix paint for customers. "
good,"Did my job to the best of my ability. Assisting customers & educating them on store products."
good,"Just your typical fast paced, goal driven warehouse job. Management helped out a lot, but has since shifted. The hours were a little much but 2 breaks a night helped. If you're newer they try to force OT on you."
good,Je travail chez home dépot depuis 2015 et depuis que je suis la bas j'ai toujours eu du plaisir à travailler là bas. Les journées de travail dur environ 8h et il y a plein d'avantage sociaux comme l'assurance qui est très bonne même pour un temps partiel.
good,"shelf stocking."
good,Was able to work part time for a while and it was a decent job. Good fit if you are a do it yourself-er and have a little competence in that range. Good people
good,"Department Supervisors train, coach and develop associates in each department to ensure customers receive excellent service and can easily find the merchandise they need. In addition they provide valuable input into merchandising decisions to the Store Management Team and Operations Team. Department Supervisors have strong product knowledge and the ability to lead and develop others."
good,"always busy, no time for boredom. friendly management for the most part. fun get togethers for employees, fun to try out new products, opprtunities to get badges which in turn became monies."
good,The Home Depot is a great company that have great benefits and assistance. The have the up most respect for their associates and work to make sure that that are happy at the jobs they perform
good,working at home depot is awesome. its a very laid back work environment. the job role as an appliance specialist is not a competitive one.  we do not get paid on commission which lacks that element of advancement within the company
good,"enjoyed this job but wasn't paying enough. I understood my postion and worked as hard as i could. All of the managers enjoyed my word ethic. Hard work equals, great relationships and happy People."
good,"Being a lot associate can be pretty stressful since most of the time there isn't another lot attendant to help out, your expected to do the job normally done by 2 or more people. $10/ hour starting pay which is pretty low considering the amount of back breaking work involved. If your hired in as a lot associate don't expect to be advanced to another department. Overall it's a good place to work, but not a career by any means. Company is very anti union which I find to be suspicious."
good,"Retail is retail, but from what I've seen, THD is far and away the best place to work out of most box stores.  The pay and benefits are a tad better than most options in my area, and the company culture is a bit more laid back and friendly.  Most people seem to get along, although there's still the cliques that always form.  Some people certainly seem to have bad experiences here, and I've even witnessed some of those meltdowns; but I'm doing pretty good here for now."
good,Home Depot has great job enivornment the fellow associates are great when it comes to team work. Home Depot have great concern for their associates. The freight that they push through can be challenging at time.
good,"The good place to work as a part-timer, but not for those who need to earn a living. The management is good as they valued diversity, everyone is fairly managed."
good,"I have enjoyed working at  THD. It definitely has its perks but the main thing that bothers me the most is the hours, the schedule is terrible and the dollar per hour isn't that much of a great thing either. I need a better schedule and better pay."
good,"The Home Depot was a great place to work, they were very flexable with my work schedule and they had a nice and very helpful human resorce team. The Home Depot is good a keeping you and the team safe."
good,"Great place to work, The Home Depot really seems to value its employees, veterans and the community. I like working here, however just wished it payed better. New employees start off part time and sometimes it can take 6 months to a year to go full time, but if you work hard and have some initiative full time and promotions are possible in a reasonable amount of time."
good,Work was steady and strenuous.  The people were great to work for and work with.  Flexible hours and responsibilities.  This was seasonal work.  Mar - July
good,"This location is a great place to work but be ready for some physical strain. The company and employees make it fun to be there, and you can tell that home depot genuinely cares about you."
good,"Overall, I think HD is a good & solid employer, though their pay is really low.  They do care about your work/life balance and advancement is strongly encouraged."
good,"I interned full-time at THD for two full summers and part-time during three semesters. The work was interesting and I learned quite a bit, but there is a definite apathy towards proper software engineering practices, at least in my area. As far as I can tell, no one in the building does code reviews (""Pair programming eliminates the need for code reviews""... huh?). Proper automation of all testing is (very) slowly making its way into my area - other groups may be doing better than we are, but I certainly feel that deadlines take significantly higher precedence than proper automated testing. As a result, QA is hugely overworked and there are fires every few weeks. "
good,From the start of my career at Home Depot I was treated like family from coworkers and management. Everyone was patient with me as I learned the system and product location.
good,"job is very interesting, because you are working in many different departments, stocking shells from daily receiving, very busy every night , only  bed things is the hours of work , usually  10:30 to 6:30 ."
good,Awesome job Learned a lot and just wish the people enjoyed working as much as I did. I wish the other associates were not so grumpy all the time and enjoyed helping customers.
good,"I had a great experience helping customers because of my personality, and had multiple employee of the month awards. The only thing was, I'd like to be paid better."
good,keeps me busy. always looked forward to break time though. keeps you in shape for sure. management is nice long days.but only four days a week. point system is kind of strict though.
good,"Management has always been kind and supportive. They may assign you to work to diffrrent facilitiesm do you meet many new people, and always you start your work day with a smile from the customer."
good,"The Home Depot has many great ideas, most of which they apply well.  However, I'd say my experience with the culture, management, and work environment weren't the greatest.  Typically the days were busy with many people wanting help.  It was satisfying to help many people with purchases, issues, or advice. There was always something to stock, clean, or maintain. I felt as though there was not enough people to help for the type of position I was in so it made the workplace seem stressful at times.  The management was extremely knowledgeable but not encouraging.  There were many times that the managers were overworked and couldn't support their employees with advise, encouragement or knowledge even though it was in their interest to do so.  I noticed the workplace culture was friendly but many times everyone was so overworked that they would be stressed.  People would get along in and out of work but it didn't have an especially ""home-like"" feel to it.  It is retail and a large company after all, but what bothers me is that being a team and supporting each other is one of their core tenants - but that is the experience of one worker so take that as you will. The hardest part of the job was not being able to do what I wanted to in the day due to a lack of people to help and an over abundance of work.  This in turn made me feel unaccomplished many times.  However, there were many times that overcoming customer's product or service issues were very satisfying.  I think if The Home Depot were to invest in a drive for more people and investing personally into their employees through"
good,"Home Depot does not appreciate when associates hang out outside of work. They perceive it as wrong and are very against it. When you want to be friends with your peers, you cannot as someone will find out and get upset."
good,"I found out later that the specialist position that I had held should have been paid around 19 dollars an hour. I was paid 9.75 an hr. The job itself wasn't too difficult, but one mistake could lead to a lot of problems. Setting up installations and then messing them up.. It takes about 2 weeks to correct for a customer that needs a new door or window installed. You have to deal with a very angry person at that point and get it right the next try. Nobody seemed to know how to work that machine for setting up installations except for 2 people. My manager and my coworker. All in all it was a decent job and for anybody that enjoys that type of stuff, it is satisfying."
good,"The job is a fairly simple, non-stressful, but tedious job. the days are fairly simple and repetitive. the servicing of the bays (selves) are fairly simple and everything that is needed for you to complete your job is given to you. the culture of the company is great and the people are very friendly."
good,"the friendliness of the staff is exceptional, never a dull place to work. Always have people to lean back on for support. A typical day at work mostly consists of walking the aisles and engaging customers and supporting their needs in the aisles. Maintaining the in stock is important in keeping customers happy with our one stop shopping experience that we promote. A Lot of workplace activities to keep all staff happy and the reason why Home Depot is such a diverse employer."
good,can't work there day or evening shifts because u have flex schedule. won't work if u have another job or school. managers are excellent dedicated & work with you
good,"The Home Depot is a Godd place to Work. The environment was clean and the people with whom I worked with were very supportive. In All, The Home Depot Is a good Place to work."
good,"On the freight team I unpacked boxes and stocked shelves and moved materials. the management was exceptional. The environment was very relaxed and comfortable. The coworkers were nice. It did get boring, not having many interaction with people. However it was sometimes fun being able to focus on your duties"
good,Working here I learn many skills involving the subcontracting field.  The work was hard but enjoyable.  I continually strived for excellence during my tenure with this employer.
good,"home depot was a place that I enjoyed. people were like family from back home , the hours were short sometimes but once I walked in the door I knew I would have a great day"
good,"Worked in lumber department. Cut many pieces of lumber for customers. Some days spent many hours making cuts for customers. Assisted customers find what they were looking for and directed those that weren't quite sure what they were looking for."
good,Its a was an easy going job just some of the department heads would change a bay around so we would have to stock & reset bays. Had to use the order picker to get big bulky items to from the overhead.
good,"If you want a retail job that has a fixed schedule and great team environment, this is the job for you. You will spend a LOT  of time on your feet and moving...there is pretty much no down time. In a typical day, I can average roughly 8,000 steps at work alone. Great benefits and a culture of safety and improvement: the Home Depot strives to keep its associates with the company and happy and healthy. Waking up before the sun isn't fun, but it does allow for you to get all your appointment and errands done. The biggest complaint  I have is the lack of pay: I wish I was paid a BIT more for the work I do."
good,Home depot is a great place to work. It offers great benefits. You can earn bonus base on merits. The environment can be one of the best places to work out of any other retailer.
good,"Working in retail can be fun and stressful, meeting high demands or angry customers and get overwhelming.  If you are not a people person than this is not the job for you."
good,"Love the customers, learned a lot about being in the workforce, the job is what you make it, good or bad is your choice.  worst part is the busy rush. seems like everyone comes in at once sometimes. Best part is all the people you meet and learning about their exciting projects."
good,Fast paced and competitive. Benefits are excellent. Constantly evolving to meet technological changes and customer demands. Work life balance was a struggle in management.
good,It was a good job with nice pay and opportunity to advance. I was in charge of receiving shipment. I think it is a good place to work but it needs better organization
good,"Coworkers are great and supportive, managers can be pretty stuck up at times. Supervisors are wonderful and willing to work with you to improve your performance."
good,"I started at Home Depot when they paid for knowledge and continually trained its' employees in their particular roles. Since then, they have changed there management model from mostly full-time employees to mostly part-time employees. In the process, they have given up on offering customers the quality of advice they once received."
good,"The Home Depot has helped me advance myself in several ways. I have been licensed to operate the Forklift, Reach, Order Picker and electric ladder. I have also learned several home improvement skills that I have used to assist the customer."
good,"The Home depot is a good company to work. with the Home Depot I have learned about receiving and maintaining inventory. I enjoyed working in Home depot because every day there's something new to learn.  but with the new general manager, they change the Shift time to 10 hours shift. As a new mother,  i couldn't work for such a long hours."
good,"People are always willing to help if you ask; the work is hard, but you are recognized. Management is hard to track down but is willing to listen. In general the people who work with you are friendly and willing to know you on a personal level."
good,"My typical day at work was helping customers which I loved. Sometimes it fast paced, which I also love. Overall, I enjoyed working for Home Depot, and I would love to work there again."
good,"The corporation has the right people and team in place for the company to be successful. On the overall store level depending on what store, management could use improvement."
good,Home Depot is a fair employer.  It is a good place to work if you like to interact with costumers. Working with MET we always had weekends off and a regular schedule
good,"Open door, family style atmosphere company that gives each and all an opportunity to grow and advance in the company.  The company offers excellent benefits, along with 401k and a stock purchase plan.  If you're willing to put in time and hustle, the sky is the limit on where you can go with company."
good,"Generan confianza , empresa socialmente responsable y buen contacto con el personal"
good,It can be a fun competitive environment.  Plenty of room to grow there.  Quick advancement.  Management teaches you to be independent.  Integrity is important.
good,"A typical day involved quite a bit of cleaning and maintenance with multiple interactions with customers. I was in the lumber department so I learned bit about what materials are better used where. Management was good to me, if a little slow with concerns I had. There was always a good vibe among associates, except lumber and deliveries. Hardest part was dealing with customers who demanded a bit more perfection from my work than what I could give. Most enjoyable part was...there was none I guess."
good,Home depot is a great place to gain experience in retail. They offer great benefits for the full-time associates. The pay could be better and there could be more hours offered.
good,"Lots of ongoing training was very helpful.  Great training provided for product knowledge and customer readiness. My job at The Home Depot changed my approach to people, teaching me correct response to situations and customers."
good,"From starting at 9pm unloading a semi trailer, to stocking the shelves, to putting what wasn't finished in the back its a fast-paced, sweaty job, but its enjoyable and you're able to move up in the ranks"
good,its ok people are nice we have freedom with the music and have a relaxed at most sphere for the most part would like a little increase in pay but its alrite to start with
good,"Good Job security, not very qualified management, they do not like many changes. Do not have very good training material, they do not spend money on new equipment or projects. Good team spirit, monthly free food, HD brand clothes for free."
good,"Good company to work for. Not really good at advancing for diversity. Good company culture. Great business model and operations. Good benefits and bonuses,"
good,"Good place to work, was hoping to get on after seasonal work but no positions available right now. People were nice, management seemed fair and approachable."
good,"The Home Depot offers wonderful benefits for both full-time and part-time employees. Compensation is reasonable for the position given. However, it is not as easy to advance as an employee on the freight team. Because the job hours are at night, it is quite difficult to display to management your potential as an employee due to the fact that for majority of your shift none are on site. Developing relationships with the day team is hindered which can leave one feeling unappreciated or not as part of the team. Overall, this is a great company to work for if you are looking for stability, equal opportunity, and the possible potential of career advancement."
good,"great place to work, although there is room for improvement in certain areas, ie: management/employees. work/life balance is not that great, feels like your entire life is scheduled for you. overall though i would definitely recommend home depot to others, and i have. every job is different for each person."
good,"A typical day at work here was always fun. Customers working on different projects came in multiple times a week or even multiple times in a day to get the help and products they needed. This was my first job, so I learned how to cashier and learn how to provide customer service. Management was fair, and they treated all customers and employees with a lot of respect and care. The workplace culture was really fun. Everyone got along with each other and friends were made even if a person did not work in the same department as the other. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do everything since it was a first job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the different projects and people who came in every day and how friendly people were."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting and assisting customers with whatever they needed. I learned how to handle money correctly and work with different people everyday. My favorite part was learning about home improvement products so I was able to take that knowledge home. Management was not the best, a lot of communication problems between managers and department heads. Hardest part of the day was having to deal with difficult customers but always found a way to make it work."
good,"you get a break every two hours and a lunch every six. Recognition of good work.good benefits for part time people"
good,"Working at the cash register was an enjoyable experience. The register at Home Depot is the easiest and the best register I have ever used. It has various menus to choose from, there is many ways to ring up an item, and there were not many problems with the machines, as some of the registers in previous cashier jobs had."
good,"I loved job! I loved and hated my customers and tolerated my managers....then I became a supervisor. Politics at home Depot are petty and childish. District managers say reach out to them if we need to, other store managers say the same. Once you do it gets used against you. Management are petty against each other and put you in the middle. If you want to work at home Depot please do but go up the ladder at your own risk. I used to love my job and now I go for the paycheck."
good,"The associates and managers are fantastic!  Helpful, caring, creative, fun group of people to be around.  As a Salaried manager, you will have little work life balance.  Eleven hour work days plus one hour drive time each way leads to very little time with those you care about (unless you function well with only a few hours sleep.)"
good,Typical retail environment.  They do sometime get lucky and have hired well knowledgeable employees.  They are a gem when you find one of them.  Did work lots of hours.
good,"I've been with Home Depot for over three years now and I would recommend anyone who is open to learning something new in sales or warehousing. What I love most is how helpful and friendly the Home Depot employees are with the customers, very content on finding what you're looking for to help complete your project. It's like they say, “You can do it.  We can help.”"
good,"A good place to start a career in retail sales. Great employee benefits, work enviroment, and job security.If you love working with the public and hands on interactions, The Homedepot is for you."
good,The home depot culture creates a family like workplace resulting in happy employees and heightened customer service. Using brand loyalty and competitive pricing its no wonder they make money. For someone that wants to make a life long career expect to wait years for an opportunity. I would recommend this job to someone trying to find a fun place to work and make life long friendships. Not to someone who wants to make a career out of it.
good,The hardest part of the job was not having enough product for the demand being  generated . The construction boom was great and the remodel craze was on fire .
good,"Taught me to manage my time in a multitasking atmosphere. Coming to work on time, leading department teams and completing small projects before deadline. The ability to always learn was awesome. Providing online tools and classes to take. Workplace was very diverse, interacting with many co-workers from all ages with knowledge and experience. This helped me grow as an individual, becoming Self-motivated and boosting confidence. Some hard parts include over working yourself to complete tasks, meeting customer requirements, maintaining work area and updating data. This all lead me to become more proficient in the work environment, guiding me to be very adaptable in a hectic environment. The most enjoyable part would be the ability to communicate with all types of individuals. Working with a team and growing with them."
good,"The culture at Home Depot is truly about customers first. They empower their associates to take care of costumers above all else and it is because of this that they continue to be successful, and that they are a good place to work. Second to customers are associates who, as far as retail corporations go, they value highly with good benefits and positive work incentives. My only complaint would be that this is a large corporation and as such they never truly put much value on the individual and can treat their workers callously for the ""good of the company."""
good,"Company will work with school schedule. Great part time job. I got paid to fix all kinds of tools. I got to work on small engines and power tools all day. I got to take them apart and order parts and fix them. I would have done it for free. It's no fun when there is not enough help. Things get crazy in rentals during the spring and there needs to be more help at the desk, but a great experience overall."
good,While at The Home Depot Warehouse I was certified to operate several large single man vehicles that are used to raise and lower either the operator to grab smaller pieces from warehouse shelves or raise and lower larger pieces themselves. During my time with Home Depot I was given the responsibility of picking all the larger pieces to be shipped each day for the entire day shift.
good,"There are plenty of tools to help people learn any position within The Home Depot.  The people are friendly, and you get a 15 minute break about every two hours.  You can choose to have a 30 or 60 minute lunch break which is unpaid.  Lots of room for advancement."
good,"Overall Home Depot is a very good company. But in retail the pay is low and the hours are long. Home Depot is not alone in this area. "
good,Work days were demanding and fast paced. They do a good job of caring for their employees while still driving the bottom line. They truly seem uncharacteristically caring for the little guy even though some large corporations can tend to forget.
good,"As a liaison between customer, installer, management and company, a fine balance was achieved to promote the best possible solution for all involved. When hired, the manager was most appreciative of my work. My responsibilities grew, and I reveled in the challenges and enjoyed my job."
good,"The actual employees there are great, i got close with alot of them and i actually looked forward to going to work. Most of management is friendly and understanding. it was a great all around experience."
good,mangement has favorites. i continue to get more resposiblities and rarely get any credit or motivation of the hard work i complete and do not feel valued
good,"From beginning of day to end its non stop for dept supervisors."
good,"This job gave me an opportunity to use my knowledge of the building industry to help the customer with their projects. It was satisfying to solve problems that were blocking the customer from moving forward with their work. I was given Product Knowledge instructions about their existing products and new products and how to use them. This was an on going process to help the employees stay up to date. The management was helpful to allow us time to grow, but encourage us to move forward. On the floor, we as fellow workers were allowed to help each other with their training, and to help the customer. One of the challenges was working on the concrete floor which was hard on my feet. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was being of service to the customer."
good,This company was good to work for because they care about their associates. Making sure that they will get help if needed. Home Depot is about giving the best customer service possible to customers and always about safety for associates and customers by in forcing them always. There is a lounge for eating and there is a t.v. too. There are games in there too.
good,"Fun fast pace job,a lot of heavy lifting involved.Most co-workers were nice and most treated everyone like one big family.They are great with training,"
good,"the people i work with were awesome , management was ok, but overall the whole job experience was pretty good. I would recommend working here for anyone looking for a decent job."
good,"This is a good company for a first job, all the way to an advanced career. You must be diligent, and control your own path. With anything, if you want the advancement it is there, but you must do the work to get there."
good,"If you like a fast pace job that requires you to do a lot of movement, bending, and lifting then this is the place for you. the workload can get hectic sometimes due to large freight coming in or the stores are having some type of sale going on at that given time, which in turns makes the work environment change in order to be able to get the merchandised out ahead of time to the stores."
good,Worked toward weekly sales goals that were given. I enjoyed the fact i was taught product knowledge before heading out to the sales floor.  Enjoyed meeting new people
good,You start your day with a morning meeting and then you get started to work. during breaks employees would play ping pong and table soccer or lift weights.
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot the job wasn't hard. The only issue is some of management assumes the world of some associates. If they can't deliver they get written up. New hires get hired on at better pay than existing more experienced employees
good,"Came in got setup for the day. Did various projects for store setup. Helped Customers, worked with department heads,store and district management to correct issues."
good,"A company that puts its customers first, then its employees. Great benefits with opportunity to advance within the local store or through out the country."
good,Company has the secret sauce. The company understands the customer and listens to what customers want. The company also listens to the voice of their employees for the most part.
good,"The job isn't so bad to be honest the only thing that gets tiring is the work schedule and pay, the benefits aren't so bad if your a fulltime employee. The work schedule really sucks you never have a set time and you might open the store one day then close the other. Also the pay should be better for the work you do."
good,I overall liked working at the Home Depot in Tilton.  Coworkers were awesome and willing to help.  Management sometimes lacked communication with ther employees.
good,I held several positions at home depot. The pay and job were good. This company is very strong in the advancement of their employees.  Benefits are available for full time
good,"Home Depot was a great company in the past, lots of training and lots of chances to move up within the company. There are lots of stores in lots of places so relocating was always possible."
good,"HD was a great place to work and learn about a variety of household items. Once I earned a Department Manager position, the Management Science and overall sales data interpretation was a great benefit to me professionally. Unfortunately, I had a young family at the time and could not stay with the company due to low pay. Some of my colleagues remained with the company and are store and district managers today. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement within Home Depot and it's a good company to work for."
good,the benefits are great here at home depot if you are a full time employee. it is extremely hard to get a full time position here. management doesplay favorites but overall it is a great company to work for.. just dont let the employees mess with your head..
good,Enjoy working there - Don't get too comfortable.  If your job is outsourced they will not make any concessions to help you find another position within the company.
good,"Change can be good, but Home Depot is going through a lot of it right now.  That can lead to some hurt feelings and some burned out engineering teams.  Loyalty can be hard to find here."
good,very nice place to get career growth if you are ready to go above and beyond.Give your maximum and HomeDepot will be giving you lot of training and oppertunity.
good,"it was very fast paced, hard to keep up with numbers that were required per job description. it was very fun working with some of the workers they also hired"
good,"The job was really gratifying, it was great working with such friendly staff and coworkers and it makes your day helping people find what they need or just giving them an overall enjoyable experience. You clock in, everyone greets you, put on your apron and head to the front end for directions from supervisor, head to designated register, sign on and check till, prepare station, greet passing customers and offer assistance, keep station clean and organized, process transactions quickly and accurately, be willing to go out of your way to satisfy a customer, perform any tasks assigned by supervisor, say goodbye to everyone, clock out, go home. When life is complicated, management tends to be very understanding and helpful, resources are provided, help is always available. Availability should be definite upon application as they don't really work with you if you need to change days/hours. You learn a lot about working with registers, money, customers and other various situations. Hardest part is compensating time in advance for the inconsistent hours you will likely receive as an hourly retail associate (such as working late one night and early the next day or scheduling upcoming appointments - must be between three weeks to three months in advance). The best part of the job is the people you work with everyday, regular customers and coworkers alike. The compensation is nice too."
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, cultura laboral de inclusión y balance familiar y de trabajo."
good,very tough job.  All you do is work all the time.  Great if you are a workaholic.  Very tough if you are going to school and work.  In home depot customers come first.
good,Home Depot is a phenomenal place and everyone had the same opportunity in advancement. Everyone was full of life regardless of the situation. I have few complaints about the company for it was outstanding.
good,its mostly making sure everything is stock and put up in the right area so the customers there were satisfied with there visit and made sure the customers got what the want on there time.
good,I had fun @ this job. They need to work on scheduling but they were a good company to work for and they offer benefits to their PT employees which is great.
good,not much that goes on and moving up in the company is rare and the pay in not worth it. there once was a man that told us a story and he never treally told us stories.
good,I enjoyed my last position there as a Merchandiser but decided on a Career change. Decided to go in to a different area of work and to go back to school to upgrade my skills and knowledge.
good,Working at Home Depot part time was a great experience. The staff is nice and well trained and the hours scheduled are fair. If you are looking for benefits they have many options. I highly recommend working for home depot.
good,"I have gotten a lot out of working at The Home Depot. It has really given me a lot of skills and challenged me to grow personally and professionally. The benefits available and financial perks are enticing, however the overall pay, while decent, leaves somewhat to be desired. My position involves interacting with a wide variety of customers and coming up with solutions to their project needs. I enjoy the Customers First attitude that is part of the store culture, and the management does a good job of leading by example. The hardest part of the job for me is feeling spread thin taking care of multiple customers/orders when we're busy. The most enjoyable part for me is using my knowledge and skills to come up with optimal and creative solutions and the feeling that I am genuinely helping people."
good,I do the best I can and be the best cashier that I can be. Do the best and handle customers the best way I can customers can get crazy from time to time.
good,the work atmosphere is great. it makes the job. feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself. coworkers are always willing to teach you new things about what they know best.
good,"I worked in many different areas of Home Depot, but my favorite job had to be paint associate. Most of the associates are easy to get along with. I learned a lot from my supervisor at the service desk. He taught me almost everything there was to running the desk on my own. Management was not very good. They only cared about numbers, not the employees themselves. Management also played favorites with certain people. It was very hard to get promoted due to the favoritism."
good,"The company as a whole follows a strict mentality of customers first. It allows for the beginning foundation of intense customer loyalty to be made. To help maintain and strengthen that customer loyalty the company provides superb benefits to each associate. It's a great place to learn a lot, meet some people you may not have met otherwise and learn what it means to treat the customer first."
good,"The Home Depot was a nice transitional place for me to get back on my feet once getting back into the country. They always give people a chance there and some do well, but many can't handle working hard overnight. I would have loved to work there forever, if only it paid a decent wage and walking on concrete all day wasn't terrible on my knees."
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work, the managers are well balanced and involved. Any questions, concerns are quickly addressed. The store also provides training within itself to accomplish the various duties that will be required."
good,Home depot always made me feel very welcomed into the company straight away and taught me all the things I needed to know before I was put onto the floor. Allowed me to work at my own pace and never made me feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
good,"I like working here, as the people are friendly and helpful, there is adequate training and ongoing computer training provided.  There are benefits available to even part time employees."
good,"It can get extremely stressful and for the pay you get, it's not at all justified, that said, the people and the culture is amazing. Fun place to be at and be a part of."
good,"I enjoy working for Home Depot. It is typically a fast paced environment, however occasionally it is very slow. In my down time I find other things I can help with around the store that do not fall under my daily job duties. I like and dislike this aspect of my job as it gives me an opportunity to learn the store and different departments better, I dislike this as well due as I like to be productive while at work. "
good,"It is a tad difficult to advance. They typically look for someone with a little age on them to move to management. Benefits are great, vacation time is fair. They look out for their employees during hard times. Can be a family atmosphere."
good,Starting out in a new position provided for meaningful learning experience. Dealing with customers opened my eyes to the culture of our current society. Working with various age groups places confidence in our youth to make a better nation in the future.
good,"The pay is okay, If they really want you the will pay up to $15.00 an hour. The work culture is good however management is terrible. They will steal more than employees."
good,"The management was awesome, some were not as great as others but for the most part, it was great. It was team oriented which was great because you rely on one another to get things done. I would recommend this company to my friends and family"
good,"I enjoyed working here but project was short lived, which i believe is par for the course. Would love a solid opportunity here that allowed for a future"
good,"I would help customers find items in the store while simultaneously pulling online customer orders to be ready by the time of the customer's arrival. The balance between focus and interaction has settled in with me at the beginning of my work experience. The management was alright, but I always kept a positive and respectful attitude despite the situation. The hardest part of the job was helping rowdy customers or customers in a rush and don't really want to listen to you speak if you don't know something. The most enjoyable part was interacting with coworkers who were friendly and helpful."
good,it is a good place to start and learn but as student it is hard to get a good schedule hours for working. The employees were wonderful and fun to work.
good,A typical day at the Home Depot is always different.  Definitely not a routine type of job..There is always different challenges arising. The culture here has a family like environment and everyone is very helpful. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people and observing their unique ideas.
good,They really try to make you feel like part of the family and  management is very helpful. Your co-workers care about you & helping out. Though full-time employment rarely becomes available.
good,i started to work here while i was still in college. is a good first job. other places pay better but you meet really nice co workers and customers overall are very nice.
good,"Its very hard and frustrating to take time off at this job. I like the pay and my coworkers are great, but like most jobs there will always be people that make a work day stressful."
good,"great culture. safety is very important,  I would recommend to anyone that wants to grow with a sold company and have room for advancement, Home Depot is definitly the place."
good,"Doesn't matter what level you start at with THD, with hard work, learning and dedication, the opportunities to advance with the company are only limited to an individuals desire to progress."
good,Home Depot is a good work place I would say but me personally im trying to build me a nice resume so that's really the only reason im looking for something new. The skills that you learn in Home Depot I fell you can use in many labor type jobs.
good,"I LOVE this company.  Even if I won the lottery and never had to work again, I'd still choose to work here.  This is one of the companies that actually DOES care about its associates.  They even have resources in place to assist associates in times of need."
good,"Management was great, Culture in my area was fantastic, great people working for the company, i worked in the garden enter and we were in busy season.  there was always people needing assistance and we were always more then willing to provide"
good,I sincerely enjoyed working for this company. They care about their employees and there is a true feeling of team work. It is a fast pace and fun environment. They reward their employees for a job well done.
good,"Great place to work, great  training, low pay for the amount of physical work you put in. No extra pay for learning to use heavy equipment (I.e. Reach truck, forklift, etc.)"
good,The pay for what you do at the job is fair. The amount of hours and benefits is good as well as the time of and insurance. However there is favoritism and unequal workload among other employees.
good,"Good pay, long hours and flexible work schedule. Management looks out for their employees. Diversity among co workers, great job security, safe environment."
good,Decent place to work. Its got a good culture. Those who have knowledge in home improvement will like it at this job. Nobody has been mean in the time I have been there.
good,"Great bunch of people to work with, good benefits and flexible work hours.  Company sponsored lunches once in a while, and lots of training for your position. I liked working there but hard to get full time hours."
good,fast pace  holiday pay  bar-b-qs  profit sharing  fun place to work two  parties a year plus x-mass party  training  training  training training  training
good,I had an awesome time working for the hudson home depot. The people that worked there are always friendly and will help you out whenever you need it. The hours are perfect (5 hours a day) and their are plenty of things to do.
good,"Working as a Lawn and Garden associate at the Home Depot is a great temporary summer job opportunity with good pay. The job can be fast paced and difficult at times, and you will make some mistakes in the beginning however as long as you're willing to learn and grow the job gets much easier."
good,The home depot provides an adventurous work environment.  The pay is above average and the management team is on point. I would recommend anyone o he home depot.
good,"The pay ceiling was raised and the loyal employees were left behind. Its a job not a career."
good,Home depot has taught me alot of what i know today. With learning how to cashier and how to approach customers i thank them for the experience. Home depot in the end was not the right fit for me
good,It's overall a pretty good place to work. I found advancing in the store difficult personally as it takes a long time to hire onto different departments.
good,"Great pay and great people. The job culture is amazing, and like a family. There was somewhat opportunity of advancement. And it is easy to learn different sections of the fulfillment center."
good,"Positive work life balance, good compensation, advancement opportunities won't always available, management was good to interact with and enjoyed working with coworkers."
good,"Not a bad place to work by any means, but if you end up in an operations position such as freight, you will receive no support and have to actively defend everything you do to the sales associates. People will grow lazy on the sales floor and blame you for their shortcomings, and management will never stand up for you. Good place to work as long as you aren't in the back. Also the pay is no longer competitive with the minimum wage increase."
good,it was good place to work but it was only temporary it was a good paying job easy work good people i liked working there it was close to home and i like to be busy
good,"a typical day, other than resets will include servicing a bay.it means checking and maintaining planogram integrity, cleaning and  facing the product. changing and checking prices. building and maintaining displays. doing resets for christmas and spring /summer."
good,Is a very fun place to work at with a lot of interactions with different people. Really focuses on the importance of safety and values the customer to whatever needs.
good,cashiering and helping patrons. Over seeing new employees and making sure they make the company proud. Promote the company credit card. Shoe the patrons where certain items are.
good,"prepare yourself to multitask, literally stretch through the day"
good,The typical work day there is more work on the body than a person should have to do by themselves. teams should really be assigned for trucks that supervisors know have very heavy break down merchandise on them. Also too many people are able to get away with just doing the bare minimum if anything at all and still having a job while others have to pick up their slack to make work goals.
good,The Home Depot is a very employee centered company. They make sure that you know as an employee that your hard work is appreciated. Everybody seems to always want the same thing; to do the right thing.
good,Long operating hours make a work life balance tough. Lots of great internal and external talent make advancement difficult. The company is like another family. A great company to work for if your needs are aligned.
good,I have met many wonderful associates that are now friends and have also met many repeat customers that are friends.  IN the end I can truly say it was a good place to work except for the lack of consistent schedules.
good,My best ever experience working for a big box retailer. Learned so many skills and was given opportunity to move up in the organization. Would actually consider working for Home Depot again.
good,Enjoyed the folks I worked with. Learned much from them all.  Would go back in a minute at the right position. Really enjoyed helping the customer with their paint project. Cross training helped to complete the whole project.
good,"Home Depot is one of the best companies i have ever worked for. A typical day consist of customer help with basically anything, watering all the flowers, selling grills and tractors, helping load mulch, soil, trees you name it. There is never a dull or boring moment with the group of people i work with in the garden center."
good,I worked as an outside vendor and had a Monday through Friday schedule.  Now I believe The Home Depot is doing that service in house which is still primarily Monday through Friday I think.  Working that schedule was best for me because it allowed more time with the family on weekends and evenings.
good,The managers that opened this new location were remarkable. Very intelligent. After 6 months or so the store wasn't doing as well as projected. This caused many to relocate and the new people were never in a good mood due to the poor numbers the store was doing.
good,Working as a cashier there was okay. I tried to get promoted at this job but they do not really have room for promotions. Constantly brought in people from outside the company to fill in management positions.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work part time. Customers rarely complained and management was always supportive. Each associate is knowledgeable in his/her respective field.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for with great opportunities for advancement, if you make it your priority. However, the warehouse work is back breaking and labor intensive. There is a high risk for injury."
good,"Great time, good group of co-workers. Excellent customer service experience and good set of priorities at work (customer first > stocking the shelf) ."
good,Busy fast paced workplace. Lots of training. Friendly management who supports their staff. Hours can be hard as they change from day to day. You can do anything throughout the store as long as you keep busy.
good,Good place to be employed. Paid well with good hours that are flexible but enough to keep you around and getting paid decently. Individuals are always pleasant to work with both with other associates and the management.
good,"Home Depot is great for part-time work because you can pick your availability.  For full time, it's almost impossible to get.  You have to really fight with them to get full-time even after nearly 3 years of employment."
good,The company takes care of there employees and really want to see them become successful. They look out for their employees and take pride in customer service
good,"Arrived at work- Made sure shelves are stocked, Helped customers, cleaned up work area."
good,The people who worked here were very professional and good to work with. I learned alot about working with people and team building skills. The management here was very good and fair.
good,What I like about home depot was the friendly atmosphere. All the employees was very nice and courteous while my time there. The workplace culture was very enjoyable and comfortable
good,"i love working at  home depot enjoying working with the customers keeping them happy."
good,"the work is monotonous and very repetitive."
good,"A great place to work,The hardest part is being under pressure to help the customers in a specific time allotted. Great benefits and awesome supervisors"
good,"Lots to learn and possibilities for advancement. Benefits for part-time and full-time employees, and flexible scheduling. It is a good job for students."
good,"Took job at home depot just moved from Philadelphia didn't know what I wanted but it was work I worked paint department overnight freight at the time I was all over. The place didn't know what I wanted didn't give the chance it deserves,later after talking to people I wish I did"
good,"This company is pretty flexible regarding work hours and rewards well for hard work.  Although there may be an over-abundance of managers, this company offers good benefits."
good,This is a great place to work with great team spirit and great benefits. There is lots of great training and lots of team activities to be involved with.
good,"The main focus of this job was to water plants, stock, and help customers. The management was quite nice but many times it felt like they weren't doing their job. The job was very easy and I found myself asking for more tasks to do because I would finish my tasks fairly early in the work day.The most strenuous part of the job was having to help multiple customers at one time."
good,I loved working here and did not dread going to work. The downside was the customers who would constantly flirt with me and the other cashiers and would continue to make us feel uncomfortable.
good,"Fun, interesting working environment.  As a merchandiser we not only had to deal with our own agenda but had to handle customers on a daily basis.  So, it was difficult to finish our projects and maintain a certain level of customer service."
good,a typical day for me was helping people find the correct sized lumber they needed then if they need it i would cut it. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep busy.
good,"I worked primarily in the Garden Center so I was outside around flowers all day which I loved."
good,This is a great job. The environment is friendly and welcoming. The staff makes sure you feel welcomed and at home. The job is secure and they understand your situation.
good,"Great place to work, the politics of the workplace can be a bit much sometimes though. Lots of room for advancement and scheduled pay increases are nice."
good,"love to solve all of customer's  problems and associating with associates"
good,I interned with Home Depot. The whole experience was great and the program was very well planned and managed. The work environment in very conducive to learning and motivates one to excel.
good,"Typical day is to do safety check of department and pack down missing items.  Inventory ordering and shipment checks are critical for stock. Customer service is number one for Home Depot or anywhere this applicant works. If the customer is not satisfied, they will not return.  Therefore, profit is not made.  The hardest part of the job may have been the prediction of the customers mood as they rush in for an emergency renovation and/or repair.  This applicant found great satisfaction, even in the most difficult of repairs is to find a solution and watch the customer leave satisfied and relieved."
good,At home depot everyone is willing to help you out with any questions you have. You meet new people every day and bond with frequent customers. It is a welcoming environment. The management is willing to work with your needs but you have to constantly remind them sometimes or else nothing will be done. It is very easy to receive awards and such but it is hard to be moved to another department unless you are well communicated with someone of higher management (i.e a supervisor). It is possible to move up but you need to put a lot of effort into it to be noticed. Everyone looks out for each other and works with each other. The coworkers definitely make my day worthwhile.
good,"Most Everyone is great. A couple bad apples can ruin it though."
good,Retail was difficult for me due to the various daily schedules.  I loved to assist customers with purchases.  Some of the jobs I held had physical demands that became difficult for me.
good,"The Home Depot is a great employer, I have been with them for over 10 yrs collectively. I have tried other avenues for employment, but have found myself coming back to Depot and they are always willing to work with me."
good,This is an awesome store. I learned a lot there with the different tools and what they do. Most of the people are nice. You do need to stay on your toes for the contractors.
good,"I have work for Home Depot for over 10 years. I love my job and enjoy what I do. I started as a cashier for a year, started at the pro desk after that and was there for 8 years 2 of those years as a department supervisor. Step down to a head cashier for a year and now currently work at the receiving department which has been my favorite. My only down about it is that after almost 11 years in the company I only make $12hr"
good,"As with any retail store, the right management and right co-workers, all can be good. As a manager, I worked all the shifts, Open, mids, closes, overnights. Not too bad if you are single and without a life, but you have nothing more going than work."
good,Have been a cashier for two years and have loved everyday I have worked. It is a good company to work for. This job is more like a family for me and I would not change it for the world.
good,"The Home Depot was a good place to work,"
good,"Large number of applications require maintenance and enhancements. Both, defects and enhancements are very demanding on the IT Organization. In recent years, Home Depot has adopted Agile practices in order to increase reliability and resiliency of the applications as well as the work-life balance of associates."
good,"This was a great company to work for the location was about 10 min away from my home.the pay was pretty decent,we recieved retail bonuses,they even give part time employees paid vacations"
good,good people management sometimes is rough very nice place to work can move up fast if you want. learn diffrent things how to improve your home learn about sales and all kinds of credits
good,Advancement in the company is available to all. Work hours can be random which makes it challenging for a single mother. Some of the managers and locations are willing to give you a set schedule others are not
good,"It's hard to imagine having more fun working for a different retailer. The management at Home Depot tended to micromanage a little bit but overall they were understanding and helpful. The company worked well with my school hours and allowed me to trade shifts with coworkers so I could work my schedule around the rest of my life which was helpful. I worked in the Lumber and Building Materials department which probably involved more heavy lifting than other departments, but it was always fast paced and fun. I would recommend Home Depot to any physically healthy person, who wants a retail job, and doesn't mind working with their hands. Any complaints I have I would probably have about any other company."
good,"open communication with management"
good,"Clock in work clock out"
good,"Home Depot was awesome, gave me a lot of extra qualifications  to put up under my belt for my future endeavors. Great pay and equal opportunity to advance."
good,"Every company has its own style. It is about on's ability to adapt and add your own outlook."
good,Awesome job for someone in college. Managers work very well with your schedule and the pay is not bad for someone in college. You get to learn a lot about different trades.
good,Stock shelves and changed/updated labels. Clean aisles for customers to know they are in a clean environment and in the right hands. Always different things to do and even more opportunities to obtain a day.
good,"The people are always nice and considerate. It was a pleasure to work with great people on a regular basis, and they were very professional and hard working!"
good,I was a cashier working at home depot here in Hialeah. There would be days where i would be the only cashier open at the register and i would hardly ever get any help.
good,There is always something new to learn here.if youre willing to learn about anything whether it be tools or plants this place will show you in order to shape you into a more knowledgeable assosciate.
good,"Fun to learn all aspects of home improvement. Easy to learn and customer service skills gained from working with home depot, Proud working crew with decent pay."
good,I worked part time and the management was very accommodating as far as my hours were concerned. The people I worked with were great and I learned a lot  with the different classes I took throughout the store.
good,I learned a lot about hard ware tools. I enjoyed working with my department. Management wasn't very proactive and it was very one-sided. I made a lot of relationships with the customers.
good,Working here was fun and if yku make the most of it you can even invest in your personal advancement. The benefits are good and you get rewarded for your hard work.
good,Home Depot was a very good environment to work in. The managers were overall very pleasant as were my co-workers. There was plenty of room for advancement within the system as well. They almost always promoted from within.
good,"Typical day consisted with meeting with my superior and talking about what and where and how we can improve our way to better serve our costumers in finding what there looking for. The work place is easy going and can be enjoyable at times, the hardest part of the job would be having to deal with rude and unpleasant customers."
good,"A typical day consists of assisting customers in product knowledge and selling all and every product associated with their project. Rush hour begins around 10am everyday until about 3:00 pm, which can be a pretty big rush. "
good,"Was a pretty good environment "
good,"I daily reviewing my 'sales goals' and maintaining quality customer service to anyone that enters my showroom."
good,"I have worked for home depot for alost two years.Home depot has played a big part in me landing on my feet and and becoming a productive member of society.I have learned how to work with a team,and fine tune skills I already had.home depot has shown me that I can achieve anything that I set my mind too."
good,"Paint is a small dept. Not a lot to do, but you have to fake like there is a bunch. Pinterest customers are the worst, because they have no idea what they are looking for but they want you to figure it out based on their minimalistic descriptions. Heavy lifting. Lots of heavy lifting. Home Depot rarely gives raises and their bi-yearly Success Sharing meetings only dish out a 50$ check to anyone who isn't a manager, maybe more if we did really good. Other than no company discount and lousy pay increase (if any) there were usually decent people working there. Until the month before Success Sharing then handfuls of people would get randomly fired all at once."
good,"As far as job life goes, its a great place to work. There are lots of opportunities to advance and gain some valuable skills. The main downside i had was management didn't put into account pre-existing workload. They would give page long job tasks on top of the one given to you by your supervisor and expected them to be completed within your shift."
good,"A regular day at work consist of stocking the shelves with products before store opens. Cover the department via customer satisfaction, maintenance, and sets of intense physical lifting. Then clean in preparation for the next day. This job taught me the skills on customer service while being knowledgeable to the products and locations around the store. It developed my customer interaction and gave me the advantage in retail and sales. The management of the company overall was good. The department heads always made note of work being done during shifts. The environment was comfortable and somewhat welcoming while working there. The other employees had no problem working together as a unit to complete various tasks throughout the shift. The hardest part of the job would be the extremely hot weather conditions we had to work in during most days."
good,"Working at HD has allowed me to venture into the unknown of home/house repair, talking to people about there project and coming up with solutions to problems."
good,A typical day at work is arriving at  work on time to your department and receiving your work assignment then get to work on it at the Home Depot I learn different things every day the management is Approachable at anytime treats everyone with respect our Work place culture is customer service the hardest part of the job is not having people to help and the most enjoyable part is when the  costumer go home happy
good,enjoyed being able to be in one department but learn others so I was able to help out if they were short staffed. Overall I think this was a fun place to work.
good,"I have worked for the Home Depot for 10 years and this company has always been good to me and my family. There is a lot of opportunities in the company, especially if you want to move to Atlanta."
good,"I like coming into work, because I work with some great co-workers that I will remain friends with, even after I leave."
good,"Home Depot has a varied day. We start with getting the store ready for customers by stocking shelves and reviewing the readiness of the store."
good,The home depot is a great company to work for and they offer so much to their employees and also have many benefits. I learned that you should always put customers first.
good,"Started out as a cashier then transferred over to the decor department"
good,Everyday you learn something New! You will improve dramatically in customer service and over all responsibility. I enjoyed my work environment although it can get very busy at times.
good,great benefits but sometimes the work/life balance isn't right. Consistent schedules were meant to help the work/life balance and instead hurt it. Good company but the few small complaints are anooying
good,Working with customers is the best time you're going to have working with management can be annoying but overall co workers are kind
good,"This is the second time I have worked part time for Home Depot, they do have a good job/ life balance, as you can pick the days and hours you are available to work and they will schedule you accordingly."
good,"Fast and slow at the same time"
good,Depending on your department the pace can be fast to very slow.  The best position are the specialist position they will lead to advancement and higher pay.
good,Everyday you had to ensure that the front end of the store was clean and tidy. A lot of customers ask you questions on where products are and as a lot associate you don't see much of the inside store so they have you download an app and the app will tell you where exactly each item is as long as Home Depot sells it.
good,The management was super helpful teaching techniques for a fast paced and multi-product stock out. They had a variety of different options for encouraging employees that varied from buying pizza and different meals for the team to a board dedicated at recognizing employees who are going above the bar.
good,Good company to work for however the opportunity for advancement is limited.  The foot in the door thinking with this company will land you just that a foot in the door.  apply for the position best suitable for your job skill and you'll certainly feel rewarded
good,Son una empresa con un buen liderazgo y trato humano
good,You learn a lot about everything. Work with great people. And they are very family oriented. They make you proud to say you work for them.

good,"This company was my first love that I started to work with. Here, I started to become mature and started learning professional life."

good,Good company to work for; good staff of people. Customer service oriented and also for the professional contractor. Difficult to help multiple people at once when busy. Management was supportive.
good,"I have been at Home Depot for about a year as a cashier. For the work you do it pays well, profit sharing is a nice trade off to not getting a discount. The management at my store is fairly reasonable and laid back."
good,Company is great to work and grow in. Fast paced work environment with constant change initiatives. Great pay! People are great a lot of strong talent in the company. Must be willing and able to network with the right people to see quick advancement due to the culture.
good,"A typical work day consist of customer service, stocking, and maintenance. Management has an open door policy. The hardest part of the job is being positive when customers are difficult to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new customers and making them happy!"
good,Working as a cashier at the Home Depot had it's ups and downs like any other job. I learned how to open credit cards for customers as well as other aspects of working in retail. It's a nice environment filled with friendly people and the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely helping customers  find what they need whether that'd be walking them to an isle or opening a credit line for them.
good,Great people and great place to work at. Meet new people everyday and the staff will support you no matter what and will be lenient towards you as long as you do your job.
good,"This is a great place to work for a first job or a job to keep while in college. It is a fun, simple job where you really connect with customers and learn about different people from all over the country."
good,Home Depot is a solid workplace with competitive benefits. You learn a lot through the varying departments. Good job for students and contractor specialists.
good,"Home Depot is a really good place to work, you get to learn a bunch of new cool things, you get to meet and talk to great customers and coworkers. Customers get to know you and look forward to see you working and being their cashier. Being a cashier has taught me a lot of how to treat people. You're taking these people money, and they're what pay my paychecks. A lot of times I deal with people after a long day at work or whatever, their daily lives, I'm the last person they see before leaving the store, they could be having a terrible day and they might be rude and careless but at the end of the I will always act professional if a customer is being rude because they might be having a bad day you never want to make that situation worse than it already is, you have to be nice and friendly just because it might brighten up their day, you never know whats going on in their lives. Always put the customers before yourself while on the floor."
good,"One a regular day, I clock in and then head outside to collect carts to make them available to customers. I also help customers find what they are looking for to help ensure their visit is quick and easy. In addition, whenever customers need help loading their purchases, I am called to come help load whatever that is needed assistance for. My co-workers are enjoyable to be around and are also very hard working. The best part of the job is seeing people smile when i get the opportunity to help whoever needs my assistance."
good,"Good place to work, fast paced and great training. values wheel is the backbone of how they treat each other and the customer"
good,Working their was ok it took me a year of begging just to move from cashier to sales and I had previous sales experience. Over all though it was ok work.
good,I was recently sick with the flu and was out of work for 10 days.  I only had 7 days of sick time so I was written up for the 3 day.  I think this is a terrible policy.
good,"I started on 2001 as lot associate working my way up to department manager in 2002. Opening the seven mile in Meyers store in 2004, managed the pro sales department for next 7 years. Had a lot of success in role, recognize many time by different store managemen"
good,"A typical day at Home Depot was very busy, unless there was a low amount of trucks coming into the receiving side of the warehouse. There was a standard receiving rate expected of you, which was 90%. I achieved well over 100%. It really depended on what you were receiving and what had to be separated on the pallet when they came in.  There was a wide range of items and some were small that the box had to be opened to make sure the amount on the box was correct. I really enjoyed working in the clamp area where I was responsible for tying down large items (such as refrigerators, bathtubs, washer, dryers, etc.). The management was not that great, depending on the manager. Some managers were very encouraging and helpful, others didn't help at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with all of the other associates, even if they only spoke Spanish. The hardest past of the job was lifting very heavy boxes/items that were hard for even stronger men to pick up."
good,"•	Constructed a multitude of projects including; displays, teaching accessories, customer projects, and shelving space"
good,"A typical day at work was clock in, find your register and help customers by cashing them out and answering their questions. I learned about different products and services offered, to work efficiently as a team. Management was easygoing and helpful. Hardest part was working the returns desk. The most enjoyable part was the breaks, and the crew."
good,Good placw to work.  Many volunteer opportunities.  Hands on demos.  Training is simple and easy to comprehend.  Most coworkers are in the teamwork frame of mind.
good,"Home Depot is a company that knows exactly what directions it wants to go and the expectations are set from top to bottom. I learned that Store Appearance means everything and management there wants you to succeed. Culture isn't bad, the hardest part of the job is that everyone doesn't quite understand the hard work that is put in overnight and the most enjoyable part the benefits & discounts."
good,"Nice people and very accepting in all ways, you wouldn't ever think you could remember over 150 peoples names but at some point you'll meet and know everyone"
good,"There is a lot of room for advancement with this company if it is something you wish to pursue. The main drawback would be the salary, but as a part time job it's manageable. I've seen a lot of people move up and the company as a whole seems to really care about its associates"
good,i enjoyed working here being a coach training the new hires and working in a fast paced enviroment i recommend new hires to go work there i enjoyed the place alot inmy time there
good,Lots of travel and 8-10 hour days. Always busy and always trying to stay within deadlines. Decent pay and no benefits. Heavy lifting required.
good,"There are many things about Home Depot that are great. Benefits, company BBQs, cheap Christmas parties and fun events, Team Depot which helps communities in need. "
good,"It's a pretty typical retail experience. They work around school schedules which is very nice. "
good,"i work nights on the freight team, its good consistent work, hours are a bit rough and pay is okay. There is room for advancement, however it is more difficult to promote if you want to stay on nights."
good,All my co-workers at home depot were very professional and very helpful. They all seemed to enjoy their work. Great place to work.
good,Overall a day is productive. Some moments can be so busy that it is difficult to receive immediate assistance from co-workers. The staff is overall easy to work with and helpful with information about their departments.
good,"The work was good, fairly simple. Management was exceptional. Co-Workers were mostly alright. I could have done without the one co-worker and his mother's consistent hostility. The hardest part of the job was the oversized shipments that came in every so often. The most rewarding part was getting to meet and interact with all sorts of exciting people. A Typical day of work entailed arriving an hour before closing, Helping the understaffed Receiving team for a little bit, and then hauling Freight out to my department. For the first hour before the store closed, I would get the opportunity to assist customers in finding what they needed. After closing it got really quiet. And then it was just a matter of sorting, opening, resealing boxes and putting the excess on the overhead after you finish the department. If there was still time you could always help another department finish their work, or do bay directed packdown to get a scope on the inventory and sort what is in the overhead that needs to be on display."
good,"Good atmosphere, decent management support, good benefits."
good,Worked multiple positions over a four year span at my local Home Depot. Over all experience was okay/pretty good. Shifts are no longer than 9 hours and move pretty fast. Good company left to pursue bigger things in life.
good,Es ser disciplinado y ser puntual para la ora de entrada y ser servicial a lo que la empresa manda
good,"Hard to get advancement going up against 10+ other candidates for promotions. There is a lot of middle management, causing a lot of favoritism."
good,"he Depot in the beginning of my work experience was a good place to work.  However the longer I worked there,  the worse it became. They cut the work crews down to skeleton crews and our job duties increased without any wage increase.  As time went on they discontinued monetary awards for work awards given to employees that excelled in the last month. The decisions were always top down, and usually the decisions made the work harder and much less efficient."
good,"I worked at The Home Depot for about 5 months and in that short amount of time I learned almost everything there is to know about flooring. Rather if it was what you needed or how to do it, they taught everything about it in a span of 2 weeks."
good,"It's been some time since I was there.  However, at the time, THD was a great environment that encouraged free-thinking and strong leadership.  Room for advancement.  Competitive pay and benefits."
good,"Home Depot is a company that you can be proud to work for, has an excellent upper management team, is a great brand, promotes a diverse and inclusive work environment, and walks the walk in giving back to the community.  It was not an easy place to work, and is very big, very demanding in terms of results, and will result in long hours for people that take ownership of their role.  Even though it is a very large company, it is still entrepreneurial and it is possible for an individual to make their mark and advance.  It is not a workplace for just anyone, but it is possible to have a satisfying job experience.  Working there will present challenges for someone that is looking for a solid work/life balance, but possible with the right direct supervisor and department."
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot. Base pay is decent, they offer benefits to part time employees. All employees also receive bonuses twice a year. Its an all arou d good company to work for."
good,The Home depot in sevierville is honestly a family. When I worked there I couldn't say enough about the people I worked with. I miss them everyday. I was cross trained from cashier to returns to paint associate as well as garden associate. I loved my time here.
good,"the people i worked with were very cool and friendly"
good,"nice management, great flexibility, which helps your family life be apart of your life. so much room for advancement.  the pay is not much, but you can pick up extra hours to compensate."
good,homedepot is a great company to work for with great benefits. I work returns an working at returns is stressful. but the job is quite easy to do
good,"Home Depot provides an environment that is as diverse as those who work there. Each day presents new opportunities for learning via interaction with co-workers and patrons. The management encourages growth and advancement for those who want it. In addition, the employees are helpful in educating fellow staff in achieving goals. In my opinion, the hardest thing about working there is that we start each day at 5am which requires some adjustment to ones sleeping patterns. However, it also means we get to leave a bit earlier than most jobs and can still enjoy some time during the day for other errands and responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at work will be to first, customer service. Second. keep my department and surrounding areas neat and clean. Operate heavy machinery and keep products in stock. Co workers are diverse."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work. It provides jobs to many people and offers a great diverse and active place to work. The top down culture, offers a great goal but the pay at the bottom makes the culture not reach down as far as it might. Still, if you need a job, the training and opportunity is both vital and reasonable. A solid opportunity awaits you at THD. The higher you climb the better the compensation opportunity and hence, culture."
good,"Its a great entry job with plenty of other positions to transfer to within the company, unless they really need you in a department with a high turn over and will give the runaround when your asking to transfer. 2 bonuses per year. Plus plenty of snacks and food to celebrate each holiday and monthly group birthdays."
good,Coming in at 9 at night. clocking in and going to the meeting room and laying out what has to get done that night and then going to work
good,If you like retail not a bad place to work. There are lots of areas to work in and a lot of hours to be worked. Ifyou get a good manager it can be a great place to work.
good,"During my shift at home depot I would ring up customers items. Made sure they found everything they needed. Clean and stock the work space for the AM shift , count out till. I had a good work relationship with the front end supervisor. Learned a few things from coworkers to help with customers."
good,t was an amazing experience except for the managers who had no regards for workers.I was forced to work in unstable weather even though they were quite aware I was ill.
good,"great steady work.always busy, customers are fun but also trying at times.assist customers with any projects they might have .I also unload freight when it is delivered to the outside garden .Ex mulch or sod"
good,excelente empresa para desarrollo laboral impulsan mucho el crecimiento tiene mucho campo laboral y su ambiente de trabajo es un poco tenso por el giro de la tienda
good,"I love working at the Home Depot RDC because there are a lot of opportunities to expand your skills and move up in the company.  It is always busy from day to day(except during the holidays where it tends to be slow). Probably the biggest thing you may have to overcome is the co-workers and their lack of attention to detail of the job requirements.  Outside of that, you get great benefits plus profit sharing bonuses every quarter and raises every year.

Benefits like medical insurance, PTO, vacation time available to part time employees after first 90 days, and better options for full time.  Quarterly competitive bonuses to all employees based on stores' sales.  Individual rewards given for exceptional performance are cumulative, resulting in monetary rewards after a certain amount.  Encourages company culture and involvement, with store meetings, yearly christmas parties, yearly ""cashier olympics"" to reward those on the front end for speed, accuracy, product knowledge, and attention to detail, and occasional community/charity involvement.  Unfortunately, opportunity to advance depends on management at the store level, which may or may not be guilty of favoritism and sexism across departments.  If you're a woman, or have plans to move from the front end into a department, be sure to talk to several of the hourly employees to get a feel for the managers at that location."

good,"I really enjoying working for the company.  Great benefits even for part timers. Being that I was a full time college student with a 7 year old son, the company really worked with my school schedule.  Management are lazy and be prepared to never get off in time."
good,"For someone with a strong work ethic, this can be a rewarding opportunity.  However, not everyone you will work with has the same work ethic.  There will be those that take every advantage of avoiding work.  You may have to take up the slack."

good,"Working at the customer service desk has definitely equipped me with lots of multitasking, communication, teamwork, problem-solving experience. This location in particular was extremely busy and I was constantly working. The hardest part of the job was the dealing with upset customers and trying to figure out how to fix problems when the computer system was constantly inconsistent. The worst part of this job was knowing that the company decided that this position, which used to be an upgrade from cashier, has now become a lower  paid  position despite having to do ten times as much work in addition to regular cashier duties."
good,"Fast-paced, multitasking. Fielding calls while maintaining customer service. Mastery of the ESVS (home depot operations system) in tandem with the Tool Rental Operations System"

good,The Home Depot as a company was excellent to work for. There benefits are amazing and the company strives to take care of their associates as well as help them in their time of need. I have learned a great deal of skills that I used not just in my home improvement but on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping many customers. Some were as simple as helping find hardware or plants, while others could be a more involved project. Many times you are asked for advice or thoughts on projects customers are working on. It's very rewarding when customers come back and are happy with the results."

good,"it's never the same working at The Home Depot. Everyday is something different, you always get to work with different characters, we always have the opportunities to meet different people and you never get bored. I feel like i've learned a lot and there is still a lot I would like to learn. The hardest part of my job would probably be having to deal with difficult customers, but I feel like that's at every job so it's not really a big deal. If anything i would say the true hardship of my job would be meeting certain goals the company wants us to meet. The most enjoyable part of my job is the work meetings, the holday parties, and the barbeques in appreciation for our hard work and dedication to the company. It's not much but I can honestly say Home Depot has been one of the greatest jobs."
good,I really liked working here co workers were awesome I still talk to some.  Management was great only had a ASM that should have been promoted.  This is a great part time job for anyone...
good,It's okay just wish for more hours. The workdays get real busy which isn't really a problem for me. I always get along with co-workers. Management is fun and joyful. The most enjoyable part of the job is how quickly the day goes by because you are busy. The job isn't all that hard.
good,Home Depot is a very fast paced and challenging work environment. You must have good time skills as well as friendly customer service.
good,Working at the Home Depot is not that bad the only thing that get me is that them management never comes on time when a customer wants to see them and it makes the store look bad.the workers are ok but it's a lot of  favoritism with the managers and some associate
good,"The experience was good ."
good,Strenusous at times but not overwhelming good sense of family values very caring enviornmet with this business management is great with workers.
good,"Company was good to work for! Pay Decent, Benefits good! Management tends to spend most of their time chit chatting instead of working. They put their responsibilities on other employees. Overall not bad though."
good,"Fun to wirk at just brutal on the body. Heavy lifting all day and only 1 hour if rest per day. "

good,"I have been working at Home Depot for the  past six years . My duties at Home Depot is re-stocking product, locate merchandise, cashiering, and customer service via online, in person, and over the phone. Furthermore, the most enjoyable experience is dealing with contractors and assisting them with their projects.I can consider myself as a helpful productive worker. Lastly, the most enjoyable part about my job is solving customer issues."
good,"Home Depot is an excellent company for advancement, but it lacks in assisting employees to obtain security. Home Depot holds you responsible for their sales, you are logged in your personal sales every week, and could be fired on almost very little. You must be careful."
good,The Home Depot company has a wonderful culture and many avenues of advancement.  The Boerne Texas store has in addition wonderful people working there that care for each other and support each other at work and in the community.
good,"Enjoyed working with my co workers learned a lot from customers. Home Depot definitely had great culture and spirit, made many friends and would definitely recommend a friend to work there."
good,"Great company values, but they do little to compensate the associates that work for them unless you are in upper management. Typical corporate company"
good,"My daily routine is to help out with customers and help out with the Home Depot team has needed.  The joy of working with so many different people and cultures is such a wonderful experience.  I love the different ideas and challenges we go through on a daily basics. Everyday is not the same, but one thing just to help your fellow man or woman.  Whatever project or case that has to be done by the end of week, at some point we all have to put our heads together and get the job done.  Just like every other company we do have hard times in the season of working, but at the end of day we respect and love each other."
good,"my co-workers were the best part about that job they always wanted everyone to succeed and would go out of their way help,"
good,This was a company i felt like i could of went far in but unfortunately the procrasitation about advancement became an issue. i would have stayed knowing what i know now because home depot has the employees back.
good,Excelente ambiente laborar reconocimientos por desempeño
good,"easy and fun job"
good,"During summers months it was really busy,Plenty of career advancement opportunities available, decent training provided for initial onboarding, additional training as you continue"
good,"As a sales specialist, I engage customers in the aisles, set up leads and quotes for home improvement services, and educate customers on products and proper techniques for utilizing the products. I started with the company as a cashier, and over the course of 3 years have learned multiple departments, including Flooring, Paint, Appliances, and the Special Service Desk. I have also learned the duties of the Customer Order Specialist, so that I could assist in solving problems with the install aspect of the business. I am also a member of the safety committee and a new associate coach, responsible for training new associates in tasks pertinent to multiple departments. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers with all aspects of their projects. The most difficult part of my job is that due to the fact that I have cross-trained in multiple departments, management looks to me to cover multiple departments. Coworkers will also pass customers off to me instead of seeking the answer to the customer's needs on their own. I have requested a merit raise from the store manager several times, and management has not given me an answer, and puts me off when I ask them about it."
good,"Although the job I had with Home Depot may be considered by some as xtremely physically taxing job, this job was probably the one job I have enjoyed the most over the years.  It kept me busy, and it was a job I could see the results of my work."
good,"Once you get your foot in the door, Home Depot does a great job of taking care of their people. They tend to promote from within. Also, Home Depot provides many associate discounts through their associate website, and have great Health Care benefits."
good,Working for Home Depot is a great experience if someone is willing to learn new things as there are a variety of experts to learn from. It is worth it.
good,"I work in Lumber and Building materials, on any given day we are jumping. The customers come to us with orders and we pull them. Some times customers need help with project and I do my very best to give them the best experience and advice for the improvement or project they are working on. My management team always helps out, wheather on the floor or on the phone or online, I know if I need them one will be there."
good,At home depot is a busy business. just need to work every weekends. Some times the pay is not good. they ask for more when they start to treat bad. And they say they will work with your schedule to fix your life and work is all a lie. they did not work with me at all. so pretty much you are like a slave there all day and weekends.
good,"-Working product on the sales floor"
good,"Working for this company was a great experience. During my shifts I was able to work with a diverse group of individuals. This company truly cares about their employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers by answering any final questions that they had, and providing them with a fast, accurate, and pleasurable check out experience."
good,My typical work day included helping find products that they needed for the task at hand. While not helping customers i would stock the store and keep it clean. The management team was very helpful and focused on making the day fun. The hardest part of the job was learning about all the different product. The most enjoyable part was part the satisfaction of helping out the customers.
good,"Retail, Customer Service, Fast paced and exciting, Hardest part of the job is task completion amongst busy customer facing departments"
good,"While at the Home Depot, I had several supervisory positions.  Lumber, Inside Garden, and Freight Team.  I had as much fun learning from the customers as I did helping them."
good,Overall good culture and good people to work with.  I enjoyed my time there and would consider going back if the opportunity arose.
good,"Home depot is a good place to work. Company supports a family like environment. The company provides excellent employee benefits. The monetary wages are low and the hours for part time employees are very inconsistent. Depending on which department you work in , the job can be somewhat laborious, especially in the lawn & garden department where lifting bales of pine straw and wheat straw is involved along with loading large bags of mulch and fertilizer. Lot attendants are rarely available in lawn and garden so sales associates must assist customers wit loading and unloading heavy and bulky items."
good,"I enjoy coming into work.  Friendly, good attitudes, helping anyone I can.  Everyone is willing to help customer's and each other.  Management is always helping someone; customer's, getting orders ready for customer's.  If there is problem, they make sure the customer is happy.  If the associate has problems or concerns, they will help out.  I like the attitude of these people I work with."
good,My day at work was very busy sometimes stressful. I learned a lot about their products. The management was good never had any problems. I always got along well with all my co-workers. The job was not hard in any way. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Part time and non management positions are most rewarding .Expect as in all retail weekends and evenings are shift priorities.
good,"The management and staff are great but some of the internal politics are a bit unfair. Promotions are slow and rare and there are very few full time opportunities. The benefits they provide are decent (if you can afford them). I struggle as a normal employee to prove my value and earn a promotion. There is some favoritism in upper management, but it still wouldn't hinder me from wanting to advance within this company."
good,"Fast pace, challenging, stressful at times, decent money. Work/ life balance is sometimes non-existant. I've meet good hard working people as well as lazy. Usually lazy people are the first to quit. I enjoy the lunches that we we from time to time."
good,"A typical day involved providing excellent customer service, and making sure the clients needs were met or exceeded. Management was very supportive with answering questions and resolving problems. The staff and coworkers always worked together as a team."
good,THD CCC was a productive work environment that allowed employees to transition to a store location after the contact center closed down. The staff was helpful & provided opportunities for employees to learn more about the business.
good,Home Depot is a great company! But its a very physical demanding job. You get your daily walk every shift. Some costumers become family and others you hate.
good,I enjoyed going to work and my coworkers but I was unable to obtain a full time position. It is an easy going work environment with great pay which i would recomend to anyone.
good,"Every day Arrive, Clock in, work the register, check out customers, clean up, clock out, leave. friendly co-workers and managers."
good,"A full-time job, I have been there for over 10 years. The have afforded me the opportunity to further my education. I am currently working on my masters but I want to use my degree which is in HRM and Home Depot wants you to become a assistant manager before you can be looked at for this position."
good,The Home Depot allows you to work with customers and associates to further your own career and help customers through their home improvement projects. Management gives allows you responsibility for your actions and gives you a certain amount of responsibility on even the lowest level. It's empowering.
good,"As a Merchandiser, I am depeneded apon to make sure store items are where they need to be for the convienience of customers, wether it is building a store display or heloing the customer find the right product they need, every day tends to be  diffrent learning experience."
good,Experienced a lot working for the company. Good and bad but all and all I gained more knowledge those years than I did in High School. Great team of people but do wear out there highest performer's in the warehouse. They have taken advantage of numerous employees but on the other hand management does realize who can handle the job or not. Prime example that there are two sides to every story.
good,Management did not quite understand how to keep employees happy. Always looked to force employees to meet requirements that were never clearly explained.
good,"Fun place to work, but they don't pay enough for the experienced associates. They take advantage of you, make you work several departments at a time. I like my co-workers, hardest part of the job is covering for people that are there and hiding."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for and grow within. I am interested in a different career path that does not correlate with The Home Depot.
good,This company has help me provide a better life for myself and family. i would recommend this company to anybody interested.
good,This has been a great PT job while searching for a more permanent position in the trade show and exhibitor sales business.
good,Its a place to work when there isn't anything better going on plus the pay isn't bad for a part time job. You come in stock shelves help customers and go home.
good,The store has a great team and clientele. They strive to have the latest innovation in the products they carry. My typical day is taking care of safety and helping customers find solutions to their home needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the variety of customers. I don't really have a hardest part as I am able to complete my job duties in a timely manner. I have a great relationship with my co-workers.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y siempre reconocen ti esfuerzo y dedicación alo que haces hay mucha seguridad sobre todo
good,"Enjoyable,days at work. Everyday something new was learned due to the different customers we handled on a daily basis. Co-workers worked as a team to get the daily work required complete. Enjoyed the job the most when I would come across a difficult task. Always ready to resolve and address all aspects of the job."
good,"The Home depot is a good place to work, there is opportunity for advancement within that if you want to grow within it. I had learned a lot by working in this company, from customer service to time management. I even learned a bit more of electrical concepts. It is fun since in a regular day all you do is helping people with different situations, at times is even more of a challenge than just a simple question. Very good place to work if you like challenge."
good,"I worked at Home Depot for a little over 2 years and had to leave due to scheduling issues. I made advancement from outside the store as a lot attendant to inside the store as a garden sales associate. I often would be called in to work different departments when someone   was not scheduled or when they needed extra help. I worked the sessional overnight position which was one of the worst task in the store (by other associate opinions) because afterwards many people were fired or quit while working it. "
good,One of the best things about Home depot is the people that work on the floor. I have now some of the best friends I could ever have
good,Fun work place to work at.. The Managers and dept head make you feel appreciated you get to meet and help a lot of different people everyday..
good,"The staff from this job made this very easy and laid back. I learned great attention to detail as some parts of the job deal with tiny pieces that have to go into certain spots."
good,"I would give this company an overall rating of 4 stars, The work is stimulating and interesting, with constant changes and upgrades in merchandise and IT. The pay is good for a retail sales position. The HR department is responsive for such a large company. There is opportunity for advancement for those who would like it. There is a wide range of customers to keep things interesting. There is room for creativity and strengthening skills."
good,Excellent Company! Our main focus is customer service and putting people first. Great work team and outstanding managers.
good,"Fun place to work with great learning programs, mostly through classes on computer and in person at store meetings.  Very fair management, who worked well with employees.  Enjoyed my job very much at this store.  This was my 'home' store because I worked here so long and knew everyone.  Hated to leave but I moved."
good,"Busy workplace. Upbeat atmosphere. Good employee interaction. However, the pay and employee benefits are sub-standard. A very deliberate chain of command. High turnover."
good,"simple work, best schedule possible but pay is very lacking also high performers are expected to maintain a higher standard of work while getting only marginally better raises"
good,"I love Home Depot for its ATMOSPHERE. however the hours suck and they never have enough people on the floor or loading. Hardest part is customers who fail to get helped because of loaders or disappointed veterans due to the companies polices. "
good,"i got the opportunity to migrate throughout the company working in different departments, with that I learned how to operate several things at one, while maintaining a regular work shift."
good,A typical day would start at 6am to 3 pm. I was a merchandiser which I enjoyed. I liked the hours and dealing with the customers. I got along with my co workers as well as management.
good,"The Home Depot is an amazing place to work If you can handle the long hours. "
good,"The customers are what drove me, to learn more and to assist in more areas than one. The team environment gives a better view of the whole store as one. Most of management did what was necessary to provide the best customer service and do right to the associates. The hardest thing to do was keep up with the freight."
good,"good work area, amazing employers and interesting field of work. A lot of fast pace working and hands on."
good,"At times it was hard, certain shifts were demanding just because the customers were demanding, but it was always a good challenge because thats the point of customer service. The management change really hit some of us hard and it was hard to keep the army moving with no general.The co workers who always offered assistance were the ones who made the day to day life at home depot the best experience, they truly cared and treated me as family."
good,"Time management was hard, sometimes the place would be full other times it would be empty. Overall it was a great experience for customer service."
good,Great atmosphere in the workplace. Fun to work at. Good management. Was easy to feel good at work. Was organized and uniformed in that I felt like I was on a team.
good,I liked to work there.i greet customers as they arrive in the store and provide them with information regarding the products and or services .
good,"A very dynamic and lively organization. Full of activity, fun and work."
good,"A typical day is enjoyable to a degree. I learned that learning from people and talking to people is the single most important thing and rewarding thing in life to me. I do not believe that the management is capable in the long run due to the questionable training and implementation of core values. I enjoy certain aspects of all my co-workers, especially the well-mannered and mature ones. The most challenging part of the job is trying to achieve the set goals with limited employees and a large amount of customers; it's difficult to help a customer find screws and restock the overhead bays as a part-time associate that only has 4 hours a day. I enjoy talking to people the most about their life and just listening and trying to give my ""two cents""."
good,"A typical day for me is quote projects such as decks, houses, roofing, and anything that has to do with home improvement."
good,"While this was only a temporary seasonal position, the work environment was a steady and fast paced place. The environment was customer focused and the workers were like a family."
good,a good company to work for with great staff. flexible hours. i learned a lot of trades i did not know going into the home improvement area. the most rewarding part of this job is satisfaction you get from customers knowing you helped them complete something they normally would not have tried to do on their own. a great company with competitive pay.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot would include customer service, development of product knowledge, ensure floor is filled with merchandise, and communicated with managers for additional tasks."
good,Pretty simple job if management treated everyone fairly. The work is not as hard or stressful if everyone works together.
good,"The Home Depot takes care of their people, and do their best to follow and act out the company's values.  "
good,"A lot of training associated with becoming an employee that can conduct sales on the floor, but Home Depot offers plenty of opportunities to work up the ladder."
good,great work place with great values and okay leadership. overall home depot is a great place to work with many chances to move up with the company
good,"Home depot demands high energy, evolving knowledge, on the job training and knowing the products and services. I learned a lot about home renovations and can now advise on some common projects with much ease. Awesome management that gives respect and lots of energy that trickles down to the team and keeps everyone motivated. Hardest part of the job is long hours while on any given day you can enjoy self-satisfaction."
good,"As a sales associate, I had to make sure the customers needs were met, I had to build relationships with them, and have knowledge on the commodities that were desired by customers."
good,"Usually started at 6AM to have load ready for delivery by 7 each day  Mon - Fri and 1/2 day Sat. Every day was different  in many aspects that made it enjoyable. Working closely with contract delivery company owner and store employees was enjoyable and rewarding. Nothing was considered hard as part of this job. Unfortunately, the contract was not renewed, and I was again looking for work.Employer was Fathead Transport under contract with Home Depot."
good,"Make customers my first priority,offer assistance when needed. Seek to fully understand the customers needs and project. I learned to take an active roll in growing skills, abilities and product knowledge and seeks further understanding of all aspects of the business."
good,"Great place to work. Advancement opportunities based on your abilities, hard work, team player. Fast Paced environment, Management reasonably available."
good,"Enjoyed working here, pay was good, everyone seemed to care about each other, lots of room for advancement. Would recommend anyone to apply here."
good,"Typically a day starts out with walking the department, assessing what needs to take priority (after customers) and setting goals to be accomplished in the time frame that has been given."
good,"Management, and staff are great, depending on the department you are in customers can really chew you out and make your day a little bumpy. Interacting with friendly people makes my job fun."
good,"Home Depot cares about their associates, from free BBQ's to PS4's in the the break room. We work hard for them and they do reward us. There is a real team feeling throughout the store and associates are always willing to help each other out. Great place to work."
good,"Working with home depot really got me prepared to know what it feels like to work in a warehouse setting, which was great for me. I obtained a forklift certification, I worked with electric powwer jacks and other machinery, Everyone I worked with were good people. Management was good. The job wasn't hard at all. The best part of the job was no weekend work."
good,"When we walk for our shift, we are have meetings everyday telling how well we have been doing over the past week and for our daily objectives  The management team are doing as much as they can to change the way the production is handled on a day to day basis inside their walls very seriously. "
good,"A typical day at Home Depot was showing up for my shift at a selected store or at the main office. I would review the shared calendar and see what has been scheduled for myself and other team members in my department. I would then go through out my work day achieving all of my goals and assisting co-workers and customers within the store."
good,"The store is very Busy especially in the afternoon, cashiers have to work very fast to satisfy customers. Many times it is very hard to find help from co workers."
good,"Overall good place to work. worked in many departments, garden plumbing hardware lumber and managed the paint department always made my sales goal plus a lot extra."
good,"As a sales specialist and designer, my day largely consisted of greeting, qualify and recommending home improvement solutions for customers. The best part of the job is the almost limitless amount of training you can take in almost every sales area of the store. The hardest part of the job is not always being able to help every customer because you are busy helping another customer."
good,"Somewhat normal to a retail environment. Helping customers out with products, stocking shelves, using the forklift to carry heavy objects for customers, as well as gathering up the karts in the parking lot."
good,it was a good job the people were nice and the work was easy and the pay was good. i would work there again with out a problem.
good,this job is one that is very hands on and requires a lot of tanning for some departments. it is a big company but they are mostly friendly and management isn't to bad when it comes to treating you as equals. there is room for advancement expressly if you have construction or landscaping experience.
good,"While the work could get tedious at times, the customers and employees were very pleasant for the most part.  Every now and then someone would be having a bad day and they would take it out on the cashier.  As far as part time jobs go this one was a great place to start my working life."
good,I've working for The Home Depot for 6 years now and have had a great experience and enjoy the laid back atmosphere. The pay is o.k. but health insurance for part time is gone.

good,"Service the public as a cashier, offering customer solutions for their problems or finding products with the store and filling the Home Depot customer service standards."
good,My job at Home Depot is very straight forward with everyday customer service skills being used as well as lifting heavy products for customers. In Home Depot I've learned a lot about products and different area or work such as flooring and renovating washrooms to learning about different soils and landscaping techniques.
good,"typically, my day alternates between customer service, building project estimates, picking orders, operating machinery, and various other tasks.  Everything I know of civilian construction was learned here from generic construction practices to woodwork and concrete work.  The most enjoyable part of is solving various problems."
good,fun place to work and easy to stay busy at any time of day. management is very easy to get along with as well. every one there is very good about following safety guidelines.
good,"Home Depot is an excellent company to work for, they have great incentives and is customer driven. Home Depot is a very diverse environment where all are welcomed to work shop and browse without the fear of judgement, very cultured."
good,"I worked part time in the plumbing and hardware depts. I learned how to take care of customers needs, had a very good relationship with my co-workers. Because of my construction work experience, I was able to help out in all the other departments, which I enjoyed"
good,i would come in and check the schedule to make sure that there is coverage.. oversee the cashiers.. see if any needs change or a break/lunch
good,"Great place to work.  Very flexible with the work schedules of part-time worker.  Home Depot is a very good place that pays their employees, offers benefits at the current prices, and offers stock options to full time employees. I typically assess the current product load for the day after being processed by the day timers.  I determine the best way to distribute the unprocessed freight or process it myself.  While stocking and overstocking product I operation the full variety of lift trucks and other powered and un-powered equipment."
good,This is a fun place to work. The employees are great and helpful. Management is always available to help. Great customers too!
good,"Co-workers are great,make the job fun. Hardest part of job is being short staffed.Leaned a lot about retail sales,built computer skills. Management was usually hard working and fair with employees."
good,"Great place to work at, great people to talk to and work with, great work atmosphere, co-workers and management where a joy to work with."
good,"Is a good place to work. You have to be ready to be on your feet most of the hours worked. You can't be scared of hard work for the salary they pay. You have to know your products you are selling or you can't be a great salesman/woman."
good,"What really makes The Home Depot a company worth working for are the people you work with. Everyone their has a different background, and life experience to learn from. With the product knowledge required, and learning about your co-workers its an job that daily bring information overload upon an individual."
good,"Not too bad of a place to work for. The hours are kind of rough working 6 am to 3 pm, but it's work... There's always something different to do every day."
good,"Great environment, love helping people and assisting with things they may need. I learned how to work with different people. Management was okay. Hardest part about the job is standing in a certain area for long hours, being short handed and working late. Enjoyable part is seeing new faces and familiar faces everyday."
good,Assist customers with purchase of appliances.Keep faucets packed down.Keepre views from Consumer Reports current.
good,"Worked as an order puller, assembling, packaging and delivering orders for contractors as well as do-it-yourself customers. High energy work environment that never failed to keep me busy or engaged."
good,Normally I would punch in and then go to my desk where I would help customers pick out carpets and set them up with measures. I haven't learned everything yet but still very eager to learn more.
good,Great job for a great company. Pay is not enough for job duties at times. Advancement can be difficult. Fun exciting. Constantly changing. New technology. On your feet. Build Relationships.
good,"Home Depot is one of the companies that are on top with excellent costumer service. It's a friendly place to work in. I work there as a cashier from april 2, 2015 till present. As I check out costumers I learn about different tools and merchandise that the store brings in. I learned to have patience and above all making the costumers feel welcomed as they enter the store. I Make sure they have a wonderful shopping experience, making them feel comfortable to shop at the store."
good,"A tyipical day at work consists of helping customers, helping them solve their problems and providing them great customer sevice. I learned many things about house improvemnt and tools. Management can be somewhat rude, disrespectful and unprofessinal. The hardest part about the job was being pressured into selling credit. The most enjoyble part of the job was meeting people everyday, and being able help customers."
good,"Terrific business model that produces great profits. The culture in the smaller stores is LIGHT YEARS better than in the large stores. Your management team makes all the difference. Stores would be much better off without so much district and home office interference. Overall, it is a wonderful RETAIL store to work in, if your life can accommodate that type of schedule."
good,"flexible schedules"
good,"~Between busy and slow"
good,"The Home Depot is an economically strong company under excellent management. It stresses safety as a hallmark for company success, and provides its employees appropriate on the job as well as online training to equip them for their daily tasks. The Home Depot prides itself in making the workplace an environmentally friendly work-site for workers, customers, and vendors. The most challenging part of my day is interacting with disgruntled folks, (both customers & co-workers) who are sometimes angry without provocation. I am most gratified when a grateful customer returns to say thank you for your advice regarding a challenging project I had to undertake. Noting that without the advice the project undertaken would have been unsuccessful."
good,"Was a great place to work. I relocated with them to New England. Unfortunately, my parents health was failing, in Florida, so I wanted to come back home. They were not good at relocating again."
good,Easy going place to work.  Easy to work with management.   Is there for the associates.  Company takes care of the associates and helps them move up in the company as they want to.
good,Decent health plan. Great eye plan. 401K and fair stock. If you are young willing to work hard and are looking to move up in the company Home Depot is the place to be.
good,"Working for this company was one of the best experiences i have ever had, even when the challenges seemed overwhelming, there was always something accomplished for that day, Maybe some management didn't pay the attention to detail that some did, and the effort but they knew that if there was a job to be done , they count count on someone. This place also gave me the confidence to continue my career and accomplish my goals and at the end the reward will be there."
good,"Home Depot is a family oriented business with core values that promote a positive environment and excellent customer service. A typical day at work involves working as a team to seek out and serve customers to be best of our ability."
good,"multi tasking of customers freight in a very stressfull environment,management was very strict and objective and critical of your work"
good,"Good place to start your career. "
good,Its a very productive place to work for and the people are very helpful. Its hard work but I liked it because it kept me motivated and it gave me something to look forward to. One of the best companies that I have ever worked for.
good,"My Mgr amazing, I general service merchandise throughout the store making sure prices are correct and that the shelves are stocked along with decontaminating product that does not belong, hardest part finding product to put on shelves if it is not in the proper area. its a low stress job. the team i work with are all team players and willing to help each other out when needed. I enjoy mostly the fact that once done with a bay i stand back and look at how nice it looks for the customers to shop."
good,"The atmosphere of Home Depot is friendly and good place to work. It's an employee family orientated workplace, lots of internal support for there staff. I would work for them again."
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work if you are looking for advancement opportunity.  If you have the right drive and motivation you can excel as far as you desire.
good,Had a fantastic time working here. The people were great and felt like a family. Long hours at times. Managers were great.
good,A typical day was challenging but rewarding. Learned patience. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part was excessive walking. Most enjoyable is assuring orders are correct.
good,"A Normal day would be like crescendo. Low and slow in the beginning, then throughout the day it escalates. The Management team when from when I was hired trumps all the misplaced idiots that came through. As co-workers, we were more than just teammates. We were family. Hardest part of any retail job is the fluctuation in business, as well as not being to complete training due to scheduling conflicts."
good,"The Home Depot has taught me a lot. I've received my reach-truck and order picker license, learned how to efficiently close a department down, gained tons knowledge on how to treat customers and much more. Good place to work."
good,Great place to work opportunities for advancement great benefits love the employees. They care about community and believes in giving back.
good,decent hours for part time has befits as a part timer. good for older person looking for something to do. can get you by during perk seasons but slows in winter for most to need second job
good,"Hard work, most of it enjoyable.  Meeting a lot of people.  Customer service a must. Alot of changes.  The people I worked with were mostly great."
good,"Ensure store appearance is excellent"
good,"A typical day consisted of filling in holes and bringing down overhead product with stand up forklifts, or bringing down big items with the overhead picker.  I learned a lot about the different departments within the company itself, garden, paint, etc.  The management needed improvement for the most part but it was still a good place to work.  Great co-workers and mostly people willing to help one another.  The hardest part of my job was juggling multiple tasks within a solid work day, but it was able to be done.  The most enjoyable part of my job had to be operating the stand up forklifts to retrieve items that were shrink wrapped onto pallets."
good,"Great co-workers and a good place to learn about the importance of great customer service."
good,An excellent company although remuneration was not very high and there was not enough employees to fulfill needed tasks.
good,"Managers are competent and friendly, staff is well versed in their field. Plenty of room to move and grow within the company"
good,"I got along with my co-workers and managers. They work was pretty enjoyable, working in the garden area was my favorite. As a cashier, they would have us perform great customer service. Example, if a customer was purchasing something that was in a package, we were to open it up and check for damage. What I didn't like about it was the inconsistent hours."
good,Always work to be done no down time. The employees are mostly positive and like working there. Management is willing to assist with work with no questions asked.
good,"I worked for Home Depot for 9 years, I really enjoyed the people I worked with. The company kept making changes so that jobs were changing constantly. It stopped being fun, and the pressure on the mid management was great. Not worth it."
good,"A good place to work, minimum supervision. Relaxed environment with friendly folks to work with. Management works alongside regular employees so that they know the good and bad of the job. Just don't like sales if i can find a job with a future that i prefer."
good,"Good working environment, friendly coworkers and managers. I worked on an EPJ Transporting good to specific areas. overall I liked it."
good,"Great culture and experience, positive energy and room for growth. The amenities in the building are amazing for example the gym, cafe and credit union, pharmacy and cvs are all on the first floor"
good,"A typical day at work, would start, either at the break of dawn or after leaving the school parking lot and ready to do a great job. Something that is worth a lesson is worth learning, and working at The Home Depot definitely taught me a lesson, because work builds character and work at The Home Depot was never a drag. From every angle I saw at the time everything seemed to be running smoothly, management always knew when and where to take action, and amiable as always. Co-workers, at the present time may or not be in training for new positions, and for the most part when working at The Home Depot at the time Co-workers were always on task. Willing to answer anyone's questions, I would say that that particular year was a great year for The location, for the staff, the management. Even when the job changed pace, during contractor hrs, during a sick employee absence the job is still very enjoyable."
good,"There are alot of politics, compensation and benefits could be better, expectations are demanding, overall there goal in mind is customer service. If you like the retail world overall it can be a fun place to work,"
good,"a typical day at work was pretty straight forward, collect carts and help customers load products that where too heavy for them to lift. i learned things from receiving like how to flag a forklift operator how to lift heavy products the right way and NOT to use my back and lift with my knees. I enjoyed my coworkers they were all very kind and funny. The hardest part of my job was when i would be the only one scheduled to work and it was extremely busy or during a rain/snow storm. finally the most enjoyable part of my day/job was seeing the lot clean by the end of my shift."
good,"Working at the Home Depot is great - the people are nice, you have what it takes to do your job well and there are even bonuses. However, the lack of full time positions offered, can be a bitter spot to those who would like to have only one job. I recommend Home Depot to anyone who needs a fun, somewhat challenging part-time job."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work; if you're willing to work with them in the long haul without a college degree or in college proper. Despite dealing with difficult customers on some days the culture of working there is very relaxed. Pay isn't all that great raises are very gradual at first. However paid vacation and sick time is available on accumulation in addition to perks like stock options and semi-annual bonuses.
good,It is a good place to work if you like hands on type of work. You can find someone to answer any questions for any project that you may be working on.The employees are good people also.
good,"I was able to work my way up to ASM from Sales Associate.  I found that HD wanted me to succeed and gave me lots of essential training.  I really appreciated the teamwork and the positive work environment overall. It has it's moments:  late hours, some employees who don't care or are just bad, some disconnection with management.  but overall I thought it was a great place to work and I am a better person for being there."
good,The Home Depot is a fun place to work. The company provides food at various time through out the year. Associates from one department will try to help out other departments if that associate is busy with a customer.
good,"Learning experience, fun place to work. Access to new items and ideas.Management is great and encouraging to new employees, department training is helpful."
good,I enjoyed working at Winn Dixie the management was very professional. However I wanted to become full time and I was not able to get full time hours there.
good,"Home depot is a great company to work for. Shifts are in rotating bais. not a typical eight to five job, always interacting with customer, meet new people everyday. Its great to be there"
good,Every day varies depending on the customers needs and what we are able to help them with. Customers are good and really make the job along with co-workers.
good,"I did enjoy working for the company. Every store is ran differently, some salary managers were great to work with others not so well."
good,"Home Depot has a great social committee that frequently plans fun events. At least once per month they cook breakfast, bring in baked goods, etc. They also do their best to get to know you as an individual."
good,Worked on AR and Work Comp issues required detail and analysis. Autonomy was encouraged. Management was supportive. Some co-workers had difficult personalities to work with. I enjoyed the data analysis and problem solving involved.
good,"I worked most of 30 years at HD - I started as a Cashier working in one of the first retail stores and was supported and  promoted throughout my tenure. For over 10 years I was a Director at the Corporate Office and my organizations focused on Store and Leadership Training and Customer Service."
good,"Llegába al trabajo, nos hablában para pintar una casa, salímos y cumplíamos con lo pedido, ordenába el almacén de herramientas, etc..."
good,"Home depot is  a nice company they take care of their employees, its worth working for. supportive in terms of caring of people and customers but it is like a politics that you have to be near to the bosses to be noticed and get higher positions,base what ive experienced was the favoritism of person they wanted to put on higher positions even if they arent deserving, however the company itself is at it best. i rated the company for 10 and the management is 6.."
good,Fun fast work pace with nothing the same twice.  Benefits are really good and are worth it.  Politics can be some what out there but all around management tries to work with you as much as they can.
good,a typical day at work would be kind of busy stocking my department and turning around helping the customers and then helping out in other areas
good,great job it has very good benefits they really care about there worker  I love getting bonus checks every 6 months they do a lot for the community also
good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
good,"As my first real job, this place will always have a special place in my heart. I grew in knowledge and positions in a year and a half. The people I work with are still great friends. It is all about the customer, and I love that."
good,This place is perfect for the college student looking for a part-time job. Flexible hours and I really enjoy working with my co-workers
good,"• Start with Safety Top to the team"
good,"Good people to work with. Learned much about dealing with public, addressing customers problems and concerns. Learned to assist customers to plan projects and select appropriate tools and equipment to get job done. This was the best part of job."
good,"The Home Depot offers a standard retail job.  There are lots of people that work there and a pretty high turnover rate.  The management is acceptable.  As far as retail companies go, this one is pretty good."
good,I learned a lot here at THD it was a great steeping stone to many other jobs the pay is good people are fun and you learn a lot while you are there.
good,"As a key carrier, I am asked almost daily to fill in for an assistant manager at some point, whether it is to cover a lunch break or open the store, or occasionally to cover a shift when someone is on vacation.  I can easily transition from being an associate in a specific department to the role of management where I must focus on the entire store.  I try to learn something new every day, from a product in another department or how to dig in to a report I am unfamiliar with.  I enjoy helping customers as well as helping the associates in my store.  I feel I am a good resource for new and long term associates on nearly anything relating to customer service or processes.  I have become a mentor to newer department supervisors also, teaching them processes that must be done on a regular basis as well as how to work reports that are required for our position."
good,"Home Depot was never had a day typical that was typical during my employment. This was because all guest and customers had different ideas for there home designs or lawn care. My department was in merchandising and I was able to learn much about outside gardening, inventory, and restocking merchandise. My management and co-workers were always easy to talk to and assist  me. The hardest part of the day was at that point, lifting extremely heavy items though out the day. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was during Christmas season and loading up Christmas trees."
good,"Fun Place to work for the most part. Orange Team spirit is evident. "
good,Great company to work for. Unfortunately the chance of advancement is no longer there.HD is o longer opening stores like they used to. Great focus on changing the customer service aspect at the store level as well as being well stocked. Mid management lack the enthusiasm that you would expect. Seem to have settled with the position they are in. Interaction with staff and customer are the biggest and the best part of the job. Ongoing problem solving and merchandising are also big parts of the job.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Fast pace store. we host kids workshops, and kids events. The store gets very busy during holiday sales."
good,"Great company, but the only thing is that you don't get discounts. You do get bonus every six months. I really enjoyed the company."
good,"A typical day can range from fast past to slow and steady"
good,"Mix and shake paint for customers, customer service, helped pick out paint colors for the customer. I also had to stock shelves and back stock."
good,Excellent company.  Provide a healthy balance of work/life for the betterment of family structure.  Allows the employee to explore many different types of avenues within a large company.
good,"I started doing phone customer service and got a promotion for email customer service. A typical day consisted of answering emails from customers quickly. The emails could deal with item specs, order status, and the list goes on. We must meet certain stats, QA'd, and such. "
good,"On a typical day at work I work with a team of people that are friendly and easy to work alongside. I use the skills the home depot has taught me to work towards the final goal of customer service. "
good,"It's touch and go with the management team --- sometimes you have a strong management team with a positive approach, sometimes managers will transfer in and have negative attributes such as having favorites, not showing appreciation and respect to hard working associates, etc."
good,Good Management and good co-workers. Overall a good experience to work. Training is provided to upgrade all employees and occasionally pizza served to celebrate the success.
good,Helping others on the daily played a big part.  Co workers were always friendly and helping the person next to them.  Receiving a thank you after helping customers is always a confident booster.
good,"Health and fun can be together.  While employed hear I learned about diet, strength training, management was very flexible with schedule.  Co workers were friendly and worked together well.  The most difficult part of job was tracking work out sessions."
good,"I sustained an injury which required hernia surgery. Since I was hired during the spring sales expansion period for the produce department, I was not able to complete the required period for continued employment due to the timing of the injury. I was given a future employable rating however."
good,"At The Home Depot there was never a day that was not busy. The costumers would come and as I would greet them, I would tell them where to go and find what they needed. Management was great! There was never a dull moment but when it cam down to it, they would get serious and tell things how they were. Co workers were willing to help out. As I started, I would need to ask a lot of questions and they never hesitated to help me or the costumers."
good,"Help people check out after getting what they needed."
good,"My days normally are engaging customers at the store or by phone, listening and assisting theirs needs, based on the projects and ideas offer all kinds of products and services to fulfill them and get the job done."
good,It needed more organization. Management was not fair with all employees. Also the pay was very low for a night crew. The day shift got paid way more.
good,"On an average day you can go from trying to find something to do, to not being able to catch you're breath between helping customers and trying to make sure the store looks presentable."
good,"Trouble shooting, estimating and then repairing the equipment."
good,My days were long and had it's ups and downs at the home depot. Putting that aside it still felt great going into work every day. I wished it gave me more opportunities to climb up in the positions and given me full-time after being with the company for almost seven years.
good,i liked working here but to advance you had to either know someone and be liked in that department or they choose favorites. Not very equal when it comes to work employees overall i would say this is a good first job out of high school but career wise is very hard to come by.
good,"Though my employment was only a short temporary position, and the work was tough and dirty, the environment was great. The effort to make sure their employees have access to food and drink is such a refreshing change from most corporate structures. Everyone was always very friendly and willing to help. Very little negativity was cast down onto new employees still learning the basics of their respective jobs. One gripe I did have was a gross lack of communication. (it should be noted that this was only an occasional problem and never anything too important that wasn't easily fixed when brought to the attention of appropriate persons) There were several instances where problems could have been avoided if only a bit more communicating between management had happened."
good,i enjoyed working with my customers . i was very passionate to make sure i gave the correct information and right advice on how to pursue the project that my customers were engaging in
good,Depending on if you're one of the chosen you can either advance quickly or stay idle in an ok position. All in all its a good place to work with a lot of ways to branch off to other jobs.
good,Is excellent in constructing career plans with employees to advance in their future careers with the company. They are flexible with college students and work hard to ensure a safe and fair work environment.
good,"I start by pulling freight off the trucks, then I organize the freight by department before I take the freight to the floor on carts. I have learned how to operate forklift, electric pallet jack, order picker, pacer unit, and reach lift. I have also learn to file paper work and communicate with costumers. The management is very good at there jobs. The other associates are hard working, easy to talk to, and nice people. The hardest part is having to do a two person lift by myself. Finally the part I enjoy the most is the interaction with the costumers."
good,"Busy. "
good,Typical day at home Depot would be just like the clean up song; If everybody does they're part everything will be great. someday are easier than others but you can't really complain.
good,i enjoyed Home Depot and the employees that work their. I got to get up close and personal with all the customers. Giving customers exactly what they are looking for was always a plus just to see their reactions to the knowledge I had given them felt amazing.
good,"The day went by quickly and it was different everyday. You have to work flexible hours. Retail is not for everyone but I liked it. "
good,"While your in school this is a good place to be, mind you it is hard to advance if your a woman in this career path. I like the management because they listen to you, but they do not do much about certain things. I like that they let me work in multiple areas."
good,"The company was too busy trying to decide whether to help the customer or their employees. The employees were too focused on getting the awards and getting themselves out of trouble, but you'll have that anywhere, right? "
good,"helping customers  find the perfect tool ,managers was very open minded,co workers was very helpful,hardest part was making sure the customer left happy"
good,"Great place for a retiree or school kids looking for a part time job. For a company that banked 76.8 Billion in 2014, they sure are stingy with their pay. Starting at less than most fast food places. The benefits are decent. The people are mostly nice to work with, as with all companies, you have your little groups. Great paid vacation scheduling. By your 5th year you have 3 weeks. Enjoy customer service, and seeing regulars coming in."
good,"Good company to work for , for a  short time and hours are good, not to far to travel from home.The compay.t needs more Diversity and African American in more Manangement  Positions."
good,"This company offers a range of benefits, even to part time employees. Home Depot offers a strong sense of community culture, so much so in fact that I feel like my job often impedes my social life, and personal obligations. The pay rate is respectable, but if not livable if you are only part time ( company policy dictates part timers must remain under 29 hours each week). Working at home depot you can often find yourself performing tasks that may or may not be directly related to your position or title (for example back up cashiering, taking out trash, sweeping, cleaning parking lot, etc.) Overall a nice company to work for, but can be physically demanding."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work for a certain amount of time. It isn't and shouldn't be a place for people to work until retirement. It really sucks you in once you've worked there over 6 months. Most people that work there have been there for 10+ years and only dream about quitting but never do. If you are looking for a job, this is an easy hire. But if you are a person with a future, my advice to you would be not to get caught up in its mess."
good,"Advancement within the company was great, I personally went from cashier to shift manager to final front end manager, all in one year. if you can show them your worth, they will promote you, great job."
good,you have to wait 6 months before being thought about being promoted to a different dept. I think if your qualified in that dept. it should not matter
good,"The company an their beliefs are reflected extremely well with a huge emphasis on customer satisfaction and teamwork. Management was very good with clear and direct instructions for the employees. Due to being a part-time worker, my days varied from being hectic and busy to calm and relaxed. The hardest part of the job was being towards the bottom end of the employee ladder. While the company tries their best to be fair to others, I was called on to do a lot of assisting and working in other departments. The most enjoyable was the people. Due to the company hiring and having great employees, I did not mind doing the extra work. The extra work felt rewarding at the end of the day."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for, there are Pro's and Con's like any place. As a manager you have to be prepared to work long hours. If you have a family it is something to heavily consider as this can impact your ability to see and spend time with them. The compensation and the benefits are great and even though a lot is asked of you, the rewards (personally & professionally) are worth it."
good,"Manage associates on the floor, set product according to plan, restock product, help the store wherever I can, interaction with customers and vendors.  Best part of my job is serving customers and making sure they have what they need to get their project completed.  Most of the manager are top notch but could use some inter personal relationship guidance to situations that arise dealing with customers or store associates.  Overall good place to work."
good,Not a bad place to work. Full time hours are hard to come by if you are a new associate. Easy to move up the ladder if that is what you want however.
good,"Each day was different"
good,"I was employee of Home Depot for 1 1/2 years and was treated with all respect. I had some medical conditions that kept me out of work for a couple months. Due to the process to go back to work the periods extended. I always had doctors consent but after third time was terminated. Finally after they found blockage in artery to heart, now doing better with rehab. Love working for Home Depot and the employees working there."
good,"Loved the fast paced responsibilities of running the register, I thoroughly enjoy all the people I get to work with on a daily basis, and enjoy the interaction with Customers."
good,"Great place to work, fun environment, great people. The pay is lacking and the hours are few. The hardest part of the job is all the standing and walking one does for the whole shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and helping them complete their projects."
good,"A typical day at the home depot would include helping customers with their home improvement projects. Also, by running machines such as forklifts and order pickers. I have learned a great deal about many different home improvement areas such as installing flooring, plumbing, construction, and landscaping. I am nursery certified. The hardest part of the job would be not being able to help customers with tricky situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning everyday about things you do not know much about, which can be from fellow associates or even customers/contractors."
good,"Great place to work, especially when working under a experience management that understands the value of having people working with them not for them."
good,Overall Home Depot Measurement Services is a fine company. They offer some flexibility in scheduling. They also offer very nice benefits. The downside is little meaningful compensation for driving expenses.
good,"Lots of pallets and freight to work on a nightly basis. Very minimal drama, and friendly, respectful people. Due to federal laws the company limits the amount of hours your allowed to work because they don't want to provide certain benefits to employees."
good,"Come in at scheduled shift and punch in. Assist customers in finding products or help the customer learn about them to make the best decision. Process payments, set up appointments and measurements, plan kitchen designs, this all depends on the department of course. Overall, provide exceptional customer service. Break every 2 hours and a 1 hour or 30 minute lunch. Co-workers are good hearted people willing to help. Very laid back environment with fun activities on holidays. Yearly raises, and bonuses called Homer Badges based on surveys and customer reviews."
good,"gain familiarity with the products, product location and store layout to provide the most efficient and highest quality service to our customers."
good,"At Home Depot , things are always changing. It gives great opportunity to learn other departments, while keeping the customer and your home department in focus."
good,Very team oriented and positive environment to work in.  Training in all areas is excellent.  Ability to cross train very easy.
good,Job focuses on maintaining a high level on customer service. Nice work environment. Managers are very helpful. Great Benefits. Flexible schedules.
good,A mostly equal oppertunity place to work.  To much micro management and not enough listening to workers with in store problems.  Manager and HR person try to work well with schedule always.  Hardest part of job is standing for several hours in one place.  Co-workers are mostly all great.  The most enjoyable part is working with people and helping them.
good,"- Customer service was an everyday priority"
good,"After working at The Home Depot for only a few months, I have to say that it is not the best work environment. There is lack of communication, but there is room to move up and the management team are willing to work with personal matters."
good,Good environment and but not enough hours starts you out part-time. Great customers very pleasant. Good learning tools
good,"I enjoy my job as well as my co-workers. My job has very rewarding qualities, but at the same time it can be very challenging to meet customers needs. A challenge I welcome. The most strenuous part of the job is being on your feet for an entire shift, and a LOT of walking...BIG store! I work the Hardware Department, so I am moving some very heavy merchandise at times. I most enjoy interacting with co-workers and customers, as I get to meet very interesting people. The best part of my job is the satisfaction of handling a persons needs to improve the quality of their home, or whatever project they may be working on at the time. My passion and pride is what I feel places me above and beyond all expectations of any potential employment! My only frustration is that some people take advantage of such a large corporation that cannot possibly monitor so many associates, and hold them accountable for their potential adverse behaviors."
good,"Working at home depot requires upbeat customer service and an attitude for hard work. If that sounds like you, this is a great job."
good,Home depot does certain functions to promote fun in the workplace.  I enjoyed the in house competitions and perks.  Monday meetings were very informative and layed out the plans for the upcoming week
good,"For a typical day at work, I usually come in 15 minutes early to set up the things I need to start my day. Depening on the call volume your day can either go by fast or slow. After working their for a couple of weeks you'll get use to your customers calling in and you will start develop relationships. I like the fact that you get work independently. Certain people in management can be helpful, and some act like they don't have the time of pay to be bothered. My coworkers are okay, usually everyone is in their own world. My favorite part of this job would be interacting with customer and making sure their needs are met."
good,Great place to learn tons about home improvement and meet great people. Lots of opportunity to work in many different fields. And its fun! My managers were always really good people.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for if you see yourself in a retail profession, however the hours are insane and weekends and holidays are always worked especially as you get into management positions,which, is where the decent pay starts."
good,There are LOTS of contractors that come on a daily bases(some more than 5 times a day) so there is always a way to stay busy. the customers there are VERY pleasant and easy to get along with.
good,Very relax management and nice environment to work for. I had the pleasure to work in various departments and had to learn most job skills by going in a computer simulation.
good,"a typical day at work would be unloading the truck, putting items on the cart, pull carts to their designated areas and start to unload the carts and stock the shelves."
good,"Everyone welcomes you,good work environment.A regular day of work includes punching in and out on your set hours.Really fun and friendly place.co workers always try and help one another.overall good place for someone to start off as a first job"
good,"Its great if you can get along with the right people, other than that its very hetic and its not for people who keep to themselves"
good,A big part of Home Depot is the interactions with customers. I enjoy that the most about the job because when you deal with people there is always something new. Everyone is different and that means each time there is a different approach to helping them out.
good,The most enjoyable part of my current job is helping customers and being the team captain of the Kids Workshop. I like working with my associates and training them to be the best they can be.
good,"I loved going to work every day. I learned that I enjoyed working with the public. All the managers where always pleasant, and very helpful. I was blessed to work with many different individuals. I enjoyed working with each and every one of them. I wouldn't really say that there was anything hard about my job, other than the occasional un-happy customer. The most enjoyable part was working with a great group of people."
good,It's a good place to work; advancement is only possible if you know someone in management. Scheduling is controversial with favoritism playing a big role.
good,I enjoyed working as a home depot cashier because we learned alot about customer service and putting customers first. Our work days went by fast due to being busy.
good,"I start my day going through the computer to get all will call's and deliveries ready for my order puller and pro delivery driver. my job is very active, physically and mentally. I work with great people i call my friends now"
good,"Although I did enjoy this job, I felt as if I was just another plumbing guy in a team of people just looking for a job. When I was hired for the plumbing pro position specifically."
good,"Home Depot is a company that likes to see people succeed in whatever they choose to do. They are friendly and give customer service a high priority, along with keeping shelves stocked and keep up with store appearance and safety."
good,Typical day would start at 6:45 am. Sitting and waiting on calls is a daily process. When calls start to come in the queue the day of assisting HD associate starts.Management is in a different state so communication is either done view email/phone.Co-workers are extremely helpful and the atmosphere is really genuine. If there is any help needed we can discuss it with our neighbor coworkers.The most difficult part of the job is finding the correct information if no one is available and if the topic cant be found in the search.
good,"Home Improvements if you like it, good company to work for, good benefits, great knowledgeable people, customer service based, need to knowledge and always learning everyday. Just stay away from the Outside sales part of it, travel all over the place with no gas reimbursement or food. Waste of time selling to people that just want to kick tires and just get quotes until next year when they have money. Internally, very good."
good,Great place to work you can learn a lot about your job from the people you help on a daily basics.Management staff is great because they would not ask you to do something if don't know how to and the co-workers are awesome because they will take time to show you how things work.
good,"Overall Home Depot is an excellent employer to work for, they have great benefits. Mostly the people you work with are pretty fun to work with. The pay is OK and management could be a little better."
good,You are given the opportunity to learn as many departments you have an interest in undertaking; you set your own learning curve within the business of home improvement.The experiences you have with your co-workers is what encourages you to return to work each day and is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I have been very lucky to be self employed for the majority of my life. Working for a big box cooperate business made me realize how important it is to be a team player in every aspect of your position;  to create a positive work environment for all other associates, as well as fulfilling all corporate interests and demands. The most difficult part of working for a big box department store is that you lose a lot of the one on one reactions of working with each and every customer to provide them with the best customer service possible."
good,"Stocking shelves, helping customers, making sure inventory is correct, unloading trucks. I've learned various tools assosciated with hardware and their purposes. my co workers are all friendly in my department. the hardest part of the job is dealing with theifs simply because associates aren't allowed to stop them. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer find what they need."
good,Enjoyed my time with home depot! great learning experience for the future for my career! would reccomend anyone who love to be active in the work place to work there.
good,"My day starts off with stretching so we can warm our muscles up due to all the lifting we do. I have become more a neat freak, making sure everything is in order. i would like to do it right the first time so i do not have to go back and do it again. Working with a lot of different people can be scary, but everyone is friendly and is a big family. The hardest part of my job is getting up at 4:00am for work. I love how I am treated like an adult and I am always learning something new."
good,"The schedule for the MET team was ideal.  Monday through Friday - 6:00am - 2:30pm."
good,"I would get to work about 30 minutes before my shift started, talk to a couple of co-workers. And as I was going out to start my shift I would ask the current Associate in my position if anything change or what needed to be taken care of. I would always greet customers and help anyone he seem like they needed help or asked for help. I also had a walkie talkie and was always on standby to be called into the store in case some one needed help there."
good,Flexible schedules. The customers are people from across the country which makes the workplace vibrant. The co-workers are great and I enjoy meeting new people and helping others any way that I can.
good,"i really loved home depot. i started working here right after i turned 18, and had it not been for a family crisis, i would have never left. There was a lot of favoritism and politics, but you will find that in any corporate business. The store associates became my family, and i made friends of a lifetime!"
good,"I worked on the MET team which is a group of merchandisers for the store. My schedule was 6am-11am mon-fri. I usually stayed an extra hour each day if allowed. I loved my supervisor, which was a stroke of luck and nothing the company could control. Most of my co-workers were awesome and we all loved playing around with each other when we could which was the best part. The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish so much with little or no resources. My supplies were always running out, or the equipment i needed to use was broken. Everyone there was stretched out to do so much and customers weren't getting the help they needed."
good,comentment dedication percision teamwork and demostrating patience is what i describe the typical work day at homedepot..i believe the managment at the San Carlos Homedepot for the most part is up to pare but there be times where its hard to get in contact with a manager sometimes there wont be any other co-worker who can spot you when you need to bring down an certain item for a customer..honestly there is nothing hard about working at the homedepot because i dont look at things as just a task that needs to be done. i look at it as an step of improving at every moment: so if there is an rude customer who's yelling and complaining im not going to be a smart mouth back and give customer service im going to stay calm and help them to the best of my knowledge..by doing this it automatically improves me as an co-worker it improves me outside of work and it also makes the customer realize that im out of place and he is just trying to do his job...the most enjoyable thing about my job is that we are so diverse and co-workers come from a very different background
good,"I was a head cashier for 4 years, and enjoyed my stay at THD. I left to go to grad school, but still shop at my local store. I store management was effective at doing their job."
good,"A diverse and inclusive workplace where doing the right thing, giving back, taking care of our people, excellent customer service by helpful and knowledgeable associates, building strong relationships, respect for all people are core values."
good,"Home Depot was always very accommodating insofar as flexible work schedules to allow for educational or familial responsibilities.  The company overall is a very good company to work for and does provide opportunities for advancement.  However, meager annual raises ($0.07 - $0.25 per hour) do not adequately reward hardworking associates.  This combined with regularly cut hours for part-time associates due to the ""Affordable"" Care Act do not provide incentives for associates to invest themselves fully in the company for the long-term, resulting in a high turn-over rate."
good,"A lot of workers have made it into a career, but it wasn't that for me. Promotions within the store rarely occur, managers are always hard to find when needed, and you never know when your going to leave if your the closer. the manger will literally wait till last minute to give you these 2 hour projects that need to be done. Ive work 3p-5a before just cause he would wait till last minute"
good,"Good place to work as far as most of the employees, Caters more to men as far as pay grade and moving up the ranks. "
good,"Took care of customers needs. Worked lumber, garden, hardware and on the lot. Helped load materials and find what customers were looking for."
good,"Good company, interesting things to learn and to teach to customers. Many opportunities to learn more than one department and to grow in the company."
good,A good company  great benfits.  Pay is ok for retail but hard to live off of it.  As in all retail rotating schedule makes it hrd to have a family life.
good,"My typical day working at The Home Depot, was spent assisting customers, providing them with product knowledge and solutions for their projects. I learned how to develop communication skills as well as providing customer service. While not assisting customers, I stocked and maintained the merchandise shelves, completed reports and performed housekeeping duties in my department. I also completed any and all assigned tasks given to me by management, and completed them in a timely manner.The Management team at The Home Depot, was satisfactory. They would listen to any grievances that I or my other co-workers may have had, but, they were not as approachable as other management teams have been. My co-workers were some of the most knowledgeable people I have ever associated myself with in regards to home improvement products and methods. Some of my co-workers have remained life long friends of mine. The hardest part of my day was not being able to provide the proper customer service needed, due to lack of coverage on  the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of my day, was knowing I had completed all my tasks and responsibilities, for the day. My time at The Home Depot, overall, was a positive experience. I learned a new set of skills, not taught to me in classrooms. As someone new to the working world, it was a bit of an adjustment. I gained my first workplace experience there, and I will always be thankful to The Home Depot for giving me my first job."
good,This was a great company to work for that really has its customers and employees in mind. Met many wonderful professional contacts.
good,Home Depot is a good stable company that helps with a little extra income. I originally worked here for the insurance offered to part time when my regular job dropped our health insurance. When the AFCA came around the part time insurance was dropped.
good,"I saw over 10 employees that had been working at this workplace who lost their jobs because the company wanted to save money and used the ""At Will"" clause in Maryland's employment law to get rid of these people to save money. My job was lost due to them not wanting to pay me benefits after working full time for 364 Days with the company"
good,"Always something to do and someone with a new problem to be solved."
good,"I worked part time at The Home Depot working third shift on the freight team. The job was difficult in that they gave you more work then you could possibly finish in one evening. I am a team player, I tried very hard to make the best of a difficult situation. My job consisted of stocking very heavy items like 5 gallon paint buckets,  putting away doors, stocking heavy drills, inventory and cleaning the floor at the end of the night. Some skills I did attain on the job were patience, learning how to work with people who weren't always pleasant and perseverance in a difficult work environment. I worked there for a year. My supervisors loved me they told me that I was the hardest worker on the team. I was told I was a hard worker and they were sorry to see me go, and they would hire me back if I ever wanted to come back.This was just a job to get me through school."
good,Great place to work if you are a student. They accommodate your school schedule and the employees are friendly. the company is always looking for ways to help their employees.
good,Sixth generation of family owned farm. Learned to appreciate being from a pioneering family in the State of Michigan and the teaching of that heritage to future generations. Great life skills learned.
good,"I was in between jobs after a lay off and needed to do something to stay busy. This is one of my favorite stores to shop in so I decided to apply. I was hired for the spring gardening season, in the garden department which is my favorite department. I watered plants (the temp outside was 100 degrees) so it was difficult to keep the pots wet as it was so hot outside. I assisted customers with everything from mowers to mulch. It was a nice position while it lasted. I was given a review by one of the garden department managers who wanted me to continue training and gave me high marks, but within 20 minutes of my review I was called in by the store manager and was laid off as my temp assignment had been completed. I was confused but I appreciated the time there."
good,"Good place to work with lots of interaction with other associates and customers. .Management  knew how to run a store well and gave great guidelines to follow. There was plenty of skill upgrading supplied. The people I worked with showed a lot of care and knowledge in dealing with customers. The hardest part of job was trying to assist so many people at one time, Some people were not happy. And by far the best part was saving people a lot of money ,they were so happy .They would come back to store and say thank you to me."
good,This is a great retail business with a really great management team.I have been given the opportunity to learn alot of different departments.
good,"The worlds largest hardware store, 321,000 Employees... busy environment, fast paced, excellent learning environment. A diverse and enriched culture of people from all walks of life and age... a great place to work."
good,"Build displays (dealing with electrical wiring for chandeliers, ceiling fans, vanity lights, etc) and maintaining, ordering, and installing Point Of Purchase material/ signage"
good,"Most of the people at Home Depot are great and easy to get along with, working in retail sucks anywhere you go though. Lot Associate is a far more difficult position than it initially seems to be. In the short year I was there I seen quite a few people come and go usually within a month or two. Everyday is different and most times you're on your own having 3 different tills to get to across the whole store in freezing cold or blazing heat so it takes a lot of VERY quick learning to be able to do this job efficiently. All in all looking back at it now it was a good experience, a tough one but a good one non the less."
good,muy buena empresa para laborar por la seguridad y ambiente de trabajo
good,"Good environment, friendly co workers, Very focused line of sight in terms of responsibilities. "
good,"supervisors were nice and helpful for the most part, a few ASMs were nice and helpful but mainly upper management was usually stone faced like any other big company. I feel like I learned the most I have ever learned in a workplace working here"
good,"it was busy and fast pace. the customer were excellent and friendly,"
good,"Loved the job , some days were bad but most were good , great people"
good,"Day started very early to get store up and running, didn't really see anyone else until lunch time. spent lunch with some great people. Had some awesome co-workers teach me how to do my job and then I was on my own the rest of the time after that.  I did get to work as greeter some on the weekends so I got to see customers and co-workers. I loved the interaction.  Did some cashiering and worked in a couple of departments during holidays. I absolutely loved that. I love the interaction with customers. Management was awesome, I made a lot of great friends while I worked there. I learned so much about customer service, home repairs and products, gardening, and just people in general. It was a great job with great benefits. I just couldn't work two jobs and I have to have daytime hours."
good,"This store is retail supplies were in aiming to lead in supplying building construction, Management are considerate and fair to their employees."
good,"community oriented work place"
good,"I enjoyed the high paced atmosphere at Home Depot.  The daily routine always had something new going on.  Required duties included, opening store safety check, re-stocking, inventory management, and of course, customer service. "
good,"I've learned a lot about Home depot MET. It is good experience what I have learned. It shows me how to do and what to do every day. There is no way to stress about it because they support me what I need to do. Even I make mistakes, they can help me to fix it and do better than  nothing."
good,Good entry level place to learn about product management and customer service.  Loved the team worked with and our manager and supervisors.  Learned a lot from the as well.  Nothing hard about working for this company.
good,Establishing business relationships was great. I enjoyed meeting new people daily as well as working with regular clients. The days went fast as there was always something to be done. My team was great. We get along very well.
good,"Fun environment to be in, and your co workers are family. its not really that  hard but it a lot to do"
good,"Was a fun place they always had events and pot lucks. My job  was mostly with problems and angry customers,that i was able to fix there problem and calm the customer down.My day began deciding where i should do my work to get the best coverage for the day. I could work most departments. My job as cos i would call vendors to make sure are orders were received our special orders and get a date of arrival. Called all installers for install dates. It was a good place to work i got along with everyone i did all my work and then some, and i still had fun. The hardest part of my job was when a customer cussed me and i could not tell them how i felt i always agreed with the customer, i was called every name in the book. The best part of the job was the people i worked with, we helped each other out, i helped them with their work and they helped me with theirs. I learned how to deal with people and all their different attitude. The managers liked me cause i fixed problems and took care of the mad customers."
good,"All in all, a nice place to work. Most employees are a pleasure to work with."
good,"lo que mas me gusto de home depot es q es una empresa que se preocupa mucho x sus asociados , home depot en si es una empresa maravillosa lo unico q lo hace malo son sus lideres , aprendi muchas cosas , sobre plomeria, cocina , construccion etc , mis dias eran estresantes ya q habias mucho trabajo y pocos empleados"
good,"I simply love this job, work environment great, People you worked with great, management was great and understanding, Team oriented. Benefits only real downside was if you have bills to pay this job couldn't substantiate the cost of living unless you are a supervisor/manager."
good,Target is a company that takes pride in its Associates and brand. Associates are taught to engage the customers and be available at all times. The company invest a lot of money and training like any other company that I have work for before.
good,"The Home Depot is an exceptional Company to work for. They truly stand behind their associates and will go to great lengths to make sure that you are healthy and happy at your job. The Home Depot, if not chosen as a career, is a great place to gain some solid experience. You can earn several certifications during your employment at home depot. The Home Depot promotes from within. If you go above and beyond your expectations, you will be noticed and you will be interviewed for the next step in your path. If you don't get the promotion, they will tell you exactly why and help you to establish a path towards overcoming present obstacles. You will be busy and not bored. All in all, Home Depot is a great company to work for. My advice? Do some research on your local store. Make sure the managers are people you would want to work under. Often times the wrong people get awarded the wrong positions. In general, if you can look up to the store manager, you can be assured that 99% of his/her associates are very similar."
good,A typical day is one that involves people. Have to be willing to talk to people and try to build some rapport for higher chances of getting sales.
good,Everyone was also so nice to me while I was training. The work was hard on the feet but rewarding enough. The managers were very understanding when I had to resign due to mental illness. Overall it was a great environment and I enjoyed working there.
good,Todo es bueno lo unico malo es que te cargan mucho la mano y a los jefes de piso no trabajen igual
good,"I enjoyed working for The Home Depot.  I was given every opportunity to advance, if I wanted to.  Human Resources were very accommodating with my schedule.  I enjoyed working with the public and have made some life-long friends while working there.  I would recommend this company for employment."
good,"During my time of employment at the home depot i was able to learn about all areas of general home improvement. i was able to improved on my customer service skills and i was able to learn how to operate all warehouse heavy duty equipment ( sit down and stand up forklift,OP and ride a long pallet jack)"
good,"really loved going to work and helping people with there projects and getting them the correct items needed to make there project come out the best."
good,"Customers and employees were very kind. If you needed any help, everyone was patient with you and willing to help. The hardest part about the job was remembering codes, or where to go to on the cash register when ringing up certain items."
good,kind co workers relatively challenging work some managers are bad while others are good
good,Continually keeping supply stocked and flowing for the customer.
good,"(Packer) Assigned to package, box, cabinet pieces and prepare "

I enjoyed becoming familiar with the store and information about the merchandise. The management was very strong and personable as well. My coworkers were great team players and enjoyable to work along side. The hardest part of the job, well it wasn't too hard because I enjoyed it so much so I cant think of anything too hard and the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to see a smile on the customers face for doing my job."
good,On a typical day  I can supervise anywhere from 5 to 10 associates at a time. I love the fast pace and friendly environment that comes along with customer service. At home depot it is never a boring moment.
good,"Working at the Home Depot involves non-stop customer service, gaining new knowledge of products available at the store and enhances problem solving method. I have learned about construction and how to repair things around the house. Co-workers are friendly and make the work day more enjoyable when getting a rude customer. Management is fair but does have a tendency of not being present when help from them is needed. Hardest part of the day is looking for product in the above ranking when it is not on the shelf and is needed right away for a customer."
good,"Assist customers by loading their vehicles and maintaining a pleasant and clean store entrance. While providing fast, friendly service to customers by answering questions and assisting with home improvement needs."
good,"Learning about home renovation and home improvement."
good,Great group of co-workers. Always trying to have fun to keep up morale. It's difficult to deal with working the number of days in a row and the different hourly shifts.
good,"20- 28 hours a week, it is a great job, mind numbing!!!!!! great coworkers"
good,It was good company to work for. the management was very friendly and trustworthy.
good,Its a fun place to work where everyone feels like family. I learned what it was like to work in a good enviornment. Managment was okay but they did pick favorites and didnt so much respect you always. My co-workers were awesome it was like working with friends. The hardest part is the angry customers. The most enjoyable part is who you work with.
good,"A typical day consisted of processing sales transactions, greeting all guests, and maintaining a tidy work area. I learned a lot from the customers. I always asked them questions. I learned how to assemble different things, and how to cut lumber. The hardest part about the job was not being able to advance as quickly as others who may have been there longer. The most enjoyable part was watching frequent customers bring their visions to life."
good,I have learnt so much working at the Home Depot.  I have met lots of people along the way who strive for excellence end deliver results. The Home Depot is a place believes in and provides very good family environment to its associates and encourage associates to create great team and provide excellent customer service.

The ins and outs of retail.                                                                                                       Was very fair and Informed.                                                                                                Worked well with.                                                                                                        I didn't find anything hard about it.                                                                                                             Helping customers find solutions
good,"Strong company fair to it's employees days range from 4am to 10pm management is fair for retail, co-workers are family, managing the constantly changing shifts is a issue, customers were mostly pleasant"
good,Great Place to work! Compensation and growing rapidly. Opportunity  for advancement.Too many changes every few years at Corporate causing field turnover. Must stabilize.
good,i love working at the home depot its very family orriented and theres so much stuff you can learn and beat apart of!
good,"Working with the public, and employees to increase overall sales of the department. Management varied. The co- workers are great people."
good,The values The Home Depot shows are amazing for prospective employees.  They offer a good benefits package with 401k and company match.  How ever a lot of those words are just that words.  Management tends to promise the world but not come through on it. The associates do all care about each other and it is a very friendly environment to work for. But if your not in the right cliques your work and efforts usually go overlooked.
good,I think that there was a big disconnect between managers at the store and district members. Overall the store was not bad at all it just needed to be more organized.
good,It was a fast paced working environment that enhanced my competence.
good,Great place to work part time definitely. Customer service and maintenance is the two major task.
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of multi-tasking and wearing of many hats. As a manager for Home Depot you are expected to handle any situation that may arise favorable or unfavorable. You manage upwards of 130 associates at any time all with different personalities, cultures, back grounds but at the end of the day we are all orange blooded and are one big family. I have been with Home Depot for 16 years and over those years I have learned that who you are and how you represent your self to your staff means a lot. It helps to gain respect of your peers as well as your staff to get the job done. You can't be afraid to show them that you are willing to do what ever it takes to get the job done. If that means rolling up your sleaves with them to complete task at hand you do what needs to be done. Ultimately its for the good of the company which is for the good of the overall team. The hardest part of the job is working in such a fast past environment at times when you are short handed and working with limited resources you have to work that much harder and smarter to figure out the solution to get the job done and still keep the values of the company intact. Not taking away from customer service, store appearance or even instock conditions at times.   The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Weather it is customers or the associates. Being able to help a customer with a project and they come back to let you know that it went great is a wonderful feeling. Or if you help an associate with an issue and they come back and let you know that things worked out for the best.Makes"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping/assisting associate to reach their potential and goals with the company or/in life. Being able to offer insight about company/corporate policies, train associate to be a successful in their jobs and passing knowledge onto associates to excel in their objectives or goals."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be how much each person owns. You can learn as much as you want about any part of the business, and help to drive the business you're in. It is never boring being in the company."
good,"I quickly learned and excelled in use of fork lift, reach truck, and other equipment and better my ability to further my knowledge in my position."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot was fast paced and fun at the same time. When I was a cashier and on a register I focused more on customer service and speed. Dealing with the computer systems and a wide variety of customers made everyday exciting. When I worked on the freight team pace was a little slower. Unpacking trucks and restocking shelves required that I paid close attention to detail, while trying to maintain speed at the same time."
good,Great place to work management is willing to help and room for advancement
good,I love everything about my this job with the exception of both the work life balance and compensation.
good,"Most of my co-workers are very knowledgeable, and friendly.  I work with a great crew of cashiers."
good,"Fun job, needed a break from Nursing. Terrible hours and pay. Met a lot of really nice people."
good,Very enjoyable place to work and be part of a team. Management became too political.
good,"Manager are ever supportive."
good,"Helping solve customer problems, making sure they find and get what they need to finish their projects.  Also recommend ways for them to make their projects better."
good,great meeting customers and building a relationship with a team of hard workers
good,Every manager is different just like every associate. Some managers are approachable and others do not seem to ever want to be there. In my store we get regularly visited by District Managers so we are always on edge.
good,Overall the job isn't bad. You get a pretty flexible schedule. Set breaks. Weekly pay. The only problem was a lot of turnover in management and leadership which led to a lot of unorganization and low morale.
good,The morale among the employees is always high. This results in a team that is excited to help customers.
good,"•Began the morning by listening to my phone messages and returning calls and prioritizing those that needed to be addressed immediately.  Then returned all other calls.  "
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. "
good,Home Depot is very good at keeping employees involved with the education and skillset we need to excel at our careers
good,"Home Depot helped me gain a lot of experience in customer service, retail, and merchandising it is a good company to work for."
good,"Typical work day consists of staffing, scheduling, and working hand and hand with management. I have learned how to deal with conflict, team building, and one on one with associates."
good,The Home Depot spends a great deal of time and effort to educate their employees and give them the tools needed to succeed in a demanding environment.  I have worked at a few stores that experienced various level of success due mainly to the quality of the management and associates.  Some of the stores had very involved management who garnered respect among the employees and performed well and one that was quite the opposite.  The work environment is dependent on this relationship and some of the locations suffered due to the poor communication and trust.  One thing I really appreciated though was the commitment to community outreach which I took part.  Overall the company was nice to work with and I will take away many useful skills learned while serving as a sales specialist.
good,A decent job but the store is highly unorganized but provides great pay and benefits
good,I would start right off mixing contractors paint for the day and they would call me with any technical questions they had about the job they were doing. I was well trained on all paint products that we sold and appropriate primers to use depending on situation. Management is hard to deal with at times. I got along very well with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is when people called off work and I was left alone to deal with my contractors and regular customers. I enjoyed working with the contractors and developing a one on one relationship with them.
good,"Learning new product, working with customer."
good,"1. Taking care of all customer needs. 2.Each customer is different, and very unique in their own ways. 3.Management sometimes can be overwhelming, they demand a lot. 4.enjoy communication and working as a team. 5.Not being able to satisfy a customer. 6.Enjoy my job when I am able to take care of a customer, and knowing that they are satisfy with the services I was able to render to them."
good,"most days consist of general service to the bays reading  planograms and setting displays."
good,This place would be a good job for someone that likes call centers.
good,A typical work day consisted of replenishing inventory and pulling multiple orders by hand and using lift equipment. I learned how to use many different inventory and software systems. Management was good and the majority of my co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with employees that didn't carry their workload and the most enjoyable part was my actual work task and the customer interaction.
good,you basically knew your job and that was to serve customers.  employees put a lot of stock in highly skilled workers in their area of expertise.  the hardest part of the job is to give and give some more to customers that depend on you.
good,"The work was difficult, but, I enjoyed my time at Home Depot RDC. Great management, great employees."
good,"The Home Depot was a very stable company with good benefits."
good,"You have a lot of opportunities for advancement, they do tuition reimbursement and they pay is ok."
good,The hours are very good - M-F 6-2:30.  Learned a lot about merchandising.
good,"Fellow employees have always been wonderful and helpful. Management has a separist problem from the employees though this is not always the case."
good,"Worked great with customers along with the other employees, always had weekly goals for our associates to achieve to earn extra cash or other things."
good,If you refuse to kiss manager butt be prepared to stay in same position the entire time you work here.
good,Good place of employment. Low pay but enjoyable job. Good relationships with management and other employees.
good,"I spent a large part of may time working ( BECAME MORE OF A WORK ALCOHOLIC ) so much it cost me my marriage . Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed what I was doing creating different styles , designs , new product lines etc managing the business end , distributors etc."
good,"- Hardest part of the job was wanting to make promises to a customer , knowing that you couldn't because the situation or anything was out of your control ."
good,Schedule varies from day to day. Working with Customers was mostly enjoyable giving a sense of gratification. Management tends to be influx constantly changing. As a whole it was pleasant to work with the other associates.
good,"It's ok, I think this will be a job for young adults who looking for an part time job for the summer."
good,working at home depot was a nice environment and it was great way to start my career in the merchandise department.. it showed me and taught me a lot of new things that I didn't know.
good,Got to meet new people everyday from all over the world. A nice work environment I must say
good,"Typical work day is between 4-8 hrs. long, co-workers and management very friendly and willing to assist both customers and co-workers.  I have learned to be a more effective listener, responding to only essentials.  Hardest part of the job in the work life balance, due to my work schedule.  Weekly scheduling varies widely, consistency in rare."
good,I liked the job it was hands on and I saw and meet a new face eveyday
good,ive learned whats needed to make it in the work force. Great fellow workers and environment. management wasn't the best but it was a job none the less.
good,"I have worked for three different stores and can tell you that 2 out 3 were fantastic to work for. Katy, Texas was beyond awesome they transferred me successfully from a California store to theirs. Once there not only did they recognize the value I added to their company but they immediately changed my status in their system from part-time to full-time. The 2 California stores work you full-time but keep your status as part-time. Now to be honest, the California stores do this to benefit themselves because they then didn't have to pay a higher percentage to 401k, vacations hours, sick time earned percentages. A part-timer earns half of the total percentage for all 3 mentioned as a full-timer does! "
good,Good work environment. Decent pay. Easy day as long as you follow protocol.
good,Worked in the Phone Ceter to begin with & then moved to the Special Services desk.
good,Great place to work with flexible hours around my courses each semester.
good,"As a full time associate for the past 3 years, I have had stable hours, great benefits and have been lucky to have great managers as well. "
good,"working at home depot was great for me because it taught me something about customer service ,managing skills and how friendly both customers and employees are when you work together ."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo en todos los niveles jerárquicos de la empresa, apoyo por parte de los colaboradores equipos integrados con buena comunicación, buenos salarios asi como las oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,I work in Tool Rentals.  Can be fast paced during peak times. (Spring /Summer weekends)  Scheduling is good as they work around my needs.  Management is a little lackluster.
good,"The Home Depot provided me with the skills to work with people.  With a staff of over 100 people and thousands of customers daily, I was able to build strong techniques in adjusting to different environments and situations."
good,"The management are far,and they work with us.The people or friendly and helps out when they can."
good,"Helping customers as well as receiving, stocking and keeping store clean in a big box warehouse retail position.  I've learned about gardening projects pesticides and herbicides, how to drive a forklift.   The Home Depot has good employees and they drive teamwork and everyone works well together.  their is not really anything hard about the job.  I enjoy working with customers to help the achieve their projects the most."
good,Moving product around all day. Very positive about people and the orange. Great management staff. What I like the most is the size of the warehouse.
good,"Typical day:  Deliver exemplary customer service and operational excellence."
good,"Work environment wasn't the greatest, employees are nice, fun people, great pay, low hours."
good,"Customer service is number one. Make sure that my customers found what they needed and if they didn't help them to find what it was that they were looking for. How to be very pleasent and very understanding. My manager was great, I got along with all of my co-workders. Leaving the job. Helping people"
good,"Company on the grow. Definitely a plus to work here. But, depending on location, sometimes advancement can be difficult."
good,Work days were well planned but the team was small. Unfortunate emergencies were hard to deal with with a small staff. The job was enjoyable because each day was different and the staff worked as a team even though everyone had their own individual duties. The management was nice and understanding.
good,"I held many different positions throughout my career at home depot so I really couldn't say what would be a typical day. I learned many different skill in the positions I held throughout the store, many of them computer based.  As in many companies there are the desirable and undesirable employees but for the most part everyone got along."
good,"I have had a great experience working with Home Depot. I have learned many skills such as using the fork lift, reach truck, and order picker machine."
good,A great starter job with great co-workers. Great work atmosphere. Management is always an experienced lifeguard and has worked there for at least 2 years.
good,"Home Depot was a hands on learning experience. Over the years there I learned to drive a forklift, distinguish between many household goods and tools."
good,time management is important and so is attention to detail.
good,Pulling orders for delivery and will calls for the next day and helping customers
good,"Never a dull day working at home depot. There were days when you would get yelled at by people for not returning their nails correctly, even though it's clear they just picked nails off the road up. Sad people but good work"
good,"Always come on time at work. I greet my fellow co-workers and customers as well on the way in with a positive attitude. I would start my shift, going through the aisles making sure they're neat and organized. Assist customers and work in the outside garden. Keeping myself productive until my shift is over."
good,"Working for home depot is great, the environment that the management team provides is great, they have a very open work environment, I have learned allot mostly because of my co-workers, training for the flooring specialist is long 2 months in the computer that teaches about things that by the time you get to the floor you have no idea how to properly use. You learn as you go, older employee's will show you the ins and outs of the software, newer employee's will work weekends older will have them off, hardest part would be trying to get a full time if you started as a part timer even with metrics met, also they do want you to help with the flooring cleanup like lifting heavy items, sweeping and dusting not only your show room but the isles. You are constantly in your feet on flat cement so eventually your feet or knees will start to hurt. besides that the pay is okay but the hours for part timers range from 10-28 hours a week, depending on what department you are in."
good,"Home Depot used to be a great company to work for but if you have a family it is not a good fit. They have great benefits, great training to move up if you so desire and if you so choose there is so much you can learn and grow from being in that environment. I learned to be a better public speaker, better manager, and better person all around."
good,I have worked for Home Depot for 10 years in many different roles.  I have found it is very difficult to progress into management.  It is a fast paced editing place to work.  they offer great benefits for their full time employees.  they also continue to match 401k and sen annual bonuses.
good,"I typical day would consist of stocking items, putting away returns, and assisting customers with their home care/garden needs. I learned how to better interact with people of all ethnicities and backgrounds and how to deal with difficult customers and situations with a smile."
good,"Working for the Home Depot has been a great experience.  What to expect changes day by day due to the different types of customers you encounter daily. Overall, there is a great family atmosphere here, there is always someone to go to if you have a question and need answers quickly."
good,"Arrival at work and clocking into the job is much like other places. The associates are very friendly once you get to know them. I learned a lot from being an associate here, in which certain projects need assistance from a professional. Management is helpful in dealing with situations that arise in the workplace and to deal with the customers as friendly and as soon as possible. The hardest part of the job tends to be the labor and the customers. Most customers are very friendly and willing to listen to what you have to say. Being new to the company is a downside since you are pretty much thrown under the bus to help with things that you have no knowledge of. The enjoyable parts to the job tend to be the hour lunches as well as when you help a customer through their life and projects and get to know them more on a personal level."
good,"Home Depot was a very pleasant place to work, the employees enjoyed their jobs and were fun to work with. The managers rarely talked down to their employees and would ask politely for us to do things. The managers were very respectful and professional toward their employees. The hardest part of my job was covering other departments while trying to cover my own, when we were already short handed, and having to answer each departments phone as well. What I enjoyed most about my job was helping the customers and suggesting new ideas. The customers are who made my job enjoyable the most. Engaging with them on their projects and learning how to do new ones."
good,"Busy"
good,You are constantly moving and there is a lot of opportunity to continually learn.
good,"If I open I must confirm that the money obtained in the register is accurate with what was recorded and sign in with my user name and password. After I open up the register I clean up and organize all around so that everything is nice/neat and ready for the customer. I help customers with purchases, returns, credit applications, price checks, and order status. I also help dictate the customers to the area where they can find what it is that they are looking for. Management always keeps in contact by answering their telephone line when any help is needed."
good,"Mixed paint, customer service, trouble shooting"
good,"Great people, satisfying job duties, just the money is not enough."
good,"Currently working in ITIS infrastructure support engineer as Technical lead. Providing L3 level support to unix and Linux servers. "
good,"Would come in and check the shelves to see what needed to be down stocked checked to see if we had any orders that needed to be brought up to the front desk. Would assist customers with any questions they had or if they needed help finding any of our products. I learned how to set wood flooring and lay tile down, also got to teach a couple classes to customers."
good,I exceeded many of the productivity requirements at Home Depot and always was one of the higher performing employees
good,"The Home Depot call center tries very hard to ensure that they have the best work environment. Free drinks are available. Ping pong table, xbox, a general relaxation area, and two small vending areas for assorted foods. Training is wonderful, coworkers are helpful. Only difficulty is that customers calling in are the typical upset/ irrational callers. I immensely disliked how scheduling worked, if you are part time, it can be difficult to achieve full time, your schedules are not set, can begin and end randomly."
good,It was a very flexible job. I learned how to use a cash register. My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was when a customer was not very happy. The most enjoyable part was to be well trained.
good,It's a great place to work. Very easy and laid back job. I really don't have any complains. Employer always takes care of their employees.
good,The work day starts at 5 am. You stretch it out with the team Supervisor gives you updates on what's going on and your assignment for the day.
good,"I love the people I work with, truly a family. It was fun to work there and I learned so much about projects I could do myself like painting, replacing a toilet, installing flooring etc. The hardest part of this job was not as much recognition and the pay increases at review time were low. I would get a great review but little pay raise. My favorite was just helping customers with their needs and knowing I made them happy. We strive in customer service and it shows when your customers keep coming back and it's a great feeling."
good,"Exciting customer first based business"
good,A typical day at work would be servicing bays and keeping the integrity of the planogram for that bay.  My co-workers are awesome and we help each other whenever we may need it.  My supervisor is fair and treats me with respect.  The hardest part of my job may be some of the heavy boxes that I may have to lift.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have been put in charge of 3 showrooms and the integrity of their looks as well as making sure the customers have all samples they need.
good,Solid executive leadership and opportunities to grow from entry-level roles.
good,the customers are what really makes your day but the management is not very good.
good,what i learned by working at home depot is how to give people outstanding customer service
good,Make sure that all product are organized and easy for customers to choose.
good,"My typical day of work would be coming in on time or even early.  Preparing for my work day and getting things in order to begin my day."
good,"Greeting or Customer Service Desk..I learned new things each day concerning products carried and placement.  Aiding customers with ordering and aiding them in finding products to aid them in their day to day needs.  Management encouraging and helpful.  Co-workers not always as pleasant as could be, young and old, I felt I needed to continually remind them that our job is to help the customers. That was the hardest part of the job keeping moral up.  Most enjoyable when a customer told me my pleasant attitude helped them and that they were satisfied with my assistance in their shopping experience."
good,"During the day I would manage multiple leaders, with competing deadlines in a very fast paced environment.  Schedule meetings, complete expenses, handle customer care issues.  I currently work for six managers and while each person has their own style I am able to adapt to that particular manager's needs.  The hardest part of the job is the competing priorities.  While this is the most difficult part, I am able to handle each priority without missing deadlines.  The part of my job I enjoy the most is my coworkers and working with all types of different people at all levels of the company."
good,"•	Evaluate, trouble shoot various tools, machinery, and equipment repairing as necessary with strict attention to detail. Develop, Structure and deliver training workshops for consumers inclusive with fellow associates. Lisaion for Q&A between manufactor and company"
good,"My days start out with making sure that the daily paper work is complete. along with making sure that our customers have properly got there paper work for the merchandise they have ordered. Along with general customer service through out the time I am at work. "
good,Strong culture.  Strong initiatives good people. Typical large corporate company.
good,"great company to work for with reasonable pay,great benefits,room for advancement."
good,"Is a good place to work, I learn very much about the customer service,  and I learn to identify many different types of materials, I knew good co worker, in a typical day at work I have contact with many different type of customer I learn to talk with the customer, help and solve their problem about the project they have in home or work, the most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer tell me thank you."
good,"A 'typical' day at Home Depot is that there is never a 'typical day'. Being a retail store everyday is different and creates different challenges and opportunity to acquire knowledge. A usual day started with me opening the store by getting the cash registers open and ready, I would walk the store and look for opportunities to make the store grand open ready. I would look at inventory levels throughout the store and order what needed to be ordered to better serve our customers. I was in charge of many associates during the opening shifts and had to make sure the job was getting done that needed done. The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job is one in the same. It's the customers and juggling all the responsibilities that goes along with being in management in a retail store. Everyday it's different and made you think because each situation needs different responses and at the end of the day one learns a lot but what to do and how maybe to do it differently the next time something like that comes up again."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, friendly environment. Management is great easy to move up in the company.  Great job for high school and college students."
good,a great place to work if you want to get experience with customer service or if interested in moving up in the company. equal opportunities type of place. the pay depends on location but the yearly raises are poor and the raise to move up to supervisor positions are poor also. but over all management is great and will work with you especially if they see that you care about your job.
good,This is the grown ups toy store if you are into home repair and tools this is the place to be
good,"I miss working here. The employees were amazing, the career advancement opportunities were great!"
good,I absolutely love helping people i found the most rewarding place was the paint department. painting is a fast change and an important one for many people. I had many people come to me when their project was done to thank me for my help they love the transformation etc.
good,"offers lots of advancement opportunities  although you will have to push for a lot of that your self. Its a big company with a lot of people trying to advance, so you need to be able to sell your self."
good,"Each day can be different. I start either independently or within a small team to complete vendor related projects or changes within any part of the store. Later, there is bay maintenance to be performed where we set the items according to plan, verify and perform necessary changes and updates. Teaching/ assisting other co-workers to ensure consistency is secondary to primarily assisting customers at any time."
good,Came in at 4p. We lined up for briefing and to see what teams we were on and where our post were. I learned to be professional when meeting celebrities and i learned about the seating and how to help the patrons find their way. Management was great. There anytme we needed them especially when some of our patrons got out of hand. I trained with my co-workers and also knew some of them from child hood so it made work even better. The hardest part was checking in the patrons and checking belongings because some would be mad or offended even tho they were forewarned on what can and cannot enter the facility. Also dealing with drunk patrons and stopping them from leaving the facility with alcoholic drinks and beer. The most enjoyable part was working for the chivas and the galaxy and working the tennis matches and boxing matches and the X games and meeting so many celebrites and their families.
good,the managenent sucks it would be abetter place if that got better
good,"i arrive at work and love going to my department.  The customers are always looking for help matching colors or even finding one that will flow through their home well.  stocking the shelves with product can be fun as well, i get to see all the new products that come in first hand and im usually the one that wants to try it to see if it works well.  The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting and the best part is when the customers cme back to the store to tell me how great their project turned out and thank me for all the help i gave them. its very rewarding"
good,"I like working here, I just wish they would pay more. My supervisor and co-workers are fun to work with.  I've already done this kind of work, so it is an easy job for me."
good,Satisfied with the company and what it offers work is cahenging and rewarding.
good,Great place to work.  Career advancement  probable.  I just started there 6 months ago.  I had my first 6 month review and was excellent.  I just need more experience in The Home Depot environment.
good,"Sales and service"
good,A typical day on the job consisted of constant packing out. This could be from a pallet or an RDC cart staged on the sales floor. Operating heavy machinary on a nightly basis in order to complete my job. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was the associates that i worked with every night. Management could have been alot better. They arent really willing to work with you when it comes to school.
good,"Always an opportunity daily to Coach, Teach and Train Associates on Asset Protection and Shrink Mitigation."
good,"	Successfully manage customer service, merchandising, inventory, talent management as well as many other aspects with regards to running your own business while maintaining the core values of The Home Depot."
good,"A typical day at work is usually coming picking items down using a lift tuck or by hand  going up ladders."
good,"Great place to work for and advancement"
good,Working for The Home Depot for two and a half years was a very appreciated experience.  I became extremely knowledgeable in many areas of basic home improvement as well as Customer Service policies.  The most important thing I believe you can take from a job is the knowledge you gain and I feel that working for this company gave me vast knowledge in numerous areas that can benefit me in any position I chose to take on in the future!
good,"This job is great to have and easy to advance in. Great benefits, pay and workers. Once you in the company stick with it for a while."
good,"Waited on customers, maintained area around registers, replenished check stands. Management was there for the employee as well as customers, that was nice. Everyone was nice and easy to get along with. Hardest part was customers trying to steal and you could nothing for the safety of yourself. Which was also nice because the company cared about you first before the products. Meeting new people for all walks of life was my favorite part."
good,"I worked every shift except the late-morning shift. All in all, the management personnel are always upbeat and willing to work with you to get you what you need and genuinely care for your well-being. What I was able to accomplish while I was there was the ability to communicate effectively as well as observe day-to-day customer service being properly executed. My co-workers and I got along well and only really had a problem with one person. Also, the hardest yet most enjoyable part of the job was the massive quantities of things people ordered which allowed me to meet them and load their order onto their vehicle."
good,I have learned that in the retail field customer satisfaction is always the principle.
good,"Best experience of my life. Taught me a lot about myself and other personalities. A day at work was to be a multitasker and a social worker. Handle associate struggles, customer complaints and operational issues all at the same time."
good,Employees are super friendly and very dedicated to work. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with customers. The hardest part of the job would be not being able to experience other departments as much as you would like. Co-workers are wonderful and great working as a team.
good,"Entered data & maintained integrity of Home Depot through the use of standardized data entry and proofing processes and procedures."
good,Great Company to work for. AP Field is reorganizing and I may not be asked to stay with company at this time.
good,I worked at Home Decorators Collection for roughly 2 years and really  liked it there. Everybody was cool and for the most part it was busy. The department I was in was the stockroom which was rather small and was probably the only thing i didn't like.
good,"I really loved this job, there is so many things you can learn just from being in this environment."
good,I had a lot of fun working for home depot. I was a cashier but its not your average cashier job. When you are slow and have no reason to be behind a register there were opportunities to do computer based training or assist with building store displays. This was a very fun job.
good,"I worked on the freight team but freight was not all we did we had the choice to help customers find what they need. I was generally all around, I helped many people including other team members and Department associates. I was able to spend a little time outside doing freight because when I did work freight I worked it as fast as possible with keen eye for detail. I knew my department very well. the hours I worked was generally 4pm-2am. overall this job was a great job the only downside was my hours were cut to 16.5 hours a week. which lead to me having to leave home depot."
good,When I arrive to work I clock in then report to the front of the store  to be assigned a register. I greet customers and complete purchases. I try to engage with each customer. Most people who come into home depot are first time home owners so they typically have a lot of questions and from being there so long I can make suggestions. My managers are great. I have a close relationship with most of them. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is that it can be repetitive. The most enjoyable part in talking with customers that are starting new chapters in their lives.
good,"-Cashier"
good,"The best part of the job really was the co-workers.  They created a fun atmosphere where you felt like family, until you went up to management.  I don't know if it is because of the stress levels or if Home Depot just needs to get rid of some managers, but the unrealistic expectations on productivity led to constant negativity.  I learned a lot about myself, and the home improvement industry and was paid extremely well while doing so."
good,I learned so much at this position. There is always something to learn about DIY projects and other products that are offered here. Had a good time learning as much as I did.
good,I wrangled carts and had fun with the coworkers and liked helping and selling to customers.
good,Need to catch up with technology! The job is very well organized just follow directions and use common sense.  Make sure to always put the custmer first.  Always keep an open line of communication.
good,"A lot of great people that care about what they do, at least on my crew."
good,good crew to work with .  Not to good about working with you on your hours.  Takes too long to be made permanent.
good,"I arrived to my Department,  Plumbing.  I notice a customer with a Question mark following him around,  I quickly and politely ask if I can help him with confidence.  As I help customers I also go around the dept.  taking care of Go Backs.  I Stock the shelves that are empty or close to being empty.  We take about half an hour to an hour in the training room on the computer and take quiz on new items or improved items.  help out other departments if the associate is busy with other customers.  Be aware of the dept. surroundings in order to keep all customers safe in the Store."
good,I had great team of workers who assisted each other.  Management provided detailed instruction on assigned tasks.
good,Good place to work. Have learned a lot from training that is provided
good,"-Unloading delievry trucks"
good,"interaction with kinds of customers from dyi to pros to the 80 yr old man looking to match a screw from his grandmothers dresser. constant problem solving, quick pass environment. Hardest part of the job is when we are short handed and you are being pulled in five directions."
good,"This company will teach you everything about retail, alot about business, and allow to work with a ton of customers literally everyday."
good,"•Floor and camera surveillance "
good,"Workikng at Home Depot was a great day ,I enjoyed helping our customers i beleave i can make all my customers happy. i worked in customer service ,returns. i enjoy talking with all people.."
good,"It's great when you go to work and know that all the staff are just as customer oriented as you are. I was lucky enough to participate in the Team Depot renovation of a local school, and it was a double bonus because it was the school my kids went to! "
good,it was a great place to learn new things i got certified as a forklift driver and learned how to scan and process material.
good,"Good Customers and Benefits, I learned a lot while I worked for Home Depot along with awesome interactions with my customers (they're like family)! Along with my co-workers we were all very respectful which is rare now days! The hardest part of the job were some customers being REALLY needy!"
good,Best for students. Good advancement opportunities. Management leaves something to be desired.
good,"Responsible for the training and coaching of all associates daily."
good,I love working at the Home Depot. Employed 14 years with 6 years on Army National Guard active duty for deployments. Looking for advancement as I have children in high school and need to pay for their college. I never had the opportunity to attend college when I was young as my parents could not afford. I joined the National Guard to help pay for college but ended up working once my father died.
good,"The Home Depot is a good company to work for, they look out for their associates and their families.A typical day of work includes unloading trucks & receiving freight preparing it to be shipped to stores. Management & co workers are very respectful & helpful. the hardest part of the job is the manual labor can be extremely hard at times with the heavy lifting"
good,really enjoyed working here before the merger with LKQ.  they had quit a bit of perks including bingo and pizza every month plus bonuses.
good,good first job. great to get a feel of what hard work is. fast pace work
good,Working at the Home Depot was one of the most exciting and motivating jobs I have ever had. The training that is available for all associates makes advancement easier to achieve and they love to promote from within. The benefits are not paid by the employer but you have many options in the way of the type of coverage you want. Overall it's a fantastic place to work or even make a career out of.
good,"Each day is an opportunity to help a customer complete a project on his/her own."
good,"I had an amazing experience working here, I learned a lot of interesting things that I would have never known."
good,"As a cashier there isn't much movement but you do get the chance to interact with customers on a frequent basis. The co-workers I've come to know there are fun like-able individuals that are great to work alongside."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Management needs to be improved. Co-workers and customers are a joy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,Fast paced environment with plenty of customer interaction. I learned plenty on home improvement each day I worked.
good,Making sure that the orders for the stores were accurate and timely. Learned alot about the stores and how they effected the store support system.
good,"Overall, I think of Home Depot as a great starting point for people who have little to no experience in retail/sales. The atmosphere is fun, entertaining and educational, while still remaining professional, helpful, etc. However, don't be fooled, it is not a simple/easy job. I worked there for a couple of years and there was never a day when I could sit back and do nothing. You have to always be moving around, looking for people to help or tasks to complete, and your coworkers will rely on you for that help."
good,I liked the interaction with people. My co-workers we're really interesting to talk to.
good,"I am submitting my documents in order to be considered for the Forklift Operator position at your company and I know that my background and skills would be greatly received. I have an extensive resume and a great deal of experience driving a forklift and would be an asset to your company. "
good,"If you are a hard worker they will treat you well, however they can also use and abuse to the point of over working"
good,Home Depot is a fun and energetic place to work. It is filled with great people and is structured well. They give employees a great deal of empowerment and have great benefits.
good,"Very nice co-workers "
good,"My job consist of providing excellent customers. A typical day included working reports, ensuring associates are being productive. Ensuring we are in stock, controlling hours, holding people accountable, solving problem and training associates. The best part of the job is working with awesome people. We are like family and we help each other as a team. (but i'v heard this isn't true at all stores) Hardest part is getting everything done, while being coverage on the floor. Like every company you have the good managers and bad managers."
good,"Once you clock in, your day has been planned out by a supervisor. I get a hardcopy for my daily projects the hours to execute that project. New product comes in and old products come out. Look over plan-o-grams to see if correct. Make sure the bay is 100% for the customers needs. Pack out product if empty. I also was a captain for (appliances,grill,carpet showrooms) to satisfy my walks with my managers.We had a team to execute in a timely matter to make sure the store was presentable for our customers. I enjoyed my co-workers on working together."
good,its a good job experience good place to start very friendly people and customers are great it feels good when your able to help them fine what they need
good,The store manager is the best that i have ever worked with. And the staff is fun and a family
good,"A typical day could start anywhere from 5AM to 1PM and would end usually 8.5-9 hours after (depending on length of lunch break). It was rather cut and dry work, a lot of customer service involved. Bending over backwards and that sort of thing was commonplace for just about everyone there. Management clearly had their favorites and they didn't make an attempt to hide it. The co-workers were always cheerful, though they could get on a roll and get chit-chatty which would lead to becoming ""guilty by association""."
good,There isn't much to say I worked a seasonal position it was over night. while the store was closed.
good,A typical day at work for me is working with customers helping and giving my advice. My management and co-workers were good team players. The hardest part of my job was the hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was able to help customers with their needs.
good,"There was no typical day at work.  Each day was very different.  You might open at 5:30am and leave at 2:30pm or another day come in at 3:00pm and leave at midnight.  The store might be busy or it might be fairly slow."
good,Great place to work opportunities for advancement. You can move from one department to another as long as you get training.
good,"A typical day for work consist of a 10 hour shift of hard work alot of heavy lifting. Very short 10 to 20 minute breaks sometimes food is provided but for the mot part you should probably bring your own food. Working with The Home Depot team I learned how to become a leader, how to become more productive, and how to adapt in different postions. Managment teams here are very polite, they will hepl you to get good or flexible hours if your struggling to make money. Co-workers are generally all around awsome they make the job time go by way faster through the day their very helpful lively bunch of people. Hardest part of the job would have to be trying to be able to hav enough energy for the next day. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the little breaks you get in between shifts you get up to two breaks."
good,work with cutomers on a daily basis to help them find what they need and help to solve there problems. So you problem solve on a daily basis and help customers and also straighten up the store when not busy helping customers.
good,"In my last few days at the Home Depot I was instructing associates on how to re-key locks that we sold, and customer on how to use the equipment they were renting from us.  I was also instructing associates on how to do my job just in case we needed assistance.  Over all I do miss my coworkers there, because we worked together long enough that we became somewhat of a family.  The hardest part of the job was leaving, because of the regular customers we had the pleasure of getting to know and the coworkers that became friends then family to me."
good,I Really enjoyed working with others and seeing my customers happy with the service that we provided.
good,the associates that work there are always willing to help each other when they need help.
good,Home Depot is a friendly atmosphere full of people who like to be around hardware tools and supplies. Working there gave me opportunities to learn more about DIY projects and how to help the customers with them as well. Managers were easy to talk to and willing to help whenever needed. Coworkers were task oriented and efficient in their duties. Not knowing all the knowledge of every tool made helping some customers difficult but it was easy to point them in the direction of someone who could. I loved the hands on experience while working at Home Depot and giving the customers my opinion when they asked.
good,"A fast pace fun place to work that gave you a sense of ownership,  which allowed you to think outside the box."
good,home depot takes safety very serious safety is the home depot number one priority
good,the hardest part of the job is the freight because is not enough time to stock all the new products.
good,The Mt. Laurel Home Depot has a great work environment.  The managers are willing to work with you if you have any questions.  My co-workers in my department are a great asset to myself and we have a tremendous team attitude.  We have no problem helping each other out and teaching each other something we learned to better ourselves and become more productive.  I find it fulfilling to interact and have a repiore with our customers.  I get a great sense of satisfaction when I am able to accomadate their needs.
good,"On a typical day at work I would gather up carts from the parking lot, help customers with heavy loads, operate the cash, help in the co-works in the lumber/building material and garden departments. At the home depot I learned how to operate a sit down fork lift, cash register, first phone, and gained product knowledge. Home Depot management was fair. My co-workers were all helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job will be loading heavy material into customers vehicles. I enjoyed picking orders for customers."
good,you would work overtime and they would make you cut the hours the next day so as not to have to pay you overtime. management was relatively good. Pretty fair with employees.co-workers....some were stealing appliances on the transfer truck and one would not finish his deliveries and bring them back to the store for the other driver to finish.hardest part of the job....lifting the or drywall for your order to be filled. Most enjoyable part of the job....working with the customers.
good,"After a morning stretch, I would proceed to the assigned department for work. Picking up from the previous work day, I would ensure bay integrity, maintain cross merchandise, pack down any low or out of stock product, and ensure proper displays and signage was present."
good,"I overnight stocked, enjoyed being able to come to a job, listen to music and just work til the shift was over"
good,"Values of Home Depot are great in theory, but difficult to do in a practical sense due to staff cut-backs. There is a great deal of emphasis on internal promotion. Typical work day is restocking and decontamination of bays, resets and general customer service with reasonable breaks. Hardest part of the job is time management and physical demands due to type of merchandise and height of overstock storage. Resets can be tedious and it is often difficult to find store associates to help customers."
good,it just a job. Don't plant your roots there. Use the job as astepping stool in your career.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot, it was a fun environment and a great place to be."
good,It was an enjoyable experience I learned many values that will help advance my career.
good,Log into handheld phone computer.  Greet everyone you come in contact with customer or employee.  Provide great customer service to all customers.  Learned patience. A lot about retail and the marketing.  Learned how to get people to do their job even if they really didn't want to.  Worked with a great team. The most challenging part of the job was little control over getting product into store and being held accountable for it.  The best part of the job was the customers and helping them get the right product for their project.
good,"Typically I work at the Returns desk or as a Cashier on the Pro Desk.  I make sure people are taken care of whether it's looking for a certain product or they would like a refund on something they weren't happy with.  "
good,"Approaching potential customers and offering assistance, explaining differences in various products.  Learned a lot about various appliances and other departments products as well because during quiet times and staffing, you needed to attempt to guide customers to appropriate areas and call managers to help them.  Management was always available although rarely on hand in the department.  Co-workers were helpful in explaining about product and did not mind my hanging around while they explained product info.  Sometimes I found the physical aspects difficult, especially climbing up the tall ladders to look for inventory.  Really enjoyed the people interaction."
good,"A typical day consist of down stocking my department along with answering any questions that customer may have and loading and unloading vehicles with the tow motors. I have gained  a great amount of knowledge of concrete, roofing, lumber, drywall, and insulation. Management is right along with every other associate providing outstanding customer service. My co-workers do what are asked of them and come to me for direction. The hardest part of the job is to make sure that ever customer is assisted while management keeps adding take to all associate through out the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other co-worker and having there help with any problem you may have."
good,Customer Services! Customer always came first at HOME DEPOT. A good place to start a job in customer service. HD will make sure that you get the properly training to help you achieve your goals in the company. Working with other fellow associates was alway enjoyable because you made friends that made the job a lil easier to deal with. Working overnight is a very physical job but you learned how the operations of the store worked.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting every customer, giving best customer service possible, stocking merchandise, loading merchandise into customer's vehicle. I have learned that fulfilling someone's needs makes a happy and lifetime customer. I have developed a good working relationship with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is completing the task at hand with not enough resources or time.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my fellow co-workers and customers."
good,Most workers are very friendly and make work very fun. It's like having a second family working for Home Depot
good,"Working for Home Depot is a great idea. They are flexible and friendly. Being a newbie though now-a-days would not be very ideal, unless you've worked in a similar atmosphere before. With new management coming and going quite frequently (in 5 years 4 whole new mgmt teams) the hiring styles, and care for employees varies. They overuse the new people, and just kind of throw them to the wolves after their 40 hour training on the computers. Unless you have someone working with or above you that is passionate about the job and store, you will not be trained right, and those people do not stick around long. With new management comes managers that do not know you or your goals with the company. Meaning people who feel like they are worth more and want to do more for and with the company, are overlooked or not considered as far as advancements in the company, or come raise time, which has these people looking else where for jobs. It is sad to see the passionate people dwindling out of Home Depot, because you end up with more careless ""paycheck"" only workers, leading to bad customer experiences. Overall I love my job and the flexibility and the benefits, but it is sad to see some people lose their heart for what could be and has been a great place to work and turn into a career. "
good,"Customer Service and Employee Development were an important aspect of the job. There was a need to multi task on many occasions. The daily management responsibilities and task were enjoyable."
good,"All team leaders are supervisors for Home Depot customers. Therefore the first thing I do is usually check if there are updates on any new procedures and updates from management regarding issues. My task is basically everything regarding the homedepot.ca division. Main task are divided between the team leaders. "
good,Very Customer service driven.  Metric driven to a fault.  Compenstation and wages are very competative.  Understaffed.  Uses Seasonality index and Sales Adjusted Hours to staff the sales floor.
good,Home Depot is a great place for growth and has a wide variety of departments that can utilize various individual skills. The management team are wonderful to work with and are always open to new ideas.
good,"Having a schedule two weeks in advance was beneficial; so was the ability to pull a schedule up at home and put in hours available at home. They worked really well with college students and families to ensure work would be available but they weren't dominating your life. When going into work you would have a general sense of where you would be all day and what you would need to do, of course there were occasional side tasks randomly coming up in need of attention. Although the managers were busy all day, they would still work well with their employees to get tasks done. If one could not get a hold of a manager, we were able to rely on each other and call work phones for help from one another. Everyone was really good about working to serve our customers first. The best part about the job would be the recognition we would receive in a meeting held once every three months for the whole store; it felt good to hear we were doing good enough for the store manager to see. "
good,Home Depot is a very good company to work for. Advancement opportunities are limited but still there.
good,There's lots to learn and know about your department and the surrounding departments. It gets busy fast at the store and can get a little hectic at times. 
good,The people are tired! The environment is charged with duties and obligation but no compensation.. 
good,"A typical work day would be multi tasking(answering phones,answering questions,helping customers at the desk,quoting and bidding,helping customers on the floor,follow ups,being a cashier,calling other vendors for special orders.I learned how to manage my time by taking the most important things first,people.My co-workers we all got along together that was so special and half the battle to make our job easier.The hardest part of the day was going home at end of your shift when customer are wanting you.The most enjoyable part of the my job is when you successfully helped customers and they bring you cookies or a starbucks drink or they have told there friends about you and your helping them.What a great feeling."
good,You will learn a lot and it is very easy to advance into management. The hardest part of the job is communication with management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other associates.
good,This was a great learning experience. I learned how to work with the Hawaiian Islands and Alaska for shipping containers of product.
good,"In a typical day at work, I had to multi-task to get my work done.  I had customers to help, individual assignments to complete and closing responsibilities.  I learned to prioritize my tasks while using my time as effectively as possible.  Upper management was very active throughout the store, but my immediate supervisors were very helpful and informative in the Garden Department.   The hardest part of the job was maintaining grace under pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people. "
good,"Un dia comun  atender al cliente principalmente , checar la mercancia que hace falta para surtirla, se prende mucho como el trato a los clientes, obtuve muchos conocimientos de herramienta que es lo que mas me gusto asi como aprender a manejar los equipos de alzamiento(montacargas), es un excelente ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros,lo mas dificil  era tener a tiempo la mercancia para los clientes cuando era mucho volumen. Me gusto mucho el trato gerencial sobre todo los primeros 5 años ya el ultimo año no tanto."
good,"Working at the Home Depot is always interesting.  The people you work with are the best part of it, as the company values people with good communication skills and boisterous personalities.  Everyone is welcome at Home Depot Ajax.  I have learned and honed skills revolving around communication, both with customers and co-workers.  I have become very adept at dealing with stressful, fast paced environments and situations. A typical day at work is busy, and very rarely dull.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers, while the most enjoyable part is your co-workers.  "
good,"un ambiente exelente para propiciar la productividad, buen compañerismo, buena administracion"
good,i was never really concerned with going to work and having a bad day  everyone around me was always smiling laughing and very friendly i never felt out of place everyone was always helpful not just to the customers but to each other as well. 
good,work bays and keep busy cleaning displays and downstocking product. Building displays and fixing price labels.
good,The co-workers kept me informed of shortages.  Communicating with co-workers and outside agencies. 
good,"Everyday is a new challenge, new customers. I treat them like I would want to be treated. I do what is needed to have them happy and wanting to come back. "
good,"Overall, Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. They provide their associates with great health benefits and also yearly bonuses. Holding a supervisory position in the company comes with great benefits as well. The work/ life balance isn't so great at any full time level, but that's not just the company, its retail. For my future I'd like to expand my knowledge to be able to become a manger in any place to be able to provide for my family."
good,The work is pretty easy. The hours of part-time workers are very few; mostly under 20 hours a week. The job can be difficult when the managers asks you to do such unnecessary tasks that can over work an individual. The pay is small in comparison to other home improvement stores.
good,typical day at work is dealing with contractors getting them in and out of the store in an accurate and friendly manner. 
good,"During spring and summer the work environment is fast paced and winter always is really slow. lumber and building materials is one of the toughest departments but once you get the hang of it, everything flows nicely. you learn a lot of stuff with the classes that are provided and also by customer interaction and u can usually learn about other departments by associates. its a fun work environment but as long as you are doing your job and communicating. the new management has got it on lock and are making great progress and have brought up store morale."
good,I learned different types of merchendise in all departments.
good,"Go into work and stretch out for about five minutes to get ready for a day on the job. Working for Home Depot I've learned practical knowledge on all parts of Improving your home. The management is great but advancement here isn't the best for options, and co-workers are always willing to help a lending hand. I would say the hardest part about my job is waking up at 430 AM but having the weekends off is the most enjoyable. "
good,"good people, teamplayers. the company is a wonderful company to work for"
good,"its an fun environment, everyone seems nice. They are very helpful when training."
good,"Most co-workers were very friendly and helpful. It was similar to a family atmosphere which I believe customers enjoy seeing. One large problem was management trying to weed that family atmosphere out by promoting more of a colder and ""professional"" attitude. This company needs to try to get away from the more scripted, automated way of treating customers. I'm getting feedback from people who have visited the store and they don't appreciate the scripts they're getting from associates."
good,"While working in the paint department, I learned a great deal about the paint industry and, thanks to their training, a great deal about paint and related products. The co-workers were friendly and very helpful. Management was brought up from the ranks which was good for morale but some tended to lack management skills. It spite of this, most learned on the job and performed very well. I enjoyed the fast pace and the knowledge obtained."
good,"Writing reviews, writing orders greeting, helping and directing customers and associates, very busy days made days fly by"
good,Fun work place with the staff and also meeting new people everyday. During peak season in summer work becomes very busy.
good,I come in and do a great job ... try and help each and every customer i come in contact with.
good,"Working here has taught me how to learn new things quickly and get better at them very quickly. The co-workers were very friendly, all of them got along with each other and would help one another out.  The hardest part of the job was leaving my wife every night to go work, working nights can take a toll on your body and also your family life. You cant spend time with everyone and sleep at the same time. the most enjoyable part of the job was that people noticed how hard I work. It felt good to know people were noticing what I do, although it is not important for people to recognize what you do, it does feel nice."
good,"I enjoy this job a lot. I get to spend time maintaining my bays, and doing customer service. This is probably one of the simplest jobs I have ever done because there is not a huge amount to do, HOWEVER, there is a lot expected of the maintenance you do. I like that it is so focused, and that my co-workers, for the most part, are enjoyable."
good,I spent a great portion of my life with THD and I have grown immensely as a leader/manager over the past 13 years.
good,"The Home Depot gave me a lot of experience. As a cashier I would work at returns, checked out the customers made sure they found everything they needed and left happy.As the bookkeeper I would make the tills for the cashiers, give change to the cashiers, breakdown the tills at the end of the shift and do the daily bank deposits for the home depot. I would also count the safe three times a day to ensure the safe always balanced, I also did the employee time clock (kronos) and many other office tasks. My last position at the home depot was a BIA I changed the prices and scanned all the out in my departments so they could be filled."
good,Cashier basically great customer service trying to get the customer in the right direction of what he/she needs. I have learned that no matter how angry the customer is there is always something that you can do or say that will brighten their day and make that trip a little better. Management is the only thing that I as an emloyee have an issue with for the simple fact that everyone knows the problems going on among the employee's and no one is trying to fix the problems they are all just waiting to catch their break and get to another store or retire from the company. Co-workers are good at their job some come to work some come to play. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers that take stuff out on you and in reality you have no clue what the other employee did or didnt do to anger the customer. Making the customer happy and being able to help them with their job or project is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Treats their employees very well.I was in charge of the paint dept. My responsibilities were to maintain the dept, and assist in every customers needs. Generally very busy people oriented job. Refined my customer service skills.Hardest part of the job was the unstable schedule."
good,While working for home depot i had a lot of fun management was good and the co-workers was help.
good,"The Home Depot has been a great place to work. They encourage advancement, and try hard to guide people to promote, so the company can promote from within. The hardest part of the job is always the work/life balance. Retail hours can be very tough, and Home Depot does not necessarily accommodate a family lifestyle. The pay is high for most retail, but is not necessarily commensurate with experience and/or ability."
good,Good place to work but too much on fairness needs better leadership
good,Home depot is a great company to work for as a full time associate. As a part-time associate not so much. A typical work day can be stressful when you have associates customers and management all barking at the same time and reports to complete. Multitasking is essential. Management and other co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of my job is the inflexibility of my schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things and know that I have done everything in my power to make the customer happy while following store policy.
good,The co-workers are nice. They are all about customer service. They use computerized scheduling and you put in your availability and that's what it goes by.
good,"a typical day at home depot would be assisting customers where and when ever needed. i learned how to operate 3 or 4 forklifts and a little bit about inventory tagging and rga scanner. management was fair. co-workers was nice people ,but also some showed favoritism, nothing to hard about the job everything fair, nothing to hard, the most enjoyable part the job was working overnight"
good,"Overall it was a good environment to work in. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unsatisfied customers. I had awesome co workers, they were all encouraging and made me feel welcome. My mangers were very considerate and respectful, and made their employees feel comfortable with whatever situation they needed to talk to them about."
good,"Managed wall coverings dept at FLA location, restocked inventory and customer care also."
good,"This is a challenging and fast paced environment. this facility on average, processes nearly 500,000 cartons a week to be sent to 140 stores throughout the northern region. the operation is in a facility that is just over 1 year old, managemnt staff has changed a few times and they are still hiring production staff both on a seasonal and full time basis. the work is challenging both physically (on your feet 7+ hours a day) and mentally (literally thousands of products of all shapes and sizes that must be received and processed), but most of the people make the job enjoyable."
good,Home Depot is a wonderful company to work for. It is solely based on helping customers and providing them with superior customer service. As well as teaching and helping them with their projects. Hardest part of the job was keeping customers from opening the products. Best part of the job was figuring out and fixing issues each individual customers would have with whatever they were working on.
good,"Typical day was loading up freight to carts and stocking it. A lot of heavy lifting, also customer service whenever was needed. I learned how to sku items, drive a forklift and how to properly help customers. Management was layed back but very aware of what was going on, made sure the job was done and done right. The hardest part was remembering where everything in the store was sense it was so big."
good,Love working at the Depot My coworkers were awsome to work with .
good,"I really enjoy this job, and if it were a secure, full-time position I would not look elsewhere."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is fine. I enjoy my job and the benefits. However, I do wish they would provide more hours to part time employees. They keep cutting hours down to 17. How do they expect people to live off of those hours?"
good,"1) Busy selling products and giving information to the public about electrical. Stocking shelves and reading alot of labels and books.,"
good,Working at Home Depot was a lot of fun helping customers with their projects. I dealt with DIY to the expert. I loved learning about new items and products that we would be selling. The worst part of my day was pushing out the riding lawn mowers at 4:30 am.
good,"Its retail, so it comes with the usual assortment of ups and downs. However the management was competent and the fellow employees were excellent. I learned a lot about customer service and about products and services that The Home Depot offers. The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone happy, between your management, team leaders and customers (Hint: sometimes you can't). But on the overall I enjoyed my time at The Home Depot."
good,The best part about working for this company is that everyday your doing something different. One day you may be helping a customer pick out colors for their new home or apartment and the next day you may be helping a customer thats tired of their hardwood floors and wants to replace it with carpet.Their stores are always busy and you will learn something new everyday from different customers you come in contact with.
good,flexible hours
good,when you have to deal with a store manager that acts one way in front of his boss and turns their head when they boss leave is the hardest. the easy part is giving excellent customer service
good,Sometimes I'd start the night with a so called walk through of getting the store closed and any extra details for the nights work. Had problems with Management not giving in-put or feedback on issues that needed to be addressed by upper Management. Loved working with the night crew great bunch of people Trying to put 10 plus hours of work into less than 8 hours of work and having the crew split up in to 2 groups so I had less members to do the same work. The night crew associates.
good,"A typical day of work goes very smooth, no pressure or bad attitude from any co-worker. The hardest part for me is the driving distance almost 120 miles a day. Considering the gas price and the fatigue associated are the reasons that make me consider a change. The most enjoyable part is that every effort is rewarded and recognized. Management listens to associate suggestions."
good,"great place to work while in school, management is willing to work with you."
good,Multi award winning associate with knowledge in several departments.
good,"Customer Service work. Enjoyed working with the public, co-workers were great."
good,When I started Home Depot I didn't even get put into the job I signed up for so there I know this was gonna be an interesting job. I made so many friends though. You will spend a lot of time with these people trust me. I love my home depot famiily with all my heart and would do anything for them. Management was a different story. It always seemed like a game of associates against management. They were always so shady and say one thing like we are going to work with you to move you up and then three weeks later get a horrible review for the year.
good,I enjoy the co workers along with the knowledge you learn about home projects. I do not like working every weekend but thats retail for you.
good,"THD is a great place to work, however, it isn't the easiest to advance towards management. To get a higher wage is a lot harder too."
good,"The people I worked with where great how ever the pay, benefits, and management need to be drastically changed."
good,"co workers are the best to work with on daily basis especially when your having a bad day.They lift your spirits back up without you even knowing put a smile back on face.When ever you need help with your work they are there or with just what ever they make it happen.The hardest part of my job would be working in a non controlling enviromental area throughout the year.The most enjoyable part of my job is always learning something new at the company and me teaching co-worker a smarter or shorter way of getting the job done.As far as management goes,i think a company will have tremendous growth with good decision making and hard efforts put forward along with hard working employees."
good,I enjoyed putting on the orange aprin to get ready to help ppl with anything asked of me.
good,"During a typical day of work, I am at different registers during the day (self-checkout, lumber, or garden). My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Management are good at what they do. The most difficult part of my job is not being able to leave the till to assist customers. I love that there are so many practical things to learn here. I enjoy the hard work and fresh air."
good,"A typical day ar work is too speak to the associates then go check my sales number then start to proceess and work my paperwork in the process of assisting customers. Everydsy I pride myself on learning new ways to make money for the company and learning more about the business. I have worked in management and learning the day to day processes of the business which consisted of controlling your numbers and profits, I love my co- working and team, this is the biggest thing in my time at Home Depot. The hardest part of the job is being properly trained to know your business by upper mangement.The best part of my job is see customers, helping turn their visions in reality, but just being around people that you don't know and just by saying ""Hello Sir or Hello Ma Am"" it's the little things that makes my job enjoyable."
good,"in a daily basis, my job consist in building the most profitable planograms, assists the Merchant in all Space Planning solutions and support all cross functional partners."
good,"A typical day at work for me started at around 4 A.M. every weekday and involved counting the cash from the previous sales date, making sure the vault was balanced, and inserting time for all associates who may have missed a punch or used sick/vacation time. I learned from working at The Home Depot that enthusiasm and sometimes a sense of humor is all you need to get a person to warm up to you. My management was very fair to me most of the time. My composure was always put to the test with a certain one, but I always managed to remain my lighthearted self. My co-workers were very respectable and when I was given some authority there I was not given too much resentment from others. The hardest part of the job was informing management that one of the drawers had come up short and I had the list of cashiers who may be held accountable. It was hard because I know people make mistakes and in this economy no one can afford to lose their job over an error such as that. The most enjoyable part of the job was being the one, among all associates not in management, most called upon when computers and registers stop working, equipment stops working, or people stop working, in terms of covering lunches. I became a very versatile employee; a factotum if you will."
good,Home Depot is a secure company to work for but the pay and benefits are lacking as well as the motivation to advance within a store environment.
good,"Working with the public was great as the customers were very friendly for the most part. I got the opportunity to answer phone when needed as that was a great learning experience. Management was great but a little bit more acknowledgement would have been nice. The co-workers were friendly and great to work with. The hardest part of the job was when you would get a disgruntle customer, which did not happen often. The best part of the job was everyone was so friendly and easy to work with."
good,I love how they stick to the guidelines and willingness to be flexible.
good,"In every encounter in life I attempt to grow and learn something pertinent from the experience. This happens to be a work environment, therefore I always look for a means of professional development."
good,-provided good customer service to all
good,Typical day at work is customers service.
good,A typical day at work was enjoyable. Besides a Coworker or 2 that was quite rude I worked with just about anyone just fine.
good,"Home Depot was a fun and exciting place to work. The days went by quickly with always a task or project to complete. As a operations manager daily duties were driving customer service standards, merchandising and promoting key products, controlling payroll and other key metrics to run a profitable business unit. Communication with store associates on a wide range of topics including personal goals. company objectives, achievement of daily, weekly, monthly goals. The hardest part of the job was reaching company set metrics in a challenging and distressed economical times. Most enjoyable part of management was the interaction with customers and employees on a daily basis."
good,"Every time I go to work, I am always willing to learn new things because my co-workers/supervisors are very helpful in giving me a hand. They always make sure that I am providing good customer service to each and every customers that shops at The Home Depot."
good,"One of the things I really like most about working at the Home Depot is we as associates are actually helping people in our local community. This job can be very rewarding. People come to us for help becuase they really have no where else to turn. Whether it be a busted pipe in their bathroom or trying to find the right tool for the job, it feels rewarding when I am actually able to help someone."
good,Great company but a horrible management line. i learned how to operate forklifts and i was certified in 5 departments. no room for growth in the company tho.
good,great place to work.a place where you can feel valuable. and friendly co-workers.
good,great atmosphere great hours and great compensation plenty of work space
good,"the hardest part of home depot is that we have to pay high price for the benefits, no good compensation company anymore ."
good,My overall rating is achiever meaning in the near future there is room for advancement.
good,"A typical day consisted of providing fast, accurate, and friendly check-out service. Being able to multitask, use of radios, phones, scanners...Help customers with location of products and provide product knowledge."
good,"Working here was like a family environment. We learned together, disagreed and agreed to disagree like family. This is a nice place for a starter job for anyone."
good,"Process orders, respond to emails and phone calls."
good,Learned a lot about DIY home improvement to better provide customer service.
good,"A great place to work, some great people to work with, and some of the most interesting customers and projects"
good,loved people loved working there compensation was good until company went public then things went down hill with service and money
good,"This job was actually my most challenging to date. I managed several departments in the store, and had 30-40 people directly under me. I learned a great deal about managing people here, and a good bit about human resources as well. I also got a good basic understanding of the building industry. The people who work for Home Depot are some of the most knowledgeable employees I have ever worked with. They also take the most pride in their company. They're a great group to work with. Management here was also really good, with one notable exception. The most difficult part of the job was absorbing the wealth of information required to effectively manage employees who had been doing their jobs for years whereas I came from another company. The most enjoyable part was definitely the great people I worked with."
good,"The Home Depot is a very diverse and fast-paced work environment. Every day is a something slightly different than the day before, which keeps you constantly re-accessing and striving to improve. I had the opportunity to develop and learn many skills while employed with The Home Depot, including knowledge management, corporate training, PHP and HTML development, team supervision and improvement, and many more. I even had the opportunity to travel to India to work with Tata Consulting and spend 3 weeks training their associates on our stores and technology. Overall the last 7 years has been an amazing and education experience which has helped round out my natural leadership skills."
good,Every morning id walk in and assess what needs to be done from what was never finished from last night including putting all the new supplies on the shelves usually from the new truck that pulled in that morning.
good,co workers were very great a day was easy going fast paced were everyone worked together/moved through must of the positions they had to offer/the supervisors were very helpful and understanding/the hardest part of the job was in the winter time because it wasn't fully equip to handle with enough heat/
good,"Friendly associates, always training to learn more about your position or another position,"
good,"Really enjoyed kitchen design. Workplace is always challenging, customers usually easy to work with for a new kitchen design."
good,My overall experience at this company was pretty good. The people were very nice and customers were a pleasure to help.
good,1. ringing up customer merchandise and offering store credit cards
good,"The production level was high and the moral was high as well, pretty good Management space to work and room to grow."
good,Overall good company.
good,management was very helpful and always available and open to teaching new skills. i learned how to drive a fork lift and acquried new skills in new departments. co workers were always there when needed.
good,"my day included helping customers and assisting other departments when hlep is needed, i learned that there is so much you can do to your home, my supervisors and managers were always helpful and available, my co-workers were fun and friendly, the hardest part was cleaning my department at closing time, was getting to see and work with things that i never tried and having fun while doing it."
good,"I really enjoyed my position at the Home Depot. I worked in several different departments while working there. I was trained to work in the garden area, flooring, Customer service, and cashier positions. It was a great psoitive and friendly place to work. The management team was very good. They were always present and helpful at all times. I got along with all of the employees at the location. It was very enjoyable going to work every day. The hardest part about the job was the limitations on the amount of hours that were available to me. I would've loved to have had a full-time position within the company but part-time is all that was available. During the summer I was given 32-40+ hours but in the winter my hours were cut down to 6-10 hours a week. The best part of the job was helping customers and constantly staying busy. I also really enjoyed cross training and learning alot of different departments and available resources within the store."
good,"I worked at 3 different store locations, and after 5 years and climbing from lot associate to freight supervisor I was fired for breaking an SOP without even trying to work with me. I know of an associate who was caught selling drugs to other workers and was allowed to go on LOA to attend drug rehab and was able to return as dept supervisor. I mistook my wifes medication for mine and after hurting my self on the job, failed a drug screen and was fired."
good,"I enjoy working for Home Depot, the co workers are friendly , also enjoy helping the customers find what they need for their projects"
good,helping a great deal of customers
good,Very flexible part time hours. Plenty of training in my field to keep me up to date on new products.
good,"A typical day at work on a slow day is very broing, but I make it fun talking to customers and trying to help them in any possible way that I can. I learned that patience is a virtue. As far as management goes, they were okay when everyone did their job. I liked most of my co-workers when they kept their personal business to themselves. The hardest part of my job was trying to find something to do when everything was done. Interacting with customers was the enjoyable part of my job."
good,Home Depot Is a GREAT Company! Good Job Security and manager
good,"Overall Home Depot is a great company to work for, great corporate leadership and strong values. Sometimes certain managers within the store can be a damper on personal success in the store while, at the same time, another manager in the store can make you a much better person and employee. You must be great at adapting to good and just horrible situations. Last note, they mention how great it is you can work for THD and transfer all over the country, sadly I found the truth to be it only really works if your a part time person. Apparently six years of strong full time leadership service is not transfer worthy. Like I said earlier though its overall good, I enjoyed my job with THD so much that it angers me I am being forced to find a new job because they cant transfer me."
good,"Home Depot was great! Descent pay , my co-workers were great also. My only problem was it was a temp job, and i didnt know when it was going to end. The assignment actually lasted 8 mths which was pretty long to me but i wish it could've been permenant."
good,"home depot was a great place to work, i had lots of fun in what i did and like how it was. I was able to work at my own pace and get much work done. I drove the forklift, order picker, and reach truck every day and loaded onto customers vehicles which i thought was the funnest part of my day. The other associates were great and i loved working with them. They were very nice and kind towards eachother. The management at home depot was great aswell they looked after us and taught us many skills which i can use today towards my future goals in my career with cabinet making and carpentry. There were many times where i would have rude of angry customers and i would have to deal with their problems and figure out a spot where we can meet in the middle with the disagreement and finish with the customer being happy and ready to come back for more. overall it was a great place to work and taught me tons about life."
good,Home Depot is huge on customer service. I learned a great deal in interacting with people. Had many customers write great reviews on there encounters with me at the store.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at The Home Depot is the customers and associates. There are plenty people there that loves to lend a helping hand. Absolutely no one is alone. Whenever you need a helping hand (no matter what your doing or whatever situation you're in), there is always someone willing to help."
good,a place to learn patience kindness and serving others no matter what mood they are in. management was at times short handed so you had to learn to be a profitable employee by recognizing what needed to get done in your department. overall the job is what you make of it.
good,- great working experience.
good,"Arriving, you would be greeted by your supervisor with a wonderful attitude; ready to help in any way possible."
good,"Being a pilot program, this is a little different than just working anywhere with THD. Overall, hard to review, but not a bad experience."
good,work en environment is really great and customer service is our number one priority
good,I enjoyed working at the Home Depot. The hardest part of the job was just making sure everything that you needed to do got done before you had to leave if the store was busy. The nice thing about it was if you came in as a mid shift the person before you would normally come and find you and walk the department with you and tell you what needed to be finished what they did and why they were unable to finish what they needed.
good,"Typically working at Home Depot you are constantly busy, its is a never ending learning experience. Before I went to work there I didn't know anything about: electrical, plumbing, and I knew very little bout garden. But while in employ there I learned a lot about all those things and more, everyday I learned something new. And when you are a sponge for knowledge like me, thats awesome. The people working there often looked out for each other, it was kinda like that familial thing. Many of my coworkers I came to consider friends. Some of the my older coworkers came to almost be like a parent or grandparent figure, they looked out for me and I them. Management was always kind and understanding. For example, some of the employees use public transportation but when the buses went on strike management didn't write them up or anything if they were late or couldn't make it in at all, they were understanding, as long as you kept them informed. I think the hardest part was the downtime that sometimes happened. I like to be either physically or mentally busy and when there are no customers, standing there with nothing to do and nobody to talk to is actually exhausting. I really enjoyed getting credit card approvals. I was good at it. It was my niche. I had the highest approval rate in the store and almost had the highest in the district. Came in second to a full timer, I was just part time. But I was hot on her trail. Anyways, corporate gave me awards, pins, and even a plaque. It was nice. I felt like I accomplished something. And I did. I was always told customers with a store credit"
good,"We were the direct support for our stores. One of my roles was the responsibility for all indirect items for our new store openings. This required strategic planning, adhereing to tight deadlines and constant vendor coordination. I eventually moved into our ""Instore Environment Department where I was part of a team that was responsibility for sign resets and grand openings. We handled all aspects of the signage rersets from ordering the needed products to shipping and follow-ups. This was probably the most enjoyable part of my job. Being involved in many aspects of the project. I enjoyed working with my team and the management was very supportive. I guess the hardest part of my job was that our computer systems did not talk to each other and it sometimes made it cumbersome to obtain needed information on a timely basis. ie purchase order..."
good,The people are nice.
good,Home Depot is one of the better place to work that i have experienced due to their broad scope of business and the ability to actually move up in the company. depending on which department you're working in you have a different experience daily. Although your job is basically the same day to the being that you're primarily servicing the needs of he customers no to days may ever be a like. Being able to have different experiences and doing different tasks helps to keep the job enjoyable.
good,"Good place to work. Have a great supervisor and a great team! I am on the MET team. I have fun when I work, but I also work hard, and the people on my team work hard as well!"
good,Helping customers everyday finding their items in everyday life
good,"• Provide exemplary customer service, establishing strong relationships that add value to our services and products"
good,"Customer service is what The Home Depot is about, selling the complete project. I learned how to be a team player, communicate and work together, profit & loss and time managment."
good,fast pace
good,"greeting custonmers, making every customer feel like home when they come inside homdepot.i learned to respect others and always smile ."
good,Is fun and you learn how to deal with different customers situations daily. The employees are nice and they are very great to work with
good,I absolutely loved my time at The Home Depot. The company has successfully created a strong culture and has solid pay and benefits.
good,"Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. A typical day at work would focus around providing excellent customer service from dealing with the customers to maintaining the store for customers. Management was decent and fair, as long as you constantly executed you job duties you would receive your recognition for for possible promotions etc."
good,Worked if they asked me to and if they called me in. It was long hour sometimes but I liked working with the people who came into the store.
good,Meeting all types of different people. Benefits for employees for good.
good,I started out as a cashier and moved up to a head cashier. As a head cashier I made sure that the lines were running and that if there were any complaints I would take care of them. I also balanced registers. Then moved to receiving and enjoyed that until I hurt my back.
good,always easy never a dull day. Its always nice customers that come in an make your day. The employees are friendly and easy to get along with. Most days its like one big family.
good,Great Company to work for just depends on how the store manager manages each store
good,Very good place to work. Managers were great and friendly. Most of the associates were nice to work with. Very easy to stay busy and a lot of work do to though out the work day.
good,"Flexable hours, excellent training and workplace enjoyment"
good,"Since it was retail, there was a lot of employee turnover. Management was pretty good halfway into the job. Fun place to work. Crazy hours led to difficult time with children. A typical day was servicing the customer and making sure product was out and delegating responsibilities to those working in my departments. Preparing reports and ordering product."
good,Ok...but the 8pm-2am really kills me. I'd like to work in a 9-5pm enviorment.
good,"A fast pace work environment that places the customer’s needs in the care of the employees. With hands on training in any area of home improvement, and opportunity for advancement in the prospering stores. I believe that better employee recognition and better pay will help this company to flourish even the more."
good,Great way to learn how to deal with people during home improvement projects and to get a basic understanding of contractors working with your customers.
good,I usually close the paint department. I help customers as best as i can.
good,Would take care of situations that would arise for customers and orders that needed attention for their installations.
good, Provided excellent service to 350-400 peak time customers
good,"A Typical Day would be to review sales and check for out of stocks. Check the schedule for coverage, begin to work the area for safety and company standards.Follow up with associate work lists and inquire about other opportunities I might have missed. Checking controllable things like overtime, markdowns and hours. I have learned from home depot how to prioritize and maintain a positive team environment that is focused on the customer. The hardest part of the job is really finding enough hours to complete everything you need to, but the key is to utilize your team. The most enjoyable part of my job is that customer who is just pleased with your service and each time they see you its like a family reunion."
good,"on a typical day you would help customers find what they need,make price quotes and answere incoming phone calls to answere customers quetions. I learned good customer service skills and how to use many diffrent tools and forklift equipment. Managment was overall good.Meet alot of nice co-workers at home depot some great hard working people.The hardest part of the job is it was usually understaffed at very busy times which made custmers wait longer for help.over all i enjoyed home depot and enjoyed interacting with all the diffrent customers and employes."
good,a typical day you come in do your work and once its time to go you can leave they dont really offer overtime
good,"A typical night starts with me arriving about 30 minutes early to prepare. I punch in as we close and immediately start flat stacking the lumber bunks and planning as to what I can bring in from out back. I then bring in the new wood and refill the cradles and over head that are empty. Any extra wood I then stack outside the door for security and safety. At the end of my shift I sweep and pick up any broken boards. I have learned many different things in my time at The Home Depot be it how to help upset costumers or finding answers to difficult questions. Most of the management are easy to get along with and helpful. My co-workers are good workers and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of my job has to be hand stacking the heavy beams and bags of concrete along with being the only one at that end of the building. To contrast, the most enjoyable part is the feeling of accomplishment I get from seeing how much lumber I put away and how nice the department looks when I am done."
good,"A typical day is fast paced, constantly dealing with different customers and personalities. Overall its a good company to work for and its good learning and work experience."
good,"Customer Service, learned about all diferent types of merchandise, for different types of customers. Different ways of ordering merchandise. Management was ok, the hardest part was when it got slow during the day, and the best was when it was very busy."
good,"This is my first job. After a year of being hired as a cashier, I was promoted to a head cashier. There is a lot of customer interaction involved with the job. I learned a lot about many of the products that we sell and what to recommend to customers. And if I do not know how to answer a customer question, I cantact someone who knows the answer and listen to them so that I may know for the future. From this job, I learned how to provide excellent customer service and ensure that no customer goes unassisted or unsatisfied."
good,It's retail so you stay busy. Large scale resets. Maintained relationships with management and employees. Maintained products approved for distribution. Marketing.
good,"great company, good benefits ,401k dental, vision,good pay once get promotion"
good,"independant work , computer driven, . six of us worked as a team , worked all buying orders , price changes , plan -o grams , sales displays, sales"
good,I love the company and the job but retail in general is not for a person starting a family. The only reason Im leaving is to spend time with my family and to have a set steady schedule so I dont miss anything as my children grow up.
good,I help many people find what they need to start and finish their projects. I enjoy learning and working hard to help other people. If there is a problem I feel comfortable speaking with my supervisors and resolving the issue. Customers always come first!!! My coworkers make the day much more exciting. The hardest part of the job is loading the heavy items into someones vehicle.
good,Everything with this company is great with the exception that it takes about 5-7 years move into management and the company cares less whether one has a degree or not.
good,"As a MET associate I maintain vendor product sets and displays, introduce new product to the store and conduct PK training for the store associates. Using planograms and vendor guidelines, sets are verified, stocked and cleaned with periodic resets and new displays built and installed. I work with a small team (5 people) to maintain a 116,000 square foot store rotating through the various departments through the week. Every day is different, some projects are small and some take 2 or 3 days to complete. It is challenging to totally demerchandise a bay and then build it back so it looks better than it did previously."
good,I very much enjoyed the interaction with customers as well as co-workers. I am currently on a leave of absence and have been informed of medical restrictions that have forced me to search for employment with less physical requirements.
good,"Just a hard eight hour shift, management is very approachable and down to earth, co-workers are very friendly and almost like family, the hardest part of the job is the consistant changes it is also a very physical job, the most enjoyable part of the job is by far the people"
good,work days could be busy sometimes but not to stressful. i enjoyed working there.
good,Salaries and Culture varies from store to store. Typical day at work includes helping DIY Customers as well as Contractors to find items needed from plumbing to Gardening and everything in between. Hardest part of the job is learning Product. If you are eager to learn and love hands on learning this is the Company for you. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunities to interact with all levels of people from the most knowledgeable to the person who just wants to learn how to do their own home improvements. Kids Workshops are great fun as well.
good,Home Depot was a great place to work. I learned alot from my supervisor.
good,The people you work with at the home depot make it a family. Management needs improvement. Customers are very diverse and you must be able to adapt quickly to peoples personality.
good,This company was fun to work for and the people who work there really care about the customers. I enjoyed working here but needed full time employment to pay the bills.
good,Fun workplace were u will ultametly gain superior customer service skill due to the high volume of people traffic
good,The pay isn't great but you do get benefits which is a plus. They keep you informed of upcoming changes and products coming in the store!
good,As a overall job it was a excellent place to work at. They were very flexible with hours and work schedule.
good,Great management that recognizes hardworkers and awards them with perks and benefits.
good,"I started at The Home Depot as a part-time cashier while in college. 4 1/2 years later, I am still employed at The Home Depot, and now I am a full-time Supervisor."
good,Sales position that was a new store located downtown Jersey city NJ
good,"As a department supervisor, you are responsible for not only your department, but also the store in general. Massive amounts of paperwork. Challenging, but not too much. They have a tendency to get rid of people without trying to solve issues first."
good,A good company to work for. Some management policies can be questionable. Overall the staff and management team work together and create a good environment.
good,"Great first sales associate job, had a lot to learn and they taught what I needed to know and more."
good,"This job was a hard labor job that required long hours. This Job also required that you work holidays, early mornings,late nights and weekends. I was very appreciative of my job but very exhausted after every shift. I worked for this company for a long time and they were really good to me."
good,"Good company to work for, like helping other people and my community when I have the chance to"
good,"Working for the company was a worthwhile experience, interacting with customers, greeting them with a smile and being able to make a positive impact in my department was a plus."
good,"The Expo Design Center is a subsidiary of The Home Depot. It is a high end home store. We did lighting design, kitchen and bath remodels. It was a great company to work for and I enjoyed my time there. I was a lighting designer and did inventory control."
good,"I had a very positive experience with Home Depot. I feel that they treated me well and because of my work ethic and positive attitude, I made many advancements in my 3 year career with them."
good,"Each day is filled with addressing and resolving customer escalations. We liaison between the customer, field, store team and management via written and verbal communications."
good,"You have to get credit , and leads for other departments and work without complaint and ask for extra work and call in on your days off to get more hours. Few people get full time anymore without really working hard to get there and it will take a few  months to several months.  IF they do not offer you full time in less than a year you are not working hard enough"
good,My job was doing inventory and giving good customer service. I loved the hours and the job. They also had stock and a good 401 plan for the associates.
good,Good people strong foundation for up coming love the atmosphere of the company great benefits to working there as well but just a great job all together
good,Hours are flexible. People are great to work with. Sometimes stressful but overall a decent place to work. Management is there to help and teach you new things about the job.
good,I really enjoyed my job and made some really good friends however sometimes it was stressful when new demands we're put on us as cashiers to pressure customers to sign up for the credit cards always had a goal set by your department manager. I owner of the store was excellent to deal with always there ready to listen and help and tried to solve any issues he could.
good,I would recommend Home Depot to every person I know it’s an good place to work at. In the future I’m looking forward to getting back in with Home Depot hopefully
good,The Home Depot sets industry leading standards for customer service and associate relations. Innovation is at the forefront of this companie's leading edge vision to be the #1 customer service retailer in the world.
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work at. They make you feel welcome and as a family. The pay is just not the greatest. And make sure you know your schedule
good,"The schedule flexibility is so good Depends the position your in , management not really they have to much favoritism, and customers are rude and they expect to much from you"
good,The employees and the overall environment were a blast and the work wasn’t too hard although physically demanding. The biggest problems stems from the lack of communication from management and the hours tend to fluctuate heavily and are very random at times.
good,hands on great company training provide. easy to move up no life work balance. long hours great compensation package. if you work hard you can make a great career
good,"I do enjoy the company as a whole, the associates I work, and the fact that they give back to surrounding communities that are in need, but there are down falls. The managers get switched out frequently,  so sometimes you get great ones that are always available and very helpful, others...... you rarely even see them at all. Another thing is you rarely get any recognition for doing a great job! And yes I really wish the pay was much better, but the benefits are good."
good,"It's easy to get along with most people there. The work can be repetitive but the employees make it worthwhile! Management can be a little stretched, which leads to miscommunication, but overall the job isn't the worst I've had."
good,Everyone is treated like family at Home Depot and the benefits are great compared to other companies in the same line of work. The pay could be better.Always learning and getting trained in all aspects of the work place and they make it easy to better yourself. Receiving is the most stressful part of Home Depots structure. You are only one person and can have 5 trucks show up at the same time demanding to be offloaded. Just go by the appointment schedule and do in that order. Employees are treated great and rewarded. Have special lunch events and contests.
good,I have worked in many different departments at The Home Depot. I enjoy my job and the people I work with but within the last year or so management has made many changes that have not benefited the employees in any way. This may just be at my store but I've heard it has happened at many surrounding stores as well. The job pays well!
good,Not enough time off. Time starts at 6. At 6:01 you are late and incur a 1/4 point against their attendance policy. But overall a good well paying company.
good,"one of the best jobs i ever had, people you work for feel like family. the job is easy to keep afloat due to the teamwork all employees demonstrate. the weather is the only downfall, outside in the cold somedays"
good,Home depot does work with you to try and advance your career there and they look out for you in a time of need. The  have quarterly bonus if the numbers are good.
good,Home Depot has a great work environment. No judgement is pass around or racism. Everyone is treated equally and with respect at all times. They fix your schedule to make it flexible for you to work without problems or complications.
good,"Pros-"
good,Una area de mucho trabajo bajo precion aprendí varias cosas y sobre todo trabajar en equipo
good,"The most joy you get from your job is the satisfaction you receive from the staff that you are working over. A lot of the staff that was below me were younger and were trying to find a job to put them through school. Therefore, I found myself coaching them through different situations and scenarios."
good,Working at this company allows for flexibility and advancement. Most employees are friendly and knowledgeable of job tasks and requirements. Community outreach is paramount in this company.
good,"It was a simple job.  Pick things up, put things down, move things around.  But the thing that really made the Freight team special was the people.  Everyone there was just one of the nicest people I've worked with.  Some of which I'm still friends with today.  If you need a nice part-time job to cover the bills, look no further than the Home Depot."
good,1500 a year tuition reimbursement made it a good job for a college student. There is plenty of work inside. It's also easy to hide. This makes it a good job whether you like to work or not.
good,If you can put up with the customers it's a good place to work the people are friendly the management that takes real good care of you every holiday you work they have special meals for you
good,"its was one of my best work places, I've learned alot, done alot, and seen people come and go. it has some of the friendliest people I've known, and still to date I keep in touch with them"
good,"This job entails various daily activities for me, as I am an associate in six different departments. A typical day for me in this job consists of working a few hours as a customer care/ services associate, then spending a few hours in hardware, cashiering and delivering store items to customers. I learned a lot about how to maturely deal with frustrated or irritable customers, how to handle cash effectively and how to work on store inventory. The hardest part of this job was juggling it with my school schedule, but I always managed to find a way to accomplish this. The most enjoyable part was being able to work and make new friends with my fellow associates and helping a customer with whatever problem they had."
good,This place was great to work at they have many opportunities you could work yourself up to. You can grow a lot in this place. They are very welcoming and encouraging in your growing level and flexible with your scheduling.
good,The compensation was good the the flexible hours was great but the management treated it's employees so horrible it was no recognition for anything we done the management tore you down more than they wanted you to succeed
good,This job definitely was one that was quite flexible with it’s hours and welcoming when it came to me wanting to learn more. While there I worked within 4 different departments and learned quite a lot from them
good,I had a good time working here you never know how the days going to go. Most managers were great but some didn’t know what they were doing or how to talk to people.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, They don't ride you bad. Provide two yearly bonuses and food on several occasions. Freight team is a little strenuous. Provide good training."
good,"Age friendly, compensation is not great, strong job culture, work schedules are variables depending on the department you are working, medical and dental are competitive."
good,Home depot is cool. I wish there was more pay to be honest... it just gets so boring there as a cashier. You try to do everything you can to stay occupied
good,"Home Depot truly cares about its Employees they increase salary when needed they do reward employees and sometimes pay for Friday meals monthly and truly cares about the wellbeing of employees."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at the Home Depot is the bond built with other associates especially those who are willing to help you get work done. Management is great at helping when it comes to issues and will even help come up with plans for problem solving. The only time the job becomes difficult is when a large number of employees call out and you are left to cover multiple departments alone
good,"Excelentes beneficios y oportunidades. Un trabajo fácil pero así te exigen. Aumento cada año casi siempre de mas 50 centavos, dependiendo tu evaluación."
good,It’s a great job to have if u not that Busy because u are working 4  pm until 2:30 in the morning but other then that everybody is cool the team members will treat u like family
good,"It's a fairly easy job to get if you apply for all positions. The first few months are okay, but the more you learn about how the store works you start to notice it's flaws. If you're part-time be careful of hour cuts because it happens at least two times a year."
good,Home Depot Warehouse is a good place to work I had fun there everyday doing my job this company makes you feel like you belong there. Really good superiors.
good,"Flexible work schedule, especially since I still go to school. The people you work with are fun once you get to know them. I was able to pick up the training pretty fast."
good,"Home Depot is a sound and secure company you do not have to worry about job security unless you are not on time. Not being on time is the quickest way to get terminated at Home Depot. I wore jeans and a polo shirt for my interview. This is the dress code for males, Women jeans and a nice top with some type of collar."
good,"Great company, competitive wages. "
good,"Customer service a priority. Giving back to the community a must. Creating shareholder value and taking care of fellow associates a must."
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for. The main issue causing me to depart was the work environment. If the Call Center was to relocate, I wouldn’t mind working there again. They most definitely should invest in their own private building."
good,"The typical day is dependent on what time you shift starts. Opening requires with walking down department verifying that area is clean and safe. Then you make sure the all shelves are stocked, attending to customers is top priority at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers.  The most difficult part of the job is not having what the customer needs. I have learned a lot about customer service and the retail business. Management works very hard to make it an enjoyable environment. All employees work effectively as a team to support customer needs and keep the store operating safely and efficiently."
good,"The Home Depot has corporate goals it wants to achieve like any other large company. The leadership provides great opportunities to all associates in an attempt to achieve said goals. Overall, their culture and drive to succeed makes The Home Depot a solid place to work."
good,I have spent many years here and learned how to work well with my environment. I have learned a lot of different systems and work well with others and customers well.
good,The people made the difference at Home Depot.  The culture is customer first but the leadership made the associates feel just as valued.  No employee discount in store but a great discount program with other companies.
good,One of the best call centers I have worked for. The best by far in AZ. If you have a chance to be referred here by some you absolutely will not regret taking a job offer.
good,"Nice people and environment. Many options to be a part of, and they make you feel important in the smallest of jobs there.  Compensation is minimal, but THD is an upcoming company striving for success."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to learn sales skills as a foundation job and grow within the company if a career with The Home Depot is desired. I have grown in this company and gained sales skills myself.
good,"Great crew to work with. My only complaint was standing in one place or walking for  8 hours on concrete floors. My feet couldn’t handle it. If I had the right shoes/boots, I may have been able to withstand the concrete floors. Great place to work. I miss working at Home Depot."
good,"It’s a great job from young people in school because they are very flexible with going away for school. When the management shows they care about their employees, it makes us want to work more than expected."
good,"good place to work and learn how to heavy equipment for the same pay grade, management is not the best in the home depot of race way Westbury , I wish that they would paid more than $12.00 hourly"
good,"Great people, convenient location, and fair pay make this an excellent place to work. I would definitely recommend this corporation to others seeking employment."
good,I is a fun and challenging environment.  Stable and easy to make a career of it.  I have been working there for 5 years and the time goes by easy.  Challenging and no two days are the same.  Always interacting with new people and varying assignments.
good,"Customer First and Workplace Diversity..."
good,Good place to work. you get a Lotta hours. flexible schedule bonus pay. The only thing that holds the Home Depot from be coming one of the best places to work at is the pay. The pay is 11.25 to start and one year later 11:50.
good,Good place to have a part time job or retirement job. There is oppertunity for advancement if you would like to make a career there.  Home Depot likes to hire from within for upper positions.
good,"I love how every month we have a least 2 special events that go on. It creates a sense of inclusion that I absolutely love! Whether it be the Homer Fund or a fundraising event, it creates a sense of family"
good,"I work over there for almost 4 months and the place, the culture and everything is all good and have a lot of fun. The people around me is so kind and they will teach you when you don't know the basic things you need to learn about your position at work."
good,Great job that pays well.Company has great benefits and teaches you a lot.Anything is possible if you work for it.It could be a career depending on your interest.
good,"There are some great people that work at Home Depot kind and giving of their time and respect the customers. Some management who give their all each and every day are great. But more "
good,"Tienen una buena cultura y sus valores, pero la administración no es muy buena que digamos, los asociados son de lo mejor, pero los gerentes no saben tratar a a la gente y hay preferencias como todos lados"
good,The company is very caring to their associates very understanding with life events and situations and help you when it’s necessary and rewarding when it comes to associates preforming outstandingly
good,"Standard Retail job. Hard but satisfying work, especially if you like working with people who are looking for problems to be solved. Management was always supportive."
good,"The hardest part about the job is the constant work. Some trucks you will encounter will have somewhere between 800-1500 items on that truck, and you need to get all of it out and organized into certain departments. Some items need to be moved by forklift because they are too heavy for a regular person. Although this may seem hard, the constant business and always needing to complete a task keeps me energized and never bored."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for with a chance to grow with them. The work schedule is good as are the benefits. The facility is nice and clean
good,The workerd there are friendly and hardworking. You would able to do hands- on trainning the first day on the job and will learn different things about construction.
good,"This was my favorite job,  would have stayed but only part time hours.  And the pay wasn't great. The managers took time to know you.  They were great with events.  And overall cared!"
good,"The Home depot strives to put its customers, and associates first.  And other than the occasional problem employee, the company takes care of each other, living the values set forth by corporate everyday. "
good,Great company to work for. You are kept very busy during your shift. Easy to build relationships with customers and staff. Compensation is just for cashier work.
good,Nice place to learn new things and interact with costumers. Costumers always come first but the company keeps employees happy with decent pay and parties.
good,They do not pay for any vehicle expenses and outside sales is 100% commission. You drive approx. 200 miles per day. Leads from store were generally good.
good,"es genial no hay tanta presion  , y hay mucha flexibilidad"
good,I learned as a group we all have to pitch in as in do your part no meed to panic if anything ask questions and be a team player it can help the environment you are in have positive attitude it also helps
good,"Dress comfortably to where you can move around & not be afraid to get a lil durty, make friends to where the time goes by quicker & you could get feedback from colleagues that see obstacles that'll come your way a little less complicated."
good,Some employees did not quite understand that they needed to do their fair share so that the day could go by much easier. Teamwork was not always enforced by associates and superiors.
good,"fast paced, fun we worked as a team and it made it fun fun to come to work. the hardest part about the job was when the trucks were late with a load we had to work just as fast to get trucks loaded and unloaded."
good,I work in a fast paced environment that requires my full attention and dedication while I am work. Overall i enjoy working there and it is always a busy day at The Home Depot.
good,My overall experience at the Home Depot was a great one. The people are there for each other teaching and helping you adjust to you position. There are always opportunities to advance in the company.
good,"Very good position with plenty of benefits and training allowing for growth within the company. As well, fast paced environment allowing for little boredom with fair pay and breaks."
good,Is a good place to start working if going to school they provide a lot of benefits and programs to students and non students hours are all over the place but that is expected of a retail environment though they work with you if you have another job or attend school.
good,home depot is a great place to work and i was sad when i had to leave for health reasons. but would recommend this job has great benefits and easy schedule if you can work nights.
good,A day at work for me as an energetic young man who does what hes assigned to it fun and interesting... I meet good people I can talk to and have fun with always whiles discharging my duties.
good,"on a typical day it's busy, sometimes you get nice customers and sometimes you get rude customers, you tend to just go with the flow and just try to help the customer has much as you possibly can."
good,A Positive environment that encourage growth and development. Always encourage the employees to learn more an prosper in your position.  Learn about other position to become A greater employee.
good,Great place to work if not opposed to retail hours. Annual raises dependent on review. Great community involvement and focuses a lot on veterans. Never an issue with advancement.
good,Great environment to work in. Management is very friendly. Promotions given often.  Performance awards and recognition monthly. Pay raises are good and often with time.
good,"The Home Depot was a great work experience. The bosses and management were great. I would have liked to have had a full time position there. This is a great company if you are willing to learn and work hard, they are willing to invest time in teaching you and helping you be successful."
good,I really enjoyed my time at the Home Depot. I would really recommend it to any High school students looking for a part time job. Sadly I was forced to leave when the new management was no longer willing to work around my school schedule.
good,The job is a good one especially if you don't have insurances because The Home Depot does provide good benefits for the employees. Overall i learned alot about the company and construction in general.
good,"I’ve worked in flooring for about 8-9 years, I enjoy helping customers finalize ideas and complete potential installation projects.  My knowledge in flooring was limited, but since joining the flooring department, I have gained so much information and enjoy learning more."
good,"Enjoyed the time I was there, but grew tired of it. The company has fallen from associate oriented to money grabs. It's falling downhill in terms of morale."
good,Home Depot takes care of their people.  Always striving to make sure customers are priority. Advancement can be struggle with such an established workforce.
good,love working here. In the beginning i thought everyone being nice is temporary but it never went away its been 6 months and everyone is still as nice as the day i got there.
good,I would return for a competitive role ASAP.  The company takes care of thier people.  The expansion is currently providing opportunities that were once stagnant.
good,"Everyone is nice and friendly and helpful when help is needed. The associates are great and a lot of team work is used at this store. Management is ok, it could be better. Overall Home Depot is a good place to work at."
good,Needs to train employees for better positions. Rotating employees would be a good idea. Should know different aspects of the Store. Customers can be rude sometimes.
good,"It's half decent, I enjoy working there well enough. I find if the bosses are good then the work is great, busy days that make the days good fast, but not overwhelming,"
good,I was only at the home Depot for about 8 months before I left for college but it was a great experience overall. The management were friendly and approachable the hours were available and flexible and the benefits package was really good especially as it started from day one even as a part time employee
good,"Good place to work. Management treat you with respect, reward employees. As as cashier the only problem was after company added more selfcheck hours were cut. Some weeks i only worked 1 day."
good,"Great people to work with, no drama. They listen and do their best to accommodate for you if injured or any other reasons. Good environment to be in, usually lots to do to stay busy."
good,"This job can be very fast paced but it makes your day go by much quicker. You will be doing a mixture of order pulling and customer service from what I have found. As you will still be wearing a company apron and people will stop you because of it. Which is fine usually the interactions last at most 5 minutes. Though any longer can mess up how long it will take to get deliveries that are going out the next day. So limited customer interaction will be key to getting your stuff done. When you aren't stopped by customers you tend to get your job done fairly quick. This job will give you good experience for many different job fields due to the encompassing nature of it. Customer Service, paper work, organization, team work, individual work, equipment training, etc."
good,It was a fine Job. Hours could have been better. Additional Days never paid off. Was asked to come in multiple weekends to do massive jobs and received not really any acknowledgement.
good,Home depot gave me a lot of opportunity to learn many different positions I loved the work atmosphere and the supervisor were very on the training of employees.
good,Talked about life changes and how different each job could be moving around in The Home Depot vs other companies. Then mentioned working over night possibilities and how it benefits customers.
good,"At The Home Depot there is a lot to do, the hardest part is feeling like youre moving too slow. Management is okay, they pick and choose who they like and want to promote. I love that The Home Depot has a sense of urgency for customers. A diverse community and respect for all people. The Team Depot events are awesome where associates go and help children, schools, homeless, and help improve better environments around us. The Home Depot is very family oriented and when we have our monthly meetings we get fed. As a safety team member we strive to work safe and encourages others to do so also once we reach milestones we get rewarded. The Home Depot helps out other associates, even if youre not in the same building, by The Homer Fund which was created to help other associates that are in a crisis."
good,"Starting the morning shift ready for the day, cleaning, mainting stock at all times, always being interactive with your costumers. Promote sales and good work ethic."
good,A fun place to work and a great place to help customers with their projects and needs.  Good benefits and room for advancement.  With retail scheduling can always be tricky but Home Depot does a great job scheduling 3 weeks out which leaves you ample time to schedule your personal events.
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work but I need to get a better job to call a career to support my growing family. It has been a great experience but I feel I need to move on.
good,Different associates from all over make working enjoyable. We are all able to come together and get the job done. Treats and rewards are given as well.
good,this company will fire people whose been there for 15 + years seemingly over nothing and theres a very high turn over ratio management included. they will over work you as well .
good,It’s a great company to work for. Most of the time the employees are very friendly. Management is good depending on the store. They have great benefits.
good,"Fast paced, helped me work on my customer service skills. Overall good upper management. Learned more about home improvement items and construction. Sometimes stressful when you have a limited amount of time to get orders ready."
good,"Customers at this store want you to know everything. From how to install their entire new plumbing system to knowing the name of that little metal thing that fell off their lawnmower. The has to be one of the biggest issues with working here, they expect every minimum wage employee to be an expert which is ridiculous. Anyway off to the real review. I began working here as a lot associate, which is the bottom of the food chain at The Home Depot. Your job is just pushing shopping carts all day so its a pretty easy job. I was then moved inside to paint, which was a lot better than having to be outside in the rain and heat. However the amount of knowledge I had to obtain for this position was ridiculous since it came with no form of pay increase. We are payed almost a dollar less than the appliance associates who literally do nothing but wait for someone to want to buy an oven. Paint is considered a specialty department however it is not payed like one."
good,I can recommend for single parents and students. I have nothing else to report. Great work/life balance. Great compensation and benefits. Good job culture.
good,"Supervisors at The Home Depot are inflated with ego and power, in my experience all the supervisors are quick to assign their own work rather than do it"
good,"excellent place to work, benefits are great, management is awesome, the only problem is dealing with associates who will manipulate the system within Home Depot to push back and slow down the completion of projects, the sad part that HD will listen more to associates than supervisors."
good,"The job required to work outside, the managers were nice and understanding. Water was handed on hot days. Overall an enjoyable work experience, really recomend it."
good,Working on the MET Team is great...great hours and benefits. The pay could be better but advancement available and encouraged. On the MET team you work at your own pace and little supervision.
good,"Working at the home depot was an insightful experience. I had a great crew and we all worked together to get our daily routines done as quickly as possible. Management was fair and worked with your schedule. I learned to use my time effectively and work smarter efficiently. Although the workload at times were heavy, I was never discouraged by the amount of shipment we'd receive  on a nightly basis. I was always determined to have all my work done by the time my shift was over."
good,I liked working this job for the year that I did. But i found my self wanting a little bit more form a Job. It was fun and fasted paced. With a good management team. But at times it felt a little hectic.
good,"When I first started working there it was fun then people that was already working there spread rumors about me about something that was so childish i couldn't believe older women made it up.  not only that some men that work there are very old and try to ""hit"" on you even after you reject them.  but its not all bad the pay is great they feed you often and if you stay to yourself then you wont have any problems."
good,"All in all seems pretty good place to work and just need more salary to live in the expensive Twin Cities.  Also, would probably be better if there was more formal training done on the floor rather than online."
good,Most co-workers you could get along management was good also. Usually operated around your schedule and could mostly get needed time off. More benefits with full-time than part-time.
good,Productive and able to learn tools and additional household improvements. Hours were crazy no set times which became stressful in the end. Needed set hours and more working hours
good,"You get paid vacation and sick time, they are extremely flexible with scheduling. TONS of benefits to choose from. Plus discounts on travel, hotels, vehicles, etc."
good,"It’s a good company to work , you just got to do your task given to you and you gonna be okay, the pay is average and management is pretty organized, that’s pretty much it"
good,The most rewarding part of my job as Head Cashier is to greet the other cashiers everyday and to thank them for their hard work.  Also talking to all of the customers!
good,"The program was just beginning and the expectations were high.  At times the job duties were vague and ambiguous, but we did our best to keep the sales people busy.  My management was offsite and never came to oversee, but monthly meetings allowed us to have input.  Cold sales approaches were difficult as many of the customers were in a hurry and not interested at all in our products.  I was able to interact freely with them, though and for the most part turned it into an enjoyable experience."
good,working for the Home Depot isn’t a easy task but overall is a great job. The worker are very nice and generous which makes things more worth it. It’s a good started job.
good,Good place to work from 4:00 to 2:30 was my shift hard to have a life but great pay and people are cool so is the working not to hard but I go to school
good,It was a great job we was like one big family great co workers great mangers..love the customer very nice and sweet.great company to work for you can make this job a career
good,If you don’t mind working weekends this is a great place to work!  The management team always feeds us and there is never a dull moment. Home Depot is always striving to make life better for their customers and associates.
good,"Home Depot is extremely fast paced and every day is different. The culture is incredible, these people truly are your family. I have been with the company for 13 years and have learned so much about home improvement, as well as leadership."
good,"Do not work here if you do not like helping with customers and having to work with your coworkers. "
good,Working at home depot was the best. They are very understanding about scheduling and personal life. These people not only are co workers but become an extended family.
good,Home Depot is great the pay is reasonable but the growing opportunities are not really there for most butThe environment is very good when it comes to the people but the work doesn’t seem to be separated properly
good,"No retail job is good for family life. Working most weekends and holidays is not ideal. Hourly rates at Home Depot are behind the average and they have trouble hiring people because of it. The people you work with make up for the lack in pay. I worked with a wonderful group of people including management. Training, advancement opportunities, and employee appreciation are good."
good,I loved working here. You don’t get discounts but you do get sick days and after 6 months they have what’s called a success sharing which is a check for each employee. After a year you get an observation and see how much your pay could go up and there is a lot of advancement opportunities.
good,"Learned how to work equipment such as the stand up fork lift, balleymore and tow motor. Successfully guide customers in the right direction for find a specific product. Also learned how to successfully work four different departments and how to use the first phone."
good,"hard worker just need an opportunity willing learn new thing whatever to get the job done efficient"
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customer needs, product availability, and store cleanliness. I learned about different products in different departments. Management is helpful when we need assistance and is fair. Workplace culture is upbeat. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diverse group of people."
good,"Amazing benefits and opportunities, ability to transfer positions/stores/warehouses fairly easily, they really want what's best for you and thats rare"
good,"Working at home depot was hard at times but, what made it worth it was getting to help good people. Management definitely needs some work though, I feel like some managers just weren't willing to fully deal with some of the other lot associates and so I had to pick up there slack, whenever they weren't actually doing there job."
good,Productive and fun. Free lunch at end of the month.Day to day always somthing new to do. I would come to work do my job have fun doning it and go home.
good,The work atmosphere is a really friendly place to work. They provide food during holidays and snacks in a cabinet. You have to work hard for over 20 hours.
good,"-Ok place to work"
good,"Hard work but good money good opportunities to advance within the company . You can definitely make a career within the company . "
good,"In my 2 and a half years there, I have worked with many people and have made a good bit of friends. My coworkers have been great and the work that I'm doing, isn't overly difficult and keeps me busy."
good,It was exciting to work for a company that have your back and want you to succeed in life and they benefit are great there so take advantage of there 401k and stock program
good,"First and only job. Felt apart of the family. Learned and grew a lot from the customers, to the store, to becoming a great cashier. Would love to work for or another company like The Home Depot."
good,They have great people there. i learned how to better help people and how to be hardworking. the hardest part of the job was try to get to ever customers only when when we did not have enough associates.
good,"Me gustó mucho trabajar ahí, el ambiente es muy bueno y cuidan mucho al empleado, además que el horario laboral es excelente, yo recomiendo ese lugar!!"
good,"I personally gained an abundant amount of knowledge, when I was employed they had courses for specific areas of the store.  For instance, before I became a Garden Customer Service Rep, I had a taken a Garden course that gave me insight to the array of plants, flowers, lawn care, etc. Another highlight of working for the company is they gave out merit badges when performing great customer service. Those badges when accumulated, could turn into some great extra money. Some days were very hectic with a sea of customers yet, that is part of retail life.  HD equipped me with many skills that I still possess to this day. It was one of the best jobs I had in my work experience."
good,"I am able to have my hours working at HD cater around my personal life, which is a huge advantage.  The environment is very friendly, and a manager is always available to talk to about anything.  Problems are resolves in a quick and timely manner."
good,Working at Home Depot I've learned an absurd amount of knowledge in a short period of time. If Semi Social co workers become like family and the opportunities are pretty vast if you can network with people. If motivated and driven you can advance quickly the only thing that sucks is work load... if you don't have the correct management in place they will let you burn out doing the work of 3-4 people. But with the right Management alot the wait is long they fill the open spots with the right people which is awesome.
good,"It's better experience/pay for me as a second job, I wish it was my first job. Can be stressful if you let it, but it's fine if you have a cool head. Customer service is hard because you handle a lot, part time or full, but it gets easier the faster you understand what your supposed to be doing. I recommend a different area than customer service."
good,"Amazing employees, you feel as if you're family there. A typical day is a empty store, every item you need to pack out with music and you do what you have to do at your pace."
good,"I really enjoy working at home depot, given the right opportunity anyone can advance with the company. Moving and learning other areas is highly encouraged"
good,Fast pace retail environment. Intense customer work load.Productive workplace with lots of employee interaction.Very good position to lear about home improvement.
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot. The company is great and my co workers were amazing. However due to repetitive issues with work schedule and life balance I had to leave. I recommend this job for people who enjoy fast paced environments, and are very fast learners because of the amount of products you have to sell. Overall great job besides managements issues."
good,"Good company to work for , lots of different things to do. Dont pay that great but treat employees pretty good for retail job. "
good,good job for a college student..part time was offered  but never had the chance to move to full time..other than that it was a great job with good people
good,"Très axé sur la formation et le développement des employés"
good,"Must be willing to listen and learn, if you can do that you will more than likely be successful at the home Depot. They do a good job of teaching you the needed information"
good,"Can be very stressful at times, but you are compensated fairly. They do provide you with the skills you need to do your job correctly. Overall, not a bad environment to work in."
good,Started me at 12$ an hour and was easy to learn my job. great people to be around. Departments are well kept and managment is very hands on. Great place to get to learn heavy equipment as well.
good,Good coworkers but is also a stressful environment due to management. Things are fast paced and you have a varied amount of goals to meet. Great w/ working w/ your sched as long as you let them know in at advance.
good,"Best job to have while going to school full time. Schedules are very accommodating and flexible. Management is very understanding and fair, Fun and friendly staff."
good,"Working the holiday season at Home Depot was a great experience. Very high-paced, busy environment at times. Meeting customers and helping them find the right product was fun."
good,"Home depot was a swell job, I was a garden associate basically took care of plants and I've information on them. Great work space my manager was pretty understanding to an extant. Great work space offered discounts on products for employee. Great coworkers group team really meant a lot because we all kind of relay on each other."
good,I enjoyed my time at the Depot. Overall the work and environment is great. They will train you. It is great for first time employees. The only downfall is the pay.
good,I enjoyed working there. There is always something to learn for DIYs with tools and projects. The Co-workers were nice. The hours and pay were decent. There's room for advancement.
good,"In lumber you would restock the shelves, measure out lumber for customers if they request it. Sometimes customers will request cutting lumber to certain feet or inches, and we would use a table saw to cut it for them. It was a pretty lax environment on the floor. Help the customers to find what they need even if its not in our own department. The hardest part about the job was either cutting a cart full of lumber for a customer or loading it onto a truck/moving van for a customer."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for, management that comes and goes make it a stressful place to work. I love the work I do and enjoy giving great customer service."
good,"Install sales not a store program per say. A sales consultant had to sell the store associates on the program and encourage associates to set jup appointments. The store culture evolved over the years. Initially it was a fight to get associate buy in. Currently, associates are more involved in generating business as compared to 15 years ago. The program now only offers windows."
good,You have to be aggressive about your own development. Expect to be taught well. Master everything around you. Fall in love with what you do. Know that you can limit or expand your career.
good,"I was with Home Depot for 21 yrs until my separation.  The associates that I worked with were awesome.  Should be called ""family,"" not co-workers.  The job was retail at it's best.  No pressure sales, but the opportunity to assist customers with their shopping needs and wants.  Throughout my tenure, the majority of management was supportive and helpful.  Overall, it was a great experience."
good,"the hardest part was other people not showing up for their shift. "
good,"Teaching customers about relevant products and installation instructions, selling the product or services offered by the Home Depot. Patrol the store to help customers and keep the store safe and stocked."
good,"A mature environment nurtures true growth and appreciation for the work that goes into our contractors and do-it-yourself people. While working your given department, learning about what the others do it highly motivating and provides constant, modern knowledge."
good,I love working here however I can't afford all the things I need to live but they keep refusing me full time to avoid paying for the benefits that they advertise about.
good,"When I started I had many trainers, and it was easy going. Selling appliances isn't difficult, but the differences between them is important.  Scheduled alone at bizzy times is stressful, but managers are helpful. Sales of product can be difficult.Nevertheless, this company has a growing interest in helping associates do there jobs. If you want to grow in the company, it's there. Good luck."
good,Good company to work for great atmosphere good hours great management and great paid vacation time very good benefits and work schedule ——//////////////
good,A typical night would include the store receiving one or two trucks of freight a night. Generally all the freight gets done depending on the size of each trucks.
good,"As sales associate, you typically would stock products and clean up aisles, but the main focus was on providing good customer service. The culture itself was very supportive and I made some great friendships working there. Managers were good at giving associates independence and helping them feel empowered, they would never micromanage. Some other parts of the job would be creating long order forms for installations and deliveries."
good,"The time I was there my front end manager was so inspire, because she motive us every day and she had a very good mood every day. She was a  model like to be."
good,"Home depot is a great company to work for with the VOA in place to for associates to voice there opinion of the company and always trying to improve to make the work environment the best to work in."
good,"It's a good place to work.. Some people do develop a work family environment and Home Depot does help out people who are struggling medically or with family hardship. The Home Depot does provide a lot of benefits for the employees."
good,"So many nice team members! Safety is very importany!  Good place to work.  Lots of oppertunity for advanvement.  Good people to work with and for.  Fun displays and floor plan changes daily.  "
good,"I've worked at the busiest Home Depot in Sacramento, so we were always busy (as expected). When I was hired, I was first a lot associate, then I moved into building and lumber. The supervisor left for another career and took some time for him to get replaced. We worked without a supervisor and was completely fine. We knew our jobs and what had to be done. The new supervisor was weird, and he didn't shake my hand on the first day even though he shook everyone else. They promised me 40+ hours and then started to see a decrease in my hours and moved me into as Pro Loader, which limited my advancement in Home Depot. After never taking time off and only called in sick a few times, I requested three days off to visit my family. They only ""granted"" one day off and that day was when the store was closed."
good,It was a really good job for me fresh out of high school and starting college. Very flexible with school and a typical day was just assisting customers and stocking your department. It was very enjoyable fast pace and it honestly taught me a lot.
good,Es difícil crecer dentro de la empresa  ya que necesitas llevarte bien con los gerentes para aspirar a un ascenso o incremento salarial
good,"Cashier easy simple, management was okay, it was like high school employees had poses and weren't friendly. Job made me miserable I asked to switch departs and I was willing to learn but not taking seriously."
good,"Good place to work, the management and staff are wonderful"
good,Working at Home Depot was a great place to work.  I like what I did and  I learned a lot about paint.  It was fun  environment with co-workers and with customers.
good,The job had me on the move and was exciting. Team work could have used some improvement. Management was completely unplugged. Coverage for any giving schedule was slim.
good,"I like working part time at the Home Depot,  I will say the customers are the most stressful part, But management and team lead are the best.  I work with a good bunch of employees at the service desk."
good,"Plenty of training available, co-workers were helpful. Flexibility is required for you must be wiling to cross-train. Physical, face-paced job in a noisy environment."
good,"It is fun place to work, because you meet a lot of new people& fun people you work with. I would recommend a friends to work for the home depot because I have really enjoyed my time here."
good,"Excellent place to work. Great work atmosphere, especially the teamwork approach to tasks where all echelons pitch in, beginning by the store manager. Easy to learn an array of new skills since everyone is eager to teach and coach. An all out  veterans support organization."
good,"working at the Home Depot allowed me to witness how helpful everyone is there. the management is a prime example of what hard work does, it promotes. Home Depot promotes within and i love that"
good,a typical day at work could at times be overwhelming but also went by fast. I learned a lot about the people in my area and skills I'll find useful for a life time. They're was tendency for work place drama that management ignored and I've grown tired of it. However for the most part my fellow associates were pleasant and down to earth. I have made life long friends and memories working here I will always hold dear.
good,Good work environment with the chance to advance in your career there. Everyone there is friendly and offer help when needed. They give you a good amount of training to do your job properly and offer power equipment training.
good,"Customer service, answering questions, solving problems,working with team members completing weekly reports. Creating weekly game plans to all team members."
good,"A typical day at work for me was, cleaning the aisles and making sure everything is where it was supposed to be for the morning. I learned that people tend to be fast paced and want their issues addressed almost immediately. I never really spent a lot of time with management because I tended to work overnights. The hardest part of the job was when a customer needed something that I had no idea about, but I knew I had to help them out. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing satisfaction on customers faces when I answered or provided them with what they needed."
good,"Great salary/benefits, great store/team spirit and great coworkers. Advancement mostly given on how well you look in front of supervisors/managers instead of seniority/hard work. Overall, not bad for a part time job, even a full time job if you are comfortable with the position offered."
good,"The store is one of the busiest in British Columbia.  The staff are mostly friendly, the managers are mostly communicative and friendly.  The workforce is quite busy, promotion, is you are a full time employee, is possible if you show the interest and fit into the image the company looks for.  "
good,This is a good company that works with your schedule and provides a good foundation of care for their employees and customers. The benefits provided for their employees would allow me to safely recommend this company to a responsible student with a busy life.
good,I really enjoyed working in the Tool Rental dept.  As I was in charge of the maintenance of all tools and equipment.  I had to learn how to repair and operate everything we rented to the public.
good,"Fun environment to work in."
good,"I was a store merchandizer with HD so the pay wasn't great, but for a retail job getting weekends off, and the option to work or not on holidays as customer service was another plus."
good,I enjoyed working at The Home Depot and the associates there were very friendly & kind. Management was fantastic & I learned new things everyday. It was an great experience
good,"The Home Depot is pretty fast paced, especially at the busier stores. Make sure you have good walking shoes because the floor is made of the devil's spine. The work culture is decent. The only thing lacking was the compensation, which left much to be desired."
good,"Good place to work if you like working with customers one on one."
good,i used ti work in customer service and basic was about fixing online orders answer phone etc. many different cultures work theres and you learn even day something new
good,"Do I recommend working for THD? Sure."
good,Opportunity is there for those who want it Great place to work with work life balance for associates but not Supervisors. Home Depot needs to focus on work balance for every employee.
good,Strong company customer oriented. Employees were great to work with with a few exceptions. Enjoyed working with customers. Most people are easy going but sometimes act entitled.
good,The job was fine for work as a student. I worked harder than most of the cashiers and got a bonus after being there only six months so management will take notice. Not a permanent job.
good,"My hours are only 4 hours a day so I have a lot of free time thankfully. I would recommend this place if you're just starting to work, or if you're looking for a job with a lot of good benefits."
good,"The Home Depot offers a challenging work experience where you are both doing physical and mental labor. Minimum lifting is consistently 50 lb or less and can be more. Because this is a starter job, employee turnover is very high and consistency with work and scheduling is low. Management works hard to negate this, but often times employee attendance puts a burden on faithful employees."
good,I was the customer service manager. Managed the cashiers and lot loaders. I was a part of management where I ran the whole store opened and closed the store. The hardest thing there were people who called in all of the time. I loved the customer service and waiting on people. I was over hardware department manager as well.
good,It was sometimes extremely stressful and overwhelming. They wanted employees do to more than expected at times. Also wanted more than reasonable work for one employee to help every customer.
good,"I've honestly enjoyed my time at Home Depot, it has helped to develop better social skills because there are so many nice people that work there. This was a great opportunity to see how the retail industry works."
good,"Great benefits, easy to move up within the company if you are willing to put in hard work. Company has changed alot since I moved in and it is the spirit of team is not a focus anymore but never the less still a great company. "
good,"Home Depot is all about providing great customer service. It's all about living by the Orange Apron. Work is a lot of fast paced work and heavy lifting. The company also provides a good work environment for their employees such as buying lunch often, the homer fund, and benefits."
good,working at home home depot is not too hard but  management make it not easy to like your job they have their favorites and make it impossible for you to make it as manager the hardest job in here id unloading trailers.
good,Something about Home Depot had me invested in not only my store but the company itself. It was very exciting to be a part of the team and I looked forward to each day I worked.
good,Cool place to work if you just got out of school and need money in your pocket. Great benefits. Good pay (for some). Great management throughout stores
good,"Management was good, and its a very team work type of store, a great place to work. Lots of hands on training and options to switch between each of the departments. The hardest part of the job is when there is short staffed on busy days,"
good,"Working at the Home Depot, regardless of department, is going to be fun, fast paced, and yet can be stressful.  However, you have a team of people to work with who are willing to help.  Everything we do there has practical implications for home improvement, and people take pride in showing products and what they are to be used for.  The hardest part, right now, is the shortage of personel for our store.  This creates a very stressful situation sometimes in customer volumn."
good,"Nice People and Staff."
good,Good place to work on the side. Management is very good at solving employee issues within reason. Good company culture and coworkers are friendly. My only issue with the company is the pay structure. You are only able to get a raise once a year and it is around 3% of your salary.
good,Fairly easy. Opportunities to move up. Most of the people you work with will be nice. Customers are really good.  Have helpful apps and tools.  Entry level is $11 an hour.
good,"Home depot, if i was able to transfer when i moved i would have still been working for them. i really enjoyed being able to help people get what they needed  and wanted on a daily basis. i wish that i was offered commission. worked in Mill works and blinds, my job was focused around placing special orders for customers and meeting sales targets, but unless they have changed no commission was offered when you hit your sales goals."
good,"At home depot, you work hand in hand with Contractors and D-I-Y Customers to make sure they can achieve their goals. You help with orders and measurements, teach customers about products and how to use them, And make sure the overall experience is a good one."
good,You'll be fine as long as you get along with the department head. He's funny hard working and fair. Store manager can be difficult to gauge but he's seldom seen should be fine as long as you're busy which isn't hard to do
good,I really enjoyed my time working at the Home Depot. Working outside and lifting mulch into peoples cars was more of my style than selling lawn mowers. That is the reason I decided to leave.
good,"Again, great place to work. I suggest you make sure you are able to lift at least 25 pounds. It always helps to make sure you do your stretches before and during your shift because we have to help a lot of customers"
good,"It can be rather busy at times, "
good,"Safety matters"
good,"Pretty easy warehouse work , good schedule , overtime not mandatory. Understanding management , undergoing construction more spacious now both inside and parking lot"
good,Again like every other company that i have worked for. The job is so specific that there are limited number of opening to advance. They had great benefits.
good,It's a good place to work. The management team is very nice and understanding. The people who work there are generally nice and kind people. I worked overnight and the people are kind and take care of each other.
good,The typical day at work was very repetitive. Learned how to operate machinery. Management at times was unlikable and enjoyed being around those I work with daily rather than being around a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is those I work with.
good,"They have decent benefits even for part-timers, a fairly professional environment and sufficient training, however getting hours can be difficult in the winter when business slows down."
good,"Very well place, fast past workplace and many different cultured workers. I learned to work quickly and have many different kind of customers. The hardest part of the job was the parking during the day."
good,Overall working at homedepot was a journey where i made a few friends but overall i learned to balance school and having a job so I think I learn quite a bit from working there and I learned to how spread your time out and what to work on.
good,"At Home Depot, there would be competitions between all the Home Depot stores in the district of who can sell more. Each place ranking win different types of prizes. Prizes such things like money, store improvements, and also cookouts."
good,"The Home Depot Inc. or Home Depot is an American home improvement supplies retailing company that sells tools, construction products, and services. The company is headquartered at the Atlanta Store Support Center in unincorporated Cobb County, Georgia"
good,"Good bonuses.  Option to be hands on training and cleaning, stocking, driving, etc.  Manager meetings were fun and insightful.  Hardest part of the job were holidays due to working long hours."
good,Very busy. Learned alot. Management was amazing but couldn't accommodate me with hours i needed due to seniority getting all the good hours. I loved this job and would go back in a heart beat
good,"Good company to work for. I learned a lot there. I got some fork lift experience. Management could hove been better. Garden department is a hard department, lots of heavy lifting and in the sun and heat in the summer time."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work. The store that I worked in had a very friendly and helpful staff. Anytime helps was needed there was someone available to assist.
good,DEcent job to have. Nice when its busy so that you are not bored. the managers are very nice and understanding. You will have to deal with customers that are not always the best
good,A typical day at the Home Depot as a overnight freight associate would consist of unloading the freight truck from the trailer to the carts and from the carts to the shelves on the sales floor. It is a quick pace job and you are always being timed.
good,You learn a lot about home improvement and knowledge for projects that may come up. there are good benefits including tuition re-reimbursement. there are also lots of opportunities in the company.
good,Meeting customers everyday and provide the best service to customer.  Have fun with coworker.  Hardest part was keep telling customer to do survey for my service each time when they leave.
good,"Great people, great culture. I feel that I am in control of my own success. I get to build a dream kitchen for a customer from nothing and see it become a reality. I work as part of a team to help people get the things they need, and I get to resolve problems they may be facing with other home projects along the way. I get to meet new people all the time."
good,"typical day come in check for any instructions left from department manager from the previous day, stock and help customers, absolutely loved working there."
good,The Home is an home away from home--as it relates to working environment. Respectable management and supervisors. Great interaction and relationship between management and staff
good,"As far as companies in this capitalist system go (feel free to interpret my political views as you may), Home Depot is one of the better ones. They have a pretty good benefits package the work is engaging without being overbearing most of the time. Most customers are fun to shoot the breeze with. As long as you are disciplined enough to handle a task that's presented to you in a timely manner, a little joking and fun is actually encouraged so long as it's appropriate. Camaraderie and a family-like atmosphere are what this company shoots for. I can definitely say I've had worse jobs."
good,"Sales people are friendly and management is approachable.  Enjoy the atmosphere and the work, but the pay could be better for what they expect of you."
good,A typical day at work revolved around me and my crew unloading several JB Hunt trailers of loosely and palletized freight and pushing them to the sales floor so that the shelves can be restocked.  At the other end of the building unloading lumber/sheetrock/concrete/blocks/pvc/Mulch and posing soil to name just a few.  Coming up with a plan to get rid(packing  away) the ever increasing volume of freight received at the store.  The capacity/volume of the store did not change however the volume of freight received was on a quarterly/yearly basis based on annual sales.
good,"Very Challenging and fast paced, I remember very few days were I wasn't sweating profusely.  But If you are not afraid of hard work or getting dirty, then this might be the place for you."
good,"Not going to get rich but it was a good job while I was in school.  I dont really know what else to say it was pretty straight forward, just a normal retail job"
good,"I worked the graveyeard shift, which had a fun group of people. Colleagues and management team were amazing. Hardest part was the time of day but the best part was the management team as they accommodated to my needs. I was in university and they worked around my school schedule to give the full 40 hours a week."
good,This was a very chill job and is perfect for anyone who is looking for something part time and flexible. This job is basically your typical warehouse environment mixed with retail.
good,"good as a part time job not the best for fulltime"
good,Fast paced and competitive company that is the best and largest at what is does.  Room to grow and advance in position.  Excellent benefits and compensation.
good,your day can start at anytime from the time the doors open at 6am with at least an 8hr shift for hourly to a 10hr shift for salaried mgrs. management teams are very close and communicate very well with each other. hardest part of the job is finding time to complete everything they ask you to do. the enjoyable part was the interaction with customer's making them feel good about themselves with partnering with the company to make their dreams a reality.
good,"I enjoy success sharing and how everyone can move around in the company to help our consumers and each other."
good,"If you can work early mornings, MET team is fantastic!  I can't say enough god things about our supervisor and the schedule is great.  No nights or weekends!"
good,"In my role as a MET, my supervisor was always very helpful and would help out on projects, learned the skills necessary to become a MET supervisor. Workplace cultuer was looking out for each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing a project and having the bay/aisle store opening ready. Hardest part of the job wsa the heavy lifting required at times"
good,"I worked at one store that was amazing. Fun work atmosphere, GREAT co-workers and more then enough work to stay busy. I loved it there. I had to moved and transferred to the store I am at now is not  even close to what I had known. This store is so very stressful, poorly run, understaffed, and micromanaged by cooperate. It really opened my eyes to how different each store can be."
good,Its good for a first job into the world of retail. It allows you to get the feel of what is expected and it helps you with dealing with people since people are the hardest to handle at any position.
good,Home Depot works well with families who have young children. The management team could stand to be on the same page when it comes to rules and regulations.
good,"Hard work, but fun interaction with customers who need help on finding the right product. Lots of fun with co-workers, however, just as much time spent alone as you restock almost constantly"
good,"A typical day at work would include constant customer service and help around the store, if I wasn't doing that I would be restocking shelves or cleaning up around my department. I learned how to drive and use machine equipment such as the forklift. The culture of the workplace was always in a good way. The hardest part of the job would be trying to locate a specific important item if it could not be found, especially if it was curtail to find it to advance to the next task. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my fellow employees as well as the customers."
good,Home depot was the best job I had and the best part was the people you work with and the recognition you get. The only bad thing is the pay since some associates are trained for lift equipment and the y don't get paid more for operating heavy machinery.
good,"Fast paced, customer service oriented, can be stressful during peak seasons. Have to be flexible in work hours since you are in retail. Store Manager team is very ridged and sometimes unapproachable"
good,It was a fun job and I really enjoyed the artistic value of it. I was working with my brothers and that didn’t work out too well. Then I moved out of state.
good,"The physical labor is no laughing matter. While it does provide excellent exercise at some points, it does take a definite toll on the body. The employees can be a mixed bag as far as attitudes, some good folk, some bad eggs. The hours were constant, yet might interfere with any evening plans during a said week."
good,"ok place to work.  plenty of oppurtuinity to move up in the company if willing to move to another city,  relaxed atmosphere with clear objectives to meet."
good,Wish I never left this company it was a case of grass looked greener however it wasn't. Terrific community involvement especially with veterans. Takes care of their associates as well.
good,"There are a lot of pros and cons working in a retail environement. If you enjoy working with a lot of people, then this job is perfect for you and it is suitable for you. It is hard to maintain school and a job therefore a retail job like this can be good since it has flexible hours. You get to work with different customers every day and since person is different, you will experience different situations and learn how to handle each situation/ conflict with a different approach."
good,"I pulled items that I delivered to our customers work sites and then delivered them.  I learned my way around the area.  I learned how to secure items on trucks."
good,"I worked at home depot for a year, in that time I received several pay raises and multiple promotions. I loved my boss and everyone i worked with. Was a great place to work."
good,"The home depot is a great place to work. The atmosphere and the company values are positive and encouraging. The work expectations and requirements for a typical day are manageable and not overwhelming, managers are helpful and encouraging."
good,"Good people, good job. That's all I have to say. This square will not be satisfied with less than 150 characters. So  I have to write this gibberish to satisfy the requirement"
good,"Fast paced and days go by quickly.  Great team environment and fun helping customers.  Opportunity to advance e and learn.  If you love working with people, its a great place to work."
good,The pay is not bad for the area.  Management is pretty good.  The workplace culture and co-workers are great and easy to get along with.  Not the best pay but pretty good benefits.  Fast paced and you will get what you put into it.
good,Working at the Home Depot as a designer was fun but challenging. With this title you will face many priorities and responsibilities. Management usually wants things done whenever they want even if you have a task you are working on. Depending on who are the managers will determine you experience working at the home depot.
good,"home depot celebrates culture and religious days of  all the nationalities around the world."
good,"every store has a different culture but at my store, everyone is typically friendly and helpful and the work is easy. thats not to say you dont have to work, its just its easy compared to other jobs out their and it doesnt take a lot of work or a lot of thinking."
good,"Good place to work. Learned valuable skills and knowledge about the products, co-workers were nice, hours were suitable. Overall a good experience and time."
good,Good place for people ages 18 through early 20's who are still looking for a Full-time job. I go to Pittsburgh Technical College and The Home Depot works out perfect for me.
good,I worked at a home Depot in ranson wv for 3 years the staff was great the managers were good pay seemed to be pretty fair I didn't starve but I didn't get rich both me and my wife would there they were very flexible with her schedule mine was pretty steady especially when I went to night shift having worked at Lowe's and the home Depot I would definitely recommend the home Depot over Lowe's the environment and work life balance we're better and the managers were head and shoulders better than Lowe's
good,What an amazing culture The Home Depot has! I've never worked for a company who truly lives by their mission statement and values. They live by the Value Wheel and Inverted Pyramid.
good,Just a normal day unloading the truck and restocking the store after closing hours. Receive two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch break as any other store does
good,Fun relaxed steady paced place of work. Worked a good amount of hours but would have loved overtime hours and a steady amount of hours per week. Everything else was great besides the hours.
good,"Fun and encouraging atmosphere most of the time.  If motivated, you can learn many departments and advance your career. I learned a lot working there.  "
good,"Greeting customer coming into and leaving the store. "
good,Home Depot is a retail business and requires staffing to meet said business. With the exception of my last DM all other management was excellent. I was typically happy at my job.
good,"I have been working as a cashier at The Home Depot for a bit over 10 months. The environment is relatively stress-free as you have a large portion of down time. However, the store that I worked at was in a bit more of a secluded part of town, so it was not nearly as busy as some Home Depots. One extreme down side to having so much spare time in this job is that you are hardly allowed to move from the register you are placed on, therefore allowing you nothing but boredom in your free moments. You may clean your surrounding area, but that is all you are permitted to do. You can talk to those on registers next to you but you must remain at the front where you are visible to customers seeking to check out. "
good,"I was hired as a cashier, but never trained. I was given a new associate checklist that is impossible to fill out, unless you do it off the clock on your own. You will get fired if not completed in 30 days from hire date. I was told when hired that I was permanent part-time then later told it was seasonal. I was told when training on the cash register that I did not have what was needed to be empowered at home depot. I asked what was that. The trainer told me a b.... I said what's that, I was told I did not have a brain. The people are so rude."
good,Work is mostly heavy labor and customers are looking for expert help despite our lack of training. Workers are often overworked and underpaid for their work.
good,"Friendly environment, safe environment as well, it gets pretty busy, but it’s great cause it’s a workout and you get to solve problems as well. Make new friends as well."
good,Working at Home Depot was enjoyable especially because of the co-workers. They were always willing to answer any questions I had with pleasure. I would work here again.
good,"Management cares about themselves, not about the advancement of their employees. Great culture, very diverse company with a lot of nice people. Plenty of ping pong and office activities."
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff and the customers that came in"
good,"Working as a Merchandise Execution Team, is a nice job, but the pay is extremely low for the amount of work and knowledge. It seems that every week you have a new task add to your duties with the same extremely low pay of $ 10 per hour, it seems more like if you are used, as a MET member you learn everything regarding merchandiser, including learning electrical conections, how to fix almost everything, build displays , projects which were not very easy to do them, planograms, and getting the stress of having a random check at the end of the shift, for $10 dollars an hour.Most of the employees work  in MET only until they find something with better pay,Even the people that brings the flowers to the garden dept, they get paid $ 13.50 to start and they don't have to do as much work as a MET member."
good,"I have been with homedepot for 12 , they have been nothing but good to me. The hardest part was relocating back here to Brunswick.  I miss the customers in Atlanta and Employee all are great."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers to quote and build their interior/exterior door, window, storm door and interior projects. Management was a bit confused meaning getting contradictory instructions from various supervisors, But on the whole, a fairly good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed the other employees. They were friendly and cooperative."
good,"Excellent company to work for...take care of their people, great values, but retail work is hard, and must be able to multi-task, be able to stand on feet, and not mind interruptions, as customers will stop anyone with an orange apron on to ask questions and directions on lumber, plumbing, hardware, gardening, where to find boxes, etc."
good,"Loved my job; a people, customer service kind of person; love numbers, tools, and I like to learn new things.  It was a fast paced job and loved it it"
good,"fun place to work. i learned a lot about garden and cleaning products, colleagues are friendly and respectful. "
good,"Great environment. To work at "
good,"Checked stock to make sure that inventory was up. I have an extensive background in maintenance, renovations, and building addition construction. There was computer skill training. Management was in a difficult position as far as having to make cut backs on payroll. When I arrived, I was able to negotiate a healthy hourly wage."
good,"I worked a lot of overtime. A typical day of work was fast paced stressing accuracy and quality. Although it was very competitive, it was a family like atmosphere. Your fellow associates and management care about your well being. Everything was available to learn all you need to do is let your manager know."
good,Eventhough the pay was low and did not work full-time it was always a good time working there.  Customers were a lot of fun to work with and cashier leads were always fair and made it fun!
good,Worked with a great team of people the thought me how to do my job.The managers was for understanding and hopeful as long as I was willing to learn they was willing to teach me. I enjoyed working there
good,"Spent most of the 14 years there as a designer, sold appliances, worked the aisles, helped out in many departments , knew what had to be done and got it done,"
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work with great advancement opportunities and benefits to go along with some amazing people you could potentially work with(Depending on staff and location). Everything about Home Depot is great except for 2 areas; having to work almost all holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas(but that is expected in retail), and always different schedules to accommodate Associates if your position is in management."
good,"A great place for those who like to take the initiative. Company promotes from within, plenty of room to grow and gain experience in all aspects of the retail business"
good,"Great company to work for. I always encourage the younger generation while in college to work their.  Great opportunities."
good,Once clocking I check in with my supervisor. If a merchandise truck has arrived then we immediately begin unloading and separating freight by departments. Once truck is fully unloaded we begin to stock shelves with freight. If there is no truck we begin department pack downs from overstock shelves. Teamwork and communication  is a necessary part of the job.
good,"When i worked here it was a great place to work the manager who hired me was understanding. he once bought me a tire when i had a flat on my way to work. "
good,"I worked only 3 days a week as a freight associate stocking shelves overnight and making sure  the store was clean before it open. Obtained several forklift license. I would recommend to anyone to work there, especially if you have a second job for the lack of pay and cost of living differs."
good,Overall I enjoyed working with the company.  It was a rewarding job but definitely had it challenges.  Unfortunately management just kind of throws you into roles and expects you to learn on your own.   I would recommend working here as a part time job for college students.
good,"Good management culture where they make everyone very comfortable. They have the quite the serious HR department which will not tolerate disruptions to the workplace comfort of all associates. "
good,"Home Depot was a fast paced work place with new challenges daily."
good,"A typical day would be the best of the basics, Helping the customers. Everything that the company did was customer first. The culture was competitive - however in a healthy way. The hardest part of the job was to balance customer service and administrative duties. It was doable, just difficult to balance. the best part of the job was helping the customers."
good,Productive and innovative.  It's a fun and exciting place of employment especially for students.  Its benefits are exceptional. It's a customer service based organization which thrives on customer satisfaction.
good,Its a great place to start but its no overtime they are very strict on that and i need more money for my living expenses. They dont like to give raises either i worked there over a year and still not much of a raise
good,I worked there for 4 years and they were a fun place to work. The pay isnt amazing but was enough to get by on. Some of the specialists there however have managed to make a carrier out of it. If you have any contractor experience or other construction skills it is a good option.
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work especially if you wanted to learn about home improvement. While working there I was able to work in several departments and take several classes on installing, building, using different tools, how to paint, and even electrical wiring. Also with as many stores as they have I was able to transfer to different cities and even different states. I worked jobs from answering phones to placing orders to being a department manager on my way to being an assistant manager. "
good,Home Depot is a very good place for employment. There is opportunity for advancement from within. They are fair with employees and spend a lot for training.
good,"The call center is very relaxed and offers a lot of recreational things for the employees to wind down on breaks and lunches. The call center has a pool table, ping pong, foos ball, video games, an arcade game, and a variety of activities throughout the year for the employees."
good,"Greet customers and get them what they need, and send them on their way. The most enjoyable parts are when we have little gatherings and meet new people."
good,n/a no review to be given at this time  on the company overall as of 1/1/19 relating to the home depot. further information and reivew to be given at a later time
good,Enjoy a good atmosphere and be able to be on your feet most of the shift. Don't be afraid to ask for help when need because everyone is willing to help each other.
good,"I liked Home Depot because they let me do an evening shift three days a week and during my time there, I always showed up to do my shift. I think that was helpful in that after awhile they seem to trust that i would be there so i gained respect. I became friends with everyone there and i missed them when i left."
good,"I worked for the met team.  It was rewarding and fun.The store side could be more of a team player, they seamed not to like what we did.  Some store managers did praise our work, and it showed in there displays."
good,Great place to work. full over energy and things are constantly growing and changing. Supervisors are always willing to help in anyway they see fit. Great benefits are available.
good,"Can be a fun place to work depending on management, flexible hours and holiday pay for all major holidays, only closed christmas day and thanksgiving day."
good,"Learned professional office admin skills under very cooperative and friendly work environment. Performed daily HR, payroll and GM, AGM assistance. company has diversity and inclusive work culture."
good,We mostly do proyects to introduce new items to the stores and to better the look of the store. It’s hectic but I’m never bored with the same thing. Supervisor challenges and praises he also rewards whom deserves.
good,The Home Depot is a place that helps develop our social and communication skills. The overall job their is very nice and helping people in any way is always a good feeling.
good,I would come in and stay busy. Sometimes i would be needed in different parts of the store. I dont feel the pay or the raise percentage was good enough.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work, for the night shift personnel the pay needs to be increased to compensate for the hard work being done. I've learn that team work is very necessary in each department to get your task complete before you shift ends. Management understands most of the issues and attempts to correct whatever they can. Workplace has a different set of standard between Daytime and nighttime personnel. The hardest part of the job is attempting to complete all of your stocking before the shift ends. The most enjoyable part of the job is great co-workers with strong personalities.."
good,"Good company to work for, and excellent benefits."
good,"A typical day at work is easy, or at least for me it easy it physical and a wide range of questions from customers. I learned a lot from painting to gardening to just a example. The management for the most part is very helpful in training and assisting associates with problems. The workplace culture at the Home Depot is family and friends like its a very warm place. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed at busy times. The best part of working at the is being to help out customers, yeah that do sound cheesy but its true."
good,I enjoy working for Home Depot. I love helping customers with their projects and making sure they get everything that they need. I also enjoy when I can make a frustrated customer leave the store happy. Management could be better.
good,Your always helping customers back to back...with all types of home procjects..etc.. Managersbare nice ..but s. Sneaky .. always making sure you are doing your job..your best.
good,"It's a good job, just a little hard to work with school while doing late shifts.  The work is fairly peaceful too, there is that slightly haunted feeling but that is a night shift thing."
good,"Caring co-workers"
good,Good place to work. Too many of the yougsters are lazy and avoid customers. The rest of the workers go out of their way to help. Nice environment and I enjoyed going to work every day. Frequent goodies supplied in the breakroom and cakes or bar-b-que.
good,Had support of some of the managers but very hard to reach when you need them therefore I made decisions on my own for benefit of the customer. Not all stores are like this though
good,Home Depot is a good company to start working for when you are young because they are flexible with work hours. They are good in the management decisions they make and compensation tends to be fair at the end of their quarterly winnings.
good,"Home Depot was one of my first jobs in the United States. It helped me to get to know the dynamics of work in this country. I worked with good people and received a lot of instruction from the store, some of which I have served later."
good,It was a very energetic enviroment . Very friendly. Everyone made it fun. The store its self was very proud of its accomplishments. The managment was very productive.
good,Fast paced and competitive work place with great associates.Great place to learn new things such as projects to do at home or building projects. Meet new people everyday and new ways to do thing you don’t know about.
good,The management at Home Depot is the only part that I could complain about. They don’t know how to properly run the store because they will take one employee that run one department by themselves already and makes them run two others because they don’t feel like asking anyone one else that is a little bit farther away. Any jobs that they are told to do are forces straight onto the he associates and they go back to the office and talk all day long about things that don’t even relate back to the office. Examples would be taking about Pokémon go or what kind of friends they had back home
good,"Safety checklist, print out your numbers ,know your business be able to speak your business and develop a game plan. Order outs, manage  department and team."
good,the job was easy and I enjoyed the culture home depot had I was there for awhile and really enjoyed it there but the hours are only good when the weather is. last summer it rained so much and business became really slow so the hours was really poor but I had a lot of freedom there and the job was enjoyable as well as working with everyone else on the freight team. good hours when the weather is good but it can get bad when it slows down.
good,"It was a good work environment. I Iearned how to deal with customers , drive a fork lift and jack palate.  Good benefits, good management. Well organized work place."
good,Quality company to work for all benefits and 401k provided. Job security as in always getting your scheduled hours with overtime available. Worked here for 3 years and I do not have a complaint towards this company.
good,"●	Involved in end to end Implementation and Support of Workday HCM and FIN domains for modules such as Core HR, Payroll, Benefits, Time Tracking and Absence Management and Recruiting."
good,People would always treat each other like family there. They always were fair on times for people who require a time for classes and can be very flexible.
good,"Multiple tasks throughout the week provided enough of a change to keep me interested in what I was meant to do. Easily able to advance in my department, or in another department of the store."
good,When the store is busy the day goes by somewhat fast. Normally you see usual faces but still have customers who need help locating & getting information. Friendly environment
good,"Our temporary cashiers were friendly and willing to help each other out during the spring and summer seasons.  We tag teamed different registers and self-check outs as needed,"
good,Very fun and self paced training. I leaned a host of product knowledge that I was able to provide which resulted in repeat customers and an advanced skill set.
good,A very fast pace to work.I worked in a little room all by myself in the back was very secure area. But began working on the floor on my feet all day helping people
good,"working with high end contractors every day and putting together quotes for special order doors, windows, roofing, decking, fencing, etc. "
good,Enjoyed working there. Fellow employees worked as a team. Most employees were older and more experienced and took the initiative to get the job done. Enjoyed it
good,"The Home Depot is a solid company to work at for many reasons. Your typical work day mainly involves interacting with customers. This includes, but is not limited to, answering technical questions about specific problems, locating merchandise in the store, and utilizing product knowledge help customers get exactly what they need. The Home Depot has incredibly flexible work schedules which is great if you are student, or in between jobs. Don't expect for much financial compensation, even if you are doing far more than anyone else. This is a company that is in a race to the bottom as far as costs are concerned. They are not afraid to replace full-time associates with two part-timers to cut costs. This will eventually come back to hurt the company in my opinion."
good,"Decent place to work taught me how to operate standup forklifts as well as load and unload trailers, the management overall was decent minus the few that had favorites and would micromanage"
good,"i liked the people i worked with and management really makes an effort to make a team environment thats fun and inviting. always willing to try and make things right,"
good,home depot was a greet place to work. You have a simple job to do and great customers. if your a people person and like retail this is a good place to work at. You can move quick but depends on how much effort you put in.
good,The Home Depot is a grat Company that tries to take care of all associates. The one area they need to improve upon is to actually give qualified internal candidates the opportunity to advance.  I was passed by on a promotion when several key members of the interview board had me as the #1 candidate.   Back office politics like every large company.
good,"Fair overall job great starter job. Management like any other retail comes and goes, great  personal growth and career advancement , net working is a must."
good,Hard work good starting pay. Workload is achievable and changes on a weekly basis. hard to fill associate hired quota. Annual raises get drowned out by continual incremental increase in base pay. No night time differential compensation. Advancement isn’t based on skill or knowledge but rather who you know and are friends with.
good,As far as Working at home dépôt somme days were fun and somedays were rough becuase there would sometimes thé feight réal would be short hand but i Feel i had Amazon managers and co workers.
good,"Overall high safety record and extensive training program.  Fair management policy, good work environment.  Available benefits and friendly staff.  Home depot gave me an opportunity to learn how to operate different types of heavy machinery, including: forklift, pacer, electric pallet jack and a scissor lift .  I learned costumer services skills and how to best assist people."
good,I loved my job and my customers.  It was a very strenuous job but still very enjoyable. Great benefits! I will probably go back if I ever come on hard times. :-)
good,I enjoy the working environment and my co-workers. there are always shifts available and they are really flexible with hours. my supervisor is really understanding
good,"no comments at this time- every location is different.  But as a manager, there is NO work life balance, can't call out sick EVER, always are working weekends, holidays, LONG shifts 10-14 hours a day."
good,"Like most business today. A lot more work is required to no pay additional compensation Most managers lack caring attitude. They only see the negative, do not recognize all the good hard work of employees"
good,Ive worked at The Home Depot since October of 2015.  Ive learned a lot and met a lot of people.  The culture and atmosphere at this location has been pleasant.  The majority of the workers really care about their jobs and it shows.  Management has been thoughtful and has worked with me on different occasions because of life situations.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for employment to try working here.
good,"Good company to work for. Great people, and other employees are respectful. Great customers, very good environment, great management team as well. Great place to work for."
good,"Great place to work. Good management and all employees get benefits. "
good,"Overall, this is a great place to work. Executive Leadership is open, responsive, and lives the company values. Chief Merchandising Officer is straight-forward and easy to work with. Atmosphere is above average, but daily workload can be stressful and work/life balance is poor. Average work week can easily be 50-60+ hours in order to meet deadlines and keep up with workload. "
good,A good morning job. It was stressful with how busy it was and how much stuff there is everywhere. The store is well organized and management is dedicated from what I remember. Not super friendly towards female employee.
good,"This is a great company to work for, the only downfall would be management. They definitely play favoritism. I've worked at 3 different Home Depot's and each management team is almost identical."
good,"Loved the people, it's a good and steady job, pay is good, the bonuses are annual, benefits are awesome, life long friends and carreers can be made here."
good,"I had to leave, but i did not hate my time at the Home Depot. They treat you very well for a large worldwide organization. I did have one manager that i could never stand, but most jobs come with that. Most of the people at the Home Depot are great!"
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for with all the employment benefits they provide along with the pay. The hours are flexible depending on your schedule and you can choose to work different shifts.
good,Home Depot is a great job with wonderful benefits. The managers are very approachable. It is a wonderful place to work. I have been there for a very long time.
good,Overall the job was good and the customers were excellent the staff was friendly and helpful and they taught me a lot working with them they helped me stay motivated.
good,I worked as a book keeper in college. I knew I was being under paid for sure but it was enough for that time period and I learned a lot for my next job. My trainer was fun. I learned the front end cashier job and my own. I like my co-workers. A lot of ppl work there for years and I get why. There may have been some school yard clicks but still a great place to be. 4 is an ungodly hour to wake up for work though and they drastically cut hours in their off quarter. If you are confused about something with hours or pay management all points at each other and no one knows what to tell you or who to point to.
good,"Home Depot is a great part time job as well as full time career. They offer flexible hours, competitive wages and the opportunity to grow within the company. Home Depot is a very friendly atmosphere and positive energy."
good,"The management at the Home Depot are excellent.  They try to make working in a physical environment as enjoyable as possible. The only cons to working at Home Depot are the low pay and having to work on your feet all the time.  For Younger people this is ok but for older employees it is hard on the knees and feet.  learned a lot since working there about the retail industry.  hardest part is standing up your whole shift. "
good,I had a great experience with Home Depot except when I moved to full time in MET I had to complete my 40 hours per week. No flexibility for the hours.
good,I love my job and the duties with my position at the Home Depot but in my personal situation I felt it was stepping out of line for my store manger and assistant store managers to give me an ultimatum that I kept my job and left my husband or stay with my husband and lose my job. This is very unprofessional.
good,"The Home Depot is a pretty good company to work for but I'm just looking for a change of pace because even though are pretty good at promoting the employees.. sometimes it or in my experience it's not a true promotion rather a change in tasks and a true promotion can take a long time where you notice a difference in pay, benefits or bonuses."
good,I was a stocker at Home Depot it was a great place to work at the management although wasnt the best. They treated us pretty poorly at least the stocking team. I enjoyed my time with Home Depot Tho
good,"Overall, great place to work. Great Core values and benefits for associates. Unfortunately, there is a lot of favoritism. It seems you get promoted by the people you know, not your performance"
good,Not a bad place to work. I started at the service desk then went to a 4am-9am shift scanning outs then went to 9pm - 1am shift doing the same job. Some issues with a few managers but that wasn't the stores fault.
good,Was a good place to work nice site cool people just got very busy at times and the didn’t get you any help but overall It was a fun place to work and cool
good,"During my time working here at The Home Depot, I always enjoyed the company of my co-workers and the relationships that developed with the customers. My regulars always came in needing something and always came to me when they had questions. The store always threw parties for every holiday not to mention the holiday pay. Overall, a great store to work for but have a set or flexible schedule can be a problem."
good,"im not really a people person but I feel at home working at home depot though some people are mean, generally speaking everyone is nice and welcoming. I appreciate the work effort put in as well helping each other out and making it a fun work place."
good,"Have been with the company for over 8 years and had a great experience, there's always great support from HR, admin and senior leadership. Associates are treated equally and fairly."
good,the home depot was a good place to work. we focused more on internal and fraud cases which were fun and interesting. the investigation would get stressful and tense because it took a while to get all of the information together before proceeding. but i learned a lot from it and i apply it to my job skills.
good,"I've worked there long enough to see management come and go, and it really just depends on who you get for a manager and what your position is. Otherwise, the company offers okay pay and decent benefits. Every once in awhile you will run into a new company policy that doesn't make sense or makes it harder on you, and then a few that will actually make it easier on you. My current position is fixed, but my co-workers seem to have flexible scheduling. Lunches can be chosen at 30 minutes or an hour, completely up to you. You only get 2 bonuses per year, assuming your store did good enough. You can get more bonuses if you get Homer Awards ($50 for 3). As long as you do your job, you don't have to worry about job security, Home Depot isn't going anywhere any time soon. Home Depot seems to pride itself on hiring the minorities, they hate a white male dominance. I understaqnd their direction, but at times, if someone is bad at their job, they won't fire/replace because they are minority."
good,"Use of the R.F scanner to loud products into the designated trailers using the stand-up forklift, use of the Gladiator scanner to distribute the products to there designated stores, use of the forklift to move product pallets. But I really don't have much to say about it."
good,the company is good for the most part. the people are nice and friendly. takes some getting use too just because of the long hours and labor intensive work.
good,"Average benefits"
good,"Moving up in this place is hard because of work ""politics"". Poor management and unfair employee treatment. Managers have favoritism. Although Co workers are great and Home Depot has good benefits. Good first job. Good pay for a Hayward location."
good,"As my first job this is were i did most of my initial growth. "
good,"Working at the Home Depot has been pretty great thus far.  Low-level management is great but does struggle to find a balance with upper management on the store level.  The job has many different responsibilities, making every day very different."
good,"Deter shoplifters, write reports based on the findings. Review video footage. Management was helpful. Work place was fun and free they allowed you to be you as long as you were productive."
good,"Overall great place to work. Room for advancement, relaxed atmosphere. A wonderful opportunity for someone to make their career. Other employees would submit  your name to management for rewards showing your hard work."
good,"Be ready for Many inquiries, Learn as much as you can because no matter what department you in they expect you to know everything, It's stressful work but manageable and they are flexible for part time or students but not for full time employees."
good,"Decent Job. Requires self motivation and politics to move ahead. Hourly pay starts low. The only way to make more money is to move up the ladder, which requires schmoozing and politicking to convince those above you are worthy of moving up."
good,"Great company when I started with them"
good,this should not be something that has to be done. i am not in the mood to write a review of my previous employer at this time. You need to revise this to be optional.
good,"As a store manager, I worked 7 days a week many times. No work life balance. I was connected by a phone. They own you. However, the pay was great but that is part of owning their employees"
good,Has it's challenging days.. Over all a good place to work at if you're not scared of hard work some days. Has a big turn over rate. Mostly because of the schedule. Sometimes not the best.
good,"it is very active work place and always something to do but some people have very poor communication or time management. coworkers were great and always trying to have good laugh and even joke while helping customers, fun environment."
good,I liked the hours of operation and the days the location was great  or far to travel I would liked to have moved up with the company it is a good company to work for
good,"In terms of call centers, its probably the best for the given area. HD does try to take of their people as best as they can and if you are social butterfly, then you will be able to be promoted. A typical day will be between 30-50 calls (depending on if its holiday season). They generally try to work with you within reason. The biggest drawback is what I said earlier. If you are the type of person who is better at making friends and able to be at least competent when it comes to your job, you'll be promoted."
good,"Promotions at the Home Depot are not necessarily based on the quality of your work but how well you network and market yourself. If you do not mind marketing yourself in order to be promoted, then this is the job for you."
good,i learned that management at the home depot depends on the store you are in it can bee cheerful or stressful sometimes it's fun  treat your people right and they will take care of customers and everything will fall in place..
good,"The Home Depot is one of those places that you have to be ""in"" with the croud. It is a great place to have a carrer if you are accepted. Not such a good place if you are not. Great benefits, great management, great help from other associates when you need it. Great core values: they had the Home Depot wheel. One of the core values was,"" doing the right thing."""
good,All employees are kind to each other. We work well together. Management is always ready to listen to what you have to say in order to make things better
good,Home Depot is a great place to work if you enjoy fast paced retail environment where lot of networking is required. Merchandising has most of the say in decision making
good,"setting bays to planograms always different things to do"
good,I enjoyed working and getting to know co-workers and customers. You can learn new things everyday. It's not stressful but it is hard work at times. I could have fun everyday.
good,Good place to work for a period of time. Learn a lot about home renovation. Advancement is available with a good work ethic and ability to work well with others.
good,"I thought working there was going to be a lot different than what actually happened. I honestly felt like I was treated like I was a child, although I was only a Junior in high school.There were plenty of other people that were my age that got way better treatment than me. Maybe it was just the management, but I wouldn't have this as a first job."
good,"Engage with customers and assist them get everything they need for their project. "
good,Your experience at The Home Depot depends on the area and the team you come in. Taking care of our people is one of the values and you just have to make sure that you have someone to advocate for you within your organization at the management level. The company makes sure you have fun at work with a lot of perks.
good,"I was a part timer at the home depot, during the years that i worked there i had a full time position at another company."
good,Nice place to work if you still unaware of your career choice but if it’s not I wouldn’t waste to much time here. The pay starts at 11 and can be increased over time
good,"It’s a good company to work for.. you can learn a lot of things,. Need to give the associates that work there more advancement opportunities ... I like learning and they can give opportunities to do it"
good,I really enjoyed working there but they do not pay you for the work that you do. It amazed me how a billion dollar company pays their employees so poorly.
good,Everyone at my work always said hi and really helped me when I needed it even on training I got to do hands on when I diddnt know and that made me know more before I started evryone is really helping and is there for you!
good,The company i work for has been great.  I've given The Home Depot 11years of my dedication.  Management has been the only down fall.  Unexperienced managers and not knowledgeable enough to work in designated areas.
good,"I can't say it would be this way at every Home Depot, but the one in Trotwood, OH is notoriously horrible for micromanagement. I mean, it probably can't be helped, seeing as the regional office was in the back of our store. You'd run into the district manager in your department at least 3x a week."
good,Managers switch regularly and sometimes lack continuity.  Your always on the move helping and pleasing customers Sometimes looking over your shoulder for a manager poised to come down on you for saying something negative.
good,"My night started at 9:00 P.M. and ended at 5:30 A.M.  I normally drove the forklifts or the reach trucks throughout the night.  I would work the lumber and building materials departments.  But a lot of the time I would put the freight up in the overheads with the reach truck.  Sometimes I would drive the slip sheet until they turned it into the pacer, along with the electric pallet to bring freight to the sales floor."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work, but salary did not fit the work. Great people to work with and safety always practiced. Health and fitness always important as well. Great store manager and assistant store managers."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. While the environment can be fast paced and stressful at times, that is not the norm. There is a great sense of collaboration between all the groups."
good,It was mostly fast paced and a lot of hardworking. The managers would lock us outside from lunch and we would have to wait for them to unlock it for us. The workers are great. The hardest part of the job was making sure you finish before the customers walk through the door.
good,"I feel the company is flexible with adjusting to work/life balance. The employees are provided with vacation and sick leave. Also, as a part time associate, I am able to received 401k, some insurance plus paid time off. I love the people, I work with. Overall great part-time job but they could pay more."
good,Work culture is fast-paced but fun. They provide great training and the benefits are pretty good as well. If my school schedule were more flexible then I would have stayed.
good,"Majority of teams are well structured with strong managers in place to help you succeed. The company does have some draw backs with some antiquated technology, something the have to invest in order for them to catch-up to their competition."
good,Productive and a fun work environment a lot of room for growth and opportunities to move up in the company. Very professional but not enough hours for the employees.
good,"A typical day started at 6 am. We did our morning stretching. We were briefed on what was going on in the company and what our work assignments were. The hardest part of the job was learning the location in the store of all the merchandise and where extra stock was stored. Extra stock was not always stored near to where it was to be displayed.  I enjoyed the atmosphere on the job, especially when things went smoothly. Then I had a feeling of a job well done."
good,It was my first job. It was okay. It was hard to get vacation time and the communication when I tried to transfer to the Lincoln store was terrible and I still haven't heard back from them.
good,"Official job was to sell doors and windows. Real job was to go around the store and help wherever was needed. L Earned to operate forklift, electric pallet jacks, tow motor. Learned about the various products, uses, and applications.Overall a positive experience."
good,"All the people at my HD were fantastic, very family-like. Management was half terrible, half awesome. My job as an order fulfillment associate was terrible. Constantly being pulled to do things away from my time sensitive work, then being yelled at when I had no choice. Do not work as an OFA. Just don't. Other departments (Ive worked almost all of them) are not so bad though. Otherwise benefits are fantastic if youre full time and Home Depot is the best retail job you could hope to have. Advancement feels unfair though, like someone working there for 4+ years has been part time and applied for multiple full time positions in and out of his department and others with half his time and skill have been promoted over him."
good,Long term employment if you are dedicated. Corporate Management is outstanding.  Local management is a shot-in-the-dark.  The education that is available for employees is the best... bar none.  The compensation for doing your job is outstanding both monetarily and in appreciation.
good,"▪ As an Appliance Specialist, I received first-hand knowledge of all products and features, as well as providing and selling protection plans. Another requisite of the job was Customer Service, in which I excelled in accommodating all customers and maximizing my abilities to bring a solution to solve any problems that customers faced."
good,"I loved working for Home Depot. The environment was relaxed and the work was enjoyable. The management did not seem to care about your advancement or career. You could try over and over and stay in the same spot. It was the only flaw of the company, other then not wanting to make long term employees full time."
good,"Excellent company and theres always room to grow and improve. Promotions come your way all the time,  you just need to apply yourself for it. I learned that you have to make decisions on the fly."
good,"Overall, it’s nice working there. They really need to work on management. Most managers don’t care about employees.  Some of them are really nice and helpful, but most of them are horrible and hated by pretty much everybody.  Also scheduling is a mess, always!! Employees are nice and friendly. Benefits are really good, even for part-timers. Pay is good."
good,"Casual atmosphere but structured.  Fast paced, and depending on department, hard work.  Can be hot and dusty at times.  Good management team at Trussville store.  If you work and demonstrate you want to advance, you will get opportunities as come available.  Pay ok but its retail so what can you expect?"
good,This was a very fun job but there isn’t much Home Depot offers to their employees on the aspect of benefits that I know of. The managers where non negotiable about some matters of advancement and rather hire outside workers than move from the inside. I’ve had a interview for a full time position here and it went excellent but I didn’t get the job second to first because another woman needed it to get away from her now divorced husband who worked at the same building and they moved her to our location to fulfill the position.
good,"Been working at the depot for 5 years now. Trying to move up to full time took me forever but finally got it after 4 years when an opening came up. The co-workers there are nice and friendly, but some of them only care for gossip and drama instead of doing their jobs and helping customers. Sometimes also feel your being under paid compared to the work others do and your doing twice the amount of work. "
good,"You can get experience in many different things at The Home Depot, primarily customer service and sales, as is with any retail setting, but you can also receive leadership, managerial, supervisory, teamwork, communication, and specialty skills, to list a few. Every store is different but in my experience, they seem to value numbers and metrics more than the employees, and one of the managers is a micromanager, with causes stress for most. I enjoy working with the people I work with, but retail is not my permanent employment setting."
good,très belle place pour travailler pendant les études
good,When I worked there Each department had knowledgeable qualified personnel in each department. Now it is no longer the same place. I ran the electrical department and the other day I listened to an employee give all the wrong instructions to a home owner on how to perform the work he wanted to do. I stepped in and gave them both a lesson
good,The Home Depot is a welcoming and fast paced environment. The employees are friendly and the managers are great. I would recommend working here to a friend. There are many different opportunities here.
good,Load and unload trucks. Used the forklift assembly line belt.. Pulled orders for shipment. As used RF scanner to scan shipment. Very enjoyable work place
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for they have a lot of diff benefits that you can pick from and don't forget they have different other programs for employees in need
good,Enjoyed my job at home depot. It is stressful  at times. Good  place to work and make a career if you're going into management. They have treated me very well over the last  16 years.
good,"The job itself can be stressful but the coworkers make up for it. Everyone helps everyone, no one is too rude or unhelpful. We stick together and keep an eye on each other."
good,"good opportunity if you can follow the sales model and you get qualified leads.  A great portion of the leads are not qualified and a waste of time and gas.  If you build your business properly, you can make unlimited commissions"
good,"Our managers and people I work along with are great people. However, the company offers a limited amount, if any, options for work place advancement. I have also been employed for over 4 years and make almost the same wage as when I started in 2014. We work hard but there seems to be now way to advance in the company. All in all, I still love working The Home Depot."
good,"Good company to work for.  Hard work, but they reward employees through lunches, and success sharing.  Flexible schedule was nice.  I was fortunate enough to work at a store with a great management crew."
good,"Start of pay is good in comparison to other retail stores. Enjoyed my time working there, only reason leaving was because of a better job opportunity. The staff is friendly, and there’s enough training for you to understand clearly of what your job is about. Recommend this job to students because of their flexible work hours."
good,"Good place as stated. For the most part you can write your own ticket, Provided you have a decent Manager. Long hours Customer service  Freight control Inventories Dealing with Customers8hour typical full time Part time Varies  Good culture"
good,Just like any where people  come and go.some take pride in there job and the ones who don't makes it hard on those that do..I  enjoyed  my time a the home depot. I am  blessed to have work with some amazing people..
good,Nice place to work with plenty of opportunity for advancement. They provides employees with on the job training. Most of management has an open door policy. There is a diverse group of people employed. The hardest part of the job is the ability to keep a fast pace through out the work day. I enjoy the team work we have.
good,I thought it was ok  there were some things i liked and there were some things i didn't like. I would go back if i was given the chance. Lots of good benifets
good,"Por más que quiera la empresa retener y por más que un empleado quiera quedarse, no se puede mantener a una familia con 5000 pesos al mes, nuestra situación económica en el país, nos obliga a desarrollarnos y ser aún más competentes para subsistir y si la empresa no tiene espacio para retener talento, pues simplemente lo pierde"
good,"All these people talking about minimum wage are lying. It starts at 11 per hour."
good,The Home Depot is a wonderful company who some what kind of slightly shows that they care about their associates. Only reason I say that is because if you work during the day there’s way more opportunities than overnight so keep that in mind when applying.
good,Working in lumber in building materials is hard work. Theres a lot of manual labor involved. You have to load concrete bags weighing between 50-92 pounds.  A lot of customers come with no help or claim they are hurt so you end up doing a lot of heavy lifting for them while they watch.
good,"The management have your back, you are treated as though you are apart of the company and not just another cog in the machine. You sometimes deal with particularly upset customers, but because of the great environment you are always backed by your coworkers."
good,"While Home Depot seems like a great place to work, and has a very fun and fast paced work environment. It is also very stressful and supervisors tend to have the superiority mindset where they feel they don't have to abide by certain rules, which in turn makes the work harder for those trying to abide by the rules. I have reached a point where I dread going in to work and am miserable when I am there. You're also expected to play many roles, and I find myself doing the jobs of other departments on an almost daily basis. The amount of work that has to be done and how crummy I feel at the end of the day really doesn't feel worth minimum wage."
good,"The Home Depot, Inc. encourages respect for customers and fellow associates. Their training enhanced my product knowledge and sales skills. Hard work is generally recognized but not especially rewarded; the hardest worker, willing to undertake more difficult and/or strenuous jobs, is treated essentially the same as a less ambitious associate. Associates willing to work less attractive (relatively) flexible shifts are rewarded with substantially more hours than associates who prefer stable working schedules."
good,"Good place to work and good pay. There is a bi-annual bonus for all employee if store meets sales goals. Full and Part time employees are eligible PTO, sick time, and benefits."
good,"This was a temporary part-time job.  It just became too many hours per week, as I also held down a full-time job.  They promoted me right away to Head Cashier."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work for younger people attending school or older people who are just looking for things to do to keep themselves busy. I wouldn't say it is a career location unless you can find a way to move up. I was part time and was forced to move because my area was low income, only part time jobs. However, The Home Depot has a great culture, great employees, and our managers were fantastic. I suggest working at Home Depot while attending college or just something on the side. If you're lucky enough to advance, then the Home Depot would be a fantastic career."
good,"I learned how to communicate with customer "
good,"Home Depot value customer service more than anything in your daily performance."
good,"Coming into the job as a cashier, it is easy to assume that this job will be a breeze but providing excellent customer service while ensuring all transactions are completely accurate and done in a timely manner."
good,First overall great work experience! You can feel welcomed and very settled your first couple of days. A big loving family working hard for a better tomorrow!
good,"Good time working there, flexible around work, school and family life. Worked there twice, and was able to come back with ease. All on job training. Would go back."
good,Satisfactory good place to work. Open work environment for getting to know contractors. A little short on tools to compete with lumber yards. Working holidays wasn't productive no contractors
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"The Home Depot ks a great place to work. The pay is good and the management is exceptional. Management is chosen carefully. They are all helpful and wise in their positions. There are always opportunities for advancement. The company is a competitive one. The aim to have thew highest sales in their district as well as encouraging customers to apply for their credit cards. The company offers many benefits to the customer for applying to their deals such as discounts, bogos, and of course exceptional customer service. The company and its employees are all very friendly and helpful."
good,It was a great learning experience to work at Home Depot i would recommend this job to a lot of people it just sometimes they don’t give enough hours lol
good,Relaxed and laid back job but when it gets busy it gets busy! You get a chance to be crossed trained which is also a plus. Also get a chance to be trained on all lift equipment.
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. It was fun helping customers to figure out and complete their projects. I would recommend this job to others that like working with their hands.
good,"Work scheduled hours."
good,"I have enjoyed learning and working at Home Depot and would love to make Home Depot my forever employment.  Regretfully I cannot continue to support myself on the pay."
good,Front end supervisor said I did a really good job in handling the serious situation real well. It was my duty to finish every customer's transaction as fast as I can.
good,Associates are well aware of their surroundings at the store. Safety is our number one priority at work. They have to work very safe for customers. Each associate solves every customer's problem in finding the appropriate merchandise.
good,"Good work envvironment easy to work with management team that helps promote company vision. Management provides the tools to succeed. Helped me to understand business management (logistics, budgeting, time management and margin)."
good,management loss prevention teach training higher terminating inventory pl anagrams weekly conference calls   visual displays customer service opening closing
good,Home depot may not be the best paying company out there but good lord is it a lovely company to be apart of. the management team and co-workers are every hard working professional dream.
good,"A typical was stocking shelves, helping customers locate items. I learned many helpful ideas about home improvement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with"
good,"I really enjoyed working for The Home Depot.  Although, I could say alot.  What I like most besides our customers,  my fellow peers and co-workers were the Aprons we got the chance to design for all types of Holidays.  This company really cares about their co-workers... and they know how to have FUN! Great place to work!"
good,The most enjoyable part pf the job is when I've accomplished my task by making sure all the docks are cleared and ready to receive and unload the trailers. When my department is cleared of the daily clutter and ready for business. Knowing that I'm not leaving my responsibilities onto a co-worker.
good,The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards. The best part of the job  talking with the customers. The workplace culture is causal business like The management is proper and professional. The typical shift can swing from slow to very active in one day. be on your toes at all times.
good,Start shift at 4:00pm set my loading station with what i needed to have when shift started. i learned how to organize my effectiveness when doing my shift. management was cool work culture was great hardest part for me was when we had orders that had to go out so you could get overwhelmed so at times. most enjoyable was just working around some good people.
good,I had a fun time working here at Home Depot. My Co-workers were awesome people to talk to. The customers were normally nice. The breaks were worth it for sure. I was trained well and had a great experience learning about products.
good,Managers actually do their job which makes a huge difference. They do a good job with providing food and activities for the employees and the families.
good,"Good temp place to work. Not for a career. Good benefits. Flexible work schedule.  The employees are very nice. Good place to learn how to drive a forklift, and how to do handy work."
good,I work at the Service Desk at 100 Oaks Home Depot. That store is the busiest store in the South East region. I enter act with all different types of customers. (The good the band and the ugly) Once I get done helping the customer I feel very proud about myself. Especially if it is a challenging task to handle. I enjoy my job but it is not what I want to do for the rest of my life.
good,Easy place to work and get money. Work hard thy bump you up quickly. Very hot in DC but you can dress for the environment. Good equipment and good people.
good,"Some home depots have better management, but the company on its own does not make the best decisions in regards to helping their employees when it comes to issues going on."
good,It’s a pretty good job for teenagers and adults alike. The pay isn’t amazing but ok and you learn quite a bit of useful things in your time there. Many come in handy.
good,"Typical day was to line the associates up with contacting their contractors in order to meet their needs for the day and week. Making sure delivery truck was properly loaded. I learned how "
good,Home Depot is a great company.  I found a better job with more opportunities.  With a local family based company.  It was a better fit for me and my family.
good,"I loved helping customers with and questions or suggestions. Working as team member to accomplish a common goal. Always willing to help other employees to be safe, and be willing to make suggestions to help them make the goals."
good,"it was an okay job nothing spectacular, Hard work with little to no recognition and is based on favoritism. work hard work hard work hard. Diverse culture and a lot of learn if given the opportunity"
good,Daily job responsibilities remained clear and understood throughout employment.  Obtained further safety training required for working around loading equipment.  Everyone had a good attitude and enjoyed the job.  Using lift equipment for inventory management.
good,"I love worked at the Chehalis, Wa Home Depot. At the time the store crew we had was amazing!! I can honestly say that things have changed and gone down hill a little but still an overall good company."
good,"A typical day is very interesting.  Always learn about new products. The management is very open, and a place is a good place to work.  The hardest part of the job is to try to satisfy every customer.  Doing the job is very enjoyable."
good,The company is not the highest paying but is a great place to start if retail or management is in your career goals. Home Depot has a great system of training retail and time management practices that can be used anywhere in your future career
good,"Working at THD was such a great experience for me i loved working there because of the environment I was around. There was times I did not like it as much but there was not a day I did not want to be there. Home Depot is all about family and having a safe work place and that is what I loved about it, I got to make so many friends and got to help those who needed it. I told many of my friends to go work there and they took their chances and til this day they say it was good I told them because it is a great place to be. Great energy and fun to be at."
good,"The home depot has its ups and downs. As any retail store has. For the most part things have been Smooth besides typical ups and downs based on scheduling. Some points too much can be asked and expected from 1 or few people. There can be holes in communication but the mannagment team has been responsible in there efforts of clearing up any confusions. The current store manager has been agreeable and very communicable of associate needs. He has also directed the store to become more successful then It has been at this location. In this said locations history.  He has been highly responsable for its sucsess. Given his great leadership as a mannager and a fellow associat. It has been a good starting job to introduce a full time job responsibility. I would recommend this job to those seeking such work, young and old."
good,"The Home Depot is a good Employer. They were able to work with school schedules, and if the was applicable to future in Home Depot they will help pay for school."
good,"I enjoyed working for them just have to watch who you talk with. "
good,Relaxed environment chill work to do. Typical day is going in and packing out the whole store putting things where they belong. Use phones to scan and tell you where things should go
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work. Management is excellent there and it offers great part time and full time benefits as well as a great opportunity to rise in company.
good,"a typical work day for me is to offer excellent customer service, the cashiers are keeping in line with the ethos of the company, ensuring the front-end offers fast and friendly checkouts and closing the registers for the night or for audits."
good,"It was fun and mostly always something to do, but lately i have had some of the managers get on my back for less then 5 min brakes and having my brother with me to wait for my mother so he can be picked up but got told he cant do my job and he didnt but i was fighting them to get off my back and to kept telling them that he is leaving."
good,"Good place to work, good environment good benefits, chance for advancement, competitive pay, family friendly environment, looking to get out of retail"
good,"This job requires you to be self motivated.  If you don't generate leads, or train store associates on how to enter leads you won't have many appointments."
good,I do like working at the Home Depot because how much I move around and stay busy. I've met a lot of really good people working there with me and I like meeting new customers to help them out with their needs. Advancement is more difficult because not many want to leave the HD so there aren't many openings that come up. The biggest thing I've learned is stay flexible.
good,"My day starts at 5am making sure the store is shopable for our customers.  That means helping the night crew put the store back together before 6am. Making sure all merchandise is put up and floors are swepted and clear of all debis. I work in the garden dept, which in my store, is the largest dept so therefore I have to make sure inside and outside garden is presentable.  I've learned the safety is the most important issues at the homedepot.  The hardest part is stay force and  the enjoyable part is when you have helped someone via on the phone or in person and that customer is happy"
good,"Home Depot is a fast pace working environment , it’s an manageable job very simple , customers come first and customers service has to be a must , products well stock and organized ."
good,the work environment depends on the day if its busy it can be chaotic. customers can be stressful making the managers mad and making us do other departments work at times.
good,It is a nice place to work. The pay is decent but the hours is what sucks. They don't like to give many hours and overtime is very rare. Everyone is always kind.
good,super awesome place to work.  enjoyed everyday. some days were hectic some were slow.  variety of cultures in the store at all times. great experience for me personally
good,"This is a very good company to work for.  They treat you well while you are there, the people are a pleasure to work for, the work is very physical when you are carton picking.  The only problem is that you have to apply for Temporary status in order to work there and only if you are one of their best employees do they hire you permanently.  Otherwise, they lay you off, telling you that they have no positions available for you and thus, you have to reapply during their busy seasons in order to work there again.  "
good,"I worked here while attending college and then worked full time for a year after I graduated. Although it's not your typical retail setting, it still very much includes all the nuances that come with working in retail only you get to use large lift equipment."
good,"The Home Depot is a forward thinking company focused on innovative products for the home improvement consumer. Consumer offerings like DIY classes are up to date and very informative. The Home Depot also involves itself in the surrounding community, Every quarter they do community service for a derserving person or business. Great leadership  which has guided the company into the #1 spot for home improvement."
good,Home Depot has a lot to offer if you didn't mind working nights weekends! Never had same schedule do you could keep a good home life! Great training!!
good,a typical day would be me being called back and fourth to help customers load and unload merchandise on and off their cars. I learned that construction retail stores are very competitive and very hectic you must always keep your cool . work place everyone was treated with respect and acted like a family . the hardest part of the job is being able to juggle tasks on the move and using intuition and critical thinking . The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the people you work with and being a part of something bigger than yourself.
good,Home Depot is a pretty nice place to work for if you can adjust to the work hours .Being in retail Dema d's a lot o e of these is working mostly on the week end this take you away from your family and close friends .
good,Home Depot has a pretty amazing culture. They care about their community and like to give back. They care about their veterans . They get you involved in Charity and it's great
good,"there were several assistant managers and a store manager,  Store manager was terrible, ASM were not much better,  direct supervisor was great, coworkers were too"
good,"I worked for THD for 14 years. They've invested as much in me as I've invested in them. That being said, you get what you give. Like any retail job expect everyone to be your boss - customers, management. If you have a positive attitude and a 'let's do this' approach it will be a pleasant place to work. As far as their benefits go there leaves much to be desired. Firstly their 401K, ESPP, and 'success sharing' are above average. The health insurance is lacking and has since declined in quality of coverage and increase in cost, especially if you have a family"
good,"the home depot was a very rewarding company to work for. The management was very helpful and reflected a great deal of respect to its employees "
good,"Great work environment but can get a little sweaty and dirty. Friendly coworkers. great management, friendly, prompt and willing to compromise. my hours at part-time varied from closing shifts and morning shifts but was due to them being able to work around school schedule."
good,"I work for the corporate merchandising team, MET.  We have regular hours, which is something I like, and cannot be said for working store side.  My team and manager are pleasant to work with."
good,"A typical day for me consists of getting my assignment, then, meeting up with my crew (if assigned with one) so that we can figure out exactly what we are doing, how, and when."
good,"work could be fast paced and hectic, or there were times where things were laid back and we were able to collaborate with various departments to try and improve the work environment and shopping atmosphere. The people that worked there were very welcoming and made the day go by faster. Management was around and available to help out whenever it was needed."
good,"Pros:"
good,A typical day at work would consist of cleaning organizing and helping costumers. lrean ordering and clean lit equipment and cashiering. Mangers help.
good,"Typical day would require attentive customer assistance, while "
good,"Prepare for a very physical job and if you work in Phoenix and in the Garden dept you better like the Heat! Both of those issues are the hardest part of my job, the best part is the people I get to work with...we all get along and genuinely care about each other."
good,"As a MEA, the tasks are different than a regular floor associate, but customer service skills are still necessary. The hours are early morning weekdays only with paid holidays."
good,"overall great, it can be a lot of work at times, but if you manage your work it can be fair. however, management expectation is too high for the reality of customer service and the task they give to be done by the end of a person's shift."
good,Once I was at the service desk I felt like they would not let me advance in the company. Great opportunity to help customers and get to know pro customers
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work if  you don't mind lifting over 40 pounds several times each work day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the success sharing party.
good,Advanced to Pro Sales. Worked with contractors in various fields. Quoted jobs per customers Blueprint Drawings. Compiled all material and set up Delivery options for contractors. Great perks for Credit Sales and submitting Credit Applications.
good,"This job has flexible hours, with opportunity to gain further hours in needed.  I just started there so it's been a lot of information all at once.  Management is very approachable, kind hearted, and willing to discuss issues when they arise.  Depending on the department, you are working with people who have a high work ethic.  The hardest part of this job right now is learning the systems and knowing how to use the forklifts.  I mostly enjoy the people who come in as customers and some of the people that I work with."
good,a typical day at work started with me clocking in then going to the lot to bring all carts to the front of the building. While doing this i also had to keep an ear out to know when my help is needed for loading. the managers are positive people who push you to be the best ou can be. The hardest part of the job was being out in the sun all day and loading those heavy bags.
good,"Learnt a lot of information about seasonal products, gained a lot of customer service experience, helped customers find the product they needed and guided customers with no idea of any of the product they needed"
good,"Definitely need patience and tolerance to work here. Days will vary, but I did this for almost 2 years and it wasn't a bad job. The pay is fair, starting at $11/hr and there is room for a raise every year!"
good,Gerat place where you can help people! Something is goin on constantly.  They care about the employees! They also try to teach you! You can learn about a wide range of projects.
good,"There has never been a retail store I have worked for that gives as good customer service as The Home Depot. When there are long lines, the cashiers always call the customers toward their cash registers. Any time you need to return something, 99% of the things returned are accepted, you don't even need to bring your receipt most of the time! Also, any time an item is damaged at the time of purchase, there is a discount provided by the friendly cashiers. I would totally recommend this job to anyone who finds it easy to talk with customers."
good,"I was a cashier right out of high school. great interaction with customers. Management was always friendly and helpful. Very flexible schedule. Always stayed busy, Would love to work there again."
good,Typical day was long but rewarding. Getting all employees involved in obtaining daily sales goal was exciting. Giving them the freedom to develop sales ideas to drive sales led to developing future leaders. Cultivating excellent customer service into the employees and including them in execution plans led to feeling of ownership. The culture was bred into your system. The hardest obstacle was balancing work and home. Being able to leave the job behind at the end of the day. The most gratifying part of the job was giving the customer the knowledge and confidence to complete a project on their own. It was rewarding in getting children involved by putting on workshops. This gave many educational opportunities and confidence building exercises for young minds.
good,"I didn't leave by choice, I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit and was forcefully removed by police. I tried to explain myself and the situation after they never came to court with the evidence. I don't blame the company though, I blame my GM at the time who didn't like me because of a previous altercation we had. The company itself is great."
good,"Home Depot experience and culture varies from store to store depending on the people who work there and the managers. Some are great but lots are like high school, lots of clicks and monthly quizzes. It can be very fun thanks to the coworkers or frequent customers that one builds great rapport with but it can also be a huge pain in the neck dealing with bad customers and sometimes dealing with picking up other coworkers slack. depending on what department on is in it's a whole different world with its pros and cons."

good,Challenging culture- very pro associate made it difficult to change bad behaviors witnessed by middle level management. The bleed orange and apron is very real and strong and exemplified by everyone that is a huge positive for the culture. Management has made great attempts to be transparent about the companies status and it's dealings.
good,"I normally worked at the Returns Register. A customer coming in without a receipt would have to have their Credit Card or Drivers Licence Scanned. The records are in the System. If it came up as ""No Refund Without a Receipt"", they Wouldn't be able to get a Store Credit for the item. If the Customer insisted on the refund, I would have to call a Management Officer up. It was again explained to the customer the reason for not getting a Store Credit for the item."

good,"It's a great place to work, fast paced and consistent. Very diverse work force and friendly environment. Management is flexible with scheduling around school and other life situations. The only hard part is keeping up with the demand of customer service through power hours. The best part is the people you meet and relationships you build."
good,Home Depot is a great first job but I wouldn't make a career out of it. Home Depot gives benefits and stock access to associates to compensate for how they pay and the lack of discounts.
good,I loved workibg there. It was a great job that gave me maby skills to vebture off to orher and better opportunities. Iv worked over 4 different jobs there in the 3 years iv worked there

good,Home Depot is a great place to start working. There's room to grow in the company and they offer a lot. It was hard to juggle with school and the hours given and that was the reason I had to leave.

The best part about working at The Home Depot is that you will learn about everything in the department you are in, which are lessons that can be carried out in everyday life."
good,"A typical day at the Home Depot was extremely fast paced, Customers were fun for the most part and other times they can be difficult to please. Regardless you use all that you have at your disposal to make things right. The hardest part of the job were customers that could no be satisfied.

good,A fast-paced environment during seasonal events and the summer. Working hours are very flexible. Home Depot has worked with every one of my school schedules which vary quite differently. The service desk is responsible for customer accuracy by follow up and processing different types of transactions. Customers come to us with their needs and we must problem solve to make every customer's experience a success. We keep these customers notified about the details of their orders and we answer a lot of uncommon questions.
good,"I was young when i had this job, so for me it was fun, great company, i felt like they cared about their employees, had a festive workplace vibe, hours were not all that, and though i loved my coworkers, the management came off a tad bit aloof, nothing intolerable however, not too sure about benefits etc, as i was young and was not concerned about that type of stuff. However when i look back at my overall experience with the company, I have a positive view, pay was 9 an hr when i was there but i have heard it has gone up to 11 now."
good,"Home Depot is a place where all employees become family. "
good,I worked here for 3 years and it is a great place to start a career and has advancement options for people who would want to advance their career into a management position
good,Great place to work. Home depot celebrates diversity and multiple cultures. Several oppritunities to volunteer in your community. The only downside for me was a lack of advancement. I felt punished for being efficent at my job because they wouldnt let me leave that position.
good,"The company is extremely supportive with benefits, and the average associate is compensated fairly for their work. Department supervisors are being asked to take on more work for no pay raise outside of yearly performance based raises afforded to all associates."
good,I work in the Garden Department.
good,"helping customers get their needs met, so they could be on their way. "
good,"At Home Depot, the workers are very friendly. I got along with everyone. The managers were strict but nice so you can't upset when they're doing their jobs. The customers varied from men working on constructions, to families upgrading their home. It is a great, calm environment to work in. It is a job that requires friendliness."
good,Working at the smallest Home Depot in the world was great. First real job I ever had. If you want to hid for a shift work the garden department. Training is a breeze.
good,"A typical day at work started out with me running the service desk, I because there were never enough people to ever cover.I learned that I can  work in a face paced high volume environment. I liked the management until they fired the head manager then they started moving manager out of our store."
good,Relaxed job during slow hours.  Helping in other departments is a great way to learn and earn a few extra hours.  Management is great except when they start writing people up for not generating enough leads or meeting sales goals for the week/month.
good,Pay is great. Pretty easy job which I didn't like. Pretty flexible with employees. Their hours and work times were not consistent and fluctuated often.
good,I would come in at 5am to start my job. I would scan bins and pull products down to fill the empty spots. I helped the customers when needed. Learned products to better help with the customers.
good,I loved customer service and sales. I worked in milk works so i Loved the design aspect of the job. Also helped customers figure out there projects. I do not like a retail setting.
good,"Not required in this scenario. Probably over qualified for this position, yet I shared my vast experience with boys both my peers and managemen."
good,"I started out at Home Depot doing my summer co-op in the seasonal department. After the summer, and my co-op finished I was given a job in the lumber department. My typical day consisted of giving quick, efficient customer service in a fast paced manner. After my 3 month probation I was put in charge of MPS (Merchandising Protection Standards) and also in charge of making sure proper inventory was being taken out and correct items were being put in. (Pack Down) I learned skills as how to be polite with customers and honest, even when I didn't know the right answer I would help them figure it out. The hardest part of the job was I was the youngest employee in the seasonal department so I was in-charge of doing most of the lifting which was physically demanding. My favourite part was definitely working with customers as I was given 3 ""Homer"" awards by management which are awarded for demonstrating excellent customer service and going above and beyond Home Depot's goals. The reason for leaving was the hours I was given were conflicting with school and it ended up with me having to give my two weeks notice. Overall, it was a great job."
good,Worked like a typical retail job keep moving help people have some knowledge of fixing things you're golden. Otherwise don't stress over major things can move up quickly if you know what you're doing
good,"Gain lot of experience there also there is lot of opportunities, enjoyed the work culture and management enjoy helping others and make customer happy all the time"
good,The home depot is a great place to work it is a professional environment and work is plenty but the pay could be better but for the most part great co-workers and management and not a bad facility.
good,"Home Depot, "
good,"Overall well balanced company. Some departments are better than others, but overall good place."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company to work for, you need to be willing to put forth the effort and make it what you want it to be. I've learned how to provide OUTSTANDING customer service. The company values are great. Unfortunately management (not all) have a lack of hard work and tend to make it harder for you to get your job done. All in all Home Depot provides great benefits, Paid time off and Vacation as well as health insurance and a plethora of discounts from other outside companies."
good,"Spent 12 wonderful years working the Home Depot.  I was Orange blooded until I was laid off.  The environment was challenging, but very fruitful as you sourced the best and most innovative product to the stores.  Great people around you which made each day fun regardless of the days challenges.  Would go back if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"I've been at the Home Depot for about 19 years now and I've got to say that I love this place. The benefits are great and there's always work to be done, so the job is very secure."
good,"they set high standards for anyone which gives the opportunity for growth. You learn everything about how a business works and figure out how to manage tasks, people and workload. i believe if you listen and learn you learn more than just work ethics but a way of life."
good,great place to work and always try to new employees to do there jobs better help pro customer with there new jobs always looking for advancement help make home depot grow
good,"MET is a great way to learn the ins and outs of retail. However, the lack of communication between different facets will cause stress. Have an open mind."
good,"Some of the manager understand and work with you when you're going through difficult time. "
good,"Great entry level position to learn about large scale retail business. Good training, but little room for advancement. Learned how the industry prices commodities and earned sales experience."
good,"This is a great company to work for. There are a lot of benefits to take advantage of and the environment is welcoming and like a second home. They work with your schedule and the pay is weekly instead of bi-weekly. They are also always hiring. However, some of the managers take advantage of their power and position. And there are times when you don’t get a lot of hours and that happens a often. Overall i enjoyed working there. I met a lot of good people and i learned a lot."
good,"Good place to work."
good,They are good at working with you on personal issues. Very friendly environment. Great people work there! Full time benefits are great which makes up for the poor pay.  Associate morale tends to be like a roller coaster depending on who the management team is at the time. Hard to get new associate that actually are not afraid to work. Very clean establishment with chances of moving up if wanted.
good,I learned a lot in short amount of time. From the time you clock in til the time you clock out you are going to be busy doing different things almost everyday.
good,Difficult to make the transition from store level to corporate environment.  Corporate recruiters fail to recognize the level of experience at store level that could be a HUGE advantage at corporate level.
good,Easy going and friendly atmosphere people are willing to help you management was easy to talk to and always available. Also scheduling was very flexible
good,Home Depot is a great company with great benefits for full time and part time workers. It gives you flexibility on your schedule great for people who have other jobs or that are going to school.  Seniority benefits might give you a stabled schedule but not secured.   It depends on the position that you have. If you enjoy customer service it’s a great place to work at.
good,great company to work for company takes care of employees.  supervisors and managers like any other company some are good some great some not very good.

good,"As a Special Services Associate the environment was fast paced, you got to meet some pretty amazing people, answered inquiries and made sure that the orders were correct and on time. There were times when the ball was dropped by pullers and other associates. The staff and management were great."
good,"Productive but free environment. Exposure to the best technologies in the field. Work life balance. Work counts not hours. Professional fun experienced people around. Management is proactive in Agile XP, involving teams in different activities. Open platforms for opinion."
good,"I was there during a transitional period, as a result, we were always chronically understaffed. Just keep your head down and do your best. Last I heard from a friend that is no longer the case."
good,"Great Company overall, locally has some minor challenges. More associates needed to help with product demands.  Would love to see some new saws in the Lumber Dept.  Customer and sales volume are fairly high and store associates are stretched thin at times."
good,I thought It was a good place to work I just think they need to pay more. Also for the managers to stand up for associates more. i was treated unfairly way too many times and it was clear i didn't deserve that but no one ever stood up for us.
good,"I would answer customer questions, down stock items, and help out in other departments when needed. I learned how to safely and properly operate a forklift and other lift equipment, what the difference is between similar products, also how to grout and tile floor. The managers I had were good at what they did and why they were in the positions they held. I had a very diverse work culture working at The Home Depot considering I had worked at 3 different locations and also in the state of Texas. The hardest part of my job would be not having enough lift equipment in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job would have been making all the friends I did while working for the company."
good,"They have awesome benefits and they really try to work hard to make you happy. I had a bad experience with my time to work and told them I had to quit, but they went out of their way to give me times that I could work at due to school. During this time I had problems being let into the building to work and it drove me to walking out. There was only a manager at night that could let me in but failed to consider me. a lot of times i would stand outside for 45 minutes banging on the door and calling to try to get let in. As a normal work time this is not a problem, I was just on special hours to work which did not correlate with their normal times."
good,a great starter job for young teens or a stable career for adults who support families. There's a lot of diversity in age and ethnicity so you get to work with and understand people of all levels.
good,i loved it there i would go back but i live far from my old store its a good place to learn new skill and make money and very patient with employees its a family vibe place
good,Great place to work one hour lunch break 2 15 minutes breaks every one there is very helpful and the training is great i hit the floor running plenty of jobs for advancement in this company
good,"Always came onto a shift, working with a group of people who always set a good vibe. We Knew how to help each other out & ensure that things were done. We worked hard, but still made it a relaxable environment for us. It never seemed to be stressful or too demanding."
good,Management took more of a leadership role and was by example. Managers worked on the floor in their departments and were helpful to customers and employees.
good,Fun place to work. Pay is great. Took a while to get hired it seemed. But other than that pretty laid back place to work. Weekends can be crazy busy. Weekday nights can be very slow and boring. But easy money.
good,"Although there’s a lot of females working there, it’s a great place to meet and greet customers. I mentioned the females because they can be extremely petty with each other. But I enjoyed my time there because I’m a male."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company, until I transferred to Florida, people were not professional or easy to get along with. Unfortunately the management team were not on the same page and gave uncertain direction."
good,Good place to work and advance. If you're into customer service and want to thrive this company is for you. There core value is what made me want to work for Home Depot and now with the way I'm growing within the company is where I see myself heading. Better furture
good,It was a fast past environment. customers are fairly easy to deal with. I would  tell someone if they want a job that is always moving around and somewhat a hands-on job then i would tell them to apply there

good,"The home depot is a great starting job. before i joined the team, i did not know anything about construction. the manager are fine, i applied for a different position, but didn't even get an interview. when i applied everyone even my head cashier said i was the best candidate but the manager just ignored me."
good,"Good company if you like bright, active environment. Starting pay is low, but if you want to work into management you can. "
good,Being apart of the freight team is a great thing. We make sure that the back area is set up to receive the truck to unload it and prepare it to be put out on the sales floor.
good,"Great place to work, the people are great to work with, my Manager was a great guy. The hours may change without notice when I was there but they stayed the same until the end when my hours did change and I was unable to work those new hours."
good,"varies on days."
good,This is a good place to work  They make you feel like family and constantly reach out to you to find out where you want to go with your career as well as support you and provide you with the tools you need to succeed.
good,Clock in get a list of stuff that needs to be brought down and stocked into the shelves. Pull items and have them scanned into a shipping list to be shipped to other stores. Help customers once the store opens for a few hours.
good,The best times I had with the depot is fall thru winter...... That's when the the sales volume is high and every1 at work runs the store like a well oiled machine....Feel me

I learned about helping the customers that came to the store, and working alongside other employees to make sure that work ran smoothly."
good,I enjoyed my time at the Home Depot. It was a great learning experience. I got to do a lot of unexpected tasks and build from all the knowledge available.
good,"Home Depot has a pretty relaxed environment for most positions.  My only real complaint is the pay. $10,00 an hour for all the responsibility is nor fair.Once again, it is a huge corporation and you are one of hundreds of thousands of employees."
good,"Home Depot offers great benefits like loans and scholarships and 401k, however, they only benefit long term workers. Depending on the department, the type of work you do varies. I worked in the Garden department. I was very easy going and easy to understand. The hardest part was just memorizing all the products."
good,"I like working at The Home Depot they have been good to me, everyone tries to help out. They are also concerned about your career as well as your family,"
good,"This was a fast paced work environment. You needed to be able to help with any problems, or have knowledge of a lot of the products sold here. You had to have trouble shooting skills."

good,"The management team is very helpful and efficient. They are willing to work with you if you have any scheduling conflicts or need time off. Great coworkers, as well."
good,"The Home Depot operates generally with a culture of cooperation between associates.  I've worked there less than a year, but managers are accessible and most of the time associates are willing to help one another.  My job is quite physical, but I am learning many things about the company's processes and about the many products they sell."
good,"My days at the home depot were often slow at times, but its still a good place to work at.  I have learned about many different products and how they work.  The only difficult part of working there was that the security could've been better. The other employees were nice and fun to work with and the management was good as well."
good,"The Home Depot paint department is fun to work in when it comes to serving customers. I have learned all about home improvement in regard to paint knowledge, stains, and various repairs. Management is strong and supportive. A majority of associates are young. The hardest part of my job is lifting 50+ pound buckets of paint, climbing up and down ladders and down stocking various heavy merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and hearing about their projects and having them return to seek my advice."

good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with mostly, some customers were really good people loved to work with them. I learned a lot by joining the Home Depot it was my first job and I gained a lot of abilities there. My typical days for me at least were kind of unusual because I would work in my department but also help out in others if mines was slow because I didn't like sitting around that much. Management was really helpful every once in a while they would be kind of a handful."
good,This was a great place to work. I worked for a division that was sold to another company and our department was closed. The employees got along and each day was different but fun. Even during the stressful parts.

good,This was one of the best places I've ever worked. The only reason I left is because you'd have to be at the company for at least a few years just to be able to get permanent full-time  and the pay was somewhat too low.
good,"While a typical day at work would include direct supervision with associates time still permitted to allow for additional areas of improvement within the store. Merchandising was left to management but supervisors were tasked with being creative and help driving the process. the culture for the most part is very stable with the companies dealing with issues in short order. hardest part of the job was freight management and trying to merchandise products on short timelines. Enjoyable part was the staff and customers as always a smile and if a customer has an issue we deal with it the best we can for both parties. Worst part is tenured associates treating other associates badly having letter after letter in their file, not being dealt with and excused by manager and HR."
good,Around the holidays you will get alot of customer depending on the department they assign you too. Make sure you have good customer service and make sure your department is clean
good,"I have a degree in science so i love all the aspects of spring.I enjoying working with the plants and selling plants to landscapers and customers. I like helping customers with their questions about plants, landscaping, and hardscaping. I also enjoy any aspect of gardening including not just gardens and plants but lawns as well. I know a lot about chemistry and fertilizers and plant chemicals are right up that alley. I also like the variety of work,  as i can help with cashiering anytime they need help and i also take care of the stock and inventory in the garden center. The management is friendly and nice.I also like the associates I work with. I have fun at my job. Probably the most difficult aspect of the job is it can be a lot of physical work. I like that and i love the freedom to move around and to choose what i want to do. It keeps me active and in good physical shape. Others might find that too much work, but it is one kind of work i like doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people and working with like minded associates in the garden center."
good,"this store had a real team mentality"
good,If they could get a manger and keep them I'm sure I could have stayed forever! Unfortunately the last manager they hired was never really on board with all of the policies and was just a total disaster.
good,Working retail can be difficult do to the required hours. Working week ends and Holidays wears on a person after a while. Helping customers was the biggest joy .
good,"The environment was always friendly however it will keep you busy. There was always something to get done. Its best to learn every department so you could better serve the customers. Management was always to hear your concerns and help when they could. The environment was cool laid back, at times challenging."
good,"This is a great career opportunity for someone who doesn't have kids or is not in school. If you intend on creating a family with someone and being the parent who attends every soccer game, then this is not the place for you."
good,"I enjoyed my job at home depot. The people were great, the only reason I left because my hours were literally cut to about 9 a week! It wasn't worth it anymore between the half hour drive to get there. The hours aren't consistent unless full time."
good,"The Home Depot work culture is pretty good, a lot of hard working individuals are employed, at least at the one I worked at. The job can get pretty monotonous at times but it's not hard work so it's all fine in  the end."
good,"Having never worked retail,this was definitely eye opening. Generally a fun place to work. My co-workers and management are quick to help one another."
good,Home Depot is a very awesome place to work for. They have lots of programs to help you develop yourself. Also to become a leader is something they look forward to train you. They are very flexible with schedules and help you go to school.
good,"Good location to begin a career in retail sales. The garden center can be very busy but is great opportunity to gain product knowledge, assist customers and kerp shelves stocked."
good,"Worked at Home Depot 7 years ago so cannot truly give an accurate review of current situations there. It was a great place to work ( at least the 2 stores I worked at). Its retail so expect to work holidays, nights and weekends with a changing schedule every week. Hard labor in some departments that have a number of heavy items to sell such as Garden or Lumber, etc"
good,"I'm responsible for a certain amount of freight per night, as long as I perform my work load my job is being performed well. My managers understands there job in turn makes my job easy. The culture and nature of the job is to assist and help others to assure we complete the task at hand. The hardest part sometimes is staying up all night. The most enjoyable is clocking out."
good,Working at The Home Depot is really nice because you don't have to be stressed out all the time.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the team is a team and not individuals in sheep's clothing.  You don't have to dress in a suit or tie but can be dressed casual all the time which makes it easier to work.  sometimes the customers can be challenging but that is where the buddy system comes into play because there is always someone who is a specialist in the area around to answer really hard questions.
good,"I loved working at home depot, i tried to go back to work at home depot they wouldn't hire me, my issue was irrelevant to working at home depot. I would very much like to rejoin their company if i had the opportunity. I wasn't given the opportunity of a second chance."
good,Good benefits and opportunities for advancement as well as a progressive culture. Coworkers are helpful and make teamwork a priority. I was happy with my work-life balance.
good,you will learn alot working here. you can learn how to drive a forklift and how to use some of the products in the ailses. Alot of friendly co workers and alot of oopurtunity for growth.
good,"Coworkers were good to get along with, we had several employee team races that were fun. Learned to work in different departments witch was good to learn so you can have experience in other fields of retail"
good,home depot wasn't bad as far as the job and people are concerned. home depot falls short where all retail establishments fall short...the hours. the schedule provided can only be described as a hurricane. it is almost impossible to have lasting friendships or relationships of any type.
good,The Home Depot has many things going for it from compassionate managers to constantly advancing its technology to streamline the customer and associates experience in the store.
good,It's a good place to work but they like to cut hours. You'll want to find another job because it's hard to fill time here. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"As with all retail positions, the pace at Home Depot is fast. In my opinion, the difference is there is less stress than most retail stores. Most customers are DYI types, so they are fairly knowledgeable when they come in to the store."
good,Looking for a Change of pace a Career with Set hours/Free weekends  & a Work as a Team Environment. I would Love to work for that is Respectable & Delivers a High Quality product while supplying Supreme Customer Service with a Satisfied Customer Base :)
good,It was great while it lasted I worked part time at Homedepot and it was exciting no complaints just not enough hours given so I had to look for a full time else where
good,My role provided work-life balance.  I continued to build my tool belt through the provision and opportunity to engage multiple business partners willing to collaborate to achieve one goal of success.  My immediate leadership was fair and knowledgeable - believing in providing opportunities to share and stretch my skills.  The culture was dynamic and exciting.  The most difficult part of my role was to deliver world class service to each and every customer in a way they desired.  We sought to continually improve the customer experience both internally and externally in all HR and Pay related concerns.  I enjoyed this role and enjoyed being part of an ever-changing business.
good,"Very pleasant work atmosphere. Company was very thorough with training regime on monthly basis. Always encouraging their employees to seek advancement with the company through schooling or internal promotions.The Home Depot has taught me how to fine tune my customer service interactions. The hardest part of the job is to try and solve customers problems when they lacked the knowledge of what was required to complete their task. Having customers coming back to thank you for your advice, and letting you know that everything went smoothly."
good,A typical day is a selling whatever is in your department to customers and cleaning said department. You will learn a great deal about whatever you department is. Mine was flooring and I learned a lot about that. Management is OK. The store manager was really cool. Your direct supervisor might be a little strict. The workplace culture is really relaxed and a lot of fun. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing friendships with your coworkers.
good,"Great place to work for. Management is very good and very helpful. Team work is #1 in this warehouse. Pay is good, very fast paced environment. 4 day work week is nice."
good,"It was a hard job to be in, fast pace at most times, the employees were fun and easy to get along with. You learn from the employees and over time they become like family. There is a Christmas party each year that is out of the store, good food and Christmas presents as well. Your time there is taking care of costumers and eating food cooked in the brake room. I got started their in the Electrical Department, I knew nothing about electricity. I went home every night and Googled everything from 10-2 wires to ground flout boxes. I did not want to help a customer not known what I was doing; It could cause a house fire. So over three months I learned the       Electrical Department. The wonderful things about The Home Depot is what you learn. I found that it all can apply to you home life. What ever Dep. you work in you learn, I for one can re-wire a house. If you work in the paint Dep. then your most likely able to know what paint and how to use it."
good,"As a seasonal worker you are well taken care of. When you are offered to be kept on, you will notice your hours have dropped and the quality of team has slipped drastically."
good,The best thing about that job were the coworkers. The Home Depot hired a bunch of well rounded individuals that worked well together. I would gladly hang out with my department coworkers.
good,"If you work on the sales floor at home depot, you will never get bored. A typical day at work is usually busy if its a week day because contractors are shopping for supplies for their jobs. You meet many different people all the time, sometimes customers will be unsatisfied if you are out of a product and its out of your control, however as far as management, every one is usually cool. You just have to make sure you're doing as expected so you can avoid being talked to from management; if you go above and beyond you get rewarded with badges that sometimes turn into monetary bonuses on a pay check, etc. Overall it is a nice place to work."
good,"The work is good, I like it. It is physical and I've lost 25 pounds since starting there 10 months ago. At The Home Depot the associates drink lots of water, bottled water is supplied by the store. Compared to my office job during the day people drink lots of coffee and not much water. At The Home Depot it is almost all water that people drink. I do well with the customer service aspect of The Home Depot, I like being able to help people. Now that I've been there 10 months, I have a fairly good knowledge of the store layout and where things are so it's becoming easier and quicker to help people find what they want."
good,"Easily move up within the company, if desired. Many different positions available within each store/within the company. Quick paced work, always something to do. Management could be improved, especially when it comes to manager-employee relationships. Treated as just another employee, not a person."
good,"A lot of standing on one spot which was uncomfortable, but I made it work. Business was slow but I learned to keep myself busy. As a cashier I could run different stations i.e., garden centre, self checkout, lumber yard, or main cashiers."
good,"Good to work with homedepot."
good,"I indeed enjoy the customer service part of my job, the learning system at the store was very helpful for me and my future."
good,"My job consisted of kitchen cabinet and countertop sales along with selling whole kitchens to include Home Depot installation."
good,"It is always good to have work close to house, and easy work Customer Service is a fun job, interacting with customers and solving their issues relevant to their project."
good,Very friendly environment to work and nice employees. The layout of the store is great for walking around and finding work like moving carts or going to the outside section to move plants.
good,"Busy, build regular customer relationships, competitive, hours great for certain positions, most enjoyable part is working with customers. Wide variety of ethnic backgrounds, for the most part polite and pleasant."
good,"I enjoyed my job working for home depot in Columbus, and if I did not have to move I never would have left. The atmosphere was very quick paced and friendly."
good,A typical day as a cashier is to stand at a cash register interacted with customers while assist them in the check out. I learned a lot in my position about the hardware department.
good,Working at The Home Depot provided me with valuable customer service skills and my mechanical skills by allowing me to learn and grow in my position as well as helped build my work ethic
good,LOVE my coworkers and management isn’t too bad either! They act more like coworkers than management and i like that a lot. It is hard work a lot of the time but is fun!
good,I worked in freight so I was overnight it wasn't a bad job just had to stay up all night and the pay and working conditions could have better overall a good place to work
good,"Great company to work for with decent benefits, training, employee recognitions and support.       I will definitely consider going back if necessary."
good,"Good place to work, room to move up if you're ambitious, very relaxed, flexible hours, good management, didn't like the hour long break, but enjoyed working there."
good,"You get to meet all sorts of people and learn how to do many new things. If you want to advance in the company, just ask. The opportunity for growth is limitless."
good,"Getting to work everyone greats you like you're family. I've learned a lot about the products and the system and programs they have us use at the Home Depot. Management was okay there are some great assistant managers and some not so great. But the work place really felt like a family treated each other with respect. The hardest part of the job was the customers and dealing with their problems, like any other retail job but a little bit more difficult. The most enjoyable is working with the coworkers."
good,"Working for The Home Depot is both challenging and fun.  I enjoy the team atmosphere however, the advancement possibilities are not what I had hoped they were."
good,"I liked the environment of this place. The only problem was that though I worked circles around my coworkers, they still refused to give me more than 27 hours per week."
good,"Reason for separation was due to the local district manager leaving, and grabbing a ""handful"" of team players to go with. Offered better opportunity and salary."
good,"I liked working there because its a fast paced job, always something for you to do, constant customers each day, the customers are regulars so, they're extremely nice."
good,working at the Homedepot is not bad its an alright job just have to deal with the customers and honestly its a lot of work but the pay isn't very good for all the work at you have to do.
good,The Home Depot offers a lot of room for upward development and provides lots of chances for learning and growth if that's what you want. The culture is fun.
good,"I was required to restock shelves that were low or empty. I would also help other employees when I was finished with my own work or there was no work for me in my area. Some things I learned while working at the Home depot is how to be a team player as well as communication. It is very important to know how to work well with others and communicate, it makes the job easier and also makes it so you can perform your job a lot better. The management that I worked with in New York was very helpful and knowledgeable as well as considerate. The management there was also very good at leading us into tasks and other things that needed to be done. The workplace culture I would say is a very friendly and happy environment to work in. If I was given more hours I would have stayed. I would say the hardest part of my job at the Home Depot is heavy lifting, not getting enough hours. For me the most enjoyable part of the job was working with others and interacting with customers."
good,"One thing I admire about THD is their ability to provide for their associates. They offer flexible hours, with a possibility to bonus twice a year through Success Sharing. They give valuable training I am able to use outside of work, and often provide fun activities to engage their associates. A typical day for me revolves around helping customers with a wide variety of product knowledge, which I am able to do thanks to the training and help of management through THD."
good,"The only negative part about working for The Home Depot is the fact that they were completely understaffed, which sometimes will upset customers because they will have to wait longer period of times before they were helped."
good,"I have had a wonderful experience with both my fellow staff and management in my time with Home Depot. It has been a highly positive and inclusive environment. As a trans-woman, I was a little hesitant in working in such an environment, but the staff and management have been remarkable. I have worked in two separate store and found that this atmosphere is consistent throughout the company."
good,"The Home Depot is director client for me and I have enjoyed my career and built my skills. This is my first company worked under Agile system, its quite interesting. The management is so kindful and they will help whenever you in need."
good,"Really enjoyed this job, the staff were friendly and the work was meaningful."
good,"Work load wasn't too bad, most of my coworkers were great, fun people. I learned how to keep a department running smoothly, how to search for products and use the store systems to correct inventory discrepancies. My favorite part was probably working on projects with my supervisor that got my creativity going, such as creating displays for new products."
good,"I worked in the lawn and garden department...which included plant care, forklift, hi-lo operator, cashier, inventory....helped set up promotional displays...customer service."
good,I enjoyed working here because the environment was different then most retail jobs. The customers were great and the employees even better. Management was always changing as were the policies. Other then that it was a great place to work.
good,Home depot was a great place to work. Everyone likes everyone.  It was a great environment and steady job. The hours jumped all over and the pay could've been assessed more. But great place to work.
good,"By the time I worked there the teams had more than one store assigned, which made the job non-typical and the change of scenery made it a clean slate every day. Since we worked in specific teams it became a family at work. The benefits were great."
good,"When I started with the Home Depot the original owners were still in charge, the stock prices were great and there seemed to be lots of room for advancement. But then they hired a new CEO who in my opinion took the company down hill and made it no longer a fun place to work. The whole atmosphere seemed to be different and it became just a job."
good,"WOrk is busy.  you will be understaffed, underpaid, and likely unappreciated unless you win the popularity contest.  So, why do I like it?  Because my job, MET specifically, allows me to work full time, be able to go to school full time, and raise my family. They also do have good opportunities for advancement."
good,"I started as a part time seasonal in the garden department. I was mostly watering plants and loading merchandise. The heat and sun were very punishing. My time as a cashier was spent processing purchases and returns. As a head cashier I managed the cashiers, the tills, and also manned a register."
good,"working at the home depot throw the years, was an great experience."
good,Productive and well managed by the manager in Holly Springs.  Good ethics and well-engaged with his employees.  A great store to shop at.  Kept clean and stocked.
good,"Good benefits, chill job! I really like working here, there are a lot of opportunities to grow here! I worked here as a cashier and at the service desk!"
good,Good place to work for. good benefits they will fit you for the  best position .like any job there will things like one does not like but over all a good place to work.
good,work was fun i learned a lot the managers were all really supportive i didnt like working till 11pm then having to come back in the next morning and every weekend
good,Employees really care about each other and for the most part work together to accomplish the same goal. All about customer service and putting people first.
good,"Good company, big, its a well built company it does have its flaws in culture at times. but like many big companies you become a number and really start to not mean much in the grand scheme of the company even on a local level. Good fundamentals and values on the culture side but local in store politics gets in the way of true team cohesion."
good,"Each day starts very early. Professionals, contractors, home owners, and regular every day people coming and going in and out of the place. Being able to assist in all aspects of home improvement."
good,"Good company to work for just for the benefits for part time and full time.  vacation was great for my first year there and sick time as well. If you want to start off with a good company, this is a great way!"
good,Lots of different races. Works well around school schedules. Always show how they appreciate their employees no matter how big or small it is.Somewhat hard to get move to different departments but is a great job an place to work
good,"Theres very little advancement potential unless you really suck up. Hours are random and based on when they need you, and there is hardley any consistency. The people there are really great to work with cause you're all in the same boat. Overall it's just kindve a job till you find another job."
good,amazing management. really takes good care of all employees as well as customers and no one feels left out. they also make sure all workers feel appreciated.
good,"Extremely good first job to have. However this isn't a long term job, very little room for advancement, would recommend keeping this job until you find your forever career."
good,The company is willing to bend over backwards to help customers have the best possible shopping experience. The work place culture is one where they go out of their way to help their associates.
good,"Loved the company and the culture but the HR and DM's were a good old boy network that rail road you, Bunch of lying backstabbing good old boys. "
good,Great place to work. Customers are all different types of people. co-workers are all different as well. You learn how to put customers first here. It's a great working environment
good,"Utilized diligent attention to detail in setting up, stocking, and displaying merchandise for easier customer access. Followed precise directions and diagrams in the set up and display of merchandise for exact product placement. Worked independatly as well as part of a team to accomplich multipule tasks each day."
good,I was fine at Home Depot until I became ill.  My supervisor at the time had no understanding and when I was hospitalized turned me in as a no call no show. I was terminated. I disputed the termination to no avail.
good,My review of Home Depot has always been a positive one I like my job I like my bosses I like my co-workers there's just no real room for advancement and when you do Advanced they only give you a $0.25 raise I'm looking to change my career somewhere where I can grow and learn and become a better person and become a great leader and team player
good,you can get a lot of knowledge about thousands of different things an different ways to do your own projects i never had any issues working there although you do have to work your way up in pay an advancement
good,"I enjoyed my time, but needed better advancement as a single mom and needed to make more money. Income was not enough to support 3 kids as a single mother"
good,"Typical work day started after school in the cool of the evening while people were getting off work and in somewhat of a relaxed mood. Customer service was a must along with management helping along the way. Work culture was great along with the hard working crew, though customer can be hard at time, but we can all be that way at times."
good,I really enjoyed working there beacuse of most of the coworkers made it fun. i really enjoyed some departments i was just not too into the deptment i was in.
good,I worked with some pretty awesome people and learned quite a bit. Overall I would recommend this company to others. There is lots and lots of room from growth and career development.
good,The customers and coworkers and more than friendly and polite by all means. Management listens to you and are more than happy to work with you and your schedule especially if you are a student.
good,"I worked the overnight shift, so we would stock the store for the next day. I learned great team work with everyone on the night crew. We all worked together so there was no real pressure."
good,"I maintained all networking equipment at the Dc."
good,Great company. Benefits are great. The pay is not that great unless you are a salary manager. As a supervisor you are expected to do a lot for only a few dollars over a regular associate.
good,I worked at the customer service I was the back up of HR I loved working there the speed the always being busy taking care of customers whether is was answering phones checking out customers making orders helping customers find products always had something to do. I loved what I did at home depot knew a lot not only customer service but as well as mixing paint millworks appliances department  the blinds. I was an all around employee that could act as a manger
good,"Some stores consider the people they work with to be family. My original store did. When I started it wasn't bad, but transferring to other stores was just...it turned into my downfall with the company. The hardest part of the job, like any big-box hardware store, is standing or walking all day on concrete floor. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with a serious health condition of the feet or legs."
good,"Home Depot is a great employer. At my store, the management team is pretty understanding and flexible to your needs, and listens to any issues with earnest and tries to solve them. I have worked there for 3 years now, and have done a variety of jobs since I was hired. Advancement, however, is limited to the advancement or departure of those already in higher positions, which is scarce... and a surprise. "
good,"I worked in paint, garden, hardware and scheduling. Excellent training. Loved my co-workers and supervisors and the customers and contractors I worked with every day.  The inability to work full time was the only drawback."
good,Only full time associates received a set schedule. And no over time. Pay isnt very good either when first starting. The employees are what made everything worth while though.
good,"Excellent culture with a great commitment to diversity. Sometime can get to far in to the ""old buddy system"" but overall great opportunity for career advancement."
good,"The company is heavily SOP oriented, this sometimes makes it a self defeating system where too much pressure is put in one area of the store departments. How ever the pay is exceptional, and the people that work there make it a great environment. "
good,"Overall, i loved the place, i have learned so many things so far. i have made a lot of friends there and i have a very good relationship with everyone. we start the day by making sure that the place is ready for customers to shop. we are always busy which is fun most of the time.  the great thing is that after a while customers start remembering our names and sometimes they ask for us by the name when they need help which stimulates us to work harder. i love the managers at homedepot, they never give us the feelings that they are above us at all."
good,I would get there on nights and have a group meeting with associates. Get our assignment and handle everything that I'm assigned. It would be crowed so we had to work smart and safe. I learned to value people inquiry and the job values. My team plus the management always came together and made the work day lighter and easy. I enjoyed putting smiles on peoples face when you help them solve their questions.
good,"Home Depot as a whole is a great company. Its very diverse, and a great place to learn in a home improvement setting. I went in with no experience at all and now i feel like i have the knowledge and tools to build my own home. Just Kidding! But overall i feel the THD is a great company to work for and anyone that is willing to try,  you definitely should."
good,Travail dans une ambiance très agréable. Supervision d'une équipe performante .Excellente collaboration avec les membres de la direction.
good,"It's a decent job if you actually work and do your job. It's inconsistent as far as busy or not, but that's just retail. For my specific store we have a good management team that is productive and fair to their employees. There's some great people to be met and I'm grateful for everyone I have met there. The hardest part is having patience for customers but in the end, it's the few customers with a sense of humor and humanity that also make them the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Es una compañía estable en el mercado, pero actualmente prefieren pagar muy poco asi como los aumentos anuales, prefieren los tiempo parciales para no pagar todos los beneficios."
good,I love working at home depot if they get more full time and raise wages! The people are great and it's a safe working environment to work in and there's always team work involved!
good,"My work day started very busy, handling the freight, checking it in and sorting it for the night crew when they came in. It gave me responsibility of being able to work by myself. The hardest part of the job was making sure there was enough working space for all the freight nightly. I enjoyed working with the crew that came in to put the freight away and learning how to receive deliveries"
good,"Great place to work...if you don't mind being complacent"
good,"Loved the people and the place was amazing. Couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with. Made life there just a little better. Could use some work in the managment and the push for getting credit cards was high ,but other than that it was good."
good,It is a great place to start you beginning. If you work hard and have good attendance you will move up. There are so many opportunities for advancement you just need a proper blueprint to get there.
good,"They worked with my school hours as best as they good. The staff was friendly and helpful, but towards the end of my term drama started to brew between coworkers. They also started to work with my schooling less and less. Overall, this was a good college job to hold."
good,"Home Depot is a fair place to work. Compensation is the only thing that I feel that was not up to par for the responsibilities and performance. Typical day included driving and operation of all equipment, forklifts, order picker, electric pallet jack, loading and unloading trucks, stocking overheads and packing down shelves. "
good,"Home Depot was/is a great place to work at and for, I worked at their Rapid Distribution Center in Houston, Texas as a warehouse associate/forklift operator where I was responsible for loading merchandise of all sorts excluding lumber into truck trailers with the goal of either maxing the trailer weight of 42,500 pounds if possible or cubing the trailer out with a volume of 2850 if possible. A typical day involved me being responsible for safely operating a forklift in a very busy warehouse full of numerous traveling forklifts and other types of heavy equipment,as well as other co-workers on feet in close proximity which required any forklift operator to be very careful and attentive to the surroundings so as to prevent any and all work related injuries."
good,"I learned a lot about building materials and things that are used to construct projects. Emphasis on customer service was always beamed on us. Overall its a job for students, or people that want a job for temporary time."
good,"I loved working at The Home Depot, but I was not paid enough for the amount of work and manual labor I was putting out. I would have stayed if they were willing to pay me more. It was a great temporary job, but does not match up with my goals in life."
good,"Home Depot managers bleed orange. It's contagious. You also get 2 bonuses a year if your store does well. The company does have a family first mind set. When you have family issues they work with you and they do really care. The work load is getting heavier, less sales rep on floor so multitasking is a must. Overall great company."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for if you are looking for a first job. The management is laid back but lets you know what to expect from a workplace.
good,"The Home Depot Company － College Point Ny"
good,"Typical day as helping customers as a cashier, front end Supervisor, order writer, Install Manager. I learned a lot about the construction business and the benefit of open communication with peers/colleagues."
good,"Working freight team at Home Depot was a generally relaxed job. Five nights a week, four hours each night, and rarely had to deal with customers since I came in an hour before closing."
good,"Home Depot was great, the atmosphere was just awesome and I still stay in touch with some of the people from there! Managers were ok, assistant managers are the ones who do most of the dirty work. Which makes sense I guess!"
good,estabilidad laboral con muchas opotunidades de crecimiento
good,"i loved the store manager that  was there the entire time i worked there but sadly left when i did. i was a part time employee that worked ""full time"" hours 8 months out of the year and then worked 13-20hrs a week the other 4 months to ""even out"" my time back to a normal ""part time"" employee."
good,one company I did enjoy working for and thought they were fair. The management team supported their supervisors. the company have good core values. I like the insurances they provide for the associates.
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Home Depot. The management was okay and the workers did their work. No one seemed to go above and beyond, but the company is growing. There are chances to grow if you are willing to put in work, sell merchandise, and create a relationship with the customer."
good,"This was one of the first jobs I ever had working for a big company. The overall experience was outstanding.  I learned so much as a young man in my early 20s involving customer service, and had such big responsibilities for someone my age."
good,This was by far the easiest job to come across and everyone was nice and friendly. you were trained and they helped all the way you also shadowed someone until you felt comfortable.
good,"Sometimes working as a cashier, loved the clientel, get to meet very different people everyday. Sometimes you work outside in the garden area with all of the different types of plants and people"
good,"Very good company to work for with good supervisors, work environment.  Great training, good interaction with fellow employees, friendly place to work."
good,I learned the most from this job and when you work hard advancement is gaureented however there was a lot of favoritism and drama through out the store
good,"i like working there but honestly the hours were to much for me i didnt like working over night "
good,I am very Productive and Flexible. Willing to extend my arms and hours for my job. Doing job well and love my job. I promise to be more effective and efficient in every task given to me.
good,I've currently been employed with the Home Depot for almost two years. It has been a great company but career wise I'm currently at a standstill with the company.
good,"The company strongly focuses and strives on providing the best customer service. Some key skills to have would be interpersonal, time management, and organizational."
good,The Home Depot can be a great place to work. Everyone is friendly. There just needs to be more associates for the night time. The night time starts to get busy just as much as the day time! There needs to be at least two closing associates at all time because it can be difficult when there is only one closing associate.
good,Worked for Home Depot for 23 years mainly at the corporate office for high level management (VP level).  I enjoyed my career with them but didn't like the layoff at age 63.
good,The associates and customers are pretty fun to be around. Can be stressful at times but it's worth it. Management could use some work but the people you work with make things better than it could be.
good,"pretty good place to work, they work with you and they help work with you. fast paced but kept you busy. everyone works together in there enviroment. would go back if i needed to."
good,"Um local civilizado onde cada um faz a sua função sem criticar ninguém , sem problemas , e principalmente com bastante organização !"
good,During the time of my work experience I gained much knowledge on each department in the store pertaining to household building and improvement materials.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot.  I was promoted 3 times in as many years.  My last job- that of a Service Desk Supervisor- was my favorite.  I was responsible for technical sales and installation contracts, and the staff who implemented them.  I enjoyed the daily interaction with the customers."
good,I enjoy working with my customers.  There are a lot of regulars.  I enjoy working with my associates.  We help each other out a lot.  Management is always there when you have a question or need to talk.
good,"Self Management, Time Management, Shrink, How to rally associates but still have a fun and safe work environment, associate performances and reviews.."
good,"the managers are pretty good, but the hours are crazy. I was there while i was going to school, but if are looking for something to stay, then you need to think twice."
good,Working at the home depot is fast paced most of the time. Occasionally you have lulls of nothing to do but its rare. Communication is a problem like in most other jobs. For me getting to move up or out was almost imposssilbe. For others it was much easier.
good,"Since they were the first to hire me without any experience, I respect them for that. I didn't know what to expect going into it, but I feel that it was a great 1st job."
good,"Customers came first to mostly all priorities, stock shelves, organize shelves, try to make sales of items, provide information for the customers on many of the items that they're looking for. help your fellow associates. all around provide great customer service."
good,"It is hard work and you may feel underappreciated. Management makes efforts to provide rewards and benefits. Frustrations with this job are the same you'd experience with any retail job. The difference is Home Depot offers career advancement tools that will help you move up the company ladder or take with you as you pursue other careers. This Job is what you make of it,"
good,"awesome job,and good pay for that job .However not much chance to advance for me it seemed anyway .Nice people and the training was made very easy to understand ."
good,I loved working for the company. This company has love for the community and does a not of charity work. They even help their workers in time of need. The only thing is when there is a new manager they start to have favoritism and start bring employees from there old store
good,"Good job, fast paced. managers are good, expect alot from you. Equal opportunity work well with you if you have another job or have to go to school.very good place to work"
good,"working for home depot isn't too bad, they give you your schedule up to a month in advance which helps you kinda be able to plan out thinks you need to take care of or if you're going to school they'll work with your class schedule"
good,"I was a professional salaried employees often worked beyond 40 hour workweeks in the distribution centers, but the work was fun and the employees were great.  The company does well in creating a good equitable place to work."
good,"Have built extensive relationships with dozens of local vendors and sub-contractors. Work gets repetitive very quickly. Groiwing too fast, lack of proper support."
good,I liked working at the fast pace. There were times that it was nice and easy. Great working with costumers. The associates were nice and friendly. It's a great place to work.
good,"Great benefits, u never feel secure in your job. Any random complaint from a customer can cost you your job...just like that! Other than that, I loved doing my job there. Very price competitive."
good,"Great place to learn all you can. Just like most retail, not enough time. We all work hard but not enough qualified people available to cover all of our customers effectively."
good,It was a fun place to work fast paced so I stayed on my toes. But it was hard enough that i kept learning new things that made me into a better employee.
good,Great place to work advancement opportunities people are friendly there willing to work with u on shift only issue is very hard to obtain full time employment
good,"great customer service, they offer alot of great benefits to the employees. The company even takes care of the employees families if an emergency arises.  Ran fairly"
good,"I started as a cashier and it was dreadful, but only because I enjoy a fast-paced environment where I'm constantly working. Joining MET was amazing and the team was like my family. When I moved, I opted not to transfer because the other teams just couldn't match up to the one at store 2203."
good,Home depot is a good place to work at. The managers are really nice and HR is very easy to talk to as well and very flexible with availability and booking days off.
good,"In my department we all know how to preform the functions of the department manager and the department manager is open to all criticism and is very adept at handling strenuous as well as down time.  In fact, out department has received the greatest compliments for its efficiency and cross knowledge among subordinates as well as department head.  We all share a very familial air."
good,"Honestly not that bad, the starting out salary is $11 an hour but pay raises are once you hit a year but even then it's only a few cents. If you're not full time and it's out of the main season hours are hard to come by so a second job is necessary"
good,"Amp up the customer appreciation."
good,A typical day at home depot is really exciting but also tasking.. I learnt how to prioritise things working for homedepot as well as customer satisfaction
good,Learned lots from the diverse range of employees working there. Managment makes every employee feeled valued and gives them the tools and power to succeed.
good,"Home depot has been a great part time job. I have learned a lot about sales, and have added some skills to my over all portfolio I would have not have had otherwise."
good,The benefits are wonderful a great place for advancement friendly co-workers the best company I've worked for yet the really think about their employees
good,Great company to begin career with. Will learn a variety of skills and deal with varied customer service and logistical issues that will guide individuals to develop proficiency in excelling with these areas.
good,The only issue I had with the company was the hrs. They do not give you a lot of hrs on how much you work.evwn if you work hard you still can't get the hrs that can pay for the bills at home only half of it.
good,great place to work good open door policy great incentives free lunches friendly work atmosphere enough employees on shift to cover the mount of work that needs done
good,This job was so many years ago! I honestly don't remember all the details.......but I think I had a really good experience. My 1st supervisor was a little overbearing at times! Which was super annoying! We talked & after that she was fine
good,At Home Depot I worked as a garden associate. Typically I would assist customers with general gardening needs as well as lifting mulch/soil and helping load cars for customers.
good,"I had a great time working with all sorts of people in a team, as well as assisting customers. I learned a lot and was glad to help teach others when it was applicable."
good,Real cool place to work.  everything  was hands on .a lot of walking. But you learn a lot if you work there long enough. Great job to work in the summer not winter
good,"They provide decent benefits for part time employees"
good,"This company is nice to work for. It can be demanding during the holidays, but overall its a nice company to work for. the hours aren't bad, and the people that you work with are very knowledgeable and helpful. Also your hard work doesn't go unnoticed."
good,"we assist customers in the store, supervise associates, culture is positive at our store, hardest part is the schedule that can be any hours, any days, a typical day consists of helping anyone in the store with whatever their needs are...."
good,Favorable environment Associates are very supportive and helpful especially to a newcomer to great place to work. Home Depot's atmosphere attitude  and standards if I'd carried opportunities for advancement for mushrooms in success in a short time what is Home Depot Bean a great place to work for with great benefits and a chrome for opportunities to advance in the company without discrimination .
good,"Decent place, many coworkers often skipped shifts leaving the blunt of the work on your shoulders. Decent pay, and coworkers who did attend were very friendly and helpful"
good,a strict work place with a lot to do to keep you busy the shifts usually go buy pretty quickly at the service desk but extremly stressful when your left on your own
good,I worked with Home Depot Interiors to generate leads. Great pay and balance of work and life. There is not a lot of room for advancement. This is a great job for someone who has a salesperson personality.
good,"It's your typical freight job."
good,"Go around the store and straighten out the shelves, dust displays, fill outs, adjust pricing and set up seasonal displays. The job is very straight forward and the company is extremely safety conscious."
good,"A good work environment, which help built my discipline with hours of rigorous lifting. Would recommend it to anyone. Great benefits, breaks and people."
good,Working at The Home Depot really helped me to succeed in many areas. This job opened up many job opportunities within the store for me. The scheduling and management was awesome and really helped me not only excel in my job there but also outside of work  with college.
good,"Our Job Was To Clean all bays (shelves) to be appealing to customers. Restocked shelves, Changed signs & Price tags if Necessary. Being At Walmart Makes Me Miss Home Depot. The Environment was Better."
good,Great place to learn about every department. Advancement is definitely possible for anyone if they apply themselves and maintain a positive attitude. Benefits are not bad if you are full-time.
good,"i gained alot of confidence at home depot since i work with people from various backgrounds and the management is great. what your told during orientation is how you get it, many companies say somethings but never deliver BUT with Home Depot i was impressed."
good,"The health plan benefit was very good I will not fine its kind anywhere.Duties: Meet, Greet and assist customer in finding product, answer their selection questions and assist with loading where necessary, keep aisles clear and clean. And operate forklift and other lifting equipment."
good,"It was nice working here when I did. Environment was nice. People and management were nice. Pay wasn't the best, but you can move up if given the chance. I left because I wanted to make more money, and had an opportunity to."
good,My location had a great friendly work environment. Promotions are available but you must let your intentions be known. Semi annual bonuses and party of store makes quota.
good,"working as part of a rewarding team environment, with a good boss, and being productive was all part of the job at Home Depot. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and always felt like I had accomplished a lot at the end of the day."
good,"This is a fast-paced, high-tech startup that HD acquired. Overall, great culture. The only negative things I have to say are regarding management. They seem more set on being placed on a pedestal than helping their team's grow in their career. I would still recommend this tech shop, as their capital investment in infrastructure enables you to self-develop in world-class technology. Driving all the way up to Vancouver was a bit of a bummer, but overall thumbs up."
good,good company unfortunately some managers run the stores not aligned with company morals and goals. overall a great company to work for. manager bonuses are great
good,"Home depot, on a day to day basic is fun and managed properly to a certain extent. Some parts of the job do not make you feel welcomed in the workplace."
good,"This was a decent job while I was there, the pay was alright.  They definitely pay men more, though women do just as much work.  There's always something to do, carts to be pushed, junk to be schlepped.  It's retail, take it with a grain of salt."
good,Can be difficult to get promoted unless you have Process Management Skillsets combined with an IE degree. Seems you have a certain window of opportunity to get promoted before you seem to feel pigeon-holed.
good,"I did not care for the irregular hours, pay and training could have been better, but had the best work family ever!! Management was phenomenal!"
good,"My manager was instrumental in my completing my contract.  HD, overal, can be a difficult work environment.  My manager blocked much of the red tape, allowing me to do my job."
good,I was on a temp assignment so the job was short lived but i really enjoyed the fast pace and the training was great. loved the shifts that were offered and i was made to feel at home.
good,"At Home Depot we have cook outs every Saturday morning for employees and customers for free. We also do raffle tickets to get a chance to win prices such as king island tickets, zoo passes and etc."
good,"Very nice customer friendly environment, with a lot of people that are willing to help customers and associates as well with whatever is needed. The moral of the store is awesome and welcoming and the job is very flexible with my daily schedule. Being off on the weekends is the best!"
good,"The work here is very relaxed. You get to work at your own pace, although there is a minimum to be met. There are a lot of friendly people that work here, most everyone is willing to help another out."
good,"fast paced environment, lots of cross training opportunities, great company in solid industry with lots of growth potential. good benefits available for familes, no employee discount"
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds and credits due to customers. Answer customer's questions, and provide information on procedures and policies. Sell tickets and other items to customers. Process merchandise returns and exchanges."
good,Loved everything about Home Depor. I regret leaving there. They are good to the customers and employees and you get great benefits. It's an amazing place.
good,"Customer service #1."
good,Good Place Great Enviorment Alot Of Benefits supervisors are coming and going it is cut throat when it comes to leadership roles but they do feed you alot and let you know whats going on buisness wise
good,"It's a fast paced but the day goes by.  Management is on your side.  You have a problem, they correct it.  No lagging on their part.  They offer a lot of benefits to their employees."
good,Its a good place to work. Everyone there is helpful. The benefits are good. The hardest thing about working in the warehouse is the heat. I learned not to trust grace periods.
good,"I absolutely love this company. A lot of changes in the past 5 years that have changed the culture. I love helping people solve their problems both professionally, as a home owner."
good,"I got this job when I needed it the most...the pay was good and my team was truly dedicated to providing top customer service and products..I was way too young to appreciate this job when I had it and got fired lol but if I could go back I would they offered advancement opportunities, benefits, and bonuses. No company is perfect but home Depot is one of the best out there to work for. I worked there in 2008-09 so some things have changed no doubt"
good,"I have been working with the Home Depot since 2/11/2016, in this time I have gained a great deal of experience working with the public which is interesting and I find enjoyable. I feel the hardest part of my job is having a schedule which can change as turnover rates vary within the workplace. My current employer (Home Depot) is a very diverse workplace as I work next to the most amazing people whose backgrounds range from being retired, to long time career Home Depot employees. The management at Home Depot is good, there seems to be a great deal of change that happens in management but they manage to stay consistant with their rules and policies."
good,"Merchandise and reset merchandise according to planogram,seasonal layouts working as a team. Follow instructions for each project and waork in and maintain a safe enviroment."
good,"Home Depot provided me with a position that allowed me to grow my leadership skills.  As processing coordinator, I was my supervisors right hand man.  I was relied upon to delegate work orders, run hourly reports, and report the findings hourly to my supervisor, and operations manager.  The supervisor and myself would build game plans in order to keep production at an optimal level, as well build game plans to gain production if our team was falling behind."
good,"It is a very good place to work for when you are growing as a person. You learn a lot about yourself and what you are willing to take from your job, customers, management, and just the people around you. Management try there best to be fair and equal to everyone. The culture is a caring environment. Where you don't have to be afraid to ask for help. I think the hardest part of the job is making sure everyone gets what they need out of this job and the most enjoyable part is the different people you get to meet and help out throughout the days and years."
good,Good company to work for. The people are great and the environment is comfortable. I am very happy with this organization. There is room for upward mobility and help always available.
good,"Its a great place to work if you're there to work, do your job and they wont fire you, don't do your job and you won't have to worry about losing it, because you won't have one to lose. There really isn't anything bad to say about working here, everyone is generally very nice and teamwork is a must. If you're a lone wolf, this probably isn't the job for you."
good,"The culture of Home Depot is great, friendly hard working employees who really care about the customer. Hardest part was having to work out in the freezing cold or extreme heat."
good,Learned a lot about home improvement projects and some do's and don'ts on how to fix things. The kids clinics were fun and the hours were fairly flexible.
good,"It was a good part time job. the management was amazing and very accepting of whoever you are. As a Transman I have a hard time telling employers my preferred pronouns, but everyone was so cool about it."
good,I worked at a Lumber Distribution for Home Depot and it was a great experience. I learned how to lift heavy lumber an I learned how to get my daily job done with good team work. Team work makes the dream work. Management is very professional over there. Home depot is a very clean place to work they take good care of there warehouse. The hardest part of my job was working in the winters when the lumber would freeze together and become very slippery while off loading them. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the truck drivers happy with the production we did wether it was loading them quickly or off loading them quickly.
good,Home depot is not the best pay range but if you ever want a job that will work with you they are your first pick. Home depot is on of the very few companys I have seen who care about their employees the help their people if the fall behind on bills if there is an emergency going on at home they work with you to get you where you need to be they are fair. Most of the customer are repeat customers so before long you all know each other by name its very rare to get a foul customer but when you do management will back you up and if need be will escort the customer out of the store cant recommend them enough.
good,"The things to do can change throughout the day whether its opening or closing the store. It's slow in the mornings and in the afternoon.  It does get very busy around noon.  Trying to clean and maintain the front parking lot can get hectic especially if there is no other employee helping out.  Taking a break sometimes not an option as it gets very hectic afterwards.  Most of the time is spent in the lot, garden area and lumber area.  Managers would check up on the employees and see how well one is doing.  Overall it is a fast paced environment if working as a Lot Associate. Wasn't really stressful."
good,"This job was a great introduction to sales and how a sales team works. A typical day would be receiving leads from the local sales office, and route plan your day of typically 3 potential customers. I would then drive to my first lead, compellingly present to the customer the advantages of our product, quote the customer and press for a ""yes"". After each meeting I would call in the results for the visit."
good,Pretty fast paced environment. Atmosphere is great though. Everyone is friendly in my store. Family-like atmosphere. Keeps you busy. Be prepared to sweat though. Hard work is a must
good,Great place great people. the job i did we didn't see much of each other we saw mostly client but we were always available by phone if we needed anything or to work around any issues we had in our personal lives.
good,I love to help people and I enjoyed working there. There are plenty of professional courses to take and I learned a lot. I have good memories from that time.
good,Great learning curve in retail sector with amazing customers. Good vibe in getting to know first hand what customer expects and how can we deliver best service and product.
good,"The work hours take some getting use to, but overall a great company. Gained a lot of experience with order picking equipment. Management was great and the work environment was one of the best i have ever experienced."
good,"A very good place to start off your working career. "
good,"Very fast paced job, you're constantly on your feet working with customers to get them in and out of the store and provide them what they need. The Home Depot really tries to get each coworker to truly work with each other no matter what department you are in. Although the hours are long, the breaks are good as well as the pay."
good,Great people work at home depot.  I have nothing bad to say about the place other than they should invest in their employees a bit more.  There is a lot of employee turnaround due to the low pay and hours management.  Working retail is not easy with the amount of customers that come through the doors there.
good,Had good work experience. Got along with coworkers and management. They did little things like bought you lunch sometime. Got a bonus check every year...
good,"The Home Depot has excellent training programs. Much of the training is on a computer, but the material used is outstanding. The company treats employees like a member of the family. Where I worked, managers provided picnic style meals on several holidays."
good,"Muy buena empresa, socialmente responsable con buenas prestaciones,"
good,"Great place to work, with understanding supervisors and having Holidays off. No work on Sunday for Freight and Unloading teams."
good,"Hi, I was a cashier at Home Depot for over a year and for the most part it was a lay back, quiet, and sometimes very slow paced job. Occasionally,customers can be angry and rude especially during busy times and the only thing you can do is to remain calm and smile, which is what I mastered! The management was extremely nice but it was impossible to complete a full shift without being spend home earlier than expected, it happen nearly everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was changing prices, organizing the merchandise, stocking shelves and dealing with customers. I learned that you have to be open minded about a job."
good,Es muy buen trabajo puedes aprendes bastante de como hacer tu mismo las cosas en tu hogar
good,"I worked at Home Depot throughout most of my college career. They do offer great benefits, but pay their employees poorly. Management could be chosen more carefully."
good,"like every job it has its problems, but overall it is a good job to have and gives you a great experience. The company hires people of all ages that have a good work ethic and are easy to get along with"
good,"Not a bad place to start working, the company presents the opportunity to learn how to operate heavy machinery which you may have to assist with on a day to day basis"
good,I loved the job as a part-time.  It was a great work environment and hours.  Would definetely work there again.  Management was a pleasure to work for also.
good,Great place to work. I loved working with the public and resolving their problems. I loved the employees I worked with. Most of the management was great.
good,A regular day is full of on your feet work that involve a lot of twisting and turning. Management is fair about time off if need and occasionally will say yes. People that work there are nice well firm people that will help if you need it.
good,"Home Depot was an awesome place to work at because you were working with people who wanted to make every customer happy while shopping in the store. While I worked there I did not have any issues with anyone because everyone knew that home depot was a pretty good place to work at. There was no room for negativity because the management was caring and they helped solve any issue an employee might have."
good,"As a GWA at home depot, you can expect job stability. However, they have high expectations of productivity every day despite being low on freight. The pay is...well...decent, I suppose. There are other warehouses nearby that pay more."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced but with the great people there it makes the work seem very balanced.  great pay, great benefits.  I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"A good place to work. Great leadership, culture and inclusive environment. Leader in the field of home improvement. Room for growth, decent benefits. Can be very difficult to maintain a work / life  balance especially in 'season'."
good,A typical day at work started off with watering the plants and then stocking shelves and then ultimately helping out customers. i had good supervisors who cared about their jobs and their department. i learned how to deal with very irate customers. The hardest part of the job was probably packing down shelves while helping two to three customers at a time.
good,"Constant interacting with customers throughout the electrical and lighting departments.  Listening to customers needs and advising when appropriate.  "
good,the most enjoyable part of this job is working with the customers. Management in the store I'm at is decent the staff is great people to work with.The hardest part about this job would be learning all different departments
good,"Early morning and late in the evening were times to power stock. From 10 AM to 7 PM was mostly customer time, but more stocking if it was slow.  The management knew I had worked at The Home Depot before, and quickly learned that I knew the job well enough that they didn't have to stand over my shoulder. Was told a few times that I work too hard and needed to pace myself.  My favorite part of the job was taking care of the customers and building a professional relationship with them. and also having them return in the future looking for my assistance."
good,I was a stocker for Home Depot during the night but also worked in other departments. It was a relaxed place to work and it expanded my knowledge of home improvement.
good,Home depot is an enjoyable and satisfying work environment. Home depot is a job for between jobs. Pays well for the work load which is more labor intensive.
good,"Good work environment with positive management support. There are good opportunities for advancement, however, compensation is low. There is good job training available."
good,"GREAT COMPANY! LOVE WHAT THEY STAND FOR!!! Great PAY and benefits!!! Management had it's good and bad apples, but that is to be expected with any company!!"
good,Fun place to work and even got to go to the client's house and take measurements. Coworkers and upper management were both understanding and helpful. But upper management stopped the ability to go to the client's houses and job became both boring and mundane.
good,Take care of their people and do what it takes to make it a fun and enjoyable work environment.  I enjoy the leadership and their approach to working with the Associates.   They strive to exemplify the values in their decisions and actions.
good,was a solid job in my mid 20s. Management isn't the greatest and you rarely see great raises there but the benefits and 401k are all positives from working here.
good,"I worked in the Lumber and Building Materials department here. I learned a ton about working in a warehouse, helping customers, shipping and receiving, power tools, and most importantly forklifts. I drove several different types of forklifts here. The types I drove included..."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work with great bennefits. Home Depot is involved with the community through team depot. Home Depot has a Homer fund to help associates in need and through the team depot home Depot helps veterans and schools etc.
good,"Home Depot is a company that really values their employees and treats them accordingly. "
good,"the hardest part of the job was staying woke while working. a typical day at work would be, I clock in and then I go see my manager for the night. depending on if we have a truck with freight, I'll unload the truck. I out the freight onto carts so that I can pull them onto the sales floor and put them on the shelves."
good,It is a good part time job for someone in college or in need of a second job. I had a great time working for the company and would consider going back
good,"Typical day at work was easy stress free laid back learned customer service skills from a great management team,awesome workplace culture and awesome people to work with."
good,"Good for a first job or job while in school. Flexible scheduling, room for change to other departments, company cares about employees, benefits, regular raises"
good,Great place to work for great people I was there for 12 years. Learn so much from great people. You enjoyed working with the people at work with the last 12 years
good,My overall experience being employed by The Home Depot is that I found it to be a rewarding opportunity to gain knowledge in several aspects of home improvement and equipment.
good,I loved working for Home Depot. The scheduling could've been better but overall good experience. Management was not as good as it should've been. I learned how to operate machinery safely.
good,The Home Depot is a great first step opportunity for those looking for their first job. The company takes the safety and happiness of their employees seriously and gives them opportunity to work up the ladder.
good,"Every time I come to work, it is always a pleasure to see your friends/coworkers. Having a family like them makes your day much easier and enjoyable and this is my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I have worked at Home depot for over a year and moved from being a sales associate to being an order specialist. The order specialist position has allowed me to use my education of applied science plus has kept me very active physically."
good,"I work in millworks and love it. The people I work with make it easier to work there, customers are alright, although management needs to improve a bit."
good,"I worked with good people who knew about home improvement."
good,"Coming here to Home Depot, it takes time to get to know people (just like anywhere else ) but we have  a nice crew and everyone seems to help each other.  "
good,"The strongest negative is the ""competitive pay"" is not very competitive. They should be paying out more for tenured associates. They have implemented programs to get extra bonuses on the side as well however, it's sometimes pulling teeth for recognition."
good,"most days are either boringly slow or chaotically fast, not much of an in between. For the most part it depends on how many contractors are there and how bad the rain is"
good,For this job u have to be able to move around to get from place to place. Some jobs may be close some further away but still a good job to have. Also give bonuses.
good,There a vast amount of opportunities for an individual to learn as well as many positions to obtain. Fast pace work great for keeping body fit. Multiple schedules so you can work both night or day.
good,If I was given another opportunity here I wouldn't hesitate to accept because the job is so easy. It's really how you make it and there are so many advancement opportunities given for the employee.
good,I started out as freight pack out associate. Then i progressed to Flooring Specialist and i love working with home depot. I have learned more about flooring that i thought i would ever learn.
good,"The compensation at this company was low but I did enjoy the job and going to work for Home Depot.  I was a merchandiser, not a regular retail representative.  On my team I worked closely with a team of 7 to 8 people and we all got a long great and we did all enjoy going to work as we were able to have fun working together and the best at getting our jobs done."
good,"Working for a big box retailer as a manager is a hard, fast pace multi-tasking endeavor only for the extremely organized, experienced, steadfast, thick-skinned leader and skipper."
good,good managment in the stores with diversity of associates. great place for old and young. other financial assistances available. help you in growing up if you are willing to.
good,Very buttoned up company. Quick and efficient service to many customers. Follows all safety regulations and does it in a quick manner. Great company to work for due to internal opportunity to rise up.
good,I shouldn't have quit this job. I was younger and dumber then. I thought I could find greener pastures but I was making good money and I was in position to go to high places. I screwed this up and walked out and regret it to this day.
good,"Home Depot Distribution Center is a great place to work.  Great people and great atmosphere.  I learned how to operate different equipment such as the stand up forklift, the electric pallet jack, a gladiator and the RF gun.  Management is very attentive and there whenever you need them.  The workplace culture is great everyone is very helpful in all departments and willing to show you whatever you need to know to get your job done correctly.  The hardest part of my job honestly is accepting the pay because in my opinion I feel with all that the employees do including myself we should be compensated a little better than what we are.  The most enjoyable part of my job is operating the equipment and conversing with my coworkers."
good,I held several different technical positions over the 22 years I spent with the Home Depot. Each one was a different and rewarding challenge. I met a lot on great people and loved the culture of this company. Hard work is rewarded very well here!
good,Home Depot has great benefits and will work around someone who is attending school. A typical day was busy until lunch time. Some of the greatest and friendly people work at the Home Depot and It is an enjoyable place to work.
good,"At The Home Depot, there is always more to learn - which appeals to me. Expect to deal with wonderful customers and difficult customers. Both will always be present. The thing I have probably has the most difficulty with, however, is the Specialist Activity Report - an overview of each specialist's (special order) sales, leads, measures, percentages, etc., etc. The issue I have is with the fact that THD tracks these types of items with each individual and yet, pays no commission. If I am to be held accountable and 'graded' on my results, why is there no commensurate reward/pay? The pressure is there to 'succeed,' but there is no compensation for my efforts."
good,"Good place to work benefits are great and customer was always put first, its different type of programs that this company provides for the associate. the hardest part of the job is not being able to grow as fast in the company."
good,Typical day at work was spent servicing the departments and helping customers. I learned how to interact with all different kinds of people and temperaments. The management was very down to earth and accepting of all associates. The hardest part of the job was the consistent changing of scheduled hours. The most enjoyable part was the ability to self manage.
good,Training was well organized and information. Lots of room to grow. Customer happiness is the goal. Lots of info you can learn and use outside of work.
good,MET Team is the best because you get 40 hours a week and weekends off. A great company to enhance your skills in the retail industry. Expect to not get 40 hours unless you achieve a management position.
good,One of the best companies I have ever worked for. They're able to work with you if you're concerned about your hours period training is always available and so is advancement
good,"A typical day at work is down to 3 basic things, stocking the shelves, helping the customers and driving credit/leads in the store. There is room for advancement, but be warned, oftentimes the reward you get is NOT worth the hassle of becoming a supervisor. More responsibility and metrics to meet, but the pay oftentimes is not there. I am as far I will ever get in the company as a Department Supervisor since being in a rural store means no opportunity for advancement. Metro areas allow for better opportunity. My pay is very good for my position, but I came in back when the stores still had master trade specialists. Plan on starting out around $15-16 an hour as a supervisor, around $12-13 as a regular floor associate. Better money can be had as a kitchen designer or sales specialist (flooring or millwork). Management most times does care about the employees, they are very understanding when it comes to family issues and time off as long as its not abused. Benefits are decent, 401K, stock purchase and some pretty good discounts on cell phone service and other things."
good,"The associates in Home Depot treat you like family, so every day walking into work is comfortable also less stressful when people are there to help and guide you to succeed."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at the Depot. I started as a cashier part time and during that time I completed my Associate Degree in Interior Design and a certificate in Carpentry.  I moved into a new position as a Appliances Sales Associate full time, to a Kitchen & Bath Designer.  On holidays the store cooks for the employees, good co-workers, lots of learning opportunities, managers are usually very nice and easy to talk too."
good,"I did like working at home-depot. There was a lot of friendly co workers made it easy to fit in. The only thing I did not like was the lack of training they gave us before we were considered ""experts"" at our departments."
good,"after actually working a hard labor type of job. working at home depot was easy. walking around helping people find what they need was easy. updating the ads in the store was fun, and sitting in on meetings was interesting. Unfortunately getting to full time was almost imposable and trying to pay bills and raise a family on part time was imposable."
good,Great place to work starting out as part time as there are insurance benefits etc. Gives knowledge in multiple departments and other information which can be related outside of work.
good,"Typical day at work would involve interaction with customers, motivating employees as a Department Supervisor. Keeping the section of the store that I ran clean and easily shop able.  Management was a big help, and would help explain things if there were questions."
good,"Good company to work for. Nice bonus schedule if your store qualifies."
good,Working there you start feeling like you're part of a team and a family. You also gain knowledge about all of the products at the stores. Working your way up from a cashier or lot tech is easy if you've got the drive.
good,It was challenging at the beginning but with time I became accustomed to the demands of the job. It was fun meeting people everyday and everyone was friendly.
good,I am a new employee so I don't have much experience in the ins and outs of the company.  From what I can see the management is very nice and serious about the success of the store.
good,Good company to work for as long as you have a servant leader. Like in any company they have good and bad ones. If you have a good one the place can be absolutely amazing to work for.
good,The training was extensive but very necessary to provide customers with proper information. The typical day was a consistent evolving door of different situations that keeps you on your toes. The pay for the skill level sucked but the people I worked with every day were great and fun to be around for the most part.
good,"very supportive HR and management team, good culture to work in and opportunities for advancement. Great Training, great benefits and good work/life balance! "
good,Trabajo en equipo por objetivos crecimiento laboral personal ayudar al progimo desarrollar una  carrera laboral dentro del mismo supervision de personal de igual manera ayudar al crecimiento de la gente cercana a uno
good,"En un día de trabajo al principio observo si hace falta algo en mi area de trabajo de ser así debo colocar la mercancía o precio faltante. Despues si llegaran clientes se les atiende con amabilidad y cubriendo todas sus expectativas."
good,"Flexible job for those wanting to further their education, especially when management is able to work around your school schedule."
good,"Coworkers and management are very knowledgeable. It was a pleasure being a part of a high efficiency team. Having most employees with cross-department knowledge is incredibly helpful. "
good,"I learned a lot and became a managing supervisor after 8 months of being a part timer. Was given an opportunity to advance into a very complicated and fast paced department. Won awards for top sales verses plan in the district, and many others in a $70 Million Dollar Box"
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy from beginning to end. I have learned a great deal about inventory management, freight flow, working in a warehouse environment and how to manage multiple tasks at one. The management team is not always open to new suggestions, sticking to corporate policies and expectations that do not always make sense. The hardest part about the job is not being able to implement more efficient work practices because they do not line up with the corporate standard operating procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with. I have made many friends while working with this company. The company also offers good benefits packages."
good,"Overall great place to work. Coworkers are friendly and bosses are polite. Many employees stay for many years at the store I work at, so there are not a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working at home depot. I learned a lot in the years spent working there.I learned new skills and was able to work in different areas. Hardest part for me were the hours/scheduling. "
good,"There is a lot to say about this wonderful company and I am grateful for the opportunities given to me. I learned a lot about the retail staffing industry and watched how the leadership took an infant Call Center and turned it into a very productive and successful center.  Over the 6 years that I was a part of the Staffing Team, we hired thousands of  part-time and full time employees.  We were responsible for inbound and outbound calls and successfully received them all and gave the best customer service as we knew how.  A typical day was on the phones from the time we walked in the building until we left, giving the best customer service.  We bled Orange. We live for the service of servicing our customers both internally and externally.  The most enjoyable art of the job for me was employing individuals who had been out of work for some time and who were so grateful for the opportunity to be employed by Home Depot."
good,"There is always something to do, if you put forth effort you are never bored. I have learned a lot about shipping process and how to move thousands of products quickly with care for each individual item. The hardest part of working on the freight team is unloading trucks, the difficulty is a good thing though as the shift flies by. The best part of the job is my coworkers.  Most of them have interesting backgrounds, they are workaholics,  and in general they are good people."
good,"A typical day at work their when I was in the garden department was helping customers with any questions they had about a plant, or landscaping. I had to water the plants, do inventory, and helped restock. The most enjoyable part was that I was always busy, the variety of flowers, trees and learning new things about landscaping."
good,Management team was very productive at my store. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to stop shoplifters and regain those assets that could of potentially been lost. Learned a lot with report writing and dealing with local police in filing charges etc.
good,"Doing my time at Home Depot I had a lot of experience dealing with  customer. Helping customers find items in the store, also educating them our company rules and how to be saved when shopping at Home Depot"
good,"- Clock in, pull orders and assist customers, and ring customers"
good,"I worked with some great people here. I learned a lot, and I did a lot. I think The Depot is a great place to work and grow as a person."
good,I really enjoy working for the Home Depot. I have gained many skills that I will carry with me for life. Working for the Home Depot is a great place to meet a lot of different people such as contractors and everyday do it yourselfers. The Home Depot is big on giving back to the community and Veterans.The work I do for Home Depot is self rewarding.
good,I use to work at Mall 205 for over two years before leaving because I was having issues with them. Then Airport called me when I reapplied and they took me in with open arms and it's a better atmospheres. The people are nice and the management are great.
good,"The hardest part of working here is juggling the multiple responsibilities, on a busy day,  that normally would be done by two or more people. My store is particularly understaffed, however another store in the same city is paid more and fully staffed. this could have to do with sales but if we are required to cover several departments then we should be paid at least equally as employees in a fully staffed store."
good,"Management doesn't run the company correctly in my opinion. I'm just looking for full-time and they aren't willing to give it out easily. Most people are great to work with there but as everywhere, there is a bad apple in the bucket but that doesn't mean they're all rotten."
good,I work at Home Depot for 9 months.About half as a lot associate half as a Bopis. The work was part-time which is why i left. The company was pretty nice to work for. I also left do to the heavy lifting of my job because part time associates don't have full health benefits. Co workers made the place great as the they always helped when i needed it and i would help them a lot too.
good,Home Depot was a good place to work.  Management constantly changed- there was a lot of theft at the time.  Learned a lot as an Inventory Management Associate
good,fun friendly coworkers knowledgeable management. they write the schedule 3 weeks in advance. however they only hire people on as part time to start off.
good,fun place to work. All you have to do is do the job correctly and your managers treat you like family. The only tough part is maybe adjusting to the over night schedule.
good,"At first I really enjoyed this job. I started as a cashier and in less than a year I began working at the Customer Service desk. As the years have gone on, less awards and compensations have been awarded but overall, the company is very flexible with scheduling and has a wonderful environment."
good,Very good Sales opportunity.  Was working full time then went to part time due to employment with National City Mortgage
good,Enjoyed my time employeed there knowing the different department and helping all customers with confidence because of the training programs offered by home depot
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Home Depot I feel as if most employees were treated fairly. I had a lot of regulars that always looked to me for help.I was always bubbly and as helpful as I could be.
good,"Good company to work for if youre a hard worker.  "
good,At the time I was a young man looking for a full time job.  Home Depot was a great place to work.  They honestly cared for their people and showed it everyday.
good,I loved working for and with the people at Home Depot. They have great incentive rewards for meeting sales or getting credit card apps. The Christmas party and prizes were spectacular and they give good raises.
good,The people who work here are really great. The benefits they offer help make up for the relatively low pay. Management is fair and willing to work with associates.
good,"Working alone fulfilling online orders, preparing deliveries for same day or next day while assisting customers with various needs. Time management and setting priorities are key to ensuring job accomplishment. Other employees are eager to help if time allows due to the fact they have their own tasks set out for them. Working indirectly without any supervision or management allows little room to grow or succeed because accomplishments are often unseen or overlooked. Working alone with many daily tasks and 2 person lift jobs is difficult while ensuring customers are put first. I enjoy that I am given such trust and responsibility for performing daily tasks alone even when times are difficult."
good,Getting to work with customers in the lawn and garden area was one of my favorite jobs. Learning how products work and what works best help with giving the correct information to the customers.
good,Learned a lot there.. People are helpful and very curtious. Job is easy and fun..  And great benefits.. Also great work is acknowledged. Customers are great.
good,"I enjoyed my time with The Home Depot. The associates are lovely and my position as Head Cashier was an absolute joy. Management needs a little work but overall, they are ok. The hardest part of working at the store where I was is dealing with the inability of management to backup associates and relay information in a timely fashion. Management isn't always forthcoming or honest. The health, retirement and legal benefits are great. Just don't make more than three mistakes in any given position. There is zero tolerance no matter what.....unless you're in a salaried position then you might catch a break or two."
good,"Main purpose as a cashier was to get the customer checked out as quickly and smoothly as possible. I have learned how to assist customers, gain customer service experience and learned information about the products within the store. Management was supportive and encouraging along with co-workers. Hardest part of the job as a cashier was standing for long hours on the concrete, and being placed in the garden area during the winter. The most enjoyable were working with the people."
good,Great Place to work with a very diverse culture. I learned how to greet customers and a lot of things for many products. Management was pretty good and the co-workers were awesome.
good,Flexible schedules with lots of room to improve and move up. Raises and benefits included if you do well enough. Management is great and you become a family there.
good,"During a typical work day there are many, many opportunities to get to know fellow Associates, follow up on leads and Operations discrepancies, and seek out patrons wishing to take advantage of The Home Depot.  THD is a great place to work and has competitive wages & benefits packages.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep with all the wants & needs of the position.  Between Safety, Operations, and Theft & Fraud there never seemed to be enough time in the day!  Luckily, a company cell phone and VPN allowed for a flexible schedule leading to greater results and increased work-life balance."
good,I have been working for Home Depot for almost a year. It is a very good place to work but they changed what i started out doing three times. I went from packdown asociate to sorter to reciever to unloader. I know the company is trying new things to better it self but they need to train asociates better and moniter there progress.
good,"Unloading Shipping Containers by Hand when needed."
good,"Typical day working at The Home Depot includes guiding customers to correct areas of interests and answering any questions, putting away truck and making sure store is clean."
good,"The company strives on the need for customer service, as an associate if one pushes for customer services then it is easy to grow with the company. The district manager believes in all associates working together, task are better handled has a team."
good,"i would clock in and perform my job and go home and make myself dinner and sleep."
good,"Amazing co workers and a great place to work if you are in school and looking to work part-time. At my specific location, there are events all the time and the management is understanding."
good,"I enjoyed this job, the managers were super helpful. lots of opportunities for advancement if you work hard.  heavy lifting is required for most departments."
good,Home Depot has many positions from which to choose and there is good chance for advancement to anyone willing to put n the work and time.
good,Good company; exciting IT Department. Management is very flat; you can speak to anyone at any level. Run a true open door policy.
good,"The training to pay off period was a little slow, it was almost two months before I got more than a minimum wage paycheck. Very helpful management team, always available to assist or monitor a consult. Unfortunately the product was not in high enough demand at the time to provide adequate compensation for my family."
good,"es una gran empresa., con unos grandes beneficios sin duda alguna una gran experiencia,. buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Loved the people I worked with, good place to work.  The hours were good and weekends off.  Sometimes it was hard to find work and when you did have work, other people would come and take it"
good,"Complete new experience working in Home Depot, the experience and the work culture was fun to work and encouraged learning and implication of solutions to practical problems."
good,"Working at the Home Depot for the past eleven years has been quite an enjoyable, educational and  fun filled experience. I've used my skills and training from previous years and applied it to working at the Home Depot. Some of these skills are strong leadership, attention to detail, inventory management, hazardous materials identification and strong interpersonal skills and working in  fast pace environments to name a few."
good,"went pretty good, I had a really chill team  at my Depot.some departments are very difficult depending on what your asked to worked.but time always flyed"
good,"Regards for safety are of the utmost importance."
good,"In a typical day I pack out product and front face the department for the customers"
good,I very much enjoyed working here as the people were very welcoming and my managers were very good at recognizing achievements. My position was Part-Time but I was given 35 hours a week on average which I really appreciated.
good,"typical day at work is alot of friendly people greeting you and wish you a good day , some days you may have impatient customer but that doesnt stop you from having a good day"
good,"It's a great starting job, but if you want to advance it's very difficult. I have enough experience now to pursue for better opportunities and better income."
good,"Working here I have learn a lot. How to be a better team player, making sure that my task was done the right way and on time and making my job be a fun  and great area to love coming to everyday."
good,"Had a clear understanding of duties.  Kept inventory rotated, stocked and priced accordingly.  Took classes on merchandise to remain versed on new merchandise sold."
good,Typical retail job in warehouse environment. People that work there are good and fair in management. Co workers are also enjoyable. Customer service and shelf stocking and integrity are typical days. A lot of power equipment operating at times. Must be flexible and able to multi-task.
good,"Garden sales associate. Start at 5am till 2 pm."
good,As a worker at the service desk there was a lot of garbage you put up with and would get paid the same as the employees on the floor which didn't seem fair.
good,"ENJOYED WORKING THERE, JUST NOT ENOUGH SCHEDULED HOURS, LOW WAGES.Weekend work if you like that. Company profit sharing determined by length of employment. overall for the right people is a god place to work."
good,great environment to work. people start as seasonal workers but after 3 months they will get an opportunity to become a HD associate. fun group activities.
good,The Home Depot started as a fun place to work for. After a month or so you really get to know the people you are working with and it becomes a lot easier to work. management was good at first then we had a change of management and the store become more about number rather than looking out for associates.
good,"I really did like this job. There was opportunity for employment. I moved in position within my first month. I was the day shift opening cashier for the returns desk. I was in charge of breaks and lunch rotation. By the end of the first year I was filling in for the head cashiers as a relief, then moved into the position full time. I was offered the position as Front-End Supervisor, but since there was No money increase I declined. Supervisor and Head Cashier run hand in hand but the total responsibility of the Department rest on the supervisor."
good,"I worked hard and got along with my fellow workers. The supervisor would talk to me time to time about different things we can do in the store. The team really was based off me and 2 other people, not everyone worked to their full potential. The environment was good enough."
good,"It's a great place to work part time, especially as a student. Great people, flexible, lots of support and understanding from management. However, pay increases are extremely minimal. Hours are seasonal and not reliable. Even as a phenomenal employee, appreciation comes in the form of meaningless badges and lip service. It would be better if they rewarded good employees with livable hours and wages instead of giving them a meaningless award."
good,"In the entire company I only found one bad spot, IT manager. Once the executive branch learned of him, he was fired. Other than that the company was great, and advancement ops came often."
good,"I am thankful for the opportunity but you haven't yet helped me get employment. Not sure why, but there is a reason I'm sure."
good,Very casual and laid back workplace customers are very friendly. There are some employees that are nice and others that are stand offish
good,"Try not to get a job in lot unless you can handle very cold and very warm weather. It can become very boring in lot. And some of the head cashiers can be extremely rude especially if you are standing still and just conversing with co-workers, it is also kind of a dead end job for most because they won't usually let you leave that department for another one"
good,"Siempre hay apoyo en cuanto a recursos humanos, es una empresa muy noble con mucha capacidad de aprender distintas cosas."
good,"I typically work a 6-8 hour shift as a cashier.  I work the regular checkout lines, self checkout, garden, and customer service/returns. With my friendly customer service skills I provide assistance wherever I can.  I also use my sales technique to push our customers to start a Home Depot credit line with us, and have an opportunity to save money on their current purchase and their next purchase.  My coworkers are wonderful, friendly, and outgoing just like me. We all get along very well with each other and with management. Home Depot helped me to advance in my customer service skills, by dealing with different people and personalities throughout the day. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the customers.  I do not know much about hardware, lumber, etc; but I love to find out what projects my customers are working on when they come to the store."
good,"friendly daily, always something to learn management productive get along with all my co workers not able to satisfy customer meeting people everday"
good,"A typical work day is good for the most part like any job it starts slow then it picks up. I learned on improving on providing sufficient info from customer. needs, learned to use forklifts to load/unload. Learn from other experienced associates to gain more knowledge in all departments.Management has been great, very knowledgeable and helpful."
good,"The days goes really good everyday."
good,The managers really care about the safety of their employees. A typical day consist of me helping costumers load and unload things in and out of their car
good,Great place to work with opportunities to excel in as long as you enjoy retail. The environment with co-workers is great and friendly. This job does have some downsides like a lot of standing around and can be some heavy lifting. I really just love the people that you meet daily with challenges and needs that they are facing.
good,"It's a great friendly place to work and very productive as well. Usually, I got lots of help from co workers and Department 90 supervisor. The hardest part is that there is stress sometime."
good,"I learned many things at Home Depot.  I learned how to multi-task, merchandise,  work in a team environment, and order and inventory product.  Ma  nagement was always fair and usually listened to my concerns regarding a given project in the store.  The hardest part of the job was the chain of command.  I would relay the same issues over and over, but they would never be addressed and always fell on me in addition to my required workload.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their various projects and providing the solution they needed at a great price."
good,"One of the better sales jobs to have, as you actually learn applicable skills for your future. Family-like environment, management in my particular store was very good and treated everyone respectfully. Overall management is a little shaky though, as some managers view themselves too highly."
good,"This is a great job to have when starting your working career, flexible schedules for students, provides great benefits for veterans and is a nice place to work after retiring. Fun company events and good benefits."
good,A typical day at work is multitasking between serving customers or replenishing stock.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job is that management  tries to make working on holidays easier by doing some sort of food spread such as BBQ or seafood day.
good,This is a great company to work for. They focus on their employees and their growth. Management is well focused and all on the same page.
good,The associates are all generally easy to get along with and it's overall not a bad place but tends to get hectic sometimes
good,"A typical day at Home Depot #0147 consists of walking in 10 minutes before clock in time, leave their beloningings in their locker. put their apron on, and then head to the sales floor to see where the employee is stationed. Once you're directed to your position, head that way to release the other cashier. Management is alright. The co-workers always have something to talk about. They are awsome, overall friendly, kind, and loving. The hardest part of the job was demagnetizing ALL all the magents from the merchendise. The most enjoyable part of the job were the overall experiences with the majority of the customers and the interactions with the rest of the cashiers and other associates."
good,"FYE provides a fun work environment for all of its employees, as well as giving them a challenge in a fast passed work environment that I believe anyone would enjoy."
good,"Home Depot was a very good place to work. The hours were good, and benefits were offered. The people I worked with and the general atmosphere were great."
good,"Working for home depot was great, the people are so nice and friendly and customer service is #1 in retail. I loveed this job I just wasn't getting an off hours"
good,"Home depot isn't ""stay in one place"" job; they'll make sure you'll get the knowledge and experience you'll need to learn how to deal with customers and how to use equipment within the store to better serve the customers and associate."
good,"The Holiday Inn is still probably my favorite job, because I was serving the San Diego Chargers as they were in training camp. It will be an experience that I never forget!"
good,"I have worked for a few retail businesses, and I think this particular company is really one of the better ones to work for as a college student or as a part time employee. The hours are SUPER flexible, and the Human Resources department is usually really good about helping you find people to cover the shifts in case of emergency."
good,Working at Home Depot was more than what I expected. It's a great environment to work in with wonderful people who just want to help
good,"Pro cashier. Lancaster SC"
good,Great place to work if retail management is an interest. Company likes to promote and develop associates. Was brought in as a temporary associate and promoted to a department supervisor in less than 2 years.
good,"A typical day at home depot entails managing close to 50 associates and working together with other departments in achieving the goal for the day, The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to work with lots of people with different views and opinion."
good,"I have worked with Home Depot for two years now and I can say it is a enjoyable job to have. I will admit it can be stressful at times but that is how it is with most jobs, especially when working at the service desk. Home Depot likes to create a family-like environment with its associates which is always nice. Pay is fair in my opinion and a lot is learned when working here. Some of the downsides would be the management ( at least in my current store). Management in my store seem to never be available when needed or requested by customers. Other than that working here is actually nice."
good,Home Depot taught me how to deal with a fast-pace environment. I learned how to deal woth different customers and make large orders. As well as dealing with vendors and making store orders. We are taught how to work together as a team to achieve the common goal of the company.
good,"Worked in the garden centre and inside seasonal"
good,Work hard and get rewarded.  Work closely with Senior Leadership on high profile projects.  Collaboration with other departments is encouraged.
good,Have had a good time working there. There are many good people who are caring and great to work with. Great culture to expand yourself if you want to
good,Worked when the store was closed every night- everyone got along well on the team. Everyone was very helpful when we were super busy with a large freight shipment.
good,"Management positions worked a 3 day, 13 hour work schedule. Great for single individuals, but did take a toll on people with families."
good,High customer support with a fast-paced environment. Filled large construction orders for building contractors. Some heavy manual labor with products. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the manual labor and the most enjoyable part of the job was working in a small town atmosphere where I served and was able to see many people from my community. I enjoyed working as a team player and would say that Home Depot is an excellent company to work for.
good,This job allows me to feel more organized at home and with my schools studies because that is all we do there. We make things look nice and correct things that are not correct or set up planograms. We make the store look good at its best so that customers don't have trouble finding things or having to ask so many questions. We make sure everything is updated correctly and proficiently at a quickly time matter.
good,"During a regular day, I am often posted to at least 2 different registers. I am mostly posted at Returns, where a higher level of customer service is needed. The crew at work are a mixed bunch, but all are friendly, warm people. The management here is always concerned about employee well being, they have many moral boosting parties and barbeques I enjoy my customers, most of whom are hard working men and women. Helping them is the best part of the day. Since it is a retail job, I have no set schedule, and must work lots of nights, and that is the hardest part of the job."
good,This was a great job as far as schedule and pay and benefits but the mandatory overtime and no raise were a no for me at the time whil I was in school.
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work for the right person, you have to be patient with the customers and very tolerant. It is a great place to learn about construction or whichever department you are placed in. There is ample room for advancement in the company and your co-workers do well to reward hard work."
good,"Home Depot is very community minded which is an attribute that I respect."
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot meeting new people helping them solve there problem, was an enjoyable challenge."
good,The Marketing department is an extremely fast paced environment and I always finished the day feeling like I accomplished many important things that day.  That is a rewarding feeling.
good,"The home depot is a great place to work, great benefits it's like working for your family, they take care of you as a employee,"
good,Tons of great people to get to know with great product knowledge. Customers are great. Can get a little stressful but you always have help
good,Worked here as a cashier while going to college was great when it came to working around my school schedule. Co-workers always having fun at work. Room for growth within company. Great place to start in the workforce.
good,I would open the desk answer any incoming calls or take care of customer's as they came to the desk. The most enjoyable part about my job was finding hard to get items for my customers.
good,Very easy to get along with co-workers and have a friendly work environment. Management can be a bit distant however when it comes to associate needs.
good,"Great Company, but there were a few issues with safety.  Home Depot preaches about safety, but when presented with issues that are LIFE THREATENING, they will overlook them, because they don't want to fire the offender."
good,Home Depot taught me how to manage people and customers.  Also to communicate with both to get what they needed from me and I needed from them
good,"-work as a cashier"
good,Since started I have seen hard work being recognized.  Being on time and applying to learn and an excellent customer service person seem to get be recognized.
good,"Home Depot was a very slow paced job. I enjoyed the ability to interact with customers! However, management in my opinion was very poor. But it was a great company to work for. They offered many benefits to their employees."
good,"The repair technician position is a very laid back position, the managers are not micromanagers so you are basically your own boss as long as you are achieving the repairs that you need. The hardest part about working second shift is that it is from 3pm to 11:30pm and it can be tiresome but other than being tired the job is great. The most enjoyable part of the job are your co workers, everyone seems so happy."
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo era extenuante pero muy satisfactorio, cada quien tiene su trabajo y la forma de desempeñarlo, redundando siempre en la satisfaccion del cliente, aprendi mucho, en cuestiones de seguridad, manejo de mercancia, logistica, la direccion y la gerencia tienen politica de puestas abiertas, y te hace sentir como familia, mis colegas tenian definidas sus funciones y todos teniamos  la capacidad de cooperar y ayudarnos, la parte mas dificil del trabajo eran las curvas de aprendizaje, porque los cambios eran muy radicales, pero como todo con la mentalidad abierta y la actutitud, para salir adelante, lo que ma me gusto, fue que siempre se empataron conmigo en mi vida personal, y siempre estuvieron dispuestos a ayudarme, yo en reciprocidad, repondia con trabajo en horas de descanso e inclusive locallizable a cualquier hora, o en vacaciones, para responder cuando se me necesitara."
good,"After spending almost 6 years in Consulting industry, I was very much worried to start another new career in Retail. However the experience is not at all as I was expecting. I am doing good and I can actually invest the knowledge that I have learned in Consulting. Such as, leadership, time management, work ethics. Because these are normal and easy to use anywhere. My regular day at job spends with customers and my associates. I have learned how to be polite, be patient, be fast yet be perfect. I am ready to move and continue my Consulting career where I have left, with all these learning from Retail and I am excited."
good,"A typical day would begin with me following opening schedule procedures. Assessing the department, completing a store readiness checklist, filling paint tents, ensuring paint dispenser is fully functional, counting my department outs etc. I learned about different type of paint sheens, the different qualities of paint, how to apply paint properly, how to strip clean and stain decks, and how to properly stain hardwood floors. The management there was great for the most part, the job itself wasn't hard maybe just lifting the 5 gallon buckets. The  most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with different projects and helping them attain the best look within their budget!"
good,Freight team is job that can be very demanding at times.  The key is working with others so that the product can be put out on the floor for the customer as soon as possible.  Typical shift was 4 to 6 hours removing the freight from a semi trailer and then putting the product out on the floor.
good,"I deal with paint so I usually come in start by cleaning my area, tend to customers needs as well as learning about the product we are providing to these customers"
good,"Excellent working environment, everyone very detailed to offer our customer's the best service, we are a very close working family, always looking to assist our colleagues.  Best ongoing training, and advancement to grow."
good,A typical day at work is I walk in see what items I need to drop from overhead if there is any. I assist customers with their needs. when the store closes I drop any pallets or any items I need to drop with the order picker.
good,"A typical day is productive."
good,"Good benefits, will work with your schedule or accomodate you in right position for you, will need good communication and customer service skills. Can be a fun place to work at."
good,Great company.  Need a better work/life balance.  Very lucrative if you can bide your time.  Health benefits are wonderful and every amenity you can think of at the corporate office.
good,I enjoy working at this place you can have a balance life and they are very flexible with your hours. It is very overwhelming when you are working behind a desk and you get many angry customers in one day but overall I enjoy working for alorica.
good,"good place to work hard to get hours"
good,"Home Depot is a busy place to work at. A typical day is running around helping customers and answering calls from one of the cashiers. "
good,Home depot had several advancment options and they have a great merrit program. The company believes in helping the community and giving back. They truly care about their people and train you to know your job.
good,Was promoted from position. Great place to work.  Worked for Home Depot for 5 years before promotion and enjoyed working at this store.
good,Great place to work. Was able to promote but unfortunately my position was eliminated from the Asset Protection program.
good,I take pride in my work as a customer service representative and will go out of my way to help a customer with a small or big task. I also strive to build new relationships as well as build up existing ones.
good,Very fun with awesome people. Everybody is family it feels. They give you a lot of training and knowledge as well in different departments. Management could be better on some issues
good,"A typical day at work for me is building moral on the front end. Assisting my cashiers in getting new customers to sign up for home depot  credit cards. By offering fun incentives (i.e gift cards to subway, hats, tee-shirts) in order to make the job fun and not boring. What I have learned from Home Depot is ;"
good,"This is your typical retail workplace. We have great staff, but the training in special departments isn't that great. The hardest part of the job is trying to help a customer who insists on you knowing everything in a department you do not work in."
good,"Learned many different departments "
good,Awesome company with great people. Room for advancement. Stable company with a lot of growth opportunities. Streamlined processes and procedures.
good,"Good benefits, clean place to work."
good,"typical day a work , was always busy, Always something to do, if your area of work was completed or you didn't have customers, there was always stuff to do around the store. Management there really helped me through an extremely hard time in my life as well as  my co worker were great , great team skills. I didn't get along with everyone but we all managed to work together to keep the front end working properly. hardest part of my job was unsatisfied customers most of the time I could handled the problem my self, but when it was out of my hands it was hard because I felt I let my customers down even though that was true. Best part of my job  was customer service and making sure all the customers  were above and beyond happy before they left the store"
good,"help customers, take returns back and place them on the shelf, do special orders, drive machines as needed, occasionally do some task assigned to me by supervisor/manager and open/close the department when schedule to do so."
good,Only offers 20 hours per week. Very few full time positions. Good training. Cares about their employees. Fun place to work.
good,"A good place to work every day there was something new especially with customers, always new opportunities to find something to do, and never bored. I learned new features in the products that they sell and gave advice on flooring, kitchen and bath and seasonal department. Plus, gave support in the back room on delivery, receiving, shipping, and moving products around the store for display. There was always an opportunity to work in any department but needs a better schedule. The most enjoyable part is that the customers come back looking for you and your advice because they enjoyed your service and attitude which was always friendly and with a smile."
good,This was my 1st job when I moved to Dallas. It was great overall. I hate that they closed the call center I learned so much at that company and still are friends with people that I was there with.
good,"The culture within the home depot is rich in pride. I enjoyed being a part of it. "
good,"A generally great company, to my surprise. Very strong adherence to  guidelines of safety and ethics. Every day is very busy, presenting new and interesting challenges. My managers aren't perfect of course, but most of them are hard workers. My co-workers are great people, very reliable and trustworthy. Probably the first company I've worked at with such great employees. The hardest part of the job I'd say is learning where everything is the first time. It's rather daunting, and understanding where every product is located is critical to performance. Hours aren't wonderful, and benefits are reserved exclusively to a select few."
good,"Overall review for The home depot, it is a good place to work either to start a career in retail or advance to management level if you have the necessary skills. like many work places it has alot to do with you know and how hard you work. There is always work that needs be doing and room for growth."
good,Great place to work.made a lot friendships there.  Was never a dull minute there.  loved the people I worked with.  Had great memories there.
good,"Working with The Home Depot was a very enlightening and educational experience. I was moved into a better position and trained intensely for that position rather quickly. The team at this particular store was very supportive and worked well together. The hardest part of my job was knowing the fact that I could never be moved into a full time position doing that particular job, which I loved, and the pay was way below other jobs with the same job description. I loved the people, and the fact that I love numbers only made my job more enjoyable."
good,"un día típico de trabajo, con mucho movimiento en la tienda donde los asociados desde la apertura de la tienda hasta el cierra realizando sus actividades y atendiendo al cliente,"
good,"While working at Home Depot I have learned to be organized while working at a quicker past and also multi tasking. A typical day there would be attending morning meetings, unloading freight before 12, greet and help customers when its need, and making sure all returned items are returned to the correct location."
good,"Being a cashier at Home Depot was a nice first job.  It gave me plenty of experience with customers, company systems, and merchandising.  My only complaint about Home Depot was it was almost impossible for women to move up from being cashiers."
good,"Home depot is fun to work at. You really do learn a lot. You learn something new almost on a daily basis, and it really sharpens your problem solving skills since people come into the store with all sorts of inquiries. In my opinion it is not a good job for a career but if you are a college student looking for a part time to get you by in the meantime it is a great choice. They are extremely flexible with scheduling. On the downside they expect you to be able to to work weekends. If you start out in a department you will be expected to stay to work until midnight if you are closing. These sorts of schedules get tiring after a while, but work great for college students."
good,"Compensation here is not very high, but is competitive to other starting pay in area.  Management and company seem to care about their employees."
good,"Worked part time 5 nights per week, 6 hours per day. I learned how to see if merchandise was in stock and how to replenish it using the hand held device"
good,"I love the coworkers and management was great. Potential is there for career advancement. Positive, fast paced environment."
good,"Good company, solid financials.  Enjoyed all the people I worked with during mu tenure. Varied skill sets made getting help and answers to questions easy."
good,Great company and people to work for as they really do care for you. I was given many skills to learn and was helped along my journey.
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot very much. I enjoyed talking with new people every day that came in shopping, as well as the responsibilities I had to take care of each day. Typically I would have to unload building material, or lumber trucks. These trucks would typically show up at 4 am and I would need to unload them and have the product tagged and put into the overhead racks before 6 am. It was a blast. I met a lot of great people through The Home Depot and learned a lot about myself."
good,"Great co-workers, and great management. Management is persistent on keeping associates on track and making sales goals."
good,Customer service essential and stock heavy. Return product that customers returned as well. When it's busy backup cashier duties come into play.
good,"Great team environment.  Loved the people who shopped there and the people who worked there.   They had flexible hours.  Also, they had a charity program that was pretty awesome."
good,it's truly a great company.  the only downside is there are no full time overnight associates however tons of openings during the day.
good,"I had a really good experience with Home Depot. I learned a lot pertaining to the Flooring Department, management was really supportive, and even though there was a lot of heavy lifting involved, I really enjoyed work on a day to day basis."
good,A typical day at work is pretty laid back.  Sometimes it can be a bit hectic when we're short staff because it may consist of one being on the main line by his/herself.
good,Home Depot is primarily customer based and sometimes they'll defend the customers over their workers. Good compensation compared to other part-time jobs.
good,"Great with career building, but the hardest part was finding a work life balance with the 20 hours of operation. The values are great and they make every attempt to live by them"
good,"Home Depot is a very interesting company to work for. I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with a great company and work with some outstanding employees. By working for Home Depot, I was able to learn many different skills and information about lumber, hardware, electrical, gardening, flooring, blinds, and paint. Over the years of working for Home Depot, I loved working with the inventory and ordering the merchandise for departments. It gave knowledge of supply and demand, what was selling in the departments and how to improve sales on merchandise. I later became the Department Supervisor for the Paint Department and I love what I did. I loved to see the merchandise I was marketing was selling out and most importantly keeping the customers happy. Customer Service is the key."
good,"At some times, the store wasn't very busy and boring for me. When there were customers I enjoyed helping out and getting the job done fast."
good,"I'd review working at the home depot pretty good because the staff is pretty nice and always helps you out along with always getting to know customers and being able to build relationships with them. And, its also a great feeling getting to know new employees."
good,"In my time spent with Home Depot in Dahlonega, Georgia, I have come to respect the everyday workers of retail. The managers and associates are friendly. As a freight associate, it can be difficult to manage between making sure customers are taken care of and getting your work done, but everything seems to get done. The best part is the strong relationships made within the store."
good,"Typical day: arrive 30 minutes before clock in and start shift, walk through my department to summarize needs, touch base with supervisor for their input then begin shift.  Greet every customer with a smile and exceed their expectations.  "
good,Everyone there is always willing to help you whether you have a question or you need a task accomplished. When I get to work I immediately see some of our regulars who I share a laugh and small chat with before I send them on their way with the merchandise they just purchased. I am attentive to all the other customers who may need assistance and solve their problems as best as I can. If ever I can not help them I call a person of management and someone always answers. The hardest thing is when myself or my team are unable to help a customer with their needs or wants and we have to refer them to some place else. What I enjoy most is when I can share a laugh with customers because that lets me know that I made their day just a little bit better and it really keeps my day going.
good,"A typical day of work  as a home depot representative, would consist of dedicated customer service engagement , ability to work in a fast pace environment  , and the ability to multitask and adapt to the current situation or current demand for success of the business."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in about an hour early. Having coffee in the lounge. Then about ten minuets before your shift starts you clock in and get to work because there is more work to do, than work that can be completed in one night. I learned how not to give into drama at this job. I learned its best not to feed into certain types of conversations because it can interfere with work. The management is fine. I had to work in way more than one department during my time working with this company. I learned a whole lot more than i expected to. It's not an easy job if your not into late nights with hard work. The hours are long at night and you have to stand, climb, and lift heavy things without stopping. Also you have to pay attention to being safe. All of that can start to weigh in after a few days of working night, after night, after night. The hard part of the job is staying energized. If you cant do that you might not want to work with home depot overnight. Your boss will fire you because if work isn't done by a certain day and more freight is coming in he gets in trouble with his bosses and that's never good for anyone on your team. The most enjoyable part would have to be spending time with everyone and working together. It was a hard job but we all had laughs and fun and there was a lot of love between everyone on our team. We worked hard every night until the sun came up and then we all walked out all with a look of exhaustion. But we all felt good because we got the job done even if we had to stay a little longer into the morning crew arrived, we got the job done."
good,"I loved being a supervisor.  All the cashiers were always willing to team work, and kept a positive attitude.  Learned something new every day. Enjoyed working with the public.  Loved being the Customer Service Supervisor for 7 months, until I relocated."
good,A typical day at work can be slow mellow and can get really busy and crazy in a minute. Hardest part of my job is unsatisfied customer. Most enjoyable part of my job is happy customer and co-workers.
good,fun place to work with room for advancement if you actually give it your all and try to advance its possible. theres not much to it it is a retail job has good pay and benefits.
good,"Good work life balance.  Able to pursue ""pet"" projects to increase productivity.  Advancement opportunities available."
good,"i loved working here the company will take care of their employees no matter what the situation may be. I learned how to work under pressure, and make on the spot decisions."
good,"The days working at The Home Depot is fine. In my experience, you have to be able to juggle downstocking, returns and talking to the customers as well. The customers are a must. Though, the store isn't exactly the best at handling people who have neurological disorders like I."
good,"The most enjoyable job I've had in awhile. Job Responsibilities could become tedious at times but the fellow co-workers made the work a lot easier. The store is smaller than most branches but that is its strength. The staff along with management really create a ""family"" like atmosphere which you can easily feel apart of. All of which contributed to great reviews on the store."
good,Friendly fast-paced workplace with room for growth. My co-workers and i work as a team to get projects and tasks done safely and efficiently.
good,"Home Depot has an actual breakroom for employees with two refrigerators, half a kitchen, and an eating and sitting area."
good,Daily service to customers and making sure team members are all doing there jobs. Learned a lot about managing and leading lots of associates. Hardest part of job is making sure the store is grand open ready perfectly daily. Best part of job is taking care of the customers.
good,"Day to day included serving customers with excellent service, maintaining department standards in a timely fashion as well as extra projects. Co-workers were easy to get along with and and schedules were easily attainable."
good,As a sales associate your job is maintenance and customer service. They teach you a lot. The only down fall is schedules are different every week so its hard to plan your life around it and the hours are unstable. But if you dont mind that it can be a great job.
good,I enjoyed my work environment got the job done I unloaded trucks my whole work shift being strong and able to do the work was my best ability
good,"If I was to recommend this job to people, I wouldn't work there full time. Especially if you had a family and children. The work-life balance is terrible. But on the bright side the employees are a blessing to work with."
good,typical day consisted of stocking assigned departments and customer service.Great work culture with a focus on team effort and lots of opportunities for promotion and raises.
good,"Amazing co-workers! There was a great chemistry between the employees. The home depot management team, was always open to new ideas and opinions. There is a lot to learn working at this store. I found myself gaining interest in things I'd usually ignore. However, there was a struggle getting a pay raise. Which is why I resigned after three years."
good,"Great company. The community help is wonderful, work environment fun, management needed lots of improvement. The company is good but hiring management that aren't knowledgeable of the departments they are hired to run is not good. I'm speaking of upper management not department heads."
good,"I had a rewarding career with the Home Depot.  I enjoyed the daily interaction with my coworkers and management.  I particularly liked being in a position to help customers with advice on their household projects and products.  Customer Service was always my key and to make the effort to establish a lasting impression on the multitude of customers I serviced."
good,"Sometimes employees have to face impatient or angry people, which is part of the job, I understand that, but when customers begin to blatantly lie about a situation or even start to speak ill of you behind your back...it kind of dampers everything you did for the day, unless you have a positive outlook on everything that happens, like me. I've learned that the hardest part of the job is also what makes it the most fun and exciting part of it. Going the whole nine yards with a customer brightens up theirs (as well as my own) day because they can see the hard work that I'm putting in to see their request through."
good,"Loved Home Depot, the company.  New management was introduced which made many non-favorable changes. Was not promoted due to unknown problems.  Was never late, missed only one day because of illness, Never asked for days off, however, was never explained to me why I could not change departments to help more customers."
good,"It is a fun place to work with great surprises. Profit sharing is great and many ways of celebrating with food, games and rewards. Management is great and helpful. The store is loaded with great employees. I'm very proud to be a part of this store. "
good,load and unload vehicles with products. a good job to help get in shape. while it was only a Hot summer so my experience is limited.
good,"staff is amazing, always friendly and willing to give a helping hand. Management seems to not care about you. Customers can be a pain."
good,"welcoming, hard workers everywhere, management sometimes drag there feet but get it done in the end,"
good,"Positive,supportive and fun environment. The only real drawback is like Most retail the pay isn't great. There are advancement opportunities for those will to work in a fast paced retail environment."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. My boss was amazing. They were vey flexible with hours. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday that were doing many different projects. I learned a lot.
good,"Customer service focused workplace. Member of a hard working team, with basic knowledge in gardening needs, electrical, plumbing, flooring as well as receiving support specialist. Excellent training and management education."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work part time while attending university. The give me flexible hours that allow me to make money while in school.
good,Working at Home Depot had it's ups and downs. It was very hard to get full time and the scheduling was crazy. I didn't have much free time because I worked a lot of closing shifts and weekends. I felt there was room for advancement if you worked hard enough. Management was very good about making sure you were on the right track to where you wanted to be.
good,I think my time with Home Depot was great. The daily customer interactions were the most rewarding part of the job. The management was very understanding and kind.
good,"A job were you can learn something new everyday or try and master one department. Also, you can pick up many skills from mixing paint, or cutting plywood, to driving power equiptment."
good,"Great place to work. Really miss working for the company, and the atmosphere is great! Co-workers were always willing to share knowledge and experience with new employees."
good,I found Home Depot to be the exact opposite of what my previous employer stated. It is family oriented and a welcoming company that certainly takes care of their employees. There are numerous ways to be invested and remain invested. It is a business where it is what you make of it.
good,i didnt mind the work or the random hours had a little problem with advancement in the company as to why i left i was there for 5 years and ran all there will-calls and deliveries it was unfortunate that they refused to let me move up because i was to important in my position.
good,A day will involve merchandising and maintaining product for customer demand. Opportunity for advancement is there for the desired. The key factor is a group of people working together to achieve common goal. Satisfy the customer.
good,I loved working here it is a great company but the warehouse downsized and I had to move to the store.  The store is a lot slower pace and I can not handle standing around.
good,Everyday work would be busy keeps you on your toes which is always a good thing keeps you from slacking. Many different personalities you not only enjoy the atmosphere but your employees become your second. Management very understanding when it comes to personal issues that may come about. Overall it is good place. Learned many things about different things. Home building projects or many different appliances and tools it is very exciting place to work.
good,"I absolutely love all of my coworkers. They're such fantastic people, and it really makes me thrilled when they succeed."
good,It is the typical franchise store upper management doesn't know what goes on in the store day to day. The mid level management allows the employees to get away with not doing there jobs.
good,I learned much about electrical equipment and how to assist others with their problems. I also learned a great deal about the electrical code and how to explain electrical code to customers
good,"The Home Depot RDC is a great place to work. The values, culture, and people are wonderful. The home depot is a great place to pursue a career if you are interested in any type of management position. The work is work, you will be doing the same thing every day if you do not push to learn everything you can. The opportunity to move up in the company is there, though it appears to be difficult. All in all, the Home Depot gets a 4 out of 5 for its values and culture. If you dont like the color orange, I would look else where for employment.."
good,The atmosphere was wonderful. Best job I have had in my work career. The only issue is the fact that their exact consequences of actions are not explained. This led to my termination due to a misunderstanding of policies.
good,"Real fun job. Hours are inconvenient from time to time, but they try to work with you. Not enough pay to make a living is the only complaint I would have. It will be a great job to work part time after I retire."
good,you meet a lot of people company is becoming cheap with pay and some stores have great talent not being promoted. I miss the old days and the fact that this company has a lot of tenor employess makes it hard for new people to grow
good,"The management was always helpful, you could cross-train in other departments in your free time, and there was room for advancement. I was seasonal and they could only keep so many people. I wasn't one of the lucky few but the job and I parted ways on great terms."
good,Its a good job they will start you in pallet build but it is not for everyone can be vary stressful and the labor that is involved is very back breaking especially during the peak seasons i would recommend the home depot to a friend but not for a long term job however there are easier departments after you put 120 days in pallet build but the day will drag in other departments because its at a slower pace at least for me because i like to keep busy but pallet build after a year and six months was enough for me i was a top performer everyday giving it my all I mite have stayed with it if they had recognized my hard work more than what they did and made me feel like i was making a difference witch i was.
good,Homedepot work is fun but just mostly for student trying to add some extra money for their budget . Making it a career will be a whole different ball game must say
good,"Worked 3rd shift on a traveling night MET team. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers which is needed when doing large resets; such as for Christmas and Spring sets. I learned to read plan-o-grams, to work with others, and do take into account others ideas. The most difficult part of the job was the travel in the winter. The best part was working with a great team of people."
good,A typical day at work would be checking people out once they are done shopping and to direct people in the right direction where the product they need to find is. Management was always friendly and nice. I loved my co workers everyone was always friendly with one another. The most hardest part of the job was when you were trying to find someone in a department for a costumer but you couldn't leave the registers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping people find what they are looking for.
good,"Once at work,"
good,"Working in the Home Depot IT Helpdesk in similar to working in many call centers, except one major difference. One only works with equal associates, and a requirement of civility is present from both directions of the conversation. Having worked in, around, and with several other call center environments, this single aspect improves the experience far more than the decent health coverage, retirement options, stock purchase programs, and semi-annual profit sharing do, though each of those are good programs available to all associates."
good,I learned how to give great customer service. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was the schedule always changing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers.
good,"Work would consist of scanning, receiving, and strenuous lifting boxes and throwing them onto conveyor belts. I learned many ways of how to be safe in the work environment and how to lift heavy items without putting too much strain on your body. One of my managers was very hands on and micro managed but for the most part management was hands off. I had small talk with my co-workers for the most part. I didn't really build any friendships at work. The hardest part of my job would just be feeling extremely exhausted after several hours of throwing heavy freight onto conveyor belts.What I enjoyed the most about working at The Home Depot was the two 30 minute breaks we would receive which would mentally make it feel like the day would go by faster."
good,"This job has been very fun! If you like dealing with the public then this job is great, plus the people you work with are very nice and respectful!"
good,Home Depot start by opening my cash till. To be more knowledgeable learning about the products sold at Home Depot and what area it can be found. Home Depot had a family like environment where I have made life long friends and enjoyed being there.
good,operated forklift and manged inbound and outbound lanes. loaded trucks with correct pallets by scanning the items. Also moved product in totes on conveyor.
good,great co workers and you enjoy going to work each day. Being able to cross train in other departments is a great way to change things up and keep things interesting
good,"Working at the Home Depot has been an incredible experience, Management cares about your needs, employees are courteous for the most part and you are welcomed to be creative and take initiative; as well to go above and beyond to meet customers' needs."
good,"treated as family, caring management team, ensures on a daily basis you are ok and not having any problems, customer interaction is interesting, the hardest part of the job is satisfying customers, the most enjoyable part of the job are co-workers"
good,My experience with Home Depot has been a positive one.  I part-time as a Electrical Sales Associate while attending college.  They train you well to be specialized in your department and to be a helping hand in others.  The company believes in team approach in assisting customers.  There's always something to learn everyday.  It humbles you to be a servant and customers will appreciate you for it.
good,I enjoy helping out all  the customers when they come in and need help on any questions regarding fixing up there homes inside and or outside.
good,"Learned the cashier, learned to talk to people, learned to be professional. Helped run a department, learned a little bit of plumbing in the process."

good,Absolutely a great place to work. All co-workers are great to work with and willing to help. Always room for advancement.
good,"Overall I enjoy working at The Home Depot, coworkers are helpful and it is very easy to find help in completing every day tasks. Working here I learned more about making appointments and about customer service. Management is great and always work with you when there are issues both at work and personal issues."
good,not enough pay for the job at hand but other than that great place and needs mor vacation time for employees.needs to treat employees right
good,It was a good place to work at with room to move up .Learned lots of stuff here from shipping to receiving. the most enjoyable thing for me was learning how to drive the different lift trucks
good,"One of the best places I've worked for. Hardest part of the job is when you are unable to make a customer happy. Typical day is putting all drawers into registers, doing opening check list, making sure all cashiers get breaks and lunches. Closing is making sure all tills are sent back and then making sure all employees are out of building safely."
good,"I worked here for many years and moved up quickly.  If you do your work they recognize it.  Compensation isn't great and you won't jump up too much in income, even with a promotion.  This is a good starter company for the young crowd, or a good second job."
good,"Work with good people, learned a lot  about customer"
good,"I have learned many skills working Home Depot from when I first started until I left, and have had the pleasure of working with some really knowledgeable coworkers, venders, installers and customers It has been a learning experience everyday. I had as a sales specialist co-ordinated measures and installs from start to finish,pulled customer orders and loaded vehicles.,down stocked merchandise to fill shelves"
good,"I liked working here, and I hope to go back soon to a different location. At the store I worked at, they were willing to give me opportunities to learn new things and move around the departments, but unfortunately getting full time was an impossible goal and I had to leave. They're good about their hiring, most of my coworkers were intelligent, friendly, and witty-- and the unenjoyable coworkers never seemed to stick around for long. Some of the MOD's were overbearing but the others were great, and the customers.. Well, they were as bad and as good as customers anywhere else. Great company."
good,"Overnight stocker and freight unloader, cherry picker, sit down forklift, stand up forklift certified. garden management"
good,"A great place to work. Co workers are all friendly, management was very good at there jobs and respected by the employees, and customers were all understanding."
good,"A typical day is basically loading and unloading trucks, providing customer service and creating great sales, as well as giving out advice to customers on do-it-yourself projects."
good,The met team did price changes stock product and work together on reset of product.  home depot was good to me with making sure everything was ok with me.
good,"Home depot was an amazing work environment with the perfect pace for me. I love to stay busy and a typical day of work included lots of customer assistance with information and loading. However, my only problem was the opportunity of full time employment. yes it is available but limited to a certain number of people and not easy to obtain. this made continuing employment difficult because i could not afford the cost of living as a part time employee. My co- workers were hard working and I truly enjoyed having the opportunity to know them all. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers only because i always want them to leave happy and some just never intend to come or leave our store happy."
good,"I very much enjoy working at the Home Depot. They are very customer oriented, yet make sure to take care of their associates. I work well in its family atmosphere as everyone will help anyone. I started in 2008 as a cashier and since have spent stints in Flooring, Seasonal, Paint, and the Service desk. I currently call the Hardware department home. It depends on the day wehter I enjoy the busy work we call freight. Sometimes it becomes a very large, unfortunate project. All in all, I look forward to coming to work every day."
good,Very flexible job schedule for freight Associates. Employees where very nice. Midnight/ Overnight shifts are nice. Not many benefits. Great company to work for if your a full time student.
good,"What really makes Home Depot a great place to work is your coworkers. I truly cared for every person I worked with, and it was a fun environment to be in every day."
good,"I enjoy my positions and the people I work with, but I definitely don't get paid enough for all that I do. It's hard to advance and the raises are way too small. I have only earned $.25 a year rated as an ""over achieving associate."""
good,been working for 2 years help me transfer to denton to start college and have a job to pay the bills while i go through school
good,great place to work just wasn't the right fit for me. i need to have something constantly to do not just stand in one place all day long.
good,"I enjoy working at Home Depot. I got to work around 4am and then I would either unload the trucks from receiving or I would pull pallets to the floor from the line. I loved it. I stayed busy, saved money on a gym membership and learned a lot of things I never knew before. I loved being able to assist the customers and listen to them and their needs and surprise myself at times by how much I knew. I enjoyed learning how to use the lift trucks as well. My coworkers always made me feel like I was a part of the team. We all got along and had a good time while we worked. I wouldn't say there was one part harder than the rest with freight. You lifted and put away things throughout your shift. Some stuff heavier than the others. In all it was work. It was what I clocked in to do and its what I enjoyed."
good,"Manage daily reports, work vendor reports and get required information, answer phone, create and maintain will calls and special orders, cash handling experience and returns. Service desk was a great place to learn how to manage time. I worked with wonderful people who made working there fun."
good,"Pretty good place to work as a retail merchandiser. They treat you well, but the pay isnt the best. Low stress work environment."
good,"I enjoy working at The Home Depot, although a lot of times I do feel under appreciated by my management team. I feel they put a lot of enforcement on credit card goals, when thats only a small part of the over all job at hand. sometimes, its more important to please the customer and ensure that they will be returning, rather than trying to score a new credit card."
good,The Home Depot was never a dull place to work and the staff worked well together across all departments and formed good workplace relationships. Management was always available to listen and provide assistance or advice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were flat out rude or even confrontational. I learned how to engage customers in a dialogue so they knew I was paying attention to them and treating them with respect.
good,"Fun place to work and learn with supportive management. Job grew with not only tasks, but a strong sense of community which i loved very much. Lost of variety in my daily job tasks, ranging from monotonus tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"My day always started with a work meeting and I would start cleaning the out side garden pavement and provide a clean work force from then I would start watering all plants, flowers, scrubs, Trees & I would finish my  shift helping customers or fellow employees with the job on hand."
good,Good company to work for as retail companies go. They encourage growth and learning if the employee wants it. All around a decent company to work for.
good,"the people I worked with where very nice and outgoing people they are helpful and all ways have each others backs, the company was not to bad to work with but needs a bit of improvement depending on the stores"
good,"well everyone is like a family my co-workers are easy to get along with management is very understanding of real world situations such as car breaking down and finding it hard to get to work because of that, but a typical day at work is fun and positive everyone full of energy the hardest part was the standing for  a very long time the most enjoyable part of the job is the people come in with different stories and back ground the co-workers and free food, and what I've learned there is you can have fun while working and it does not have to be boring."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Excellent benefits, great management and job security.  "
good,Fun to work here and advancement is a real possibility. Always concerned about sales numbers and very community based.
good,"Work nights if you join this company.  Everyone on nights is awesome.  I think during the day people get stressed out having to deal with all the customers.  Hard to get full time hours, yet they want to hire more people? Really easy job though.  If you want to choose your hours get a second job got to school or else you might get thrown around from nights to days rapidly.  Success sharing is awesome.  Mainly just stock selves, clean up.  Wear gloves or something, stuff is dirty.  Most people are pretty cool."
good,"tending to customers needs of there basic household flooring and wall , i learned how to install tile carpet and other the management was great cant complain, coworkers was very friendly, hardest part is when you are the only working in your section and have to help maintain, we have store cookouts the love there employees"
good,Great place to work while attending school. They were extremely flexible and there were plenty of opportunities for advancement. The co-workers are all helpful and willing to teach you if you are willing to learn
good,I have enjoyed home depot but the raises leave a lot to be desired. Also the work hours also are not the best such as closing one day and opening the next is not fun..
good,It was fun working with diverse people and helping customers. This was the most I have ever helped customers in retail. The Head Cashiers were the best and I would love working with them again.
good,I was working 30+ hours weekly as well as finishing my Bachelor of Science at WMU. During this time I was working as a cashier as well as promoted to the Hardware department to help increase sales in power tools.
good,"Responsible for the overall sales and merchandise maintenance of the flooring and décor department, maintain the department according to company merchandising standards and store operating policies.  Maximizes sales of department merchandise and related products, provides and ensures quick, knowledgeable, responsive, friendly customer service.  "
good,Overall an amazing experience working at The Home Depot. Highly encourage job seekers to look out for their posting. A very rewarding experience for me to learn from one of the best retailers in the world.
good,"I attend the parking lot, organize shopping carts, help customers load merchandise in vehicles, maintain front end of store, cleaning, pulling orders, helping where ever is needed. The hardest part is trying to take care more then one customer at once. I enjoy interacting with customers."
good,"Home Depot is a huge store with many employees.  There is a percentage who are stable and loyal to Home Depot, and then a percentage who are revolving, so new.  Because of the large number of products, representatives are common with new information and new products."
good,"Just as a cashier the day can get a little boring in between hours when there aren't many customers, but for the most part the time passes fairly quickly and you learn a lot about the products sold at the store your future and you help a lot of people every day. For the most part, management is good, no one is too harsh but they always want to improve your skills. Most of the co-workers are friendly and help pass the days quicker. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help some people who you really want to due to company policies or just not having the power to help them."
good,"At least at the store I work in, the co-workers are friendly and cooperative, the management listens to my concerns and the corporate culture isn't just a bunch of words.  They mean it when they say customer service comes first."
good,Great place to start out with little or no experience. You have the capability to learn other departments and advance to another area or level. Customer Focus is the number one priority for this company.
good,"The best part about working at THD is helping customers find solutions to their problems, and seeing them get excited about getting their project done. Now, the frustrating parts... There is the never-ending fight between having enough associates on the floor, due to lack of hours available to spend, i.e, usually, one associate per 8 hour shift for each department on weekdays, sometimes there are gaps in coverage. In turn, customers dont get the help they need, get frustrated, and go to the competition. Second, theft from 'customers' is incredibly high, so you do have to spend some time processing empty packaging and reporting suspicious activity, which allocates valuable time towards protecting merchandise, instead of selling."
good,"Working with customers was very enjoyable"
good,"I've been with the company since 2013 and they've been very appreciative of the fact that I'm a student. They have, at times, updated my schedule to accommodate for school related purposes. I've learned very practical skills, as well. Above all, I've made good friends and shared conversations with both other associates and customers."
good,"Working at Home Depot was a steady paced, but changing environment. Peoples needs changed every time a new person walked in the door and everyone has a different project. Every one there likes to help each other and customers, and were always sharing information with one another. I found it most enjoyable to know exactly what someone needed for there project, and I felt helpful. At night work was straight forward and it was easy to keep busy."
good,I was certified to work on any and all equipment that was used in the warehouse. There were only a handful of team members that had these licenses. I unloaded trucks of freight and loaded others with freight.
good,"The Home Depot sells the ""Do it Yourself"" slogan. They provide the tools for almost any home improvement project and more often than not they supply the people to help get the job done. "
good,Once training is fulfilled you will be busy. Really emphasize safety and customer service. Management hit and misses. Co-workers very nice and some have good background for this job.
good,"the company provides great benefits and a lot of options to move up if your willing to learn and work hard for it. management was horrible . Commutation between them is even worst. definitely a place you can make a career of, you get in what you put out."
good,We work as a team. We try to help each other out as much as we can. Very friendly workplace. At times you will be the only one in your department which can be a bad thing when you are busy and no one else is able to help you out with customers.
good,"Un dia tipico en la tienda es cuando hay mucha gente en la cual le doy asesoria de mi area para que concluyan su proyectos, mis jefes son muy accesibles en todos los aspectos ya que les preocupa que nos sintamos bien en la empresa, mis compañeros cuando no conozco algo y requiero de apoyo siempre lo hacen, y lo que mas me gusta es poder a ayudar a la gente en lo que me piden."
good,An ever changing work environment with lots of multitasking. Great colleagues with a wealth of knowledge to learn and teach. A large international company with red tape and politics but expected.
good,"Very good company to work for with exception of compensation as an associate. "
good,"Highly demanding, being a servant leader to all your direct reports and customers.  Being engaged with all parts of the business, customers, associates, operational processes, contractors big business.  Watching people develop into leaders and move up through the company knowing that I was part of that process."
good,"I love this job. It isn't stressful, the coworkers all get along with each other. Everyone is there to help and teach each other. The environment is a great experience all around. The hardest part is moving up within the company and the pay.  If the pay was a bit better I would really see myself making a long term commitment with the company."
good,"En general home depot es una muy buena empresa, fue muy bueno trabajar en el home, el ambiente es grato y de respeto. Un día es como un día con familia y amigos, siempre brindando apoyo unos a otros. Y la capasitasión es constante. La parte más fácil es la atención al cliente, ya que lo que haces es impartirle los conocimientos que tú ya tienes y hacer de su compra una buena experiencia. Lo más díficil  fue dejar de trabajar con la familia naranja aún los extraño, cinco años no son facíles de olvidar.Lo que más me gusto fue el ramo de hecho me gusta mucho la construcción y pues el conocer los materiales su uso, aplicación, redimíento y de más características y el conocer y aprender fue lo que me cautivo de home depot."
good,"Show up clock in make the backroom ready for the day. unload the trucks breakdown the pallets for the individual departments. The hardest part was the nonstop, and fast pace work.  I learned how to operate a forklift, Do data entry."
good,"Customers are the service. Operates with an upside-down pyramid, where the customers are FIRST in our hearts, and the CEO is the last on our minds. As with many companies, it has its share of political mechanics. Everyone learns from one another and plays a vital role, despite which department they work in."
good,Great place to work. Advancement opportunities are abundant. Very fast pace. Customer service is #1 priority. Associates are very friendly.
good,"supprtive and knowledgable management, very thorough traing        system, good chance to advance, very family oriented, flexible schedule,"
good,"Great company to work for, a lot of benefits and great pay. Great company if your in school and want to learn about home improvement."
good,"Very busy environment. There is always something to do. My managers are great. Employees enjoy rewards for hard work, also for meeting safety goals. Hardest part of the job is the amount of work. I enjoy the freedom. I work independently for the most part, yet also as a team to get the work done."
good,"I started as a sales associate (as did all employees) when The Home Depot had 56 stores. Managed various departments learning skills for being a successful manager.  The owners fostered an entrepreneurial spirit within each store which led to the dramatic growth of the company. When the owners decided to step down, they brought in a non retail CEO from GE who tried to fit a square peg in a round hole.  Many members of management resigned or were forced out.  This led to the company being a follower instead of a leader.  Fortunately, after several years of poor performance, the CEO's contract was bought out by the board."
good,Since working with the company I have learned a lot and have a great understanding of how the company wants to be run. I hope to advance within this company to a management position.
good,"No day is typical, every day is different thats what i enjoyed working there. I have learned a lot about different cultures, how to handle different situations, and how to work under pressure. Management is always around to help."
good,"Stock, stack and keep picked up (clean) between customers, cut wood for customers on both saws. I learn how to's from customers on other jobs like drywall, concrete every day and pass that on to other customers. Working with contractors, you are either learning more from another trade or passing on from my construction background to help them. Co-workers are great, they help out all the time from department to department. Its work, there really is no hard part of the day. Most enjoyable part of this job is the hundreds of people a week I help get their projects done and a lot of them I guide them through it so its done right the first time :P"
good,"Very good company to work for, good people mostly. Assistant store managers work hard just like you. The hardest part is standing on concrete all day."
good,"Typical workday included running reports, auditing online and special orders, answering phones, managing lines of people waiting to make returns, resolving customer's issues, and maintaining a positive atmosphere. Management was undergoing some changes and could have been more supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems for customer's and satisfying their needs."
good,"The best part about working for The Home Depot was the benefits. They match 401k distributions by a certain percentage, stock options, grants, tuition reimbursement, sick and vacation time, and so much more."
good,"they do play the favorite game very well other than that great place to work and learn"
good,great company to work for however Store management was a bit incompetent and unorganized.   Three Store managers in less than 2 months.
good,"I would clock in to work and rent, clean, and repair tools till lunch time then continue till it was time to go home or this other associates brought me their projects to do or help with"
good,"I work with contractor mostly among regular customers. Making sure orders are processed and materials delivered if need to be. Call my pros to see if they need anything in which I can help with in any of their project. I assist in other departments, from kitchens with designer appointments when the store designer is not in since I have been trained in 20/20 previously to showing customers where to find items they are looking for or making suggestions. I love the work environment with my co workers because they are fun and friendly which makes the days go by faster and easier. Management for my store is friendly and work with you if needed be. The company tries to educated you well to make sure you can be able to help out customers. The hardest part would be when you are short handed and can't find help for a customer as well as when you get one of those customers that expect you to just drop everything for them but you can't cause you are working already for others before them, therefore they become aggressive or angry but you have to keep professional and maintain that great customer service aspect. Overall, this is a great company but I feel that I need a change that is why I want to find a new employment."
good,productive and a fun work place. The work place was well diversified. The company had good managers as well. The co-workers was good to work with.
good,"Cool company; has a hiring session every year. They company doesn't determine who can return in a proper manner.  However, the environment is clean, friendly and location is great."
good,I began working at the Home Depot when there were only 123 stores. It was very exciting. It was face paced. You had to be a self starter. We had guidelines which were mainly to insure complete customer satisfaction. As time progressed we added over 1000 stores. Operationally we started to crack. Many solutions were planned but due to the rapid growth were difficult to implement. The founders left the company and a new CEO hired. Things got worse. I retired before a new CEO was hired who has done a good job of correcting the problems. He has returned the company to where it was on a policy and procedures standpoint as it was when I first started.
good,"Great place to work it's always busy in the building materials department. From the time I clock in to the time that I clock out I'm busy helping customers and it fun, I love to help others."
good,"great place to work, fun environment, great company values, associates are put first and are valued highly, great co-workers, great customers"
good,".great work ethic"
good,"A regular day at work for me would basically be the same thing everyday. I would go to receiving, check if there was any new freight to be brought out to the sales floor to be seperated and brought to a certain department to be packed out onto shelves, or overheads. The home depot is a great job to work at because you can grow in the business very quickly but its all up tp you. Ive learned a lot working here like how to deal with customers under extreme pressure, how to manage and operate forklift and reach machines. the employeees and managers are descent people to work for and get along with for the most part. There comes a time where the job does get frustating either with the customers, a manager, another associate, or just the amount of work on certain days itself. But the most enjoyable part about the job is all the new people you get to meet and new things/opportunties you experience."
good,"-A typical day at work starts with Assessing the Ails with all the necessary tools.to know the level of Parkdowns that may be carried out, Receiving,Engauging and Helping Customers out including providing any needfull technical assistance . Take online orders in liaison with the Front Desk Service Dept and ensure products are released in a timely manner. Ensure lean shrink management by carrying out markdowns in aproper manner."
good,"Working at the Home Depot on an daily basis, is the job where you can encounter different ethnicity and personalities from co-workers and also the customers. It is also, a very detailed, hand-eye coordination, responsible (task oriented), computer and hand-held literacy, multi-tasking, and most of all customer service oriented type of employment. Since I have been at the Home Depot, I have learned numerous of things that range from; dealing with customers that are never wrong (from a business point of view), plumbing (the different pipes and drainage issues), electrical (knowing how to cut wire correctly and the different types of light bulbs and how to locate the correct light bulb for the one that is blown out), lumber (proper lumber to use when building your own deck or fence and all the different types they exist ex; treated or non treated), millworks (understanding the correct door hinge for the door and the correct shutters and their different types), paint (qualities and sheen's of paint, stains, and concrete paint, the different methods of how to apply and knowledge of all the accessories that come along with painting), and drywall (how to measure for the correct amount of drywall needed and the joint compound importance). The management can improve by all long shot, although they majority of the time try to always work with employees on the scheduling aspect of the company. Co-workers, for the most part are easy to comply with and work with on an often basis... although like some other jobs you do have some employees who tend to try to bring you down with them because"
good,"A typical day at work would include, greeting and thanking every customer, keeping a neat and clean work place, answering any customers questions or concerns, processing returns and exchanges and cashing out customers in a fast and friendly manner. I learned a lot of great customer service skills, patience and how to work well under pressure. All of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful when needed and everyone works well in a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers."
good,"I love my work family. It is one of the hardest (if not THE hardest) working team I've worked with. My only complaints are that the hourly pay could definitely be better for the work required, and that it could be better staffed. Sometimes there are not enough employees in the store to serve the demand of customers. Also schedules are subject to change within a week's notice. Otherwise this has been a very good place to work."
good,"fast pace, very challenging ,wonderful learning.Not enough workers to cover certain departments Managers had no control on how many employees they could hire even if they were low staffed in departments."
good,Very minimal advancement opportunity and really long hours. Micromanaged as cashier. Co-workers are friendly but some supervisors have favoritism.
good,"Strong company with lots of potential"
good,"At the Home Depot I witnessed a company that takes great care of their staff, giving back to the community, and assisting individuals in furthering their future goals. I was thoroughly impressed and would recommend this job to those who are looking for a place to work with friendly staff and great incentives!"
good,"Process all documents Received via O drive Address jobs with Missing Paperwork"
good,"I really love working at The Home Depot.  On a typical day I interact with many customers and build good friendships.  I am a people person so I get along well in my position.  The management has been very good to me and demonstrate they are glad they hired me. I get along well with the co workers.  The hardest part is some of the lifting, but I don't do that on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part is the interaction with the customers."
good,"very good place to work at. Friendly atmosphere and a positive place to learn. I learned different ways to handle transactions and trouble shooting. the management team is very social and nice to everyone and if help is needed, they help instead of getting someone else."
good,"Working at The Home Depot is great. The culture is fun. They really promote a team culture."
good,It was great place for me to strengthen my customer service skills. Everyday was a new challenge. Helping people learn the proper way to do there home repair was an everyday occurrence. Customers never forget people who help them do something they thought they could not and they would always come back to me for their next project
good,"Fine, not enough hours to provide opportunity for independent living."
good,I check in with the Service HR manager and see if she has anything she needs me to do. If she doesn't then I go up to the front end and cashier for that day. I love working there because I have to opportunity to learn other departments. The hardest thing for me is getting back into the swing of working outside the home.  I am adjusting to it though.
good,"Benefits for PT employees, Awards with limited financial recognition, will work around school schedule, able to get needed days or shifts off. Positive work enviroment for the most part."
good,working at the home depot allows a person like my self to learn about basic home maintenance. I enjoy going to work everyday with a variety of things to be doing.

good,A typical day at work would be basically behind the register performing cashier duties such as cash handling and customer service duties. I assist customers with ringing up their items and answering any final questions or concerns before they leave. I also work at the returns/customer service desk. I assist customers here with returning items and solving any issues they may have had with our products. I also help customers pick up orders or help them place an order if they need to. The customer service area is also where I answer phones and answer any questions customers may have or transfer them to whatever department they need assistance in.
good,"Worked overnight pretty much the same..Unloading trucks seperating merchandise and working it to my dept which was kitchen/bath and plumbing."
good,"My typical day at work begins as soon as I drive into the parking lot.  I am greeted by my peers sitting on the curb outside the store, who gladly inform me of the heavy workload that awaits me. I smile and walk towards the time clock greeting customers and co-workers with my bright smile.  After small chatter in the break room I head to the receiving department where rows of palletized merchandise is lined up. I immediately locate my department supervisor and ask for the days game plan.  He directs me to the many UPS and FEDX packages  that have arrived  and the urgency to have them processed through the computer system for customer pick up. Once all the UPS and FEDX is completed its onto the mounds of freight that must be sorted by department, put on carts and taken to the floor for the evening freight team to work.  I also key rec' all trucks that arrive to be unloaded and schedule  new deliveries.  If there is any time left in my work shift I also assist  the RTV clerk in processing the returned merchandise for credit.  This is a typical day which always includes helping and greeting all customers."

I've learned much about the company culture, it seems to be a friendly atmosphere. The management team is the busiest as they make sure the store keeps operating but still find time to help customers and interact with employees. The employees put forth a team effort and have fun while working."

good,"Home Depot is a nice place to work at if you really like to help people. It is a place with their own education, so that you can be a professional at your job. Despite unfortunate things that go on in the workplace, the co-workers is what makes this place tolerable. They treat you like family and show unconditional love, something management should take a quick lesson of."
good,"Upper Management asks lower management and regular employees to assess situations and solve customer care issues and problems. But in reality if you inform them of an issue that a customer brought to your attention that is serious and needs to be taken care of, and they tell you to go do something else that we will talk about it later since the customer had to leave to be somewhere else, do not trust the management fill out the report first and notify someone over their head if you have to otherwise they will use you as the scapegoat."
good,I loved that they automatically reconized my great skills and wanted me to move up immediately and the staff was very friendly.
good,"Belle horaire de travail, beaucoup de réunion pour nous motiver à continuer notre bon travail. Il y a beaucoup de possibilité d'emploi dans l'entreprise."
good,"My typical day as a Delivery coordinator consists of: "
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work, but you have to be willing to work hard especially if you want to advance in the company. Home Depot has a family oriented culture with great benefits. Individuals have to be able to multitask and customers always come first."
good,"A typical day is making sure every customer has everything they need to complete whatever project it is that they are working on. Finding solutions. Helping chose colors, paints, finishes, adhesives is just the beginning of the day. Knowing how to use adhesives, caulks, solvents and all of the tools to apply them is important. Using and maintaining the tint machine is also a major part of working in the paint dept. Once the customer has been taken care of, there is always down-stocking and filling the shelves to do. There is always work to do and that makes the day go by quick."
good,"I like working for home depot, good people and very dedicated to our customers. The one thing i do not like is the lack of communication between dept heads ASM's and Associates. And to get the training that you need."
good,"The Home Depot is an excellent place in which to work. I learn on a daily basis, and love working with customers knowing I did all I could to help them with their shopping experience. Web-based training is an ongoing experience. I am continually learning more about our products that we carry not only in the garden department but also the electrical and plumbing department in which I am asked to work in as well."
good,"I met a lot of great people; customers & fellow employees!  I learned a lot and sold a lot, still have friends from Home Depot, and I continue to shop there too!  Some of the skills I learned back then I still apply in my life today."
good,"Typical day includes heavy lifting of merchandise, working to help customers find the products they need to perform a specific task at home/on the job, while learning new skills and how to use tools for each and every task involving carpentry and engineering. Management works close with employees and encourage learning new skills. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude/unruly customer, while the most enjoyable aspect is being able to learn something new everyday (i.e. how to start a garden, how to build a shed, using different power tools, etc.)"
good,"If you find yourself having to work in Retail, Home Depot is probably the best place to do it. After having experienced many retail jobs, the Home Depot has the best environment out of all that I've experienced. This is a workplace of Adults, not children, and the company treats you like you have a brain. You are given plenty of freedom, responsibility and there is always something to do. Your brain is worked to it's limit and you learn a huge amount, especially if you work in a technical department like Electrical.   "
good,Home Depot i a great place to work that truly puts its associates and there families first. One of the greatest things about the company is that there is a lot of room for growth for its associates and the company takes an interest in building those that are already working in the company.
good,Just a good overall place to work if you are the handyman type. They will work around your schedule and the pay is fair. Hard work is rewarded and advancement is there for the taking.
good,Always a learning experience. looked forward to engaging professionals and dispensing knowledge to do it yourselfers.
good,As a special services associate I was the go to employee for anything and everything. I obtained and retained a comfortable amount of knowledge in each store department to answer any and all inquiries and address issues. I served as a back up to the returns cashier as needed.
good,"It was the first job that I ever had, I knew I had to go in and work hard. I found it also to be a great learning opportunity to learn how to react and talk to different people everyday. It was something that was foreign to me as well as out of my comfort zone. I had great co-workers when I was there and one even become one of my closest friends. I often return there for shopping, because I know some of the staff and enjoy talking to them as well as I know my way around that particular store. It really gave me a different view for shopping because I was on the other side and know what it can be like. The hardest part about the job was when it was busy, you had to run around so much and juggle 10 different things. It was a hard balance, because I wanted to give the best service I could to each person, but at the same time I wanted to be quick and try to help everyone I could. The best part of that job was the people I got to work with, especially some of the older ones, they had to much knowledge and there was always something to learn, or a funny story to hear. As well I also got trained to operate the fork lifts, which I can't really complain about."
good,"Excellent work place and friendly atmosphere, very nice supervisors, training of product knowledge was excellent .Home Depot was safety oriented and employees had to trained on forklift, cutting saws, product stocking machinery, assemble lawnmowers and other equipment."
good,"Prepare orders for the days delivery both on box and flatbed trucks.  Pull orders for that day and next.  Work with Receiving and Special Services on BOSS and BOPIS orders so they are available for customer pickup.  "
good,"Work was simple, workers were friendly for the most part, management was nice but they were not usually the brightest when it came to working smart, they usually just delegated work out that could have been done in a much simpler fashion should the proper tools have been provided."
good,"It's an okay place to work if you are a student. If you're looking to make this place a career, I say try corporate. It's not hard to step up if you work your butt off. It's a great place to work overall"
good,good part time job doesnt really invade into personal life easy job but some of the people are very noisy and all in your life
good,"Assisting customers with sales and product assessments for their homes,apartments,condos,etc. I've learned the value of great customer care beyond the normal requirement, in order to ensure top quality customer satisfaction."
good,"Gran aprendizaje en la atencion a clientes"
good,"el dia a dia es un mundo muy agradable ya que a diario nos encontramos con retos y satisfacciones al termino del dia, el aprendisaje es continuo dia con dia se imparten cursos de diferentes productos, los lideres cuentan con la informacion necesaria para cubrir cualquier eventualidad que se presesnte , los compañeros siempre estan al pendiente de todos para facilitar la jornada, la parte mas complicada es el entrega de material ya que no cuenta con unidades propias de alli en fuera todo es perfecto"
good,I rather not say anything about it. I liked working there but what I was hired for I rarely got to do. Otherwise great place to work at and nice people.
good,"I have many customers that will only come to me because I treat them with respect and honesty. This is the favorite part of my job. "
good,not a place for a career but a job for the moment. i had a great experience with my co workers. thats the only reason i stayed so long
good,"My day typically starts with a line at my door with co-workers needing advice, or looking for a shoulder. I am constantly reviewing and adjusting the schedules, managing hr issues, scheduling and maintaining salaried managers calendars. I've learned that your management style has to vary based on who you are dealing with. Some people prefer the straightforward message while others need a more friendly,softer approach. I can honestly say that I enjoy my co-workers, we have fostered a two-way honest communication and we value each others insights. The most demanding part of the job is keeping a team of 115 people on the same track with a positive attitude. The most rewarding part of the job is the knowledge that each and every one of those 115 people know they can trust and confide in me and I am always there to help them, no matter how big or how small their problem is. If I don't have the answer immediately, I will always find it and get back to them before the end of the day."
good,I enjoyed my six and a half years working for the company. I had lots of great experiances on all the differnt teams I worked on over the years. I never had a bad experiance dealing with managment or HR and every time I had to talk to managment or HR they made me feel really comfortable. The benifets are really good just they pay could be better. They are really fair at giving any hard working employ the chance to grow within the company
good,"The associates are easy going and know their department. Management is good, especially the assistant managers. Product availability is excellent so long as the receiving department has the full support of management and enough associates in the department. Customers are generally nice, contractors are the best customer and when you turn a frown upside down by helping an irate customer, it really makes your day. Getting Homer Awards and money for going above your job duties is a boost in moral."
good,"a typical work day consists of. the store work,meeting with the store managers. letting you know that your dept. sales are good or bad, sales is the key find a customer and engage."
good,"Have to deliver world class customer service to customer, always putting them first above all priorities. I learned how to motivate myself to learn the Millwork, Hardware, Paint, Tool Rental, and I also learned how to operate a cash register. Co-workers are willing to go the extra mile to help each other. Hardest part of the job is maintain the knowledge of certain departments for several months even when I wasn't schedule in that certain department. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding a solution for the customer and making sure they leave with their questions and dilemmas solved."
good,Would come in to my register makes sure its clean and sufficient amount of money. Help customer with on questions they have.
good,"Dynamic and friendly atmosphere. I work with amazing people both as customers or fellow associates."
good,I learned how to manage putting up freight and helping customers at the same time. I learned how to be versatile. My co-workers made it a great place to work.
good,"Work days typically weren't bad nice job"
good,An innovative team that works hard together to ensure that the objectives are met.  The management team is committed to supporting each individuals growth and training.
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo es iniciando el día con pendientes de un día anterior alistando las cajas para atender al cliente . recibir el pódium [efectivo de cajas] ."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the compensation was decent and management was approachable.  I worked as a cashier, and felt like the company really wanted to promote me (wasn't what I wanted at the time).  I didn't like working retail hours, but my co-workers were fun.  Working in the outdoor garden area on cold days was a bit taxing, but not something I dreaded doing."
good,I enjoyed working there. Everyone was friendly like a family. The work envroment was laid back and enjoyable. Management was flexible and understanding.
good,"Customer volume is unpredictable. One day it could be very slow and the next it could be extremely busy. I learned better money management skills while on the job. How to train, teach, and develop my cashier team in order to provide the best possible service to our customers. Most important of all, I learned how to be a leader while on and off the job. Unfortunately I cannot speak too much about the store's management team as I did not get to associate with them too often. All I can say is that they were usually available to answer my questions and customers' questions if I could not. They were available to assist the front end with obtaining more money for the registers and to deal with disgruntled customers. My front end team was ideal. They provides several opportunities to learn how to be a better leader. The cashiers looked up to me for guidance. The hardest part of the job was having to adjust to new changes and delegating those changes out to the front end cashiers to ensure that they start adhering to the new procedures. It was difficult to do this simply because there were frequent changes."
good,Enjoyed working part-time at Home Depot. Welcoming environment and management was always there to help with any questions or concerns.
good,"**as stated in previous review"
good,This is one of the better retail companies I have worked for. There is no discount at the store but they do off a website with discounts on various things. The cell phone discount is the best at 25% off. They do offer good benefits and management is easy to talk to.

good,"A typical day at Home depot Starts off with a store meeting to review weeks profits so far, then to your designated area to perform tasks till 10 am. then its customer service only till 2 pm. through out the day management will check on you to see if there are any issues. The store manager is a strong presence and has an open door policy and will always make time for your questions or concerns. "
good,Worked with Contract customers orders and stocking shelf locations. It was fun.
good,Good place to work with excellent core worker and manager. Store manager provides a positive environment with a focus on providing good customer service and countability to fellow associates.

I am trying to stay with the company but it is proving difficult with everyone else being displaced is applying for the same internal job."
good,Home Depot has a very flexible work environment.  This is a good place for anyone looking to work full time or who just needs part-time work while in school.
good,"Home depot was a great place to expand my experience in hard labor. I spent a lot of time loading and unloading the freight trucks. The management was awesome and if there was ever an issue with co-workers, it was quickly resolved. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I helped deliver a quality product to the consumer."
good,I have enjoyed working for Home Depot and the Benefits that they provide are good considering i am a part timer.  Working retail can be rough with hours when they have to be cut or the weird scheduling. recommend this job to people looking for a part time job because of flexible schedule.
good,Home Depot is a strong company with great opportunities. The best part of the job is meeting new people and being part of a company that gives back to the community.
good,"•	Per pear  paints for customers , sale attachments for paint projects and home repairs"
good,"Working at HD teaches you to deal with a wide variety of different personalities.  It can be challenging at times, but rewarding as well.  It's nice being able to know my trade, and explain how to tackle a problem.  The co workers of mine are easy to get a long with.  Management is also pretty easy going.  The hardest part of my job is having to be on my feet on the concrete for eight hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I hear a costumer tell me how happy they are that they ran into me, because I gave such good costumer service."
good,Home Depot can be a fast paced place to work as with any retail job there are many duties one must complete daily.  At times it is difficult to get a break as the paint department is a very demanding department but other associates are understanding and try to help out whenever they can.
good,Home Depot is a very good company to work for. Great benefits including quarterly bonus.

good,"I 'd like to advance my career, while my legs could not support me to stand 8 hours a day, it is hard for me to stay long for this job."
good,"I like the people I work with. Sometimes trying to get further in the company (Transfer posistions, or lead and gain responsibilites) can be difficult. Managment can be back and forth. The managers are nice but every manager has their own way of running things and sometimes it can be confusing. We just got a new Freight Supervisor and he's still trying to figure out the flow of things so things are bit overwhelming right now. Overall, the job security is nice but for working late. I think we could be getting paid more and should be full time. But unfortunately Freight cannot be full time even though some people have full time and others dont. Nobody is sure why that is."
good,"The Home Depot was a very positive and productive work environment. it had plenty of possibilities is advancement for any who wanted to. in most cases the management was very helpful and caring. But most of all it was a very customer oriented work place. a typical day at work was full of hard work but very rewarding, helping customers and always finding something to do. co-workers were kind and mostly helpful. the hardest part of the job was the slow days or the extremely busy days, sometimes we were understaffed and there was more work then workers. the enjoyable days were very enjoyable, full of of course hard work but also fun. such as cook outs and just all around fun with co-workers."
good,"I would work at quite a few different Home Depots. I worked as a vendor from Anton Sales & Marketing. It involved driving to different locations and doing duties such as merchandising all of the trees and shrubs in the garden sections of The Home Depot. I would mostly work independently and occasionally with a few co-workers who were really fun and easy to work with. I would pull in all shipments from receiving, organize and condense old product to make space for the new product. I would price the product and cleaned up. I would also cull any dead product up to 100 lbs. Sometimes it was hard for me to decide where i should display the product, but the more I did it the more comfortable it became. I enjoyed looking at the finished display and complete all of my assignments."
good,"I am very lucky to be with this company. The customer service to customers being a top priority and then the treatment of the employees has been the best I have ever worked for.  I am trying to relocate to Austin area.  The  hardest part of my job is having to find another job within the company to relocate because it is so great to work for.  I have learned a lot about the ins and outs of retail, receiving and merchandising, cashier duties and performing special orders with vendors. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with customers and other associates."
good,I enjoy some of the associates there. Good place to work if you want to climb high into the company.I enjoyed working there and they are very caring when you are in need. Plenty of volunteering in the community especially for Veterans

good,Fun at times and hectic at times.  Hardest part of the job has learning where everything is located to you can get customers to the right aisle.
good,"My typical day at work was on the floor, driving sales and service through the associates and the team I lead.  As an ASM, conflict resolution and ensuring customers left happy is part of my regular day.  I work with some great people, and although I love my job, the people was a big part of why I've stayed so long.  Work life balance can be tricky and was probably the hardest part of my job.  Overall, I enjoyed all aspects of the business, because I used every situation as a learning tool to improve myself."
good,"Associates and management actively try to involved with each other and maintain friendships outside of the workplace, which can be very pleasant as long as you're on someone's good side. However, this camaraderie can cause issues with preferential treatment and lack of accountability, creating friction within the store."
good,the work place was nice and very clean I enjoyed working there.
good,"The Home Depot was a wonderful place to work as a student.  Their part time schedule is extremely flexible, and their HR staff is generally very reasonable.  Promotion to full time is rare, and the departments rely heavily on part time work.  It's a large store running on minimal staff, so multi-tasking is constant.  As big box companies go though, The Home Depot is one of the better ones."
good,"Overall Home Depot is a great company to work at, but they seems to be changing over the last couple of years for the wrong reasons. Today, they hardly give much in pay raises."
good,"It becomes a drag to come to work, but the people you work with are okay. The pay is not enough for the amount of work you do."
good,"I enjoy doing DIY things, and sharing them with other people. Hobbies, crafts, and home/auto repair. Giving advice and having people return to me to thank me and give me things they have done to take my projects further is extremely rewarding."
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot is filled with challenges and fast paced work. I start by driving the perimeter of the building, looking for both safety concerns and any sort of housekeeping that may need to be done. Once I walk in, I engage the greeter and I stop and try to look at my store through the eyes of my customers. Are we clean? Is the store organized? Are we in stock? Are my employees engaged and actively seeking out customers? If any of these areas need to be addressed, that becomes my first priority. Once addressed, I look at my workload for the day. "
good,great job good wages good employees and employees are treated fairly
good,"The co workers are always nice. its a good place to work you get payed okay, there are cool parties. The customers are not the nicest though."
good,"Answer phone calls and direct the customers to the right departments. Help with online sales and inquiries on special orders.  Help with the returnes of problem merchandise. Answer questions as to where things where in the store,also, to offer suggestions on other products and ways of doing a better job. Reviewed past orders and returns, to clear any return discrepancies from the manufactures. Clear all reports of questions in sales or orders."
good,"Go over the daily planner with the associates and also productivity from the previous day. What I've learned is to stay engaged with the associates and you will get the best out of them. The management team is very experienced and can learn a lot from, and my co-workers are very fun to work with. I think the hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy and on the same page. The most enjoyable part of the job is I, learn something new everyday."

good,Was amazing place to work in the 1990's before restructuring. Compensation and growing rapidly. Opportunity. Too many changes every few years at Corporate causing field turnover. Must stabilize.

good,"Good for students and retired people , lots of chances for advancement if u deside to get into management"
good,I learn how to work a register and how to talk to the customers and in helping them find what they need.
good,Store needs a full time HR to beable to help and take care of Associates.

good,help customers drive products with forklift stock freight
good,Great place to work with great culture and room for advancement.
good,Nice place to work. Employees typically are very nice and sweet. Management for most part are cool. Hardest part of the job are the hours (it is retail).
good,"the pay isn't that good and the hours are even worse. iv'e learned about the products in my department, management is only around when their being watched, my co-workers are pretty cool, hardest part of the job is getting more hours/ pay. most enjoyable part of the job is the company events."
good,A typical day at work involves coming in a few minutes early to make sure im ready to be on the floor and knowing sales maybe going on would help you better assist customers for what they may be looking for or what they need to finish up a project.

good,Good place to work. Fun and good solid atmosphere. Id recommend this place to others

good,"I have enjoyed working with our team in the front end and being around in different departments learning. I stay busy non stop. i have earn patches in Cashier of the month,"
good,"The company started out fantastic, it was a great place to work. However over the years it has declined. Still a good place to work, but not that family feeling when you walk through the door."
good,You know what to expect for your shift when you come in.  One way to keep it interesting is that you are scheduled to work at different registers throughout the store and relieve co-workers for breaks.  I've learned a lot about home improvement and gotten a lot of project ideas while working here.  One of the most challenging parts of the job is trying to learn the store and figuring out where everything located so you can better assist the customers.  Everyone gets along which is nice.
good,"Good place to work, friendly atmosphere, and opportunity for advancement."
good,"Plan, design and execute Point of Purchase (POP) in warehouse areas.  Set-up of stock material based on Planograms design.

good,Great organization to work for.  The company is truly dedicated to taking care of their people.  There is no one day that is the same.  The company truly represents being one that invites innovation and welcomes change.
good,"A typical day on the job is like any other retail seller, you get dressed in uniform (Apron in this case) and you go out to the sales floor and assist customers finding things they need/want."
good,This job was part of a marketing campaign for Home Depot that was in store. A typical day of work required me to drive to a different store around Colorado everyday and approach customers on Home Depot's behalf in the store to schedule appointments. I learned that in the business world people really hold the keys to their own destiny and the power of a strong work ethic. Management for this job was great they did not micromanage and were very helpful in my growth as an employee. I enjoyed all of my co-workers it was just a very positive work environment on a whole. The hardest part of this job was the hours no including the driving it really took it's toll. I really enjoyed meeting new people every day and helping them with their home improvement needs.
good,"great people to work around and always learned something new everyday,"
good,"Home Depot is a great place for people to be able to work in a steady environment with nice coworkers. However, there is no real advancement available for part time associates. They begin by paying more than most places offer, the training is severe, but that allows for better associates. The hardest part of this job is the hours you are expected to work. They can schedule you anywhere from 5 am until beyond midnight if they need it. However the environment created by coworkers makes it nicer."
