rating,review
bad,"The company were downsizing at the time of my employment. The older employees whom had worked there for years and years were in fear of losing there livelihood. So they were not sharing information nor were they happy to see a younger person on the job making a third of what they were making."
bad,"Management is god awful. No raises. Always increasing demand with no extra incentive. Only hear about the negatives, you never hear anything positive."
bad,"First job in the USA, Challenging work condition in 30+ degrees heat. Difficult transportation to work site. Good benefits though. I wouldn't want to work there again."
bad,"Management was lazy and had no respect for their workers."
bad,Not a professional environment to work in. Hours are long and stressful with low salary. To much fraternization between management and lower level employee's. I would not recommend Kodak as a place of employment.
bad,A great job for a company that eventually went under.  During my time I learned more about Quality control and leadership then for any other company... Miss Kodak
bad,Worst job I have ever had management are poor hours long without any real reward at the end of it and was never paid the salary I was due to get each month
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had. If you like working in a place where people stab you in the back, and no matter what you do it isn't good enough, then this is the place to be."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Kodak to anyone ever. "
bad,I was offered a job with Kodak and moved across the country only to be told the day I got into town that I will not be working from the company. RUN away from this company. If you tell anyone in Rochester that you got a job with Kodak they will laugh and said don't believe it until you actually start.
bad,"I saw this company change rapidly over 7 years.  Although I was a victim of downsizing, I observed a culture of management that rewarded consistency - meaning do what we've always done because the Kodak way is proven."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,The people at Kodak are absolutely great. Company had a wealth of resources.
bad,The former CEO was a moron and the management was even worse. Surprised company has not gone back into bankruptcy and closed the doors.
bad,poor lost job due to poor management and was hoping to end my career there lile so many other people
bad,"The enjoyable part of the job was working with co workers and servicing equipment at customer sites. Enjoyed working with customers and repairing/troubleshooting/maintaining equipment. Unfortunately, the company , to keep profitable would lay off workers,sell assets, etc. Not a fan of the way their CEO is handling the business. Should have stepped down a long time ago. Drove the business to chapter 11 and caused a lot of lost jobs/hardship for families already struggling."
bad,If it wasnt for the people that you worked with to make it through the day. The atmosphere wasnt good.
bad,Didnt keep up with technology and the digital age. Got outmatched by other camera companys like canon and nikon.
bad,Only work here if this is your only option other than mcdonalds
bad,A typical day at work is going over our work schedule for day or night then going to work.I learn recently how to make some of our film products.My coworkers are my friends here and outside.These people are down to earth and very friendly and when if I needed help there was always someone there to help.Hardest part of my job is working nights.The most enjoyable part of my job are the people that I work with.
bad,The upper management I. This company was blind to technology and stuck in the 1970s. They purchased a company in 2006 which would have helped them succeed and they dismantled it.
bad,"The people I worked with were great, the management an company not great.   Poor management, an if you don't fit in with the people that have been there for years they will get rid of you."
bad,"Execs here still have visions of relevancy and grandeur. Kodak was great in the 1970- early 1990s. Since then it has been a slow train wreck. Since the bankruptcy in 2012, the company is even worse. They have all the incompetent managers, but none of the good workers. They still belive they are going to sell $2000 FILM camcorders, where you PAY to get the film developed!  LOL  What idiot comes up with there stupid, retro, useless ideas?  It is sad when execs only look backwards and not forward.  The company will probably go into bankruptcy again because they don't really have any differentiated products."
bad,"Bad management priorities and policies created product problems and they didn't listen to what their customers were saying. The result was closed divisions, a bad work environment and bankruptcy."
bad,"aprendie serviços como o de fotografia,também aprendie sobre negociação e atendimento ao público,era agradável o companherismo dos colegas de trabalho."
bad,"Nepotism here!!  Nepotism  here!! Nepotism here!! Nepotism is here!! Management is horrible!! Nobody knows what they are doing. If your not related to somone that has been there for 20 years or more, they treat you like nothing!!"
bad,A typical day at this company started at 6:00 am and ended normally at 8:30 pm due to a lack of direction and structure.  The work life balance in this company is very unbalanced.
bad,"Journée de travail stressante , manque de personnel (sce client)"
bad,Moved around and felt like I wasn't part of the Kodak Employees left I did not feel that they cared about my 29 years and 6 months of service at all
bad,Kodak continues to shrink in size and narrows it's footprint in the market place. It continues to loose money year after year and is struggling to keep afloat.
bad,"In 4 years of working with Kodak I had 9 bosses.  The company changed leadership too much for anyone to be very effective.  As of the time of this writing Kodak has been in Chapter 11 for 19 months and they kept promising employees that they would emerge.  Recently they sold off 2 of its larger divisions and have laid off several thousand people. "
bad,"In the end of my career at Kodak, the Sales organization put themselves in charge of all Service. The intent may have been to sell more presses and give away Service pricing....to place more product.  Do not sense Kodak was compelled to give raises to retain Service Representatives.  Many, if not most, Kodak Service Representatives lost purchasing power for their families because of not even keeping up with the cost of living for many years......"
bad,This company desires to go places in the market place but isn't willing to spend the money to research new ideas. Poor planning and no visionary plan for the future
bad,"No direction, poor planning, no advancement"
bad,The company is a mess. They have layed off all the workers and kept all the management. Their overhead can not be supported with the current sales and products. They need a lesson on how to run a bussiness and it is not going to happen with the current management staff.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was to print picture, assistant people with their choice of the frames they wanted and creating collages . The management was great and respectful . The work place culture was to come in early, house keeping for every one ,excuse yourself if you late , 15 mins tea break and 1 hour lunch  . The hardest part of the job was to carry the frames to the workplace or placing them on the right places ."
bad,they will never be big again unless some new and fresh ideas come into play. I loved working there in the beginning but they changed management and the it was a nightmare. then they filed bancruptcy
bad,The electric motor shop was a great place to work from 1996-2008 a typical day was to repair emergencies motor\pumps\gearbox orders first test\inspect then ship back to dept. of origin. I learned a unsermountible amount of skills\knowledge. Management was strick but fair.The co-workers were always great! The most difficult part of my job was to complete my job on time and built in excellence to every job. the most enjoyable part was the gradtifacation  that comes with a satisfied  customer!
bad,It seems that every 5 years of so Kodak lays off the permanent employees only to hire in contractors. I should have known better as I was one of the contractors in 2005.
bad,"The work they give us is ok but there was never enough Brakes. The staff don't really listen to your needs. The payment for the hours you do is not brilliant.   it's mainley for single people who have no family or comments. "
bad,I worked at Kodak during their entire bankruptcy so it is very hard to judge my time at this job. Most employees were 20 to 25 year employees who were worried of losing their retirement and pensions and should not be blamed for the poor work environment
bad,I worked here too long ago to judge what it is like to work for Kodak today.  It is a much different company today and much smaller.  I don't think I would recommend it though.
bad,"Too many backstabbers, wasn't getting paid the amount I deserve to get, schedule was so crazy with the 2days & 2nights"
bad,This company is great the boss help out any way they can. The help make all the difference in the world anything they need. But they training could use more work they don't train people very well.
bad,I didn't have the best experience there simply because i was pregnant at the time so the supervisors would hassle me when i wasn't lifting  the boxes or was having a hard time standing for the full 12 hours
bad,"The Kodak location I worked at was located in the Knott’s Berry Farm theme park. A typical work day begins and ends with swiping a time card. Once clocked in you then traveling to your work location for the day, which may vary on a day to day basis. By working with this company I acquired cashier experience. As well as improved on my customer servos experience. I did not interact with the manager directly most of my communication with the main office was with his assistant. My coworkers were very patient with me during training.  They provided a comfortable atmosphere, and made me feel at ease. The most difficult part of the job would be the lunch breaks. You could not eat in front of the guest; you had to go to the break room which for me was on the other side of the park. I was given a 30 minute lunch break, but it takes 15minute to travel to the break room and another to travel back which would only give me 5 minutes to purchase my food and consume it.  What I enjoyed was photo graphing the guests, as well as printing and distributing photos."
bad,"I was only there for 6 weeks on an assignment. The place was awful. Too repetitious. The salary was great for what little work I had to do. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"Gestão totalmente autoritária e anti profissional, pois a mesma envolvia problemas pessoais com o cotidiano da empresa e funcionários."
bad,tinha atendimento ao público onde aprendi a lidar com pessoas.
bad,The company suffers from a poor strategy severely limiting the ability for employees to be successful.   I suspect that Kodak will no longer be a publicly traded company in 2 years.
bad,"Pay is not close to making job worth it. Pay is well below market and responsibilities are huge. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs."
bad,"There was no typical day at work. As Kodak struggled with downsizing, so did it's employees. I certainly learned to be flexible and to embrace change because change became a way of life. I had great co-workers and our local management [groupleaders, supervisors etc] were doing their best. The hardest part of my job was the constant uncertainty of the direction and more importantly the future of the company. I personally had a great job, self directed, results oriented and satisfying."
bad,The work is not hard at all. Expect you to be a team player but doesn't pay you enough. Don't be believe in the cost of living raise. Want you to work some of your off days after you have done your full rotation. They tell you have so many sick  days but will only pay you for two. Work here only if its your last resort.
bad,not a good place to work always looking over you shoulders for someone to tell lies about you  having to take blame for others mistakes and not a friendly work environment
bad,"Kodak was a very fun and exciting place to work. Until all the downsizing and the mis-management of a great company. Our team was always told run run run then stop, cant spend any money budget cuts all the time."
bad,Nice environment with a self paced attitude. Severe lack of opportunity as well as a non realistic job descriptions and requirements!
bad,"They just don't get it. The good news is that every business that they sell off is more successful after getting away from the big yellow ""K"""
bad,delivering film alll over NJ NY upstate NY and some local eareas stores . but some times it was hair pulling with a snow storm or thunder storm woyld make driving diffical.
bad,entrabamos a las 10am  y empesabamos a revisar los productos a las 11:30 nuestro almuerzo y regresavamos a las 14:30 y luego empezavamos a embalar.trabajar en equipo.eramos mujeres.el conteo de los productos
bad,Not a good place to work. Constantly downsizing. Employees are unhappy. so is management
bad,"A great oportunity to learn new things,good pay,great people,good work environment"
bad,"Great people to work with, but there is no future for the company"
bad,"You can get the experience and learn the basic things what the Designer must know but you can't get enaugh salary or other benefits to be satisfied, so for begginer designers this job is good but after 3-4 months you have to find the job where you are paid well."
bad,I do not like working at Kodak in Dayton OH. The work environment there is poor. They develop products that are not good for market. The managers do not listen to ideas from other sources.
bad,Based on company's current financial status they tried to keep everyone aware of opportunities for involvement. Management was in a difficult situation.
bad,"You are just a number,  management demanded your suggestions on how to be more efficient and profitable, then totally ignored them."
bad,Need Improvement for the sake of market and the existing employees before it closes fully . and also it need to consider new invocations and also invest more on new ideas
bad,Slow paced job I was an order picker I learned to operate the stand up forklift and the Cherry picker lift its not really a job where you can move up the chain of command
bad,"In a typical work day you can expect a certain workload to accomplish any given day.  "
bad,"Pay raises suck if there is one"
bad,I really dont have much good to say about a company that let its middle management bully them an run the company in to disater. Really you make people fill this out!!
bad,Managers are honest but overall issue with casting people out who perform. Spent many hours setting up processes and supporting multiple departments yet not considered for staff reductions. Not a company I would have worked for if I had known about the financial stability.
bad,"Kodak was full of opportunities and I was there at that time. If you worked hard and smart you were rewarded for your accomplishments. They promoted family activities and education which, helped make your personal life better."
bad,"Taking inbound phone queue calls from business clients."
bad,"Decent place to work"
bad,day starts at 7 am ends at 12 pm.
bad,"I work with all functions at various levels within Kodak (and outside customers) negotiating, drafting and finalizing Sales contracts for US and Canada regions. The day is interesting because you constantly learn new things, new products for Kodak based on different strategies and how to work with different people so that everyone's needs are met and done so, with respect. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is the constant change aspect, it is never the same day to day."
bad,"Terrible supervision , management needs to stand behind what they preach . same rules don't apply to everyone . double standard when it comes to advancement in the workplace ."
bad,"The Kodak plant where I worked is a mess. There's a general malaise that permeates the job site as none of the production workers actually seems to enjoy their job. The cause of which could be from any number of things. "
bad,"Review Maintenance logs from previous day and night."
bad,"Mostly Desktop support with a good mix of personal contact and communication. I have learned that while having a plan for everyday and goals to accomplish, I must always remain flexible and put the needs of the end-user first. The hardest part of my job is the instability of the corporation. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people."
bad,"Hard work, demanding from managers, supervisors and others working there. It is a stressful environment. Sometimes you need to go to places where no one works like vacant buildings, hot or cold no heat or A/C."
bad,"a typical day at work. I learned the ways they clean. The management had favoritism and bad attitudes. the work place was ok its just a lot of cleaning, which is your job but its cold inside, a lot of people for different departments. there was no hard part for me."
bad,"LOVE the job but, with the lack of corporate direction there have been continuing layoffs.  This has left all remaining employees wondering when they are next."
bad,"Worked 12 hour shifts rotating through 7 days, 365 days per year. It was great having 4 days off a week and having different days off gave me free time to accomplish many tasks. I learned all about the jobs along with safety, teamwork, government regulations and communication. I enjoyed the people I worked with and still am in contact with them and others that retired years ago."
bad,"La tienda no posee gran organización durante mi estadía y no cuentan con un salario suficiente en cuanto a las responsabilidades que posee un vendedor ordinario, ya que no existe un cargo exacto, todos los trabajadores realizan las mismas tareas."
bad,Felt an honor to have worked at a well know company as Kodak. Job was short lived but enjoyed to job and the people. Every job I was sent to a different part of Kodak. I could be working on a job at the Tower one day and then be on another out at Elmgrove. I think the company had a hart time forecasting its future.
bad,Challenging work environment sullied by current state of affairs
bad,"When I hired into Eastman Kodak and for the first 10 to 15 years I would have given 5 stars in most categories.  After 34 years and the bankruptcy, it is nothing like what it was."
bad,The co workers made this job do-able. The management was poor. Raises were inconceivable and benefits were non existent.
bad,I enjoyed the people and most of the work.  We got to learn a lot of new things seeing there were about 40 people in our department at one time and ended with 9.
bad,"cross training was great, communication between workers and management was not good, great co-workers, watching the company hold on to bad ideas that cost the company money and put them into bankruptcy, nice bonuses"
bad,If your looking to advance dont do it the people there are nice but that's if you are looking for growth this isn't the place for you managers dont manage and its ran unprofessional
bad,"Company has been downsizing for 20+ years with no end in sight."
bad,Company was solid in every area until about 2000.  Employees are truly the greatest asset.  The continuous need to conserve resources has been at odds with the rollout and committment to new and innovative products.
bad,I liked my job at met new friends liked going to work. was very productive  fun and got the job done.
bad,Was a good fit for me. Enjoyed working there and had good co workers
bad,"In 1979 when I joined Kodak it was one of the most desirable companies to work for in Rochester, New York. Now, unfortunately, the company has fallen on hard times and is no longer a prime employment opportunity."
bad,"I learned many things while working with the said company such as enhancing my skills in Adobe Photoshop, new design ideas."
bad,"Take photos of guests, sell photos to guests, edit photos of guests. work at a visitor center complex on government property, but not a government employee."
bad,"I start my day by seeing how many printheads I have to work on, depending on what is wrong with them gives me an idea of how long it will take to fix. Then I check my company e-mail for the morning.  My boss is great to work for, just not the company.  I love my job but no room for advancement or raises when my work load has tripled.  We had 10 people now down to 3.  I've taken over team leader position and all responsibilities with it. I enter data, gather supplies, troubleshoot, clean, organize, & etc. The hardest part of my job is when electrical failures happen on the printheads from shorts or fluid damage.  The best part is I work alone self motivated."
bad,"Worked 12 hour days and nights and went between several production jobs. I learned technical skills , computer literacy, safety awareness, and applied them to all my jobs. Had team meetings with staff and co-workers on a regular basis. Hardest part of job was working the 12 hour nights but it was do-able. Enjoyed troubleshooting and using computer software to evaluate process and product charts ; and also liked training and working with others ."
good,"data enter clerk, time sheets, good starting point to get back into work life. Freindly staff, very helpful. enjoyed my time there. good work life blance"
good,first line supervision
good,The no hard psrt to the job getting to no the people mangement is list to male employees more than females if you dont expect raises and medical insurance go up each year perfect place and 72 to84 week checks
good,"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL environment. Poor training,management and severe on the job drama. I wouldnt recommend anyone to work here. Racism isnt a issue but sexism is.....if youre a woman? Good luck. There is zero job security here...you can get let go if you disagree with anyone there.... hated this jobs ethics but the pay was awesome."
good,"While I was required to work long hours with supervisors who were less than helpful, the work was easy. Pay was decent but nothing to write home about."
good,"working in retail was quite hectic as the shifts were unmanageable and I worked 12 hour shifts 9 times out of 10."
good,"Kodak is not a bad place to work"
good,"Monitoring of production schedules and adjusting or changing where needed.  Monitoring of component inventory to keep the processes running, while maintaining inventory goals."
good,All employees start as conditional/temporary employees with review to be given after one year of employment but they did not give reviews until after a year and 6 months.  Then decided not to make conditional employees permanent. Most of permanent employees were conditional for anywhere between 3 to 8 years.
good,"Es una empresa excelente, con un gran ambiente de trabajo."
good,Kodak was a good place to work in the beginning but went down hill fast.  Co workers were good people and became like family.  Did not like shift work but was a way to earn money to raise family
good,Fun company to work for but upper management can be a pain it's the same company as Digiphoto Global and Kodak EIS. You will love it if you working at a cool site like Six flags
good,"Muy buen lugar para traabajar, hay line de carrera, lamentablemente Kodak quebro se retiro de Peru y ya no habia beneficio en seguir laborando con ellos."
good,I've been with the company and on the same project for many years.  I've been through many layoff events and no matter what they say it is very stressful even when you are not affected.  I've seen the same people in the same management position for years and they make the same decisions.  I've seen the desire to eliminate hardware several times and every time they have come to the conclusion that we can't do it because this is what is generating the profits.
good,Enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. When first started job was in one area one job. After layoffs more cross training and multi tasking. Worked in three departments near the end. Customer focus person was main responsibility along with quality testing.
good,I held several different jobs while I was at Kodak. I worked in areas that stressed being a team member and also worked in places where I had to work on my own. I have worked just about every different shift rotation that there is and I have no problem working any of them. I particularly like working nights. I have always had good relationships with my coworkers. I have never had any kind of arguement at work.
good,"Great people work for this company, poor management, big disconnect between upper management and the regular workers."
good,This company is currently in chapter 11 proceedings.
good,"management ""moderate"" . Two leads were OK one wasn't "
good,"either a lot to do or nothing, business doesn't seem to be going anywhere. doesn't allow for much time for a social life. not a bad job but lacks excitement and progression as well as a sense of accomplishment. no good benefits for young people."
good,The environment at Kodak is a tough one to endure.  It isn't so much the work or the people but never knowing how the company is actually doing.  Will I have a job tomorrow?
good,"The company changed so much when digital came into the world and Kodak did not want to accept that the consumer would be an active player in this role as well."
good,"If you have even half of a brain, then look for another company.  Many of the people you will run into are metal defectives.  And as for management, they are the most inept."
good,"Typical day at work, I worked at water park in Legoland, California. Absolutely, I felt like I was in military training in my country, Thailand. Because I had to stay under the sun all day, this job needs people who really have strong patience obviously. "
good,"New skills are always available if you are willing to take on new responsibilities.  People are friendly and always willing to show you something new or teach you a way to do the job in less time, such and batch jobs, scripts, etc.  There are many people at Kodak with great knowledge in IT positions and non IT positions, and they are always willing to share this knowledge and help you with any problems that might be presented your way."
good,"el dia tipico era con muchos nervios para terminar el trabajo, siempre fue muy serio el ambiente. aprendi rapides con las maquinas de coser. mi jefa siempre fue seria y no hablaba mucho pero meinsentivo en el trabajo. mi colega y yo nos llevamos bien y renunciamos juntas al trabajo por los nervios que nos producia. nos pagaban poco y estabamos todo el dia."
good,Working for the Dayton Operations was a wonderful experience until Kodak outsourced the entire general accounting department to foreign trade. Most of the people in the department had been employees for over 20 years. The Dayton Operations management worked very well together. It was sad to go.
good,"From the first few days in the Research Labs, I knew my time at Kodak was going to be filled with fun and creative challenges. I had the pleasure of working on many wonderful new and innovative products. I have learned how to use most if not all Windows PC Operating Systems and applications, Microsoft Office tools, and have been tasked with being the lead interface to CAD tool usage in China and PCB manufacturing in North Carolina."
good,"I was a contractor at Kodak not a direct employee. I enjoyed the work that I did and the people I worked with. The contract was for one year and then Kodak started layoffs, contractors were the first to go."
good,"self directed work"
good,"Constant meeting to stave and recover business to be on track for profitable."
good,"Co-workers were easy to work with, it was a team oriented place. Management had an open-door policy. The hardest part of the job was the shift work, especially working nights and 12 hours."
good,I preformed th duties of operating kodak ektaprint machines. Will machins are running I could sit at my desk and send out mailing for different departments.
good,place of work Monday through Friday 40 plus hours per week. Management is typical of most companies. I no longer work there so my input is insignificant to this employer.
good,if you like long hours..i mean long hours
good,"Good management,nice co-workers,Very good teamwork.Expect Lots of noise warm temperature,must be able to work at a fast pace."
good,"I would not recommend starting at this company now. The working condition are good, but the pay per perfomace is non exsistant"
good,A lot of good people employed. Work on state of art technology. However upper management is incompetent. Difficult time to work there because of Chapter 11. Benefits and bonuses are being cut.
good,"Love the people I worked with, but there wasn't room for growth or opportunities. A lot of people have been here 40 years and are just coasting. If there was better opportunity to grow and make a career I would stay."
good,"My experience at Kodak was how out-of-touch upper management was with the realities of the business. Often, it was apparent that they didn't at all care about their clients and often almost extorted them."
good,"It was a very decent company to work for until it fired for bankruptcy.  Good working environment with dated product lines and poor vision from the senior management, that eventually brought the demise of the company."
good,Bad memories of the layoffs in the early 2000's. This created a brutal and competitive work environment. Everyone started playing to not lose (covering their butts) rather than playing to win.
good,"Only worked there for a very short time. Kodak offered good benefit packages, health ins. life ins and 2 weeks vacations to start out with, Kodak also pay for school. that was 35 years ago."
good,"During my time at Kodak, you would get ahead if you brown-nosed the boss and were never late, but achieving excellence was optional."
good,"In my career at Kodak the employment in Rochester shrank from 60,000+ to less that 10,000. The company today appears to be more stable but much smaller."
good,it was good in the beginning but over the years things changed I think it is time for a changed but it was a good placed to work but some of the changes really put a sour taste in my mouth
good,Kodak was at one time a great place to work.  But due to the constant layoffs and downsizing the work environment was not productive.  I was affected in 2013 with layoffs.
good,"12 hour shifts on 2 day, 2 night rotation. Lacks incentives to keep good workers and terrible benefits. Job isn't hard, but must be able to learn on the move. Good co workers and makes days enjoyable but lacks structure."
good,Was a Great company having a hard time to make it in the digital age. Learned a lot with training but mostly on the job training. Many Good people to work with.
good,Was a good place to work until they lost huge markets and were forced to bankruptcy.  Now future there is uncertain.  Received invaluable training and experience there.
good,"Básicamente era un proyecto para digitalizar archivo histórico."
good,I enjoy my job and my coworkers. Kodak was the place to work years ago but all has changed for the worst... It is very stressful not knowing when the doors will be shut after 25+ years but life goes on and I will work hard no matter where I am.
good,Initially good company to work for.  Company constantly reorganizing and restructuring.  Top heavy in Management which caused problems.
good,"it was a fun job overall, the co workers were fun to talk to and hang out with, everyone got  along, management was good until the manager I was hired by was replaced and the new manager wanted out with the old in with the new so tried to fire all the old employes. Hardest part of my job had to be sitting in the sun for 8-10 hours a day, the most enjoyable part was talking with co workers while helping quests out, meeting new people and making friends."
good,"Its 8 hours of work as usual, Ive learn a lot of things like editing and printing pictures, handling kiosk machines, changing machine"
good,"strong team, little hours, and no benefits"
good,check for new issues that arrived over night
good,"I work 33 years at Kodak, I saw the best and the worse of Kodak working conditions. I can not say anything bad about Kodak, they have been fighting to stay alive for half of my career. Once digital photography arrived on the scene, they just could not come up with anything that was was profitable as silver halide techlogy"
good,My career at Kodak has been very rewarding. It is sad to see such a great company heading into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. I truly wish the best for Kodak in the future.
good,"Kodak has its heart in the right place and hats off to my direct manager (Kodak you need to give this guy a raise). He was great at doing his best to try and get me what I needed and stayed available for assistance when needed at any hour of the day especially being 3 hours ahead of me."
good,"I was responsible for brining three undercover FBI spies into Elmgrove because  it was a hotbed of illegal drug sales, not job sales. this was in 1985."
good,I have worked for kodak for 28 years and have enjoyed my career there. the company has changed over the years and is still struggling with management and a direction
good,Company went through Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012. Part of Eastman Kodak company was spun off into Kodak Alaris during the bankruptcy. I do not know much about Eastman Kodak to comment.
good,"Given the huge changes in Kodak's product base and culture, it is hard to write a review of the company that would be relevant today. My extended career at Kodak was rewarding."
good,"Use to be very competitive and a booming market as a field service engineer. However, towards the end management was nowhere to be found. Constant layoffs/"
good,"The potential of Kodak will never be realized.  Within it's environment they had a great deal of talent and knowledge.  The issue was always management being exceedingly conservative and not always up to speed with technology they managed."
good,The job lacked opportunity for advancement and compensation was well below average.  Management and other co-workers were very easy to work with.
good,"Work for Eastman Kodak for a long time. I've developed a lot of good friendships and have learned a lot of different job and skills that I can take with me in my new ventures. The company itself  is not what it use to be. Not only isn't it keeping up with the times and inovation of today but because of it the employee is losing out every year with bad heath care plans, low or NO bonuses and no raises"
good,"was a very good place to work in the beginning ,then was let go because  they felt I was using my vehicle to much when we signed a contract saying we  had as much personal use as you wanted"
good,Kodak is a great company filled with knowledgeable and very experienced people. Company just has to many traditional practices that ultimately lead to their decline.
good,Category management for high-tech equipment for the printing industry.
good,"The workdays were very long and the weather could get pretty bad. The pay was pretty good because of the hours I clocked in. The management was friendly, but not the most organized. The hardest part of the job was working 10+hours on most days. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the interesting people who visit Six Flags."
good,I Loved Working for Eastman Kodak years ago. Kodak Fell off dramatically and i beleive in the next 10years kodak will be gone
good,Over twenty years ago Kodak was an extremely large family that was concerned about you health and welfare. There was excellent changes of being rewarded for hard work. A typical day I would arrive a half-hour early to setup my day. Once the day began I was response for coordinating human resource requirements such as payroll and exemption changes. I would order office supplies as well as personal protective equipment for the operators to make chemicals. Schedule meetings for management; take inventory; distribute mail; answer calls; travel arrangements and travel and hotel arrangements for future potential employees.
good,Company provided me and my family a good living and had a great job
good,"great first full time job. enjoyed the supervisors, more of a relaxed atmosphere"
good,"They are a fun bunch and teach you so much about the products and all other info you need to know, patient and professional. It was a good place to build up a little bit of experience, even though it was short."
good,The Health Imaging Division was sold and therefore my employment was terminated.  I kept all my benefits and seniority as I moved into the new Company under new management.
good,"Goal Setting"
good,The entire time I worked for Kodak we were under the threat of layoffs. I was employed 27 years at that company and always feared for my job. When I was finally laid off just before their declaration of bankruptcy it was a relief.
good,"Kodak is no longer the same company that it used to be, especially after it went through bankruptcy proceedings.  And I have been retired from Kodak for 9 years so to force me to answer questions about Kodak now, is in my opinion, silly."
good,"had to work rotating shifts - days, graveyard, swing shift.  Hard to get used to one shift as we had to change all the time.  Other than that, not a bad place to work."
good,"The work was demanding and motivating. My coworkers were great people to work with, and my supervisors were smart and encouraging."
good,I worked for Kodak as they were in decline.  It was still a good place to work with a lot of smart professionals.  The company lacked vision from leadership which ultimately led to the company's failure.
good,The company is long since past its prime as an organization.  The management cannot make a strategic decision in the interest of survival.  The  culture is rigid.
good,"Due to bankruptcy, poor work environment caused by low pay, drastically reduced head count and diminishing revenue stream to support growth or sustainment of the products."
good,"As a long time Kodak employee, the good far outweighs the bad.  But the past ten years have been a struggle, as they attempt to redefine themselves in the post-consumer film era.  As a result of their struggles to grow, career advancement opportunities are limited"
good,Consumer Imagining and Digital Imaging were divisions of Kodak and sold to Kodakalaris in 2013.  These groups were divided into two separate investment portfolios.
good,"Job was exciting, challenging, and rewarding. Team enironment was excellent, I was sorry to leave - but the layoffs were coming to fast and furious to feel secure. Too many great folks with massive amounts of experience were let go due to continual fiscal loses."
good,"Being a manufacturing company with such a long history, they definitely are good in processes. Loved their product development methodology, worked with great people."
good,Worked as field technician servicing high speed copiers.  Copier division is no longer in business.  Maintained a mid state territory. Worked with a great team of technicians.
good,"When times were good, at Kodak, it was an awesome place to work.  I worked 30 years, here, and went through 30 downsizings until the company went bankrupt and my Department was closed.  We had a great Vision!"
good,"Kodak used to be the ideal place to work as we all know. When I was hired back in 1974 I was making $3.50/hr  \and $18/hr. when I left in 1998. It was back breaking work but very rewarding when you could constantly exceed expected goals. I loved my job and the people I worked with. Unfortunately when the layoffs started and Kodak began sending portions of the business out of the country, and hiring through agencies the job stability at Kodak no longer existed. I had to quit my job in 1998 because I became disabled."
good,"I enjoyed my years there. The first 17 years of my career were there and gained knowledge in quality, supervisory and the principles of lean manufacturing."
good,"I liked working for Kodak where I was (at Six Flags)... for about a week. Though the work is very easy (taking photos), standing on your feet in the sun and heat, and rain and cold for hours on end was not enjoyable at all. The indoor shops were barely better because they did not have A/C. Only get one 30 minute break for working 8 or more hours. Working for Kodak was fun was friends and the amusement park environment ,  but not enjoyable. But they were lenient in giving time off, which I did like. Overall it was chill, but jist standing in the sun all day wears on you."
good,I always enjoyed Kodak because you could learn multiple technologies without ever leaving your company.  When I was there it was so fun to go to work each day
good,"A lot of travel, but many experience in different markets and countries. Using a small group of people to generate a lot of sales."
good,Working at Kodak I meet a lot of great people from many walks of life.  The employees were hard working and caring. It is sad that the company has shrunk to such a small size.
good,"Same job spanned three different employers while the job remained the same. The job was new from the start as I had no experience in the manufacturing of image sensor chips used in digital cameras.. It required multi tasking in a clean room environment between numerous manufatcturing stations covering; coatng, exposing, developing and various quality inspection stations. It varied between complex automated and manual inspection of product to detect product defects. At times it was possible to rework defects detected. Other times it was the reponsibility of engineering or supervision to select the appropriate action to take. The job at times was staffed with multiple operators but often was a lone operator position. It required both standing and sitting to perform the many operations. The hardest part of the job was working in 12 hour shifts and working the C shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers."
good,filling requests for spare parts to repair machines and ship the parts where needed  Ship with UPS  DHL  overnight  or ground
good,Placing my feet into the office made me think of how much I enjoy being a janitor. Having great people to work with was a plus. The days didn't seem long enough because I like to make money
good,The early part of my career was in the construction of HVAC and batch control processes. This involved reading prints ordering parts working on site to complete on a timely manner.
good,"- Layback enviroment"
good,"It was very demanding during the day and working at night was very hard and stressful."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. It was very fast paced and I liked everyone I worked with. I had to quit because of school, but not I have flexible working hours."
good,"your selling constantly, shouting for people to check out there photos, work 12hrs a day doing the same thing over and over. it got really boring thats why i quit."
good,"During the time of my working there, Kodak was going through a very difficult period trying to realign and downsize the business.  The decline in demand for their traditional products had a great impact on manufacturing employee morale and overall business success.  My activities there were to keep employee morale up, make sure that IT projects stayed on track and on budget, and career planning for employees"
good,"each day is something new, unfortunately due to declining sales in the film business, the day goes by slowly."
good,"Run Test on Print Stations"
good,aquí aprendi a preparar pedidos embalar cajas y pallets archivar y armar pedidos con scanner de códigos también rigurosos controles de faltantes roturas y certificados de aduana
good,fun but changes and request are very demanding. ok bosses good co-workers
good,production working with 35mm film. light and dark rooms. examining for quality.
good,I enjoyed working with new projects and great people in the chemical and disperson plant. Introducing new technologies to save money in the dispersion plant was very exciting to me.
good,"I loved working for Kodak until for the past few years. You were always waiting for the next down sizing because you knew it was coming and always had to worry that you were next. A lot of stress. You go there to prove yourself that you can do a great job for the company, then you are told that your impacted in the massive layoff and your heart drops."
good,My career at Kodak was a wonderful experience. Employee values were extremely high on managements list. Benefits were very good and the work/life balance was extremely good.
good,"I am responsible for handling employment discriminiation matters and responding to state and federal agencies. I am also responsible for providing paralegal support on employment and commercial litigation. While performeing these duties, I learn about company policies and applicable laws. I don't manage individuals directly, but I am organized and am able to manage my time effectively and efficiently. I work well with my co-workers and am known to be a team player. The hardest part of my job is preparing responses to the appropriate agencies. It is important to prepare a response that is factually accurate and convincing to the other party. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new challenges."
good,"Good place to work, but got laidoff,great co-workers good management"
good,"Design, develop, and deliver training for various business groups throughout the Company from motion picture film to inkjet printing customer support."
good,"I did not like the uncertainty of the job my co workers were fine we did alot together, management was always secretive,I liked working in a high speed production enviroment, the hardest part was working in the dark"
good,The hardest part of the job was having to keep up with the high call volume from the retail stores.
good,My organization was involved in bringing a specific research technology to production. We worked well together as a team under stressful conditions. I was able to learn totally new skills which were outside my area of expertise.
good,Very flexible with work/life balance. All jobs I held included all necessary training to make it safe and enjoyable. My opinions mattered and my co-workers were the best.
good,examining ink jet modules
good,US account provides customer service for those who are using KODAK camera. You need to familiarize every designs and feature of each camera to serve customer better on their inquiries. Kinda boring.
good,"At top of the rock you had one job take pictures and try to get ppl to buy it, but the managers aways try to make it more than it was and love to play favorites"
good,"deep night assignments "
good,"The current management is not to blame for the condition that Kodak is in right now. It was selfish management in the early 80's and 90's that put Kodak where it is today.  I worked with great people. Every team I was on was concerned about the success of the entire team. Unfortunately, Kodak became obsessed with saving money instead of innovating. Now it's going to take Kodak a lot longer to recover, if they do at all."
good,I received a world of life experiences and accomplishments that could not have occurred anywhere else. Great people of the highest caliber eager to share knowledge of how the system work. Unfortunately pier reviews were nearly always frustrating.
good,"有限工作资源，需要很强的独立工作能力，以及团队激励能力。"
good,"The biggest disappointment with Kodak was the continuous downsizing of manufacturing operations. It was know at the time it was upper managements  goal to eventually shut down the Film making operation. This led to a disheartened work force. But even with that, co-workers worked together to do the best job they could every day of the week."
good,"Operating a chemical manufacturing process through a mod300 computer. Adjusting pumps, valves, feed screws, vibratory feeders and blowers to keep the process flowing at its optimum capacity. Trouble shooting & repairing equipment quickly & safely. Inspecting final product and packaging in many different types of packaging. Monitoring inventory & updating spreadsheets with shift production.I have learned many different jobs throughout the business and continue to learn. i get along with my coworkers and we have a good time most days"
good,"A typical day at work consists of working with customers throughout the day, responding to their issues and answering questions.   I also complete outbound calls to our accounts.  This requires professional and proficient communication skills. "
good,Good pay. Great Learning Experience! Worked in the scientific department. Clean environment and nice people.
good,"You are constantly on your feet and talking to people one on one on a daily basis. This job required an advanced level of social interaction and skilled in sales and marketing. EVERY employee is required to sell! For most people selling the products is the most challenging part of the job. Talking to people from all over the world is the most enjoyable part that I found in this job. However, the best preparation while working with this company is obtaining appropriate shoes that are comfortable and allow you to be on your feet all day with ease. I would recommend Dr. Scholls! The one thing I learned while working with Qualex/Kodak, is great techniques in regards to sales and marketing. This is a growing company and allows for advancement, but you must be willing to work fast paced ALL the time."
good,"A typical day at work was a mixture of smooth running machines and machines performing start-ups, product changes or cutting back for any number of defect problems found in the product. At Kodak I learned to monitor the machines for quality and mechanical issues and catch them before they became non- passable product issues and how to correct problems when they did occur. No issues with immediate management in my building but the company leaders let us down. I got along well with co-workers and most were dedicated team players. The hardest part of my job was when the machine that I was on had mechanical or quality problems that extended for long periods and nothing was made except waste. Making wide roll polyester base  requires a very large and complicated machine and occasionally problems can be extended as a result and it was never a good feeling to leave work on those days. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning all the skills that were necessary to maintain good product and putting them to work. Also very timely, successful major start-ups, product changes, experiments and other of the more challenging aspects of the job ."
good,"Easy job, great place for a first job. Take photos of guests at various locations throughout an amusement park. Then sell the photos. The guests are what made this job very horrid. Also harsh weather conditions, being outside, and standing for 8 hours. "
good,"Our work was outlined for us and we were entrusted to work with minimal supervision. Co-workers and mangement adhered to EOE/harassment policies making it an enjoyable, harmonious and safe environment to work in."
good,Great bonds with co-workers. Have learned many skills that I will be able to apply to a future position.
good,"Work varies from day to day, sometimes we have more work than we can complete in one shift and some days we do not have enough work to stay busy."
good,"The work varied, which made it more fun. LC/MS, LC/MS/MS and LC/TOF were the main tools and sample preparation and method development were interesting parts of most projects. Management was easy to work for and the co-workers were all high quality people. The hardest part of the job was the gradual down-sizing taking place over the last 20 years, especially watching friends and co-workers lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The most enjoyable part of the job was the excellent scientists and engineers I was able to work with."
good,"I have loved working for Eastman Kodak. This company took me on as a fresh new hire and has supported me through two major career changes. I began as an electrical engineer designing digital hardware, moved to writing embedded system software, and finally to image processing algorithm researcher."
good,Good place to work. Good pay and benifits. Poor job security company has field chapter 11 bankrupcey.
good,It's a good place for someone do not carry to much time at his/her shoulder. However people who working at Kodak so helpful and teamworker. Whenever you need help they always be around you.
good,"Kodak is stuck in a weird position, they want to be hip and cool, but they are afraid to move on from their old products (film, print, etc). The work environment was laid back and that was nice, but projects were boring and they didn't seem very valuable or ground breaking."
good,"Un ambiente bastante agradable, pero muy desorganizado en el periodo de mi estadía."
good,"I have been very fortunate to work at Kodak for the last 19 years i have learned and gained many skills that will help me in my life, my co workers where very nice people who i got to know very well at a working level and on a personal one, the managers always treated us well and it was like one big family, the hardest part of the job was making on the spot decisions that impacted the quality of the working day, the most enjoyable part was having so many good friends there."
good,Eastman Kodak was a fun place to work. There was a lot of room for advancement and the training that they gave you as a group leader or supervisor was excellent.
good,I was given government clearance to work on top secert projects as well as new product lines and enjoyed helping in solving problems that may occur the bosses were great to work for and enjoyed the different challenges that were given t me to solve
good,"Not a stable work environment, for business reasons, otherwise a good place to work."
good,salir a realizar los servicios programados
good,"Great company for many years but when film died, Kodak died with it. Sad."
good,It was a fun summer job. Help me build responsibility and character to better understand peoples needs. and how to tend to them.
good,"Nice place to work, the stability of company how ever makes you wonder everyday who is next."
good,"Kodak was a challange becase its declining sales and staff. Trying to maintain quality and morale within the company was very difficult. Most co workers were very knowlageable and helpful to resolving problems. I enjoyed trying to beat production goals set by the company, I liked to try to get more done than what was expected of me."
good,"I was in a fun environment, but standing out in horrible weather conditions was not fun what so ever. Co-workers were friendly and so was management. Customer we really rude at times but I learned to not pay it any mind. I have to say getting in six flags for free was the best part about this job. The breaks were not as long as they be because the walk to go get food takes up most of it !"
good,"Actually I don't have a lot to say as I joined it for only 3 months after my graduation then I moved to IBM, although it was good experience for me in client facing and work on logistics stuff"
good,Atendimento ao cliente e Operações de Vendas/Área Comercial
good,"My position at Kodak required extensive travel throughout the Western US.  I would start my work week on a Sunday or Monday, depending upon travel distance.  Once arrived at customers location we would start install and testing of Kodak equipment.  After a successful install, we would then train the costomer on how to use the equipment.  I was part of a very supportive and fun team."
good,Entreprise très humaine qui permettait au salarié de progresser
good,"Over the span of nearly 20 years at Kodak I was able to grow as a marketing communications professional with sequentially expanding roles and leadership opportunities.  I started here when the company was much larger, so was able to work across many of the businesses and product portfolios, learning my trade and maturing into an executive with broad, diverse, global experience. Today, I manage a team of 20 employees within Kodak's largest business unit - Print Systems Division.  I also sit on the CMO leadership team, helping to drive strategy for the overall company.  Over the last 3+  years, I've learned a lot about managing people and bringing a matrixed, WW  organization together to achieve much improved results.  This required a lot of planning work, team building and change management to turn a tactical and silo-ed team into a cohesive, highly-functioning marketing organization.  I have personally been fortunate to work for a tremendous boss alongside a great team of peers for the last 10 years - doing meaningful work and helping my management to find its voice, even in the most difficult times.  The hardest part of my job is working across the business units to achieve 'one face' to the customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is setting people on my team up for success and seeing them thrive when given new responsibilities and expectations."
good,This was a great opportunity to meet great new people and help others working within the company.
good,fue una buena experiencia labolal ya que fue mi primer trabajo y me sirvio para desarrollar la personalidad y desenvolver mejor el area laboral.
good,"I recieve and make inbound/outbound calls all day. "
good,Many days the operation of the machine set the tone of the day. There were moments of working in highly stressful moments considering the motion of how the product would flow through the process line processes.
good,"Aprendi mucho en este trabajo, pero al hacer muchas cosas como xej: atencion al cliente, manejar el sistema de gacturacion, estar en la caja con efectivo y manejo de maquinas de impresion, el pago era muy bajo por 45$ la hora."
good,It is a pretty typical call center. No real surprises here.
good,"Phenomical Company.  My whole family worked there.  I miss it.  They took care of their employees.  "
good,"Kodak products were an incredible item and company, but came to an end with technology and phone camaras, they stopped making the film which changed also to SD cards,, but otherwise , it was nice while it lasted."
good,Work is challenging yet enjoyable with not much change to be had.
good,"• Licensing strategy. Standardized a running royalty-based licensing program that generated revenues in excess of $120 million, plus additional revenue & cost savings from collaborative strategic alliance agreements."
good,was a great place to work until recent management changes.company is now focused only on shareholders and doesnt care about dedicated employees
good,I am also find the working. I am can doing my great job in working. Photography is my ambtion and my faction. 1 day i can coming the best photoshoot.
good,great place to work but the job has its down fall due to the bankruptcy and the company being sold very soon. new workers don't know if they will be able to keep their jobs.
good,I was able to work and develop my skills as a technician doing what most other companies have professional do.  I had great co-workers and even some great bosses to work with.  Enjoyed the work and the interaction with most of the professionals.
good,"A typical day at Kodak was interacting with customers, printing customers photos, cash handling, till balancing and opening and closing the store. My co-workers were wonderful to work with. The hardest part of the position was putting the chemicals into the machines because they had to be perfect measurements. The most enjoyable part of the position was the interaction with the customers as l love working in that type of environment."
good,"I learned lots of things, how to be a better person, skills on machines, fork lift operator,first aid responder"
good,Transitional period for the company. Minimal supervision at work. Fulfilling job in that you get to see a project to the end.
good,You could laugh and cut up as long as you did your job.
good,With the constant downsizing it became very stressful because you did not know whether you were going have a job from one day to other.
good,They have paid my bills. The work schedule is ok. the people I work with are good. managment needs to focus more on the good and not the bad in people.
good,"didn't see the digital age coming. old timers got away with everything. no room for advancement. had fun while it lasted, pay was good. that's all I've got to say about that."
good,"Lots of hardworking and job orientated people."
good,"enjoyed my 32 years with Kodak"
good,"love the shift hours! and pay. Clean environment. great location. Lots of room for advancement, very safe secluded place to be. Veryfriendly people that dont mind teaching how things work"
good,Kodak has been good to me through the years. Times have been difficult the past two decades with constant restructuring and leaning out but yet through all of that I maintained a positive and hopeful outlook for the future. The future these day's seems hazier than ever. Stock is below $4 a share and attrition has demanded more work with outdated resources.
good,"the company filed bankrupt and laid off its' entire sales force, so there was nothing anyone could do to prevent the lay offs from happening. it was a company that didn't change with the times"
good,"Kodak is still struggling after emerging from Chapter 11, but they will survive, and in the right position, you could be very happy there."

good,"10 hour shifts, 4x/ week. Nights every other week.  "
good,Kodak was a nice place for me.  I have learned a lot in regards to exposure to lean manufacturing and 5s.  They sent me for Green belt training and for leadership development.   
good,"poor management ,very likeable coworkers,learn to run and operate machine,hardest part of job is setting up machine to run good product and the most enjoyable part of job is working with coworkers."
good,"Kodak has been a great company to work for. I have had a number of different occupations while employed there. They are very flexible with work arrangements, even though I am a traditionalist in that I like to work on the job site."
good,"A typical day for me consisted of constant changes and challenges. It ranged from handling shipping and receiving duties to operating a coil room. I learned how to manage my time better and become a more accurate data processor while maintaining production for three operating lines. I enjoyed all my co workers because they were all hard working and dedicated people who didn't mind working together. The hardest part of my job was the rotating 12 hour shifts, working days and nights. What I enjoyed the most where the people I worked with. Everyday presented different challenges and change but the people seem always positive."
good,I took great pride in my ability to transform glass blanks into precision optical lenses. I was given oportunities to contribute in most areas of optical fabrication
good,"I learned that you cannot trust that thinks are as they appear with the people or the work,  very backstabbing with the people I worked with"
good,Kodak had a tremendous brand legacy but the senior leadership and inability to react to changing market conditions drove this company into the ground.
good,As an outside sales representative I was tasked with product sales as well as relationship and category management as well as merchandising (in many cases). It was a perfect fit for me on every level.
good,"Eastman Kodak was a great place to work at one time but with the advent of the digital camera(Which Kodak invented) , this was one of the biggest nail in the coffin. In my humble opinion Kodak forgot what it really was, a chemical company."
good,"trabalhava com vendas de fotos "
good,Challenging positions with excellent people to work with! The company is going through some tough times financially post bankruptcy.
good,"•	Sales assistant skills"
good,"es un gran trabajo y realmente me gusta, es solo que lo opuesto es terminar con la persona a la cabeza del trabajo y quería otro trabajo mejor También tengo mucha experiencia en informática y hablo muchos idiomas y también puedo servir para recibir clientes y otras personas que vienen a otros países.Sé que solo tuve que hacer una pequeña evaluación del local. Todos disfruto un poco más de mí, pero de hecho es un local muy grande en el centro de San Felipe. La propiedad se llama Ivar lemus. fotos y también vendemos productos para cámaras también reparamos cámaras e imprimimos fotos intanntanes"
good,"Everybody would come in and knew what their job tasks for the day would  be. I was exposed to a lot of different work conditions during my time there. Walking into dark rooms was a challenge. It was like a little city with cafeterias,stores,gym and even a bank."

I worked any many different environments, chemical, power house, clean rooms, dark rooms, alarm systems, PLC controls, Installing equipment over seas and in Mexico"
good,"Provide technical support and repairs for 24-hour, shift-rotating coating machine.  My daily duties included maintaining and monitoring process control systems and making equipment repairs as needed in a timely fashion to reduce production downtime (i.e. motors, fans, lights, switches, outlets, relays, timers, ionizing radiation devices, etc.)  I worked with other shift mechanics across several flows which allowed me to cross-train in other fields and be more of an asset to my employer.  The work was very physically and mentally challenging in part, because of its demand nature, and could take a toll on your body over time.  However, it was very rewarding to know that my efforts made a difference in the quality and quantity of film made available to people all over the world. The immediate managers were as supportive as possible in an arena that was undergoing some huge hardships and cultural changes.  There were occasions when the transition of a female in a male dominated field were challenging but the challenge has only made me stronger. I was blessed to have been employed with this company for many years but was eventually affected by one of their massive downsizings."
good,"Worked in many different production departments. Enjoyed the personalities of all the people I worked with, plenty of opportunities for advancement At the end management decisions turned out to be the downfall of the company."
good,"My time With Kodak was at period where the company was into numerous businesses and technologies.  I was witness to a monumental transformation unfolding before me.

I learned how to properly place a photo and how to approach people.  I learned how to sale photos.  Management was good and co-workers were fun to be with and they were on task.  The hardest part of the job was selling pictures for me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being with people."

good,"The company has undergone significant change in the last two years, including going into and emerging from CHapter 11 bankruptcy."
good,"Loved working here. Was able to converse with people from all over the world, stayed busy and the days just sped by. I loved my coworkers and management."
good,"Daily activities would be surrounding design improvements, new concept development, and production stabilization."
good,"I enjoyed a rewarding career at Kodak and I'm proud of my accomplishments there. I managed all aspects of Kodak's product packaging from creative conception to production artwork. I worked with talented, dedicated people. Seeing Kodak branded product packaging at retail in my the packaging I designed is extremely gratifying."
good,"An incredible learning experience, great people, meaningful work, flexible schedule."
good,I typical weekend would consist of going to either Walmart or Sam's Club and talking with customers about Kodak products and letting them know the Pros and Cons of different products.
good,Very nice environment.
good,"Aprendi muchas cosas, como x ejemplo tomar fotos carnet pasaporte ,dni, y tambien a atender muy bien al cliente, dar a conocer nuestros productos."
good,"Lots of rich history and traditions! Based in Rochester, NY, Kodak was the first to introduce the digital camera. We have an outstanding line of printers and are moving towards being the best partner for your business needs."
good,Many good years and many good people at Kodak. Managements move to consumer electronic space fail very disappointing.
good,"Arrive early to set, setup all components of production, assist with shooting, wrap. I learned the creative process of documentary filmmaking, teamwork, and history about the subject being filmed (in this case the Holocaust). Management was good at directing staff. My co-workers made the experience more enjoyable and aided in the learning process. The hardest part of the job was the commute over an hour away, the job itself was very enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the director and aiding in the creative process."
good,"Great variety and many opportunities. Otherwise, no comment."
good,The Eastman Kodak location in Kettering Ohio is the main hub for the research and development of their new line of commercial high speed printers.
good,I have enjoyed working for Kodak after 20 years. I have been able to move within the compamy and feel like I have made a difference. My immediate managers have always stood beside me and had the confidence in me to to do the right things in regards to my position. I am thankful for all Kodak has done for me and my family.
good,"Over my 20 years at Kodak, I have learned so much and have taken on an exponential number of responsibilities.  I have always prided myself on being very responsive to the requests and needs of the various business units of the company.  The hardest part of the job is prioritizing in this ever increasingly demanding environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with both locally and around the world."
good,Management failed the employees at Kodak that gave everything for the company.  That being said it was a great place to work with great employees and co-workers
good,Legacy of world class scientists in a collegiate working environment continued to produce scientific break through's.  Lack of vision by middle and upper management to capitalize on research led to the  elimination of corporate research in 2018.
good,Was OK to work at but lack of advancement within the company and management was OK but could have done more.  The culture was good and moderate.  Fixing the product was the best.
good,"Working at Kodak can be rewarding and stressful.  They have some excellent managers, some not so.  They continually tinker with the organizational structure, which at times can create employee and customer ambiguity.  The customer and field support teams communicate hard and often within that culture and make the work enjoyable and customer centered."
good,As a research Associate I spent the majority of time in advanced engineering creating new technologies to meet the demand of new products. This type of work is fun and extremely challenging. Kodak provided a great working environment and although there were always deadlines and reviews the focus was always on getting the job done right. Kodak people and management are very supportive and mutual respect is much higher than in most large companies. It was easy to get up and go to work everyday.
good,I loved working here and while I was developing skills and learning new things I was very happy. The odd shift work and lack of advancement opportunities was really the reason I left to find a new opportunity. I had advanced as far as possible and did not think I would be satisfied in another 10 years without developing new skills
good,"launched dry chemistry analyzers for hospital and physician office laboratories in W. Pa., and W. Va. "
good,Eastman Kodak is currently in Chapter 11. The company has been cutting businesses to reduce costs and focus on the core business it wants to be.
good,"I was an apprentice in the machine shop at the Kodak Elmgrove plant and worked B shift for many years, setting up and using grinding machines."
good,"A contract position of limited duration as the company continued to move into new businesses after the decline of the traditional photography market. Overall, a nice place to work, considering the intense pressure the company was experiencing. My managers, supervisor, and co-workers all worked to keep things as pleasant as possible, while maintaining high standards and fulfilling the needs of the business."
good,"I was a software engineer with three or more projects ongoing at any one time. It was hectic but fun, I enjoyed going to work each day."
good,"Exceeded the productivity goals for spooling work in 135 films Darkroom room operation, Coached multiple shifts on production and training issues."
good,At Kodak I Worked on an elite team of demonstration specialists to support the sale of Kodak’s Portfolio of Printing software and hardware. It was great to work with the latest and greatest software and hardware Kodak had to offer to the printing industry.
good,"A great company once upon a time, but a victim of a train of bad choices and arrogance. Still a great culture, but the stress of years of watching good people laid off, round after round after round, takes its toll. They did treat people well in severance packages. Glad I worked there, too bad so many short sighted decision makers set so many harmful objectives."
good,"I was harassed by my team leader for about fifteen to 20 mins., for making an adjustment on the process line (sheeter)  because the length of the plate was out of specification. I had worked this position for about 10yrs., and the team leader which  was brought over from the Finishing department about one year prior. I can honestly say that I was and am a dedicated worker and have given the company 110% percent., but when you bring over your friend to better their advancement, is simply sad for the Operator that has actually been on the job hands on for this amount of years can really make you feel like you’re pretty expendable and it ruin my career at Kodak after 14 and half years of service. I am still hurting over that situation."
good,Did no embrace digital technology as it ate into existing print/film portfolio -- eventhough they owned many of the digital patents. Work environment was strong.
good,"All of the good reviews on here about how Kodak culture is good for their employees goes way, way back to George Eastman who set the standard for taking care of employees. I am surprised it is still around with all of the numbskulls who tried to loot and destroy the place with their modern, ivy league business management styles. They've gone downhill due to the loss of the film demand, a technological change beyond their control. Kodak was always a film company, not a strong camera company, even though a person there invented the digital camera. It's tough to compete globally with cameras- they are all the same. I won a Kodak digital camera in a lottery once like twenty years ago, and it still takes great pictures- go figure."
good,"Sales calls on local and regional grocery and drug store chains. Covered parts of a 5 state area on a monthly basis. Did technical training to employees of contracted one hour labs, Taught up selling, customer service, has-mat and chemical handling. Reviewed upcoming advertisements.60,000 miles driven yearly."
good,I worked with a fun group of people.  We all seemed to get along well.  We did our job and went home.  It was a nice place to work.  I left to be home with my kids.
good,Worked on a lot of engineering drawings for the copier division at that time. Small group that was very and present to work with. Unfortunately that division does not exist any longer.
good,Film is almost dead. Kodak needs to bring in revenue with new innovation and technology. The Culture is stuck in the 1980's and has great need to upgrade.
good,Overall a good company.Seen a lot of the USA with this company.The benefits were top notch and the pay was good.I ended up with a terrible boss and I complained to HR about him but nothing happened.I guess thats what happens to Vets with some mental issues..They never asked me about my military service.
good,"When I first started at Kodak it was an awesome place to work ,but as time went on it changed as did ownership,managers ,etc. At the present they are working short handed, and are not planning on filling positions as needed."
good,Trying hard in a competitive set of businesses.  Great products with wrong marketing.  Need to get the company growing again in their primary businesses.
good,Worked for Kodak for 26 years before down size in May 2012.  Enjoyed work environment and co-works.  Worked as Buyer for digital accessories doing purchasing both overseas and the US.
good,"This position taught me many skills such as how to use cameras, what makes a good photo, organization, socializing, good judgement and problem solving skills. The experiences I went through with Kodak provided me with knowledge I can use in future jobs."
good,"Was there a long time, made some outstanding friends including my last supervisor. Shift work was tough, but good team work helped a lot!"
good,This job was my first experience in manufacturing and it was a great learning experience for me.  I was able to learn many difference aspects of the film emulsion process as well as what it took to work a swing shift.
good,"A typical day working for kodak clock in, set up your camera  go out to your assigned spot and ask  guests if they'd like a photo.while I worked at kodak I learned how to operate a Nikon camera and use a specialize photoshop program along with how to use a cash register.Management is good, schedules out in a timely manner usually open to schedule changes.great co-workers fun and easygoing always willing to help if needed.Working in harsh weather will be the worst such as heavy rain,hot sun and cold nights but working as a team to make the job or event running smoothly is really enjoyable."
good,Management was selling out parts of company to make film only when film sales dropped nothing to fall back on. Management only looking to take care of self and not long turn of company
good,"I spent the best years of my life there. Had some really great colleagues."
good,Worked in many research departments with top notch scientists and engineers. I learned a great deal about vacuum coating and processing from them
good,"A typical day would include reviewing morning actions and working to close them out. Attending status meetings and updating as required."
good,"work from home."
good,"Based on my University Thesis, I have prove the concepts of operation Optimization based on processes, tools and systems implementations. I have learn the  magic of combining teams, concepts and knowledge t make things happen!! that was my first job...see the results, the savings for the company, customers happier and employees feeling the enjoinment of being par of a team and together succeed."
good,"Kodak and the people I have worked with have great potential, but poor direction."
good,i wore many hats had several jobs at Kodak I also worked at several different departments for almost 17 yrs always had good attendance and great work ethic
good,Great Company for many years!!  Hardworking teams in a rapidly declining business
good,"A typical day at work began with checking emails,text and Lotus Notes from corporate laptop. Prioritizing off site calls with the corporate needs and travel time. Repairing equipment(ie. replacing HHD,motherboards,PBAs FRUs),and or ordering replacement parts,and installing parts either next day or 2 day delievry. If corporate dictated,bought parts with American Express Corpoate account to expediate customers productivity. Close calls (or put them on hold until parts have arrived via UPS,FedEx etc.) with corporated Black Berry App or corporate laptop.Check with District Manager and or other Field Engineers that required help. If problem persisted longer than perscribed time informed District Corporate Managers and Customer Managers.Attempted to close 5 calls a day between a distance between Warren,MI and Perrysburg,OH. When needed performed duties as perscribed through District Manager and Corporate. Maintained coroporate automobile(GE Fleet or PHH Fleet), corporated gas card(accounted for travel with reciepts) and corporate AMEX card(Gelco). The hardest part of the job was recieving defective parts from corporate(ie. $25,000.00 Laser or AOM drivers shipped from California DOA) and explaining to a angry customer that I was on top of getting there equipment up and running.Also, I had an incident where I set up a network with 6 kiosk computers. The customer IT department kept saying the issues the could not ping the site. Ten hours later they discovered the were on they plug into the wrong site. My main pleasure is when my customers thankd me for making there jobs and lives easier."
good,"Serviced a client base of more than 50 customers spread over three states. Serviced digital imaging hardware, software and multi-vendor storage / server equipment. My co-workers were team players and easy to work with. A lot of travel during the day. The customers were a delight to work with."
good,I worked on documents and used workflows and error logs to correct issues to have the flow of product to get from sensitizing to finishing.  My co-workers were wonderful to work with.  I learnt so much while I was at Kodak.  I used Microsoft applications and Lotus Notes on a daily basis.  I feel I am an intermediate user for those applications.  I used SAP also in many different screens.  The hardest part of my job was watching the company go in a downward trend.  It was a company that was so successful.  I loved working with everyone and had a good connection with all
good,A Typical Day At Work Taking Great Photos And Making Sure The Customer Is Satisfied And Keeping The Place Clean.
good,"I can say that Eastman Kodak allowed me to give my family a good life. The company was a manufacturing ICON, in it's day. it truly saddens me to watch the company struggle through these changing times and I feel it is time for me to move on. "
good,"Typical work day consisted of calling customers and planning where and what accounts were in need of service for the day. After the planning I would go to theses places and service many different types of equipment. Each customer was different in equipment and in need."
good,"Kodak was a company that would take a kid, fresh out of high school, and give them the tools that would help them grow and develope into knowledgeable and productive adults with skills they could take with them, wherever life leads them."
good,"Most days at work provided new and challenging opportunities in which my skill sets and abilities were utilized to their fullest. There was great comaraderie between myself and co-workers, production workers, and supervision. There were ample training activities and growth opportunities throughout my long career at Eastman Kodak. The most difficult part of the job was the time I spent away from my family working 12 hour shifts and a great deal of overtime. The best part of the job was a feeling of great accomplishment for providing reliable and consistent support to the production departments in keeping their equipment running and minimizing downtime."
good,The hands on work that I do is interesting and always keeps me challenged
good,"Has always been a great place to work, have enjoyed working with so many creative people"
good,"I worked as a material handler moving product, loading/unloading trucks, delivering needed inventory, and shipping and receiving. Data entry using SAP. I trained operators to drive and operate fork lifts with class room and hands on. The most enjoyable part was training. I love working with people."
good,"Normal work day, 8 - 4:30 every weekday. Most positions don't require overtime but salaried employees are expected to work as needed when needed. Hardest part of the position is working with the back office to solve customer problems that are usually caused by back office."
good,"A typical day here was check my car inventory and /or my satellite inventory, then looking at what calls I had scheduled for the day. If I didn't have much scheduled I would check for what PM's were coming up , or with co-workers in near by territories to see if the needed help."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kodak, but was impacted during one of the layoffs during 2011.  The company had great benefits and I enjoyed the area I was working in.  I also enjoyed investigating corrections when the machines went down, and the people I met."
good,The Job was good to work there I love the employees that had to training me and I had to training new employees. And go to different floor to help employees.
good,I liked my time at Kodak and the people I worked with but they decided that it would be cheaper to out source there job. This caused me and other employees to be lay off.
good,"Pros:"
good,Worked there for 20 years - enjoyed the job but the management drove it into the ground and there is not much left of it. Would be skeptical for those interested in working there as viability still uncertain.
good,Eastman KODAK is always restructuring on every quarter. There are constant layoffs within the business.Hard to find stability within the business model
good,"Good Job, Good People, Interesting and Challanging I have no more to say just typing because you wouldn't let me close this window without doing so. I hope you guys have a great day."
good,"Economic conditions have made things more difficult for this one time giant.  Management strategies, CEO changes have been difficult.  Direction and focus has changed from photography to now printing."
good,"When employed by Kodak.you could always learn and move ahead by trainning and on the job trainning,i felt it was a great work experience"
good,"I have been with Kodak for 12 years and have gone through the toughest times in the company history. We went from a 28 billion dollar company down to 2 billion in this time due to product discontinuation, downsizing and legacy product reductions."
good,"I had a variety number of jobs at Kodak.  I learned about the big corporate culture, worked with many different people, had a lot of versatility, and the most I learned about people, there are a lot of really good people!  Even though Kodak was so big, what ever job I had, it was like our own little company (each department), but we were all incorporated into the big company."
good,Lead a group of senior managers and executives to build out and agree on a set of SOW (Statements Of Work) that enable the business to stand alone
good,"A lot of diverse individuals, but all worked together to produce a high quality product.  Also, when issues were encountered, everyone pulled together to resolve!"
good,"The days were eventful yet the average day ran into lengthy hours.  The management was too concerned about personal image over employee or client relationships.  The best part of this job was being able to get out into the open air and to travel locally to various locations.  The hardest part of the job was the super fast growth and the managers ability to hire enough manpower to keep a stable work environment.  Health and Safety were at times looked over to accomplish the task at hand.  A great team effort was established to work together to help lighten the load, this by far was the highlight of the employees work ethics."
good,"The whole time I was at Kodak I drove a van and picked up and delivered packages , envelopes and totes. I always liked my employees and supervisors which I found easy to work with"
good,"Was a great company until the ceo destruction of the company. Great money, healthcare, and people. Very poor choices made by upper management."
good,Worked at customer site to fix equipment. It was gratifying to meet an upset customer but the time you have finished resolving their issues the customer would be very happy. Good thing about the job is that I was outside driving from customer to customer
good,"A typical day at work for me was never the same as any other. I learned to always be ready whether it rain, snow, or even during the summertime through a resilient week of heat. The management and staff of my fellow employees worked together as we consistently met quotas. Communication was well developed between my co-workers and I, this made it possible for us to reach above and beyond our quota. The hardest part of my job was probably the weather, it's sometimes made it impossible for us to meet our quota due to thunder storms or any other critical weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of working for KODAK was meeting new people and bringing smiles to their faces. It made me feel like I was preparing them for one of the greatest experiences of their life."
good,Very knowledgeable co-workers but their customer skills were not very good. The emphasis was all about solving problems fast and moving on to the next. They didn't always take the time to hear the customer (other Kodak employees) out. The result was unnecessary repeat visits. The best part of the job was the praise I received from my customers. The Chemistry department contacted my supervisor so that my tech-services could be dedicated only to them. The hardest part of the job was leaving the Chemistry department for a new job with benefits.
good,Kodak SD Inkjet was an exciting and fun place to work.  A lot of opportunity to learn and grow professionally.  Really satisfying to know what I contributed made a difference.
good,"too bad this company dissolved"
good,"Hitech company, with great products"
good,"It was great to work with many different teams of engineers, designers, and graphic designers to achieve a common goal."
good,"As a product engineer I worked to solve many different types of problems that hindered customer satisfaction and product robustness. Naturally, there were software and hardware improvements to develop, but I also worked to support customer issues, develop training materials, and even improve manufacturing reliability."
good,"Una empresa en donde todos los trabajadores nos llevavamos bien , habia respeto, lo malo es que no cumplian con los pagos de gratificación, ni dias feriados"
good,"Worked twelve hours the hours were long, but the people were great to work with."
good,"Eastman Kodak Company was technically one of the highest value company in the world. There were three divisions within Kodak; I was employed within the Eastman Chemical Division. During the earlier part of my Kodak career, most of the projects involved preparation of photographic chemicals. These chemicals involved many chemistries where product consistency was one of the utmost concern."
good,Great experince. All my co-workers were great. They all help each other with anything. Management needed to be more organized and up-to-date with employee's schedules.
good,"We were a full service company. Self insured, internally educated and trained. Great company to work for until the digital market took away their cash cow."
good,"Great place to work for until their site started to close down in the parks. management was great, co -workers were great also, taking pictures you meet alot of interesting people."
good,"The company used to offer many self educational programs to employees so we could better ourselves. Employees didn't get the company in trouble, the upper managements decisions did."
good,"The people are good to work with, they are helpful and friendly."
good,"For the majority of my 20+ years with Eastman Kodak, this company was a fun yet productive place to work. Overall compensation (i.e. wages, benefits, bonuses) was excellent. The management team was good despite being a little to conservative at times. Job security was almost assured. The opportunity for profession growth was excellent and was encourage by continuous education support."
good,I do not really know how Kodak is to work for today as I have not been there since 2015 but during the time I was there I was satisfied with the flexibility and overall satisfaction that field work often delivers. There was a lot of road time though ...
good,"Great job if you want to not stay confined to one area, room to learn multiple products, great training program, lots of support when you have issues,"
good,"I have worked at Kodak for 28 years before leaving the company due to a outsourcing of my job to Germany in 2012. I was asked to come back 4 years later and was happy to do so. It was a great company to work for in the 80's when I started and it is still a great company today although it is much smaller. My only complaint with the company is that there are no raises for anyone other than management. There are people that I work with who have not had a raise in over 10 years. I was recently given a excellent job performance appraisal and was also given a pay bracket change. In the past, a bracket change meant a pay raise. This time the bracket change came with no raise. I was told that the company is not making money right now but if in the future we do start to make money I will be in line for a raise. It was hard for me to wrap my head around that. I have never been offered a raise with no money before. I believe this was done as a way to let me know how much they appreciated my work but are still are not going to give you anything for it. I always try to give more than expected in any job I do and that will not change because of this. It is just difficult sometimes to know that the managers get raises for achieving the high scores on the department matrix, but the people on the shop floor get nothing when we are the reason for the high matrix scores."
good,"Wow, 28 yrs. Great company. They hired me right out of the Navy. Wonderful advancement opportunities. Started as a maintenance mechanic and advance to Controls Engineer. Bad corporate decisions and directions ultimately put the company in bankruptcy. I chose to leave after the company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy  in 2012."
good,"a typical day at work would be back up trailers and unload them"
good,"Major technology shift over the last ten years with film going away. Allowed freedom to develop new processes and products that now form the backbone of the new Kodak. However the company still clings to some of the old ways and many find it difficult to adapt to the new way of doing business. Still a product rather than a solutions provider, inflexibility and slow response are key issues. Always impeccable quality and highly innovative products"
good,"Kodak is a legendary company with a rich history of technological breakthroughs in imaging.  Imaging has changed, however, and Kodak businesses are trying to compete with many electronics companies."
good,"Kodak during its busy years, gave engineers tools, training, I worked in Advance Development, the team was excellent.  Also had the best current engineering team.  Everyone worked as a team. Knowledgeable of their products."
good,"A typical day at work included taking photos of guest at certain photo opportunity's. As well as sell the photos to guest. Interact with guest throughout the park, and provide customer service."
good,"If is unfortunate that I was there during Chapter 11.  I gave up my position so that someone else could stay.  I felt that many long-standing Kokak employees got the shaft.  I had struggled with another inexperienced manager, but he at least had a heart and some compassion."
good,"Kodak was a really good company for most of my career. As sales declined it became more challenging and stressful, but that was only towards the last few years I worked there. Very good managers that were willing to mentor and train others to improve career opportunities. "
good,Employer took good care of its employees. Provided a nice work environment with good benefits. Gives people the chances for advanced and provides chances to improve your education.
good,Learned a lot of Productivity in The retail shop as it has build my working experience because now i am able to deal with customers and Pressure in  any working environment
good,KODAK in its heyday was a good company to work for. Compensation and benefits were excellent. Co-workers were great and became friends outside of work. Still see some of them on occasion. Places of employment like this are unfortunately gone for good.
good,"Being a firefighter at Kodak was interesting. I never did not want to go to the job. I was able to help people, while at the same time protecting the assets of the company. Its sad the top management had to make so many wrong decisions that destroyed the company."
good,Great Place to work! Very helpful coworkers. Friendly people with good attitudes and good work ethics and very safe and quality focused work place.
good,"really enjoyed my time at Kodak,really nice people,good perks.It was a fun working enviorment..Sorry I left. Still have a lot of friends there"
good,I was with Kodak in the glory days and I was there during the rough times. Kodak printers are still very good products and challenging to work on and Kodak trained Field Engineers are among the best in the business however lack of new products and inconsistent messages from management clouds the future of the company in the print industry. The workforce there is about as lean as it can get.
good,I loved working there.  I gained so much knowledge.  I loved the expertise of the older people who had worked there and felt sad when they left.  Poorly managed now.  I miss the family atmosphere we had together in customer service.
good,"The company was changing daily, Had to learn new skills every year. Had to be willing to change jobs at any time. Production areas were well managed."
good,Left 25 years ago when it was a great place to work.  Loved the comaradarie with fellow employees.  Overtime when required was not an issue.  Decent pay
good,"On my first day at Kodak in 1996, I was walking up to the building I was to work in which was one of hundreds in Kodak Park. My building was over a quarter mile long and three stories high. I was thinking, ""It would be very easy to be overlooked in a company this size."""
good,Extremely long flight hours with short periods of time in between flights. Always arranged for co-pilot when necessary. Very well organized. Days of film and labs for developing film.Excellent management team. Well qualified employees and contractors.
good,Very nice and big company good products nice place good team managements.
good,"For my internship, I served in the Corporate Audit Department."
good,"Always there 30-40 min. before start of shift , coffee and talking about our weekends/days. Going to assigned areas , reviewing the day schedule for product mix , check times for processing or sending materials , checking lotus notes for changes or meetings. Learning was an every day process as things were changing constantly and then applying it to the job. My co-workers were absolutely the best , after 31 years it does become a family. After 12 hr. days/night shifts the hardest part was trying to get your outside life in synch , in the beginning they would let us play cards during lunch , that stopped. Management was always changing every 2 yrs. most were very good to work for in the beginning and they rated/praised you for the excellent job done with raises!!! Then they started to take your wage brackets and reduce them as they would reduce your salary not by .25 or .50 but $2 to $3/hr. even though you did nothing wrong and there was no documentation stating that you were a problem in or for the company."
good,"Start from home to first customer, repair unit and complete preventative maintenance. Proceed to next job work order. Assist other servicemen with difficult repairs and or customers. "
good,"Durante los 21 años en que he estado ligado a KODAK, ha sido una empresa ejemplar, que ha mirado por los empleados y en la que ha primado el bienestar de los mismos."
good,"Typical day here was very interesting made the day go by fast, taking photos of tourist while being near the historic background of NASA."
good,"I worked in packaging, warehouse, and computer operations."
good,"The company is not what it once once was, opportunities no longer exist. The training was excellent and the culture used to be vibrant and exciting. Kodak's future is not going to be centered around manufacturing."
good,I am working with a great management team. My direct supervisor is fantastic and hard working. We have a great teamwork based environment. We are also very encouraging to each other. The most difficult part of the day is locating the people on the boat after we have captured their photo. The best part of the day is how well we get along. It helps to make the day go by smooth. I have learned how to manage large groups in a single photo and presentation of the photo for sells.
good,It's a fun place to work with a lot of good benefits.Company encouraged workers to take college courses that might benefit the worker for the future.
good,"During 25 years as a Kodak staff photographer I enjoyed meeting and working with many fine individuals both in and out of the company. I had the use of the finest camera and studio equipment with which I used to complete a very wide variety of assignments both in the studio and on location, the latter both in the US and abroad. My co-workers were, for the most part, very friendly and helpful, although some of the veteran staff members harbored some resentment over the first several years after I joined the photo department as their youngest member. Overall I earned the friendship and respect of most the people I had contact with, both in and out of the company."
good,a day of work would be several thousands of people coming in very busy fast pace environment.
good,Industrial maintenance setting. Steady workload. Clean room environment on occasion.
good,Well scheduled and maintained production systems and teams. working in a dark enviornment with challenging material requirements and an uncertain future business.
good,While employed at Eastman Kodak
good,Kodak was versatile giving many objectives to do. They helped with
good,"Kodak was my first job after finishing grad school. It was a great learning experience and I did much to hone my skills and education. Worked with advanced statistical tools, computers, and software."
good,"Had to work all three shifts"
good,se fut mon premier travail d'une durée de 13 ans avec plusieur changement trés valorisant
good,"Kodak was a wonderful place to work.  The job paid well, had a good work/life balance and offered interesting projects to work on.  It was disappointing to see such a grand old company go down so quickly."
good,kodak typical day at work is laid back. I learned the process of the webbing and how to chemically balanced the bathes. there is nothing hard about the job
good,I felt important in my job and i was appreciated the company took care of us there was always someone there to lend a helping hand i microfilmed documents and stored them in order it was a avery repititive job
good,"I worked at Kodak when is a very large company. the work was rewarding and the pay was good. However, like may companies, Kodak moved most of its manufacturing to China."

good,"In the 80’s it was likely one of the top companies in the area in which to work.  By the time I elected to leave, there had been a series of terrible business decisions made, the company’s direction had changed and the market changed.

good,I worked at Kodak for 30 years and was one of the last department to get outsourced.  You really don't know that you had it made until you move south.  The culture is so different.  No processes in place.  Slow moving.  Not as friendly as people think.  We were a family.  The training Kodak provided for me open a lot of job opportunities in the south.  Want to say Thank-you.

good,"Hooray for is a great place to work when I started there. It was a very family oriented company who was change direction and your well-being, your education,  and your career. They were very much into promoting you in the areas  you were interested in pursuing. They were very fair and their salary structures and they were very fair in  rewarding you financially if you did a good job for them. It is a shame  that they were forced out of business because of dgital technology that they either overlooked or didn't know how to address."
good,"This company was a great example of a workplace that was inclusive, and a person could feel safe.

Diversity, and inclusion were excellent!"

I left for better pay some place else and now regret it."

I had 4 - 5 jobs while I was there which made it interesting.  Worked mostly the swing shift.  I was able to switch off certain shifts I didn't care for which made it nice.  I do not have a quality job now like I did at Kodak.  I am in a union and I dislike unions.  Kodak's performance based culture is superior to unions if you are a responsible worker, come to work everyday and perform your job, not hard really.  Kodak rewarded good performance.  Unions reward poor performers, believe me."

I have learned how to manage a wide varity of people over the last 4 years as being a supervisor and asst. manager. I have also learned a great deal of selling techniques, how to schedule employees, and how to manage an operation to move as efficiently as possible to exceed goals given to us by high managment. The hardest part about my job was scheduling people due to the fact we had serveral locations and many people's availability conflicted with certain shifts i needed to get covered.

Then was selected to be a shift supervisor with employee development and workplace safety responsibilities. I did merit reviews and controlled wage increases, or monitored workers having problems on the job. I became so good at this I was given problem workers to develop. This was a good job for me because at the time I was single with few problems of my own and I could work with the problem people."

This allowed me to network across all lines of business and management levels. My customers loved having 'one face' from Kodak and thus I became a valued business partner and not just another vendor.
good,Loading and unloading trucks on most days. The best part of the job was the people i worked with and the hardest part was pulling 55 gallon drums of chemicals or cases of chemicals in general.
good,"Kodak has been a revolutionary company in terms of work environment right from its founding in 1880. George Eastman was a visionary in corporate stewardship similar to William Endicott and Henry Ford. In the past few years, the disappearance of silver nitrate photography has crippled the company and it certainly will not survive as we know it. In December 2011, it filed for bankruptcy."

Prepare and certify equipment, components and chemicals to make sure all were working prior to real time coating event. I learned how to troubleshoot issues really fast with the help and feedback of amazing teammates. Morning market meetings with management on day shift and daily e-mails kept us shift workers in the loop.The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job was that the leaner the company became the more aspects of the business I had the chance to learn, working in more than lab at a time."

good,Kodak was a good company and educated its people. We were not only workers but a big family and a school. Most employees were able to improve their jobs and them self. I worked their for 35 years. I feel the management unfortunately did not see or forecast how the future would happen. The world is always moving forward.  Kodak needed to change and go to a new future. The hardest part of the job was seeing many co-workers leave unwillingly.
good,"Kodak has always been an exceptional company to work for especially in the days when sales and profits were robust.  Unfortunately, due to extreme competition, Kodak began to suffer market share decay and as a result ultimately filed for bankruptcy.

Returning to work after being out for a while can be stressful for you but there is no compassion concerning it when you return to work. I fell down the stairs at Kodak after I return to work and my doctor pulled me back out of work. Not to mention when I return to work after the long-term disability, they told me I couldn't have any more days off. I left work that night under my doctor's orders. Upon my return they had to let me go I was told. Therefore I felt no compassion concerning my health issues at that time."
