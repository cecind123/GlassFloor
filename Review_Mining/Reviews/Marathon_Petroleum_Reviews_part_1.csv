rating,review
bad,Accounts Payable Manager/ Supervisor was horrible need more training on how to treat & communicate they had no boundaries hostile environment nobody got along worst group of people I ever worked with stay far away from Marathon it’s not a good company.
bad,"Continually judged, pressured & punished by inexperienced management, putting public and employees at risk of physical harm IMO. Stressed drivers should not be behind the wheel of a loaded tanker hauling fuel.In my opinion, invasion of privacy takes priority over leadership and development of non-stressed focused drivers, micromanaged and continual decrease in time allowances for loading and unloading, not honoring delivering what you are promised, no teamwork, created animosity by management between drivers and continual threats of being sent home without pay if you experience any difficulties rather than assist addressing problems and issues."
bad,Good pay that’s it can’t trust supervision they look down on you and they are unqualified liars that don’t know what they are doing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"just an okay place to work at, management was awful, people I woked with were great. they need to focus on listening to their employees more. ping pong tables were great"
bad,I worked for a contract company not Marathon. It was G4S Marathon was great to the contra company and their employees.the company I wanted to work for was marathon
bad,Don’t waste your time here. They put you thru rigorous training only to throw you into a fire. Complete mess of store managers to deal with. On call all the time. No training.
bad,This was a very unprofessional and the most unpleasant job ever! The manger didn’t know what he was doing. They took $50 out my check and didn’t tell me until I said something. The claimed it was for 2 shirts that I haven’t even received. Very unprofessional!
bad,Not one best places i have worked for. Boss really was hsrd to work for. This business prepares food which je lets it set out all day. Needed to be thrown out after 4 hrs.not very clean in the area prepared thr fpod. Nor back in sinl. Just not really professiomal at all. Dont roatate food when comes in or dated.seen no ome wash hands just put gloves on. I washed my hand everytime and wore gloves. Not fair to employees.
bad,My personal experience it was a lousy environment for contractors. The last direct manager I worked with at the company was unprofessional and temperamental.
bad,Regular job nothing special close to race track so you receive those customers - not the best conditions to prosper on the job - very mundane - an entry level position nothing more
bad,The gas station is in ruins. Management is horrible and will not talk to you at all when a mistakes are made. They won't even tell you that they fired you they let customers do it.
bad,Dangerous place to work due to 23 fatalities during my time their. Terrible culture. Vindictive managers...............................................................
bad,"Never got a raise, was a very stressful environment to work in, manager was rude and not appropriate, did not work with me on hours or days, and was just a horrible place to work."
bad,"we busted our butts  for a man that treated us poorly. "
bad,Marathon Oil was a good job it's fast paced but you get to know your customers. I ran cash register restocked the sodas and learned the lottery machines and Gas pumps. The pay is good but they make you work a lot of hours. You can work 40 plus hours a week and some days no days off.
bad,"poor managment, poor team skills, not good work area, store had lots of mold growing, to much favoritism, lazy workers, nobody work here, workers rude to customers."
bad,"boss/owner constantly making inappropriate comments. manager is bosses daughter, accountant is bosses wife. basically you get to watch them rob themselves and blame their cashiers, constantly causing conflict, firing/hiring family members over and over. there is no accountability when it comes to the family."
bad,"Marathon is a horrible company to work for, they have their favorites there and they cater to them 100% where the other people who work there are treated badly. A typical day at work is mainly me doing all the work while the other person gets special treatment. I learned that Marathon has their fav's that they treat great. The one manager is not a very good one. Workplace culture is very horrible. The hardest part of the job is getting help when needed. There is no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,I was advised to put Marathon Oil instead of Radiant Food Stores because it would be more identifiable as a gas station. The staff did not properly train me but expected me to work long shifts over night anyway.
bad,"Duties were just being a cashier but once I became assistant manager my duties became counting multiple registers "
bad,"This was a oil jobber business.  The owner retired many years ago.  While I worked with this business I was office manager and in charge of collections, accounts receivable and payable."
bad,A great culture until a new CEO came aboard.  Then a new HR Manger was hired and it appeared as if her only duties were to fire people and NOT give severance.  A new Performance Review program was started and it was just the worst ever!
bad,work was basically an old mans club but only women if you werent one of them they tried to say you missed doing things and were mean to you
bad,"I hated working here, the boss was not a nice person and the customers are always in such a hurry that they make you very unhappy."
bad,was a great learning experience but not a great environment.
bad,"There are a lot of chances to learn area of the oil and gas business. The people are great, but the management is not."
bad,"Pressure, Pressure. They push safety but will doc you when you make a mistake.Top Heavy Company.All decisions made from a cubical in Findlay.Hours of work are all over the place"
bad,The say they care about family but they dont gave them everything I had in me work 6 days a week for years but they truly are not the employer everyone thinks they are
bad,"poor advancement, poor management, no drug testing policy, poor salary, management does not address issues presented on any given day - left to deal with on own."
bad,My life is worth more than $8 an hour. The fact that you have to stay until the next person decides to come in. The owner didn't seem to appreciate the employee's or managers.
bad,"Nepotism is the key word here. Management puts family and friends in positions people are under qualified for, there have been, and will be more accidents because of this."
bad,If you like to be treated as a number instead of a person then this is the job for you. It’s not a good work environment and has some of the poorest management I have ever seen.
bad,"Jefferson Pa BFS MARATHON location was & is an easy target for theft/robbery. The company does nothing to ensure their employees are safe. No overtime, no advancement, often shift changes at last minute. Random called mandatory employee meetings ur expected to be at within 30min, not even paid for it. Only $7.25hr"
bad,"Horrible management. So bad that the more experienced guys who were not in the good ole boy club decided to call for a union vote, and when it failed, management found every small detail and even fabricated write ups that ultimately let to people deciding to find a new place to work or the dismissal and firing of almost the entire work crew"
bad,"A typical day at this company makes me happy I have a job, but as for a happy place to be in daily, would not be my first choice to spend my time. The customers that visit this gas station are mostly, if not all, very rude, loud, ungrateful, messy, and very disrespectful towards me and every other employee that works for this company. They treat us as if were, ( the employees) uneducated, worthless and insignificant, when really everyone that is employeed there is either in college or has been to college. I myself have attended Wilbur Wright College but unfortunately had to drop out because I had to choose between paying my bills as a full time employee or going to school and further educating myself. I can say without a doubt I have made the wrong decision. As for management, lazy, would be a word best to describe them. When things go wrong at this company, they are not in any hurry to fix the problem and make things better. There really is not any hard part of my job. It is a gas station. I know what to do as far as customer service. I respect people that visit this store, even when they do not respect me. I would say the only good part of my job at this company would only be, it pays my bills. I am looking for a respectable job in a good neighborhood, and to work with a company that cares for their employees and cares how they look as a company."
bad,Stuck in a no way out 6 year contract starting pay is $23 per hour after a long 6 years you will eventually make $26 1 dollar raise every 2 years non union side of company drivers get better pay no weekends management make you work mandatory overtime on your days off office personnel tell you how to deliver gas when they never done the job before something always changes after the management. Team has a meeting
bad,No one lasts long as job duties are not made clear ever. They tell you to do one thing and then reprimand you for doing it sometimes not even remembering telling you to.
bad,"Basically if you are hourly, it's a very uncomfortable place to work at. Simple mistake regardless they are determined to punish you in their point system. Basically they are after your job."
bad,my manager at the time was wonderful but the higher up management was never around. Just because you own some establishment does not mean you know how to run the business. I think if I had work for a different owner that actually cared about his employees my experience would've been different. I was robbed at gun point around 5 in the morning  and the owner never even called to see if the manager on duty or myself were ok the next week everyone got their pay on the right day but that manager and myself. I could've lost my life the weekend befor my childrens birthday..
bad,"The only time we were around another associate was in shift change for about 20 minutes, or in the early morning for 30 minutes to an hour with help to open the store at 6am, or for about 15-20 minutes at closing at 11pm. he camera system is only covering half the store and there is no camera surveillance outside. Hours are unreliable and people are favored as to how many hours they get."
bad,"during a buyout let go without warning or regard to job security, here's your money and you can leave... bad experience... I would not recommend applying to this company if you plan to have a permanent career because they are not trurstworthy"
bad,"Marathon became a terrible place to work. people are afraid to speak up and share ideas. also, no clear vision and poor leadership skills starting with the head of the company who believes it is his company and not a public domain."
bad,The location I worked at was owned by a local family so they ran the store how ever they pleased. My schedule was always messed up And My boss was a real mean old lady.  Everyday I walked through those doors I could feel her slowly stealing my soul. Run.
bad,"Manager and supervision is picked from the buddy system of who knows who. This is not appropriate since our past 2  suppervisors and Manager know less than the college interns. This has lead to huge financial losses to non-IT desisions on multiple occations and the blame falls on the teams working 50+ hours a week to support these dumb desisions."
bad,"I was Hired on to an Apprenticeship through BP Oil Refining at their Texas City, Tx refinery.  Loved working for them.  in 2013 the refinery sold to Marathon and all company employees became a part of Marathon.  As a union member, i was somewhat protected from termination for the most part.  i had personal issues i was dealing with at that time and was given an impossible ultimatum."
bad,"Better management,and safety  and more trucks and better maintenance because thier tucks are in bad shape safety wise too much favoritism and management covers up alot of accident that happen on job sites like spills and other qq"
bad,"Daily operations of producing and maintaining oil wells and three  facilities. What I have learned from this job is self-discipline, time management . Upper management is inexperienced and does not stick up for what is right nor what is best for the company. Workplace moral is horrible and more than half of the company is looking for other employment. Hardest part of the job is actually being prevented to do my job due to excess programs and reports that get dumped on the operators, which doesn't help me preform my best or the companies best interest. Most enjoyable part is the friends I have gained from this job."
bad,Uprooted my life moving to OKC. Let go 15 months later because they didn't want to pay my 6 figure salary after re-org. Buyer beware. Found my job requiring less then half the experience posted on the internet about a month before being released. Layer upon later of management.
bad,This company is suffering a painful restructural change and has a terrible management at the time.
bad,"They set a budget that couldn't cover the project, then remove engineers from the project thinking that will save them, which it will not. They will have to increase the budget anyway in order to complete the work, pi s s poor management."
bad,"the company is a very good company to work for, it has some bugs to be worked out in management. long hours with poor schedule. can be away from home for several days"
bad,I worked 11 hours a day alone I loved my job and the people but management was bad never paid on time wouldn't pay all on a check had to take cash
bad,"Manufacturing age management mentality; all decisions -- even the most miniscule -- must be made by CEO; lack of vision, no ability to improve and implement new processes."
bad,New management was very poor and unorganized. No room for advancement unless you were already a fulltime employee. Very poor management. I was there 3 years and only received 1 raise
bad,"I would come in and count the till to be sure it was right on. Pay attention to those using the pumps. Greet all guests. and help if they had questions. Ring in their items, and cash them out. If the were buying alcohol or tobacco products I would check ID to make sure they were over the age of the law to buy said products. clean the store. and do the end of day paperwork. set the alarm and lock up."
bad,"The place was ok to work but for only one person ,manager wasnt the smartest man around but he was generous and helpful at times"
bad,"My work night was always grand before my manager left our company. I had very regular customers, that came in specifically to make their purchases from me. They appreciated my personal side with them, made them feel at home.  I actually took the time to fix the customer's problem rather than not even try, I made a few loyal patrons this way as well."
bad,I loved my job in the beginning. The environment and the co workers were amazing and everyone was very friendly. Did not like the management after my original manger left. Was not happy about what he was pulling and turning the store into.
bad,"small gas station everyone knew eachother was a fun place to work. management was very nice. hardest part was just keeping it clean which wasnt that difficult. Station got shut down, No advancement in that job but stil was fun."
bad,Must be able to multitask and work independently. Lack of advancement and benefits. Store is now closed down due to lack of proper ownership.
bad,"The manager was hardly there, and the people that were always there weren't consider for advancement, they would bring people from outside. Not to mention, the district manager, and my manager did not like to interact with eachother, so nothing actually got fixed. The district manager's attitude toward anyone who was not at her level or above was attrocious, and unflattering. The turn-over rate was mainly over the fact that there were no benefits, compared to how many days, and hours you would have to work."
bad,Salary positions are treated very well but hourly personnel is treated as expendable. The company is more concerned about the bottom line and not your safety.
bad,Poor benifits.Poor Management.Not a very secure job.Not a longterm job for sure.
bad,"The work wasn't too bad, nor were the costumers. I would work the cash register, sweep/mop the floors, keep ice machine and inventory stocked, count cigarettes, count and drop my money in the safe. The coworkers were nice people, but mainly old. Because of this, if there was any heavy  lifting I would be called in to help. It felt very unfair because I would have to do things that they would not. I loved being able to talk to the costumers all day, I learned a lot from them. I didn't requested days off often, but one of the few times I did, for a family members graduation, they told me I had to work and wrote me up. This was even though I requested the day off a little over a month in advanced. The management team was very unfair and biased. I didn't appreciate how they picked on certain people. A few people had over time hours and they took their hours and put it on their next pay check so they didn't have to pay them the extra. We also did not get a break."
bad,"There is no job security which you can trust"
bad,Was hired to implement PMP's Best Practices for Project Management and Project Controls only to experience resistance from ExPat from Europe.  Old Europe are afraid of changes.
bad,"It's easy to stay busy there, but the pay is minimal, less hours in the winter."
bad,"I worked at the Canton Refinery, then came a wave of layoffs, due to managements knee-jerk reaction to profit margin for that quarter. Findlay Management always controlled Canton Management, and you always had your manager and dotted line manager, then the District manager,  - like in Office Space if you messed up the TPS reports. Not only that but the union does not like to interact with the office workers and vice versa, HR was chaos with constant layoffs and interns to do mediocre gauge readings for corporate tax write offs. People got hurt, OSHA was there We shot a few hundred barrels of petro product into S.W. Canton's air , -then had EPA was here.... Pays well for Canton Ohio, mostly good times while it lasted, no loyalty unless you pay Union dues, all about the Benjamins especially if some guy in Findlay gets a wild hair ..and wants to show that their B.A. in Business Management was all for not move people around Canton refinery like chess pieces on monthly basis..........."
bad,Very Nice people. Low pay. No benefits. Dangerous place to work.A very temporary job. Not a place for permanancy. Management is very nice and easy to work with.
bad,I did like the company but i quit because of family reasons. If i would not have quit more than likely still be working there. But i do not regret the experience i have had there or my other job with customer service.
bad,"busy most days, loved interacting with all the customers, management was strict and did not really listen to complaints.  alot of down time and needed to keep yourself busy"
bad,"If you are into creating pretty eye-catching PowerPoint slides and want to work for a Texas A&M corp cadet who doesn't really know the business, then this is the place for you!  This is not  a environment that fosters teamwork as much as it does tearing down others to get ahead."
bad,"Cooking the chicken first then making pizza and setting up the hot case, when closing I'd have to tear everything down and clean I would sometimes have to change oil in the fryer and it was a huge deep fryer."
bad,"It wasn't anything special. Just a normal gas station job."
bad,Marathon is experiencing the same downturn as are other oil and gas companies.  Hopefully it will be able to return to its former state once this is over.
bad,Current upper management has destroyed the value of the company by foolishly putting all money towards oil production increases in the eagle ford and paying outrageous dividends to themselves.  Also removed most middle management that did not include eagle ford including all new exploration anywhere in the world.  stock price shows the overall value of the company.
bad,My co-workers were a pleasure to work with and supportive. The Management  and Leadership teams were not supportive and moved very slowly.  They protected each other even at the expense of other employees.  would not recommend working for this company!
bad,"Depending on if I worked first or second shift it would either be super busy in the beginning or super slow. My coworker and I would stand at the register checking people out for most of the shift. We would alternate  cleaning jobs and do them near the end of the night of throughout our shift when we weren't so busy. I loved working with most of my co-workers. I did not like working so late into the night when I work second shift especially because I was a full time student."
bad,The management was unresponsive to concerns of its employees. Longer hours than scheduled and high employee turn over. No appreciation from upper management.
bad,Loved most things of my customers! The downtime was horrible and the busy times just made time go by fast! I just couldn’t not have a life working all different shifts 7 days a week
bad,"I worked as a contractor through a temp agency in several departments and believe it's a good place to work, but very hard to get in permanent. Regular employees who have retired were replaced with younger, just out of college instead of hiring on those who have been there for a long time as a contractor for a temp agency."
bad,"When first started working here was a good place to work. Over last few years management has changed, and the work enviroment is extremely hostile. Bosses will say one thing to your face, and go behind your back and say the oppoisite to others. It's a daily stressor wondering if and when you are going to lose your job."
bad,Learn  about  relationship with costumer. I get lots hours but this is low  income job. This job is good for short term or part time. The hardest part of this job is I takecare everything. But they  don't pay me  much. That's why I'm looking for another job so I  can takecare of my family .
bad,You are required to stay in one room all day or night looking at a computer. The majority of the people you work with hate being there. You get a lot of vacation time but its based on a seniority and counsel specific pick system. So if you don't have someone to cover your vacation you have to work. It is a highly stressful environment. The managers are nice but they have no power and do not keep order. When you are on a night shift schedule their is no supervision and people act like children. The people in the OC have an entitlement that they are special and that they can get away with things that normal positions in the company could not get away with. They scoff at the HR Department. I don't recommend this job if you have a family. This job is perfect for someone who lives alone and wants to make decent money. There is more I could say but in general the job is overwhelming and not worth the stress.
bad,This was a place where you had to watch everyone that came in the store. this was a very uncomfortable place to work. i didn't learn anything from this job. We where shut down by the S.W.A.T. deam 2 times. that should say it all.
bad,Not hard duties at all. Only duties were to keep the coolers and shelves stocked and clean the place at the end of the day. Didn't really learn anything on the job besides good work ethic. Job itself was all pretty easy.
bad,"The company keeps shrinking in size and who knows when it will stop. The company use to be have wonderful employee retention and really cared about employees but no more. "
bad,"The entire town of Findlay is oddly Marathon focused. Being a small town, there is no opportunity to ""blend in"" and just live your life. I felt like I was always being interviewed: at the grocery store, at the bar on a Friday night, everywhere. If something happens, everyone will soon hear about it. The company culture is the absolute worst I have ever experienced. Very pedantic rules, I was once scolded for not holding a hand rail when I was walking down stairs. You can NOT take a single step with a cup without a lid on it. They stress extraordinarily small things like this ad nauseam. The employees who enjoy working at Marathon and stick around turn into robots who chant praises for the company at every opportunity. It truly did feel like a cult at times. The pay is fantastic, but for me it was not worth it. If you are a person who enjoys small town life, doesn't mind a company culture that can feel like kindergarten, and deals well with a very top-down hierarchy and competitive atmosphere, you may have a better experience."
bad,This is a waste of my time. I do not wish to participate in the survey. It really serves no purpose. Adulting is required so I went to work. It sucked.
bad,"Marathon has become Devon 2.0.  Unfortunately, this is now a resource based company due to changes in management.  Culture has changed into a robotic society where everyone are just numbers and new relative ranking ranking systems can be biased especially if someone's boss or bosses boss happens to be there to bat for them."
bad,"No stablity and weak leadership, and was always expected to do more with less. the most enjoyable part was the team I worked with, we did a job but we had fun doing it."
bad,"Marathon was our (Ashland's) merger ""partner"" in 1998.  Marathon's corporate success in those days was due in a large part to their company's foresight to also be an oil producer, not just a refiner as Ashland unfortunately had chosen to be."
bad,Decent job just no raises been there almost 9 years at the same pay good people but no benefits Norway to better yourself looking for a change in dependable and will always do my best just looking to better myself and my family.
bad,A workplace that keeps you busy and learning. Great co-workers and managers.
bad,Enjoyable atmosphere. Able to build relationships with regular customers. New ownership caused concerns for both long term customers and employees.
bad,"Hard work, long hours, senior experience; but company valued lower salaried, less experience, and no advancement.  What was achieved; renovation across two refineries, combining the two making it the largest refinery on the west coast; then, amassing an enviable safety record of no OSHA recordables on 1.7 million hours."
bad,"Learned a lot however, some of the employees weren't paid cash like others of us,they were paid with food from the store and cigerettes. Not my business but, the boss kept ""confusing""me and my work ethic and our aggreed upon pay rate for they ones getting paid in trade,which led to my checks ""accidently"" being short on more than one occasion. Not a good look!"
bad,"Good place to work, just need a little more focus on safety. Generally maintenance is on a 4 10's schedule. Overtime work as needed."
bad,"always alone."
bad,I met many new people and made new friends with my coworkers.
bad,"Oil Refinery Canton Ohio , Ohio Refining Division."
good,"Typically it would be stocking and checking products, making the food for on the racks, and running the cash register. The job was always fast paced."
good,"crazy hours, no breaks, pay sucks, lots of work for little pay and too much travel involved"
good,Worked for a construction company there did not work for Marathon Oil. But was a nice place to work the safety team was great to work with I really enjoyed working there.
good,It was an okay job wasn't too thrilled with the people who ran the store they were very ignorant and very arrogant. Talked down to woman and treated us like scum.
good,Unprofessional... bad scheduling...not oraganized.. I was only hired to work for a employee that needed a vacation...never filled out paperwork..no communication
good,"I loved my regulars that came in to play lottery everyday, sometimes when they won they would tip me or bring me lunch. Managers were pretty cool most days, I worked with my supervisor so I was alone most of the time. They didnt like that I was pregnant so they cut my hours. The hardest part of the job was working by myself, trying to stock foutnain area, vaccum, and be behind the counter to help customers. The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,Would not recommend working within the PRA group. This was a newly created group that was brought back in house after being outsourced for 15 years. Management was horrible.
good,Management is my best skill but at this job things are so messed up nothing will ever be right. I just wish i had a chance to show my true skills . i appreciate the opportunity though
good,The store was nice but the hours were rough and constantly changing because it was run under three brother that alway fought over when they would work. They all had a tendency to take things from the store and then forget so the inventory was always off. Which created problems.
good,The Marathon gas station I worked at was independently owned. Which the owner didn't run right the store ended up getting seized by the bank. Some time ago the knocked it down.
good,"Routine operations"
good,"Typical day at work in coming in 4 hours early or staying four hours late because one of your coworkers who doesn't give two craps called off AGAIN and you know you now have 12 hours of time to try and kill. You know that that is impossible yet management expects you to ""look busy"" so they want to to sweep floors or clean even if there is nothing else to clean. Coworkers are eager to throw you under the bus for their own gain and management will terminate you for reporting violence in the workplace. HR will turn it around to make it your fault. All this to protect the company's image."
good,"•	Oversaw all full-time contractor crafts both maintenance and turnaround personnel in the execution of job task and activities necessary to complete scheduled SAP work orders in accordance to scheduled and planned jobs."
good,Great place to work fast pace it gets crazy sometimes but then it's also slow its not to bad of a job if your great with people this is for you store is always cleaned
good,This is the most cut throat place I have ever worked. The management was constantly reported to that certain Superintendents caused havoc throughout the company. They did nothing. Many of the complaints were in writing and no response. This made it very stressful for the entire culture of Marathon.
good,"Do your work and CYA!  Your paid very well, but management doesn't listen to suggestions.  Not a very friendly environment people that work there have no compassion."
good,It's an easy going job. Make sure to count the register and inventory before your shift so any mess ups do not fall on you. The management is not good. Two owners with no communication causes problems
good,"Marathon Oil Company is a huge organization with well over 5000 employees working in different positions at different locations. It has a very dynamic environment and great scholarships for school.  Overall, there is no chance of movement up the ladder."
good,"Marathon Oil is a relaxed and easy place to work. At times, it has been stressful. Questionable and other rude people had been employed there. Not a bad place, however, I would prefer not to work there again."
good,"To begin, the design group joined with Document Controls group. The DC manager did not know engineering or design. We were constantly questioned our design procedures by the manager."
good,"While working for Marathon Oil Gas station I was able to maintain a good work life schedule, I was able to "
good,"Marathon is one of the worst companies I have worked for. Their upper management never comes out to the units and just sit in their offices and look down on you.  They don't care about safety they only care about money.  They run things to failure and you never get recognition for your hard work, especially if you are hourly.  If you are salary you get a medal for finding your office every day."
good,"I usually worked alone for 8 hours without a break. I waited on customers, did paperwork, stock, and cleaned. Hardest part of job was being alone and using restroom which was not attached to the store. Most enjoyable part was talking with so many different people."
good,"Not much to tell because it is just as you would expect. You clock in, do your job as assigned and clock out. You are standing behind a counter and scan customer items."
good,"Worked for them for almost 5 years and from day one had bad experiences with lower level management (RTM) from probably after first 6 months. While MPC itself is a good company, the lower management they entrust to oversee the driver pool leads alot to be desired. Pay was fair, equipment nice, but just couldn't take the constant badgering and always being on edge. If you like to rat on your fellow drivers and like to brown nose, this is most definitely the place for you. Like I said,  Good Company, POOR lower management"
good,"This was an independently owned Marathon Oil gas station. Therefor the environment was unstable. No set schedule, you worked when they needed you. No advancement available because it was family owned and operated."
good,"I love working at a gas station, its a good job to have... Typical day was counting your drawer and counting cigs and lottery and day started... Always something to do at a gas station..."
good,Good company overall but management needs a lot of help. The benefits are good. Supply Chain is a good department to work for as long as your manager has a mind of his/her own.
good,"You must be able to handle a lot of stress to work at this unit. It is very unorganized, chaotic and unprofessional atmosphere. It is poorly managed and requires a lot of biting your tongue."
good,Had a set rhythm to environment. Since it was a 24 hr. location it was a steady workplace.  Decent coworkers and management.
good,"A typical say with Marathon would start in the early morning hours at 6 a.m. and would end at various hours. I was a lease operator/ SCADA operator, my job duties would include but not limited to; managing/control and recording well flow of oil in the Eagle Ford Shale region. The management seemed to be awfully rude, not organized and selfish. Wasn't uncommon to be belittled by upper management. My fellow co-workers seem to be friendly, took awhile for them to open up to me and make me feel welcomed. The hardest part of the day would be dealing with the extreme weather conditions but nothing was more enjoyable than complimentary lunches and breakfasts."
good,"Although my day was somewhat monotonous. I enjoyed working for marathon. I most of all loved my customers. My co-workers were fun to work with, and the management was exceptional."
good,"I learned a lot working at Marathon, how to balance deposits, open and close a business. Hardest part of the job was keeping same employees because they would either get bored or they just were not wanting to come to work. I loved my job because it was easy and the customers were great."
good,"Marathon was rated by Forbes magazine one of the top companies in the US."
good,They will give you hours but the work is very mundane. The owners are nice and do what they can but favoritism is obviously the best way to get raises
good,"Worked both Fracking and drilling HSE.  Everyone was to busy worrying about there job.  I did enjoy working the drilling end of the BU.  The fracking end of the position was a very complicated issue, having to be sure to check hammer unions, slings high pressure lines and gel being used down hole."
good,"I opened a new payroll and sales day when coming in at 4 AM. Managed cash while setting up plan for day and following budgetary constraints, scheduling and ordering. Morning phone conferences and vendor check-ins all while taking care of Customers and preparation of food  My day usually ended around 4 PM but salaried it often went to 6 PM and had to return at all hours being a 24/7 store."
good,"They make you feel comfortable for a while, but then it gets annoying. You learn to work fast there. You meet a lot of people, your coworkers help you when you’re new."
good,"As for terminal culture, it's either the greatest job you'll ever have, or a good pay/benefits but a terrible place to work.  Expect to advance due to your connections instead of skill or work ethic.  High stress.  Zero tolerance for mistakes, even typo's in some cases.  HR's only purpose is to prevent lawsuits.  They will never side with the employee otherwise.  Some terrible management on the local levels.  Expect to train yourself.  Expect meetings on your off days.  Expect out of town training on your off days.  Expect to work weekends.  Terrible work/life balance. Shady relationships with contractors and management.  Management ""stores"" equipment at their home.  Favoritism and nepotism is status quo."
good,"Fun day at work"
good,The owners aren't polite. The store is very dirty. Management is very rude to employees and customers. The truck is always late each week also.
good,Overall Marathon was a good place to work a lot of activity going on made the days fly by. Job security is an issue. They were good at developing new ways to operate and were always open to new ideas.
good,"Is a good company for someone to start of and then jump to something else. Management is not that great, they are very authoritative."
good,I liked the people at Marathon.  I made some good friends their who I still talk to today.  The plant needed the 1.2 Billion dollar infusion it recently got for upgrades.
good,Marathon was a good job to work as a high school student. I got along well with my workers as well as my manager. My manager was always understanding of days I requested off. It was hard work and very fast paced.
good,They have great equipment and get you what you need. No security and no. Have reduction of workforce then a month later hire three more people in the same spot was removed from. Makes no sense. Great supervisors and also very bad ones. Play favorites inappropriate communication at all hours of the day after drinking.
good,Exposed to many different IH monitoring. Constantly learning new IH information.
good,I am actually seconded to Marathon Oil from AMEC Oil & Gas Americas As the Senior/Lead Electrical Engineer for an offshore Platform Project.
good,My job with Marathon was one I enjoy. It provided me with customer service experience as well basic sale knowledge. I would have no problem working for this company again.
good,Safety could be improved on as well as relations between union and non union personnel. Not a very cooperative working environment. That is the biggest issue at the Texas City site.
good,"Company had 9/80's which helped with needed days off. Bonuses were fair. Very safety driven company. Enjoyed coming to work as it was fun, until the layoff hit."
good,"had an awesome experience with Marathon met and worked with a lot of good people. "
good,"open up task list, print out the request. and review the requested updated. Schedule a meeting with the requester for a phone review. Note all changes and move forward with a responding email confirmation of the phone review. Once the drawings are completed, another email is sent with the new drawing and the relined drawing for review to the requester."
good,"HR is nothing but women trying to climb the corporate ladder and will do whatever it takes to do so. You're part of the click or your out. "
good,"Work at Marathon was ok, but the people that worked at Marathon made the work seems so much better.  I can honestly say I miss the people so much and I made some great lasting friendships there."
good,Good to meet costumers from other countries and learning about their cultures. Not all the costumers are alike but you get a few that are very interesting.
good,"great co-workers, never had a bad boss, good benefits, "
good,Marathon used to be a positive work environment. Culture is changing in a way the legacy employees generally do not support.
good,"I went to work between 2-11 pm shift .I did the inventory , stocking , cleaning and doing front desk / cashier.I enjoyed learning the operation of the store , but was dissatisfied with security at the job because of which I decided to pursue other options"
good,"Unethical and backstabbing.  They say there is future advancement, and your job is secure, but it isn't."
good,"While Marathon is a good company to work for, if you are used to big city (or any sized city) life, this will be a culture shock for you. Not only is it located in a small down, the majority of the people who work there are from the surrounding small towns. Occasionally someone from a larger community or out of state is recruited, but they do their obligatory 5 years and move to a larger market. "
good,"Clean,bright,and many regular customers. Required to take cust.Service classes were a great asset. Co-workers were timid,but knowledgeable"
good,"its a job to get ya feet wett in Customer Service skills, very great people to work for just not enough money. friendly enviorment"
good,"To  perform transactions with money, credit card, lotto, money gram and Comdata. "
good,"no room for advancement ,  was a family owned franchised.i was young just a gas station was a college student with  two jobs at the time to make the time go by"
good,"I had a great experience while I worked there. Learned a lot since I have worked there. The management was kind, motivated, and supportive while I was working."
good,"Customer service takes a big role here, since it is a gas station. Nothing was too difficult thought, except maybe lottery. There is a very bossy lady here though, I blame her for part of the reason why I quit."
good,I worked closing shift which was alright. I did not like some of the tasks that were part of the shift but that comes with any job really. I would work there again if they paid more.
good,Great teamwork.  Good management. Awesome coworker.  Everything is good. Always good to be here for a great company. I’m just trying to make it through work safely
good,"no shortage of job duties. co-workers are excellent, potential for advancement under the correct management, enjoyed the work, strict safety requirements"
good,"People here are reviewing Marathon Petroleum Corporation on a page designated Marathon Oil.  They are two separate companies with absolutely no connection.  MPC was at one time a subsiary of MOC, but that was 20 years ago (maybe more?)."
good,Goed georganiseerde organisatie. Prettige werksfeer
good,"A typical day was dealing with the public, serving their needs, and maintaining the store so it was well kept and stocked up. Hot food and coffee was always a big seller. Clean bathrooms were a must!"
good,"Marathon has a collaborative work place that requires you to interact with multiple groups. "
good,Great work/life balance and the people are great but workplace culture needs improvement.  Lack of effective collaboration and innovation bogged down by time-consuming processes.
good,The people and the environment at Marathon were conducive to individual performance and improvement.  The management team was interested in helping less experienced employees grow and mature and they were given a lot of latitude.
good,"good job to make great money, you have to deal with a lot of hazardous materials. Definitely a pay attention to detail kind of job, also like any other driving job you have to deal with the general public."
good,It was a fine atmosphere to work. The people seemed fair. The hours were as expected. I enjoyed interacting with customers. For the most part it was easy work.
good,"The manager made this a great place to work, always something different to do, stock, clean, serve coffee, inside and outside work. Owners closed the doors for personal financial reasons. Sad to loose this job."
good,"Very fast paced job, especially when you have a line of customers and venders running in and out. Can be boring because normally your working by yourself"
good,"This was a temp job, I just got my CNA a took another job that is in that field. It wasnt the worst place but just not what i want to do for the rest of my life"
good,the work environment was fast paced but I enjoyed it. The work that I enjoyed is stocking the candy and pop. Also I enjoyed pricing the items and also i enjoyed stocking the cigarettes
good,This review is forced and will not allow me to continue on the site unless i write a certain amount of words about an experience that I don't think accurately portrays that would be helpful tom another potential applicant.
good,i love the gas station lifestyle very easy goin and face paced and you get to meet alot of cool ppl some are not so cool at times but overall i enjoyed it very much
good,"Really enjoyed my job, but poor advancement. Felt like you were just a number there and not an employee. Had good benefits, with a very poor working schedule."
good,"A  typical work day at Marathon consists of helping customers, cleaning, answering phones, and using a cash register. Overall Marathon is not a terrible place to work but it is sometimes hard to cope with the lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"Competitive Pay/Benefits is above-average."
good,This was an awesome learning experience for me. The employees were very nice and helped train me in anyway I needed it. They have since closed their doors.
good,The office was really nice. They also prepare activities and mixers for employees from time to time. The work load is pretty normal. And the manager is okay.
good,"My experience at Marathon wasn't bad. The management could have been better, but overall, it was a laid back job. I enjoyed working with the public and enjoyed how it would be fast paced at times. I was put under pressure a lot having to work the register, answer questions, managed the gas pumps, and perform many other tasks all at the same time. I just didn't feel like there was much room for growth with the company and I'm looking for a place where I can advance and grow in my career."
good,Marathon was once a great company. The new leadership has taken it in a direction many don't believe in--the market analyst tail wags the Marathon dog.
good,The plant was recently bought by Marathan Petroleum. The culture there is result oriented and reward accomplishments. The company is in the Oil & Gas industry
good,"Fun place to work if you like people, alot of customers are really nice and so is staff and managers. You will run into some rude people sometimes but the hours are very good too"
good,"Overall, Marathon was a mid-tier company (a follower) in Upstream.  Advancement is difficult.  Work / life balance is very good, particularly with 9/80.  A good place to learn, but lacking for a long-term tenure."
good,"Work load was ok given what we dealt with on a day to day.  "
good,"The enviorment is not bad to work in, it is pretty laid back. You have your daily duties in which you are supposed to get all of your stuff done. it work outs great for school!"
good,Honestly working here would have been much more bearable if I had had a different manager. Very hard on females. Let males work 30 mins. less per day yet they  still got paid the 8 hrs I had to work 8.75 hours with an unpaid lunch...whether I took it or not.
good,Excellent pay and benefits. Long hours and plenty of overtime. Excellent training for jobs. Dangerous work environment but traing makes up for it. Lots of safety training.
good,Excellent pay and benefits for the region - not so much when you take in consideration the pay and benefits competing companies within the same industry pay.
good,"Lots of cut backs but compensation is great."
good,"I just swept up dirt and picked up trash, didn't really do much other than that. It was a nice summer job, and I made a decent amount of money."
good,"New management has really changed the culture of the company. This used to be a great company to work for, now I'm not so sure."
good,"Marathon has gone from a employee friendly place that encouraged training and innovation, to a culture of cost cutting and employee hostile."
good,"I always got the tools, supplies, classes I needed to be successful in my job.  There was too much work and we were short staffed which made it difficult to complete work assignments with associated deadlines.  "
good,"The pay was outstanding, but there were some long hours involved. I would still be working here if the company didn't sell to Northern Tier Energy."
good,"As a first internship, I was treated well.  I enjoyed learning in the refinery and what engineers do in that type of environment."
good,I worked for the company for 3 years. The job pays very well but management is awful. Nobody in management has ever driven a truck before and they try to tell you how to drive a truck.
good,"I joined Marathon in 2007 in the Diversity Department. Had wonderful experiences and exposure. I moved to the Talent Acquisition group in 2011 and was laid off in 2015. With retirement of CEO in 2012, company changed and stock has plummeted."
good,"·	Understand and adhere to all to all safety regulations and applicable to SLB policies"
good,"I worked the night shift operating the plant and all the surrounding wells by myself for 3 weeks when i first started. I finnally got someone who knew what they were doing but he only lasted a week due to a confrintation with one of the scada operators, they fired him on the spot. i worked another 2 months then i got called into the office and my boss was telling me what a great job I was doing but the following week i got called back in and i was told they had to let me go cause he heard i was sleeping on the job which was so far from the truth. never got a warning. comes down they layed off 110 employees a week earlier. i was cut cause i was making more money than the marathon employees. i was working for Swift world wide resources. I believe i have earned my salary with my education and experiance."
good,"It was just that...a great place that provided many resources to tap into for learning/training purposes.  There were many skilled and knowledgeable operators (as well as other craftsmen) on site to observe, learn from, and work with.  I learned something new, as well as important everyday I went to work."
good,"Start off with Safety Meeting"
good,Work starts when you clock in and doesn't end until you leave. Their focus is on production and quality.
good,Comfortable ands balanced place to work; very well managed.
good,"Run analysis on petroleum products and fix instrument issues."
good,"i also loved working at the gas station, i got to see lots of the same people on a daily basis!"
good,Easy going place of employment. Owners were very understanding and very helpful. I learned that there are always people willing to help you succeed. Loved interacting with the customers.
good,i liked the marathon i met lots of different people everyday with it being a truckstop marathon
good,"Nice place to work, offer a different range of positions at contract, full-time, and internship. New changes after the merger between Andeavor and Marathon"
good,Its a very dynamic environment with safety and security as its top priority.  Employee performances are monitered and evaluated in quarterly meetings.
good,"My experience with Marathon is unfortunately limited to MEGPL branch, which is West Africa. So, my assesement might not be a real broaden one."
good,Nepotism is the preferred method of coming on board and being promoted...but hard work and long hours can overcome the disadvantage.  You must be willing to sacrifice to succeed.
good,Itbwas a relaxed good job boring at times.. My manager was awesome.. If she was still there i would deff go back and work there again.. Time did go by slow
good,"Compensation and benefits were very good.  9/80 schedule was available.  Company is very dependent on the price of oil and had to make lots of cutbacks when the price dropped,"
good,Working at a gas station helps improve your social skills because many people pass through. The location I worked at was by the airport and so foreigners passed through often. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the country and world the most.
good,"Company needs to hire management that is willing to be fair to all employees that work under them. "
good,"Typical Day: check SCADA to see how facility is doing and determine priorities for the day. Go on route and inspect facility, calculating production and hourly rates to dispatch water and oil haulers. "
good,not bad for an oil plant. good comp and benefits. Only was an intern so didn't experience full time. location leaves much to be desired as a place to live
good,"I would provide customer service "
good,I really enjoyed working for Marathon Oil and Marathon Petroleum.  Teamwork was first and for most of my time with the company.  I have made lifelong friends from those I've worked with.  Depending on what project I was working on and location.  Management always had my back.  The hardest thing was the traveling and the most enjoyable was working with good people.
good,The culture changed after the split. The culture changed even more after oil started tanking. Just kept getting worse and worse. Layoffs every quarter. Very tense environment. HR running the show.
good,"The work-life balance is the best part of employment, along with the excellent benefits and pension which many companies do not offer today. The people are wonderful and feel like family. MPC is one of the best employers in the area that I live in."
good,"The culture is the good old boy network. If you looking for advancement this is not a place to work, but the pay is good.  If you are looking for diversity it is very lacking.  When you view their web-site the first thing you see is women and or a minority, but don't be fooled because this is NOT Marathon."
good,"A typical day is working with Operations on how to improve the facility financially and safety-wise."
good,"Good benefits but no work life balance. Not much opportunity to grow."
good,"I enjoyed working for Marathon with the exception of certain old school fossil supervisors, which needed to retire to improve the HSE culture and worker moral.  Very good pay and very good work schedule."
good,"In my personal opinion, my current working environment is not structurally sound. There isn't much consistency in the rules. My typical work day consists of observing and reporting, searching personel and vehicles. Keeping and logging data. Hardest part is dealig with schedules and the weather. Most enjoyable, no day is ever the same, and co-workers make it enjoyable."
good,"I am in charge of a staff of 10+ CSR's.  I am in charge of housekeeping, money management, as well as adjustments and waste management.  I have to run my store within the guidelines of OSHA regulations as well as health regulations both state and federally regulated.  Upper management is very involved but it is difficult to advance within the company.  The hardest part of the job is the consistency within the company.  I have worked in five different stores and two different districts training new employees and have found inconsistency within management.  I very much enjoy the work life balance."
good,Other than cameras not allowing you to talk on Bluetooth in the truck and poor management it was a decent place to work. No body bothered you as long as you did your work.
good,"Worked from home. "
good,Enjoyable work environment and great city location.  Start and end on time in order for employees to have a work/life balance.
good,"I started employment with Marathon overlooking our artificial lift program which typically included tracking, maintaining, ordering, and change out plunger lift equipment as needed. I would also schedule and supervise all slickline and swabbing work as needed. After 1 year I was promoted to Workover Rig Supervisor. I am in charge of planning, scheduling, and supervising jobs associated with the workover rig and still schedule and supervise slickline and swabbing jobs. I have been involved with numerous workovers such as converting dual string wells to single string, down hole pump changes, tubing string changes including using x ray and pressure testing units, rod string changes, milling and fishing packers, fishing tubing and rods, bailing, perforating, wellbore clean out, installation and removal of coil tubing, and drilling out plugs. I am also Well Control certified through Chapman and Associates."
good,"A typical day at work consists of running the register, stocking the coolers and regular customer service. I work with three other girls and I get along very well with all of them. The hardest part about this job would probably be just some of the things you have to deal with customer wise, but you have to make the best out of everything. The most enjoyable part of this job is just how laid back and comfortable it is."
good,I like work the people I work for. very good environment and great people. Compensation is very attractive with the city. The pay is good and work life balance is really key here.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Fellow workers were easy to get along with including owners of the business always willing to work with the customers and employees
good,Marathon its  fun job but the problems was the salary i got to much bills  to take care off . Getting pay $8.5 per hours is not enough for me to pay all my bills that's why i'm looking for a new job
good,"I worked here because I needed a job while attending school, it's a nice atmoshpere, management is very rude to customers and staff. Customers make the business and I loved seeing them everyday and up selling"
good,Left to make more money. Boss was friendly customers were great. Nice store. Good selection on alcohol and tobacco products. Had subway next door attachex
good,waiting on customers when they on their way to work or just customers coming in get what they needed. made a lot of coffee. some where friendly and some wasn't. how to order merchandise for the store. Managers are not honest they tell you something and then tell another employee something else or something bout another employee. manager she wasn't a boss she rather be a friend than a boss. I believe u need be a boss not a friend. a lot of double standard and favoritism. learning how to run a trender and cat scale. enjoyable part is the customers
good,I enjoyed everyone I worked with and all the cultures that I was able to learn about. There were a lot of repetitive customers so I got to know them as well. That to me was the greatest part of employment at the Marathon. The hardest part was taking out trash but even that was not so bad.
good,I liked the work I performed at marathon. I also liked the customers and coworkers. The pay seemed fair for the actual work that I did. The Job was Nice but no way to advance.
good,My overall experience was ok. I did not expect too much going in to it but it pretty much was the experience I expected. Overall it was a decent job and I would go back.
good,A great place to work to interact with new people. Friendly faces and smiles keep the patrons coming back. Would have loved to stayed longer but needed room to grow.
good,"A good workplace, and they are very flexible when it comes to work hours and personal life responsibilities.  They offer some room for advancement, but do not follow-up or take much time to help.  Management can be very questionable as well, but this is mostly because changes are happening at a rapid pace.  While I worked there for 3 years my group had four different supervisors who had zero experience with writing, or even managing a group of writers."
good,"I enjoyed the little time I worked for US Security at Marathon, but the job ended once the contract was sold to another security company. I was responsible for vehicle searches, making badges, etc."
good,"Nice job culture, with good people around. They give people option s to explore new ideas. Employee opinion is given great importance."
good,Inexperienced management making decisions during critical times in the industry has left several groups in chaos or short staffed in important roles.
good,Learned industry terminology within the oil and gas industry. Many health and safety regulations to follow. 
good,"Your generally working by your self in a small shop where I was at. you must keep yourself busy and stock when ever possible, there are no mandatory breaks and if you smok good luck getting 5 mins to suck one down"
good,"nice owner. The job is nice because it is very low stress. There is not too much hassle working there. The pay really stinks. The co workers are great, the benefits are non existent."
good,Was a great place to work. Enjoyed interacting with other departments in the company. Company decided to eliminate jobs or I would still be working there.
good,"A typical day at work here went by fairly fast because there is normally only one person there at a time so you didnt have much time to relax. Being at a gas station, i was constantly dealing with customers throughout my work day. The hardest part of the job was finding time to do what you had to do on top of dealing with all of the customers."
good,"This was a company I always wanted to work because of its rich history, being a part of the Stand oil Empire was fascinating.  The strong company culture is alive and well still today."
good,"Even not a direct employee the company tried to be equal in all benefits but still lacking."
good,"The company is in the process of changing its work environment.  Historically it was a typical risk adverse corporation that based its business plan on very conservative management decisions.  After separating from its downstream component a couple of years ago, the company has struggled to compete with its new peer group of independent exploration and production (E/P) oil companies.  In an effort to continue its downsizing efforts, the company recently executed nearly 400 personnel terminations in the Houston, TX office (approximately 15% of the work force).  The new work environment is expected to be very demanding and the company's stability could be questionable in the future."
good,i liked working there was just really long hours and was hard on the kids
good,Although quiet and calm atmosphere there is no room for you to need to leave due to family emergencies. There is great work to be done while employed. there. There is tons to learn
good,"The pay and benefits are great, but management is flaky and layoffs are brutal.  Like all Oil and Gas companies layoffs are inevitable when the price of oil is down.  This leads to a lot of stress and uncertainty."
good,Good company to work for. Schedules are flexible for the most part and salaries are competitive. Good cross-departmental collaborative environment across the organization.
good,To start the day I stocked the cooler's take the trash out. I ran the cash register for the rest of the day. At night I made the deposit and closed up shop.
good,"I loved my job when i worked there a few years back. Regular customers, didnt see the owner  much because he trusted me with his store. I left when he left. It was fun whem i was there but that was years ago."
good,"Good oil company to work for."
good,Very busy  but a very  interesting place to work. Very fast paced but you can learn a lot about the petroleum business. Great coworkers that you can call friends.
good,"This is a good place to work, however, they hire alot of temporary workers and work them for years without hiring them.  Which makes it very hard to get hired in, even if you know someone."
good,"Decent company"
good,"MAP has/had a program for college students to work a summer job. Only students with high enough grades were eligible. The pay, for a kid, was very good. I think this is an awesome program for the community."
good,This job required a lot of running around for the people who worked over you. You did exactly what the job title said. Summer help was a good experience for those who want to work at a desk in a office.
good,"On any given day I deal with some really great people, but a few people are crazy or rude, but I am very proud of how I handle these types of people. I take care of any orders that come in that day. I give great customer service to all the customers that come in. I work well by myself, but also with my co-workers. The most difficult part of my job would probably be when sometimes one of my co-workers doesn't clean the store as well as I do, that is frustrating, but I simply clean what she didn't do on her shift and go about the rest of my day as happy as ever. The best part of my job are the regular customers that come in everyday and they tell me how they love how well I treat them and how I know what they need or want."
good,"Most of the customers are friendly, there's always something to do. I made good friends working there that I still keep in contact with today. The hardest part about the job was lifting some of the beer cases."
good,Marathon is a strong and growing company. They value the safety of all personal and the environment. Have great collaboration between all levels of employees.
good,"A work day for me is very fast-paced, learning new items and how to order items for the store. The hardest part of my job is to leave when my shift is over. I love working no matter the hours."
good,"While working at Marathon I learned teamwork, customer service, and new skills. I enjoyed helping customers and getting to know my coworkers."
good,I provided excellent 1st and 2nd line end user support within a refinery environment.  Great place to work.  Management was good.  Co-workers are great.  No hard parts tot he job.
good,"My job is never the same day to day. Supporting a large office, two field sites, and multiple remote users can lead to very challenging, yet fun, work week."
good,"Open envitonment"
good,"Independent oil and gas company: Good benefits, vanpool and wellness center; challenged by current oil and gas market prices;"
good,"Well depending on the shifts, there was stocking, being a cashier, running a lottery machine, and there was the deli part of the store. I wasn't old enough at the time to work deli but from other coworkers they said it was a pain. That and the lottery machine seemed to be the hardest part of the job."
good,"As an intern, I was given structured responsibility that was beneficial to my education. This being said, the pay and moving stipend were not substantial enough to pay for my moving expenses. As Houston is an expensive city, the moving stipend should be increased. The same moving stipend is given to interns regardless of distance. Therefore if you are in Dallas and move to Houston it is the same as if you move from New York City to Houston. This is a real problem."
good,"The days consisted of managing a team of employees, constant contact with vendors, and proper inventory display. I learned my initial management skills in my time with the company. The most fulfilling part of the job in my time with the company was the ability to see immediate results after steps were taken, from shift switches to inventory display, I was able to see results of the labor."
good,Good company with good career growth. All refineries worked well with each other and shared information well.
good,"Marathon Oil was my first ever corporate job and I consider it a great first job in the corporate field. The people are somewhat friendly and helpful, but like all work places you have co-workers that are unique in their own way."
good,another night owl job meeting a lot of different people from a lot different backgrounds
good,A typical day at work involved monitoring of process units and project development.  The atmosphere is very friendly and supportive.
good,"I worked at Marathon Oil for 13 months and about 80-90% of the employees were contractors in the Professional offices in the Galleria area of Houston.  It seemed as though no matter if you gave 110%, the opportunity for becoming fulltime is very slim.  Most companies reward their employees for giving amazing customer service but Winfred Bourn was not one of those types of managers.  I appreciated his knowledge and the opportunity to work there but it was not a place that you could call home. I did receive additional knowledge there that I was able to take with me but the positive morales were not something that existed.  I have moved on and up but Marathon Oil is NOT a company that I would consider working for again especially because of the manager in the department that I worked."
good,"work is easy, meet tons of new people. good first job. gives good experience for cashiering and stocking."
good,"Good refinery experience, learn different areas of how petroleum industry works."
good,I learned a lot about HR at this company and formed wonderful work relationships.
good,Great company in early years but stopped being about employees and loyalty in later years. Layed me and other dedicated employees off after a lot of dedicated years of service to them!!!
good,I enjoyed working their and the customers were very nice as well
good,monitoring tank activity gauging tanks sampling tanks starting pumps turning valves loading tank cars hardest part of the job is 12 hr rotating shifts
good,"This is a fun, safe, and friendly environment to learn and grow with. A company that values its employees and strives to improve customer experience everyday."
good,Marathon Petroleum is a good company if you start at the company early on in your career.  They tend to promote from within and rarely hirer outside experienced individuals.  Which is great for the workforce that is already in the company but not great for others.
good,"Great company to work for. I was the manager of the store for some time off and on. I would open the store, handle customers, vendors, truck orders, bill payments and banking deposits."
good,I work in a very normal work place. meet a lot of different people from different places. being in a happy friendly work environment is so nice and sweet everyone is welcoming and friendly . the people are great.
good,It was an interesting place to be. Most of the people there were professional and hard working. It was a pleasant place to work.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Marathon. The management and employees were fun to work for and with. And hours were nice and flexible. There’s definitely a variety of products that are sold there that you can’t get at every other gas station which keeps the customers coming back. It was like a family, made me feel at home working for them."
good,"Company was really good to work for and good pay , the Health insurance was great too and I hated to leave , but there was very little overtime and I was traveling very far for work"
good,"The only thing wrong at all with this position was the people that were brought in out of state to run the projects.  They came with all their buddys and did everything how they wanted with no regard to anyone or anything in the places they were working at.  If they didnt like you, you just were pulled off your own position and stuck where they felt they wouldnt have to deal with you in their daily schedules."
good,"I worked autonomously and was discouraged from asking my coworkers or supervisor for help. I was expected to know my job, figure things out on my own and held accountable for any mistakes I made."
good,Great place to work. Swing shifts is the bread and butter for the refinery. If you don't mind that its the best place you could work. The management is great and they provide great benefits and compensation. Its a growing industry that isn't going anywhere.
good,"Always something new to learn. I've learned that there are task on the job that can be applied to everyday life. The culture leads you to having more open discussions and idea sharing. The hardest part of the job is also the best. Which is troubleshooting, where each situation is unique in the resolution. Through troubleshooting the more you learn different avenues to obtain the goal. As the industry grows you have the opportunity to grow with it."
good,"My typical day at work was learning all the prices in the store. we didn't have a scanner. so we had to learn the prices of each item. some had stickers and some didn't. but the more you learned, the easier it was."
good,Folks are nice and helpful in the store. Management is good . Salary could be better for everything you are required to do . Hours could be better for part time more than 20 per week .
good,Was a great place to work until the boss became very perverted. Loved talkimg to customers managing the store 5 nights a week by myself
good,just like any security job check premises do paper work look for anything suspicious and respond to alarms and codes. coworkers are very nice.
good,"Overall a good place, great benefits & work life balance.  Technology needs some upgrades, but in some areas they are improving this.  Reviews/promotions are based more on who you know & whose butt you kiss than how well you do your job."
good,"Work consisted of geoscience data management, using various software packages, primarily on UNIX workstation platform. Wrote SQL scripts to pull data from ORACLE-based software apps such as LandMark's Openworks, et al. Also maintained/updated paleontology database for the Gulf of Mexico via SQL, and managed all well log curve data using Geolog software. Got first exposure to Geolog software. Most co-workers were great, but there were one or two who made work more difficult than it had to be...nobody can ""win them all"" at every workplace. What mattered was getting the job done, and nothing interfered with that. I thought shorter-term, ongoing effective communication between myself and my superior were lacking when it came to year-end employee review time, but in retrospect, with the company undergoing rapid downsizing and reorg, I think my superior was out of the rapidly changing loop at times as well. I loved working with the software apps to achieve work goals."
good,"Challenging place to work with the variety of project always in the works. "
good,"I spend 7 years at Marathon Oil.  Great working culture.  Being a smaller organization, every one was very helpful.  The management is relatively new and they are in process of redefining what Marathon Oil is all about."
good,"Great Place to work, I learn alot of valuble thing that will benifit in the rest of my career. Management is were i didn't think marathon showed its strong points. the co-workers were very smart ans easy to work with."
good,Overall a nice place to work. The employees are very friendly. If you have enough drive you can grow with the company. Management is very flexible with development of employees. Only negative is pay scale is relatively low and job security may be a problem as well
good,I learned so much during my internship at Marathon. I was able to gain experience in all areas of procurement. I really enjoyed my team and the different community outreach opportunities the best. The hardest part of the job was to make sure I completed all of my projects in a timely manner. You were sort of on your own and had to learn how to prioritize and complete them on your own. They have great compensation and really try to take care of their employees.
good,"A Training Specialist for Marathon's Transport, Terminal, & Rail (TT&R) organization designs, developments, and evaluates job specific training for field personnel. Work with Subject Matter Expert teams in the development of task specific learning guides based on DACUM's performed on all field positions. Write learning guides which are used Qualified OJT Trainers."
good,Pipeline control is a good place to work.  Current control room manager is fantastic.  Opportunity to move up is good.  San Antonio office is a good office to work in.
good,Its really not much to say at all. Management isn't bad. they pay well and are pretty understanding about time off and what not. I would work for them again for sure
good,"Marathon is still a prestigious oil and gas company despite the various downturns and degraded management that have affected the company over the last six or seven years.   Under its previous leadership, MOC made great strides in overseas acquisitions, reserves building, and mentoring of younger staff.  After that leadership was replaced in 2013,  ill-advised management methods destroyed camaraderie and cooperation within the ranks.  Exploration also ceased and the company began selling off assets to maintain its Eagle Ford efforts. "
good,"It's a huge corporation so it comes with all of the good and bad of corporate culture. Meetings, company policy, safety videos, badges, the works. They have a pretty decent cafeteria in the lower lobby that's partially subsidized the prices are lower for employees and it can save you a lot of time on a busy day. There's even a Starbucks in the lower lobby (definitely NOT subsidized prices)."
good,This was a nice company to work for.  They had a good culture and seemed to really care about the workers.  Safety was always a top priority.    Pay was a little low for such a dangerous job.
good,good place to work.. i learned a lot and got a lot of experience in the work place.. i got along with my coworkers and always helped out when needed..
good,"Enjoyed working in the JV Audit Department.  Supervisor was personal, knowledgeable and a company person.  I enjoyed working for her.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling with my co-workers and working closely during our field work."
good,"It is a decent place to work, the working environment is very relax but at the same time technology is embraced to be successful. Unfortunately the company is affected by oil prices and it is shirking."
good,Good place to work. Low stress.  People really make or break the job.I was in a refinery setting so that also madea lot of differemce. Not so office stuffy ut more safety rules.
good,"Quiet atmosphere, respectful co-workers, culturally diverse, positive management. Management interested in helping you grow within the company. A nice place to work."
good,"Marathon Oil doesn't skimp when it comes to the personnel:duties ratio. The most enjoyable aspect of working for Marathon Oil, other than their immense regard for safety and environmental stewardship, is the level of team coordination placed on all projects. Honestly, I've not experienced anything like it since our local buyout."
good,"Marathon has very good benefits and compensation.  However, the culture is very conservative.  Management continues to try to expand the company and attract new employees."
good,"Upper management makes great decisions, lots of opportunities available to those willing to relocate. Work culture is good, lots of safety training, competitive salary."
good,Working at Marathon was okay. It was a fast paced work environment. You were provided a 30 minute lunch that is unpaid. But if you were not a marathon employee just a contractor you were treated different.
good,I worked 40+ hours/week with unresctricted overtime but saw the complexion of the workers deteriorate from multi-cultural to 100% Indian H1-B workers. By the end of my contract which ended with my being replaced by multiple foreigner (Indian) WIPRO lost this loss-leading contract and all digital services provided by WIPRO were brought in-house.
good,While I worked for Marathon I learned the Spotfire software package.  Compiled and kept track of production to send out to partners.  We had a great team while I was there.
good,"Great people to be with and work around. I was given a directions to follow and as long as I colored within the lines I could do whatever it took to accomplish our goals. It was such a wonderful place to work, the atmosphere was very positive even when the Lay Offs began and we all had a suspicion my position would not be renewed. It was done gracefully and with taste. My boss at the Kenedy site was one of the better ones I have ever had in my working life."
good,Very concerned with safety for their employees. I really enjoyed working here and made many lifelong friends along the way. Very professional and good environment for employees. Launched many times!!
good,"everyone was very helpful in my role, giving advise to be  a better employee. i was trained in various job roles to be a backup . i got the training as i asked for it."
good,"CBRE is a good international company, one of the best in the facilities management industry. Every account is different based on the client's diverse needs."
good,"At previous locations throughout my career with Marathon the culture was open and supportive. After transferring to OK I found many (not all) of the people to be closed minded, un-accepting of change and quite judgmental if you didn't fit into their idea of what your beliefs and values should be."
good,A typical day at work for me is starting work at 9am. I stock the coolers and then jump on the register. It teaches good  communication skills with customers. Management is good. The co-workers are great. There is really no hard part about this jobs just common sense. Having a good laugh with your co-workers
good,"Get up 4;00 a,m . go to physical training at 6;00 get back at 9;00"
good,"I am leaving this company not because it has issues, but rather because of my spouses career.  Management is good, the company is going in the right direction.  The healthcare benefits are decent and the compensation is on par with the industry."
good,"A good place to work with many opportunities to travel the Mideast.  There are a substantial amount of politics, but the company provides opportunities for advancement."
good,"A day at MPC garage is very busy. You never know what task you have to handle on any given day. I have learned many skills that I feel have helped further my career. The people are friendly. Of course with any job there are tough parts, and for MPC the hardest part is to be able to keep up with all the changes in company policies and guidelines. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that we add value to the company by providing cost effective maintenance, and providing a reliable safe fleet to the customer."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Nice, on-site cafeteria, great location, company gym, and great work-life balance. Some find limited potential to grow after awhile. Great place, but may not be a lasting fit for everyone. Most of the people there are great. It's a major part of why people stay."
good,"A typical day of work for me consisted of running the register and cleaning up anything that needed it and checking the outside trash every couple of hours and restocking the shelves and the cooler. I learned better people skills. I also really liked my co-workers. I liked my managers, they were always easy to get along with. The part of the job I disliked the most was bagging our own ice, it was really hard bagging it up and sealing it by yourself. The part I liked best was working with customers and stocking all the stuff that needed to be."
good,"Marathon Oil Company (the upstream company after the division) is a great company to work for with top notch compensation, work life balance and great company culture and company values. However, be ready to remain in the same titile/grade for a long time as promotions are rare even after 10 years in the same role, the salary keeps going up. There is also a lack of challenging opportunities so job satisfaction is low. The hardest part of job is staying busy for 8 hours a day. The leadership lacks the vision to grow the company and has sold off all the international ventures and turned the company into a domestic oil producer. The culture for new ventures is to look for low risk opportunities of which there are not many."
good,I liked the people I worked with a lot. They were like a little family to me and are always there if you need them.
good,"As a Sales Associate at Marathon, I took every opportunity to learn and grow.  I went above and beyond in my position.  I knew customers by name.  In addition to greeting customers, processing transactions, completing paperwork, stocking shelves, and counting money, I was also responsible for opening and closing the store, creating schedules, and making deposits."
good,"I was laid off back in 2015 after almost four years, but Marathon was a great company to work for. I would work for them if given another opportunity."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Marathon for the most part, every job/company has its ebbs and flows. I had worked on a couple occasions as a contractor then was hired permanently and relocated to Alaska. Definitely learned a great deal about Procurement, Contracts, Logistics and other aspects during my time there. I don't know what the culture is like now but was mostly positive when I was there. For many companies in oil and gas the environment and culture did change beginning in early February 2015 which is when I was laid off. If I had an opportunity to work for Marathon Oil again I certainly would."
good,Working here was excited because you got to interact with people. Everyday was something new. My boss was very understanding when it came to family. Good environment and good people.
good,"I had a good experience working for this company, I learned  alot on how to work create copies, imaging and printing regular documents and oversize documents, on regular copiers, plotters, imaging etc."
good,"Worked at Anacortes Wa.  a facility which was previously owned by Tesoro which was sold to Marathon Oil."
good,I love Marathon. They are one of the top companies in the country for a reason. It is a place to stay put and retire from. There is possibility for changes in position once you get your foot in the door.
good,"Working at Marathon is a blessing. It’s a strong company with strong leaders and employees. I really felt like I was supported by my supervisors. When a family problem comes up, that comes before work which is truly appreciated."
good,"Excellent people and place to work.  When I started at Marathon, I had no oil field experience.  Everyone that I worked with were helpful and made sure that I was trained and safe."
good,"Any given day or time is busy at Marathon, since it is located across apartments.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday. The hardest part of the job would be lifting 60 lbs or more on some days. You learn something new everyday that is what I like about this job."
good,"I loved my management, they were wonderful and did everything they could to make it better for everyone. However, some of the employees were less than desirable. They had to stay on because of hours and how shifts worked out, so I understand the decision, but it wasn't good for anyone. Everything was fair and understandable; one of the better jobs I had growing up."
good,"Marathon provided me many opportunities for advancement and if position was not eliminated due to organizational restructuring, I intended to remain with Marathon until retirement."
good,Fun meeting new people talking with the cops loved learning lotto. Didnt like being alone nor the location of store. Loved making food finally figuring paperwork out.
good,"Marathon Petroleum was an awesome place for an internship, they paid well and provided meaningful work for all of the interns. The on campus cafeteria was a bonus."
good,This Marathon was in a small town and I had almost the same customers every day I loved them coming in and knowing exactly what they wanted. I also liked meeting the new customers who stopped in on their way through town.
good,"Great work atmosphere, but un-appealing role in industry. Days can be dry and repetitive. Opportunities for advancement come slow, but pay and benefits are great."
good,Its fun working with costumer and great experience. the fun part is always you will have good communication with customer and talking funny stuff and meet different people.
good,Good company to work for but the downturn in the oil and gas sector lead to me looking for another job.  Co-workers were great to work with pay and benefits were also great

good,"Every day new logic's implementation."
good,"Company gives great opportunity to switch your fields and grow. Bonuses are great."
good,"I enjoyed working for Marathon Oil. However, there was not much room for growth.  I had a great relationship with everyone that I worked with on a day-to-day basis, especially my supervisor."
good,"great co-workers, good working environment and great benefits. The new management is bringing in both positive and negative aspects of Exxon style management. Therefore, many things in this company may change in next few years."
good,"If your happy making a good but not great living and not having to work hard for it this is the place for you. Little control over future as promotions only happen due to luck. "
good,Nice place to work. Sometimes politics are involved as with any corporate job. Managers are either extremely laid back or really uptight. Internship program was fun and rigorous especially towards the end. They really challenge you in this internship to be innovative and have initiative.
good,Friendly staff who worked well together. Providing great customer service to build a connection with customers. Managers who are easy to talk to and helpful.
good,"Project management responsibilities from 8AM - 5PM, Monday through Friday with 30% travel for work."
good,MPC was a very good place to work. Management genuinely cared about the health and well-being of their employees.

good,Marathon has good values and care for there employees. I have gained valuable knowledge in the CBM field.
good,Fabulous working environment/culture.  Strived to advance business function within my scope of responsibilities. Great builder of teams/team environment

good,"this job allows you to excel. You get the opportunity to learn new things, meet new people. This job can get stressful at times but management was amazing"

good,"Fast paced environment with a HUGE variety of tasks in a large variety of locations. No two days are the same, always something to keep life interesting even in the admin offices."
good,The management was very high and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy going job. The coworkers are also to easy to get along with. A great first job for anyone.

good,".A typical day was usually the same so basically run the register and lean the store"
good,Family orientated company that puts family first and considers Safety a condition of employment. Workforce is heavy on the engineering and advancement can be challenging.
good,I worked in Kurdistan with Marathon. It was a very interesting place to work due to the political and logistics of getting people and equipment in. I would go back in a heart beat enjoyed my time with the Kurds and had a great time.

good,Challenging work. I was able gain many skills. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Allowed me to live a good life style and raise my family. Would encourage any one to seek employment with Marathon at a refinery or truck loading terminal as worker or a professional
good,Company seemed to have little respect for hourly personnel. Very limited advancement opportunities without an engineering degree. Company took pinching pennies to an extreme
good,Not a bad place to work.   Even the smaller refineries have a nice family feel to the workforce.  Union Management relations improved greatly just before I left with the election of a new local union leader.
good,"Customer service, cash handling, and cleaning, stocking the shelves and inventory. standing for a long period, cleaning the shop area."
good,"Great place to start career, however, I'm not sure how the current oil price may be impacting current employees.  All the same, its a big company and good place to grow."
good,"Marathon is a great company and enjoyable to work for. It is large enough to provide a variety of opportunities for employees, but not so big that you feel lost in the masses. One thing that I really like about Marathon was their active involvement in charity and giving back to community such as involvement in Susan G Komen Race for the Cure, Impact a Hero, volunteer project in 5th ward Houston, and Books for Bioko and anti-malarial projects in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea (West Africa)."

Good fair management at the plant I worked with. There was all kinds of job opportunities there. I have been gone for quite a few years and still miss the people I worked with. Hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer time.

I worked primarily out of my home, but was well linked with a district office and home office for the neeeded professional asistance. The hardest part of the job was some of the market realities which began to rear in 2007. The most enjoyable part of the job was the independence."
good,"Great company to work for, it is a busy gas station. I work there part-time to support my educational expenses."
good,"My normal routine is from 6am - 6pm. Most of the people take the bus at their bus stop to get to work and others do not. What I love the most about matathon is their trong safety commitment and environment. That is what actually  help us be safe in the industry. It is hard sometimes to follow, however, at the end you realize the importance of being safe working around condensate and gas."

good,"I appreciate the job security as there is years of work needed to be finished.  The support I receive from management is excellent.  The field crews doing the ""As-built"" walkdowns are well trained and have excellent attitudes."
good,"You deal with lots of people every day. If you are not a people person, this job probably isn't for you. A typical day would be coming in, receiving a to-do list, checking the garbage cans near the pumps and cleaning around the pumps, stocking drinks and snacks and performing sales operations with customers."
good,An average day was filled with learning new skills imperative for my job. Everyone was helpful and understanding. Findlay Ohio is furthest from an ideal town.

good,"Management is the key to a good work place, my management is amazing! My coworkers are like family. Although we get alot of off the wall and sometimes disrespectful customers, most of our patrons are amazing and love the fact that we remember what they usually purchase."
good,"My job was to load petroleum products at their terminals into their tanker vehicle and deliver those products to customer sites. (Company owned or independent dealers.)  Dispatches changed on a daily basis and sometimes changed during the day. Those dispatches were often challenging to accomplish during the work day even when few delays occurred and that was rare.  Usually dispatch was (reluctantly) understanding.  Any terminal delays were often verified by others as all drivers loaded at the facilities."
good,"They are very nice and are small oil & gas company compared to like shell. Job was relatively easy and good supportive system of a team atmosphere. Pay was decent and fair, and they are willing to flex your schedule if need be if there is a certain issue(s) in your personal life."
good,No over time for non exempt hourly truck drivers. Other than that an awsome place to work. Great culture and people are all nice. Treat you good. Great flexibility.

Typical day at work when the daily sales shifts gets over or short and then find the errors. I learned how to keep up with all the paper work and how to lead an employee throughout the management. Workplace culture  was very peaceful and very helpful to each others.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to have monthly dinner with companies employees."

good,Overall great work experience. Really enjoyed the guys I worked with as well as the job I performed. Would definitely go back to Marathon Petroleum again.

Facilitated collecting, organizing, editing, weekly and monthly reports for executives the director.  I also designed and built Sharepoint websites for file storage  for several different departments within refining."
good,"Great company but very poorly management, and staff to work for. Always short handed, no Schedule breaks, no lunch break, work day he consist of 14hr work days with no lunch or any other type of breaks, or relief. It paid great for a gas station salary but I work no less than 120hrs every two weeks."
good,I love working here i do wish they had more benefits though. It is in its early stages of new ownership so things are a little crazy but all in all it is a good place to work.
good,"Advancement is an option if you are favored.  Work life balance is low.  Overtime is excessive, so time off is short.  The company is great.  They really take care of their employees.  Garyville location is the flagship and there are a great group of people throughout all departments that are very knowledgeable and hard working."

The manager Debbie Evans was a great trainer who had taught me how to run registers as well as the Lottery machines. On the weekends my boss would allow the High school which I had attended years ago, to have fund raiser car washes.Which,was always during my shift on Saturday morning.This consisted of the cheerleaders, baseball, or football teams.

From previous experience with oilfield jobs i was more than hesitant that this company would be better, but it was more that I had expected.  Everyday I enjoy coming to work and actually ate having to miss for any reason at all.  I enjoy the team that I work with and management has been nothing but honest, fair, and fun to work with as well.  They value their employees as well as family values and overall this company has been a blessing to work for and hope to keep this as my career and would love to retire from here!"
