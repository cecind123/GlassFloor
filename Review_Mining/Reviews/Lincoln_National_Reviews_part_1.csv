bad,Tensions are high. Your co workers you most likely will not be able to trust . There is a lot of snitching and sneaking because people will want to get you fired if they don’t like you or if they want your position. The managers are hard to get a  a hold of either out of the office or in meetings all day. If you reach out to someone to assist you which is their position they answer rudely like they don’t want to be at work. You can try this position maybe you will have better luck. I came in very nice and they chewed and spit me up because a co worker who had been there longer did not agree with me. Something to keep in mind if your looking for long term this probably isn’t it
bad,Process claims. Pressured to make unrealistic deadlines. Stressful. High Turnover. Toxic and very strange work culture. No room for advancement. Poor technology.
bad,By far the worst place I ever worked at! I am warning all that decides to apply.. You will not be doing anything that you applied for but get stuck on the phones and a million emails you will not understand. Poor management and they care less about their employees and for just 16.45 Trust me its not worth it!!
bad,The managers really make u feel stupid like you don’t belong there . All the managers are very young with no kids so they have no clue on work ethic or what a team should really be like . Managers have no work life balance ! They lie to you and tell you the you can work from home lies ! They let you work from home if they like you period ! Very unfair company . They don’t care about their employees at all !!! Run run run
bad,"Lincoln used to have a sterling reputation but in this last year the company took hundreds of millions in tax cuts and told its employees it would be going back to the company. Meanwhile they have cut paying people for cross training, found creative ways to deny the annual bonus to employees and hiked charges on customer accounts. They tried to take away HSA contributions by saying they would be adding 2 weeks of paternity leave instead. I can't find one good example of how money has gone back into the company for the average employee, since they have restructured. If you want to make 30K for working 4-10 different product lines, being forced last minute to work on holidays and to have your requests for time off sit in a queue for so long they get to it weeks after you even requested time off, go ahead and apply. The max you get for an annual raise is 2% I would not be surprised if Dennis Glass clears 20-25 million this year, or more, because NOTHING has gone back in the company or its average employees."
bad,"Management and Supervisors are Really Poor Treated you Like you are Really Dumb sitting in the Hot Sun waiting for Job Assignments, waiting for a Transport Bus to and the Parking Lot which sometimes did not show up"
bad,"LFG is hood and unprofessional. High turn over rate, no coaching they will just fire you for something coachable to start a new class.  Low opportunity for advancement throughout company. High call volume of rude people calling in seeking disability checks or dainty dental office clerks calling in being rude for no reason."
bad,The disorganization starts from the top down. The Company advertises itself as employee-centric but they are anything but. The Executive Managers are unable to provide consistent messaging. Each area of the same operation says something different the scrambles. Those same areas don’t work together at all. The employees suffer as a result. They communicate expectations and timelines but rarely meet their own expectations.  They frequently recant messages. HR also has inconsistent messaging. You can call several times asking the same question and get a different answer every time. Their IT department is outsourced and almost useless. The department that is not outsourced is understaffed. You wait over a half an hour only to get bounced around. Their maternity benefits are terrible and so is their compensation. I’m almost embarrassed to say I worked for them. And it wasn’t by choice. I would never work for them again.
bad,If you are not the liked or a favorite they don’t work with you nor do they care about you!  Work hard keep your head down and they will just take sides.  Management is weak with no backbone!
bad,"No employee compassion. They are always hiring because they are always firing. "
bad,Training was terrible then when you get out of training you are suppose to be able to ask others on the floor for help but because they were so short staffed- that never happened! This is the worse job I’ve ever had and would NEVER suggest anyone work there.
bad,"There is no room for advancement. If you are one of the lucky few to get out of claims, life might be better. Don't expect to ever make over $50,000 handling claims. You will receive threats of violence from claimants and managers DO NOT CARE."
bad,"They will promise you the world while interviewing, but only when you start to work do you find out they do not mean what they say. "
bad,"Digitalizar, preparar tablas, presentaciones, cartas, emails, archivar, cuentas a pagar."
bad,"If you think bullying ends with high school then be warned. It's just part of the culture at LFG, and actual leadership skills mean nothing."
bad,"It's clear that LFG values incompetence. Clueless, poorly trained client reps loose paperwork, hang up on calls, and generally make it impossible for clients to get paid. That's a built in strategy at Lincoln."
bad,"Management has no clue what they are doing.  Extremely toxic culture, no consistency, worst move I've ever made.  Company is morally bankrupt and they tell you in ""town hall"" meetings that their priority is their shareholders. not the employees and especially not the insureds or their families"
bad,"Working at Lincoln has been the most miserable experience of my life so far. Expectations are not realistic and the leadership style is basically bullies trying to intimidate employees."
bad,"At Lincoln, you can expect to be threatened. If you refuse to cheat a customer or break the law, it will only get worse. You've been warned."
bad,"If you like being challenged to a fight by your supervisor because you witnessed someone copying customers' personal information (and also getting harassed by HR), then by all means come work for LFG."
bad,"From what I saw at my time with LFG, I'd say they were the Wells Fargo of insurance companies. Various management flaws, lack of training, and impossible expectations meant the customer always got shafted. The blog lincolnfraud.wordpress actually does a good job describing the culture."
bad,"This company was the worst experience I've ever had at work, and that counts the terrible jobs I had in high school and college."
bad,This is the only company I've worked for that will bad mouth great performers to keep them from leaving. It's also the only job that put me on worker's comp. The employee who injured me wasn't punished in any way.
bad,got to meet new people in a fun and environment. work a register  and take tickets while keeping an eye on the parking lot. hours were very long
bad,Horrible management and expectations that are not humanly possible. No work life balance. Pay is not good.
bad,"Agreed that it is all about who likes you at Lincoln Financial Group. No job security, no work-life balance, and no compassion from any manager. You are a number, not a person."
bad,I learned a lot. I also learned I was not going to be a good fit there long term
bad,"Horrible immature management, not supportive."
bad,"Micro- management, no chance for advancement, pressure, lack of leadership. Middle management is not respected, senior management will side with employee before the manager"
bad,"Compensation is far below average, management is all picked based on who you know, and every employee I know wants out of the company."
bad,"During my work experience at Lincoln Financial Group for 3 years in customer service in the call center, it was a pretty good experience to start with management being flexible, incentives being thrown around, but then slowly evolved into management expecting everyone to be ""drones"" in the workplace. Management started setting stricter guidelines, performance rules, and not allowing anyone to come into work and socialize with their peers, etc. Employees were just expected to come into work, stare at a screen and take calls for 8 hours a day, not give any negative feedback regarding the company or procedures, and maintain a positive outlook on the future of the company. The best part about the company and only good thing about the company at this point were my co-workers. When I could communicate with them, they were supportive, fun and friendly. I like to think of Lincoln as a ""concentration camp"" and I'm sure other various employees would agree with me, at least in the call center. Management dictates what should be done, and employees are to do as they're told or be out the door."
bad,Promised a totally different job and work environment during interview and training. Training was suppose to be almost 4 week but it was cut short by week and a half. You are then thrown onto the floor and put into a work environment where you are taking constant calls with no break in between. You almost have to be a robot and process claims for customers while adhering to constantly changing rules and guidelines by the company. I only worked here for a few months and couldn’t take it anymore. Not worth it at all. Very crab in a bucket work environment
bad,"There is a long history of turnover with Lincoln Financial in my past role."
bad,Mass hiring because company bit off more than they can chew. Trainers need to be subject matter experts in what they teach (greatly lacking). Always complaining about hard they work and gossiping all the time.
bad,"Since purchasing Liberty's disability business, they are failing miserably to do what they intended to do. Horrifically underqualified mgmnt. Mass hiring of anyone off the street, totally incompetent trainers, pay is a joke for the intensity and importance of the work!!"
bad,"You are expected to handle and interpret contracts for 120 cases. Management is not consistent. I had a horrible manager that lacked people skills! They have high turnover due to strict deadlines (ie calling doctors, sending out requests to client and doctors, review medical records, calculate benefits and answer all incoming calls)"
bad,"I swear I hated it. I worked there for years, and they decided to be very sneaky and get rid of positions, and say that it's due to making changes to improve things. I watched so many people come and go! I was so stressed, and micromanagement is what they stand behind. The only reason I stayed was for the benefits!!!!! But, my sanity was more important. This place can really affect your personal relationships. It's a great place to work, if you don't have a life!!!!"
bad,"Many that hold senior leadership roles are small minded, tunnel vision, self promoters. Middle management suffers at their hands, as they are not concerned with whom they destroy in order to advance themselves. If you’re not a member of the clique, look for a new job."
bad,"This company does not train properly but yet they expect you to meet their crazy metrics. This is micromanagement at its finest I have never been so unhappy at a job. They are clueless on how to provide customer service because they only focus on the numbers, how many calls, how long on hold, they could care less about the customer and their satisfaction. They want to compete to be the best company for retirement plans but their strategy will never work. They want to cater to each employer but it is impossible because the employees cannot keep up with all these changes, requirements, and rules for each plan. On top of that, they are very behind the times they are still asking customers to mail or fax forms. People don't use faxes anymore and then they claim to be so concerned about the security of their customer's information yet they ask them to mail in the application with all their personal information. Can someone please tell me if that makes any sense. Why not allow customers to email or have a way for them to upload documents into their portal. Then when the customers finally sends in the forms to request a distribution the company takes forever to process and poor customers have to call multiple times to get the status on receiving THEIR money. Honestly, this place is horrible for the employees and customers. Get with the times LFG, stop worrying so much about metrics and micromanaging the employees and worry more about the customers and their satisfaction. You would have far less employee turnover if people weren't miserable. Thank goodness I no longer work there."
bad,This company acquired my previous employer  in May. The transition has been terrible a complete and udder lack of transparency. Their have been multiple broken promises and a few outright lies.
bad,"Liberty Mutual (LM) was just bought by Lincoln and the reason they are trying to hire so many case managers is because every other day someone has quit. This role is in a call center environment. Management is a joke. Managers discuss potential new hires negatively among employees, incredibly unprofessional. Mentors, senior employees and management gossip like they are in high school. Every single employee in this department dislikes the job. Nothing good to say about this place other than the 401k plan is great. Was employed with LM for three months, was an awful experience. Keep searching!"
bad,Started looking for a different role within 3 months of starting at LFD.  Was disappointed it took nearly 3 years to find my next role.  It's an old boys club.  Collaboration and team work seemed to be foreign concepts.
bad,"I started at the Atlanta office Aug 2016. I had another job offer on the table but LFG said there was room for advancement. Once I started asking questions I learned that that was a total lie. "
bad,The stability of your job depends on how many people like you. If you have the ability to brown nose and do not perform well you will be successful.
bad,A lot of rah rah back slapping and fluff for the senior leaders but no support nor time for the actual associates who do the work. Many great areas for the company but HR isn’t one of them.
bad,Severely micromanaged by the two managers there.  They undervalue you and treat you like a child. HR is a joke.  They don’t care about employees concerns.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  HORRIBLE managers.
bad,I have been told that since I left this position that the management has completely changed which is a good thing.  I worked as a customer service rep in a customer service position.  We were  blocked from taking vacation days for two to three weeks after a quarterly statement was released.  Not only did that happen but most all of the time we had to eat lunch while we were working and the bad thing is that we were telephone agents so we would have to chew our food so that customers could not hear us.
bad,"You will not like the job, or management! They decided to offer good benefits to make up for the terrible pay, and stress. You'll end up taking meds for depression. You'll have to choose between your sanity, family life, or benefits."
bad,"Very Very Stressful work place. management does not care how much time you have to do the work, they just want it done. You are doing  16 hours  work in 8 hours everyday."
bad,"The environment is very noisy and Lincoln provides little to no training.  Outsourcing jobs to a foreign country rather than keeping them in the USA goes against what I believe in and what the president is trying to accomplish."
bad,"Company is entrenched in what it terms ""The Lincoln Way"".  There is no openness to new ideas or new people. Employees are expected to work horrific hours, often 7 days per week, without compensation, appreciation or recognition. Fort Wayne management is terrible. Fort Wayne local, long-term employees are incredibly unprofessional. Having worked at Lincoln their whole careers, they have no idea what professional behavior looks like."
bad,"Not a great place to work."
bad,"One of the worst organizations that I think I've been a part of in 30 years.  Great pay and benefits, but high level of stress due to poorly training managers and executives."
bad,"The actual job was great as well as the policies and core values the company claims to uphold. However, after three years of service I could not tolerate the bullying and harassment from a few co-workers and the partiality from management. -SM"
bad,Let’s just say my manager was loose with his ethics and promoted those that rewarded him. He couldn’t control the people who worked for him and the drama was unreal. It felt almost like he enjoyed it sometimes. I do NOT recommend working here. Also it’s pretty hard to move up once you’re in. The more positions you apply for the more it counts against you and others are chosen over you. Although I have heard if you get up high enough it’s a great place to work.
bad,Management was never around. I thought this was giving me autonomy until my position was eliminated out of the blue-management didn't know enough about what I was doing to fight to keep me.
bad,"There is none,  a min of a 45-50 hour work week with a constant demand for overtime. Within the short term disability claims department there is no career advancement"
bad,"Atlanta office needs better direction when it comes to the Directors and AVP.  They have no clue how to run an office and will run off good talent.  There's a lot of favoritism in this office and if you expressed your ideas which are not in line with the leadership staff or speak up you will be an outcast.  They will continue to find whatever they can on you to make your life miserable and force you to leave.  "
bad,"Depends where you would in the company all depends if you're going to have a work life balance. Where I worked there is not a work life balance. Management definitely shows their favorite employees. You basically have to be at 100% quality and don't speak to be appropriated by management. They always want you to give ideas at work, but never actually use your ideas, unless someone that they favor brings up that idea. Raises suck...it's once a year and it doesn't matter if you have worked there for 5 years or 7 months, the whole team gets the same raise (atleast that's how it was on my team I worked for)."
bad,Great company to work for if you like micromanagement. Not family oriented and  management shows favoritism. Hard to advance within the company. If you think about working there make sure you do your research.
bad,"A typical day was working more than the 8 hours a day to only get half your claims processed while taking calls and emails all day long from claimants, employers, brokers, service account managers and internal customer service team. They set very unrealistic team goals that will never be accomplished. Management was more concerned with the numbers and did not take feedback from experienced claims examiners about work flow process to get the job done. The morale is beyond low. Toxic enviroment, no work life balance. Have to work late every night and on weekends. Very strange work culture. Its a them against us mentality, but we are one team. A set up for failure. Consider your options very carefully before you commit."
bad,Poor planning and execution of project plan. Work units were started and abruptly stopped due to lack of overall project managment and test data. Very negative responses received when issues arose and were reported.
bad,i didn't like this job because I got paid a month late but the people that I worked with was great.
bad,My biggest problem with this company was the way they handled some of the customers when I worked there.  They were not really customer oriented and a lot of people got into monetary issues because of the lack of willingness on Lincoln's part.
bad,"Fast pace"
bad,Aggressive Company. I worked as a Business Analyst in the Life Insurance Industry.
bad,"more concerned with output not quality.  just put it in production, we will fix it later is the most current attitude.  and forget knowing about the systems/products.  just do it this way now."
bad,working at the football stadium was not fun for me because I didn't like standing for long hours in extreme hot or cold weather. you definitely have to wear proper footwear for them long hours
bad,"It was a typical intern job. Go get coffee, send out mass emails, take packages to the post office, etc. I didn't learn much when I did my internship but I don't think that should reflect on the company as a whole."
bad,Actual responsibilities differed and it was not a good fit.  Nothing more to say as I think the company does not currently exisit
bad,NOT a place to be if you are looking for job opportunities and/or growth. 80+ people apply internally for any given job just because they are desperate to move around. Must lock in to any position for 12 months.
bad,"poor environment and pay!  dishonest! I don't like working at this company because of the pay and environment. It is monotonous work and unprofessional. A dishonest company. I have had quite a few people that I have called either tell me that they are not interested or that they think that the company is dishonest. "
bad,"Lincoln was not a great place to work. There was minimal career advancement unless you were in senior management. The culture is cold and unfriendly. As an example if you said good morning most of time you would get no response. They claim to be change agents in the industry, but when it is time to actually make changes, it is resisted by employees and managers."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is asking for clarification on job roles and responsibilities but getting no clear or consistent answer for 3 years.  Management is just there to rubber stamp senior leadership decisions.  There is a great deal of time and effort dedicated to creating the illusion of analysis to justify and then cover for strategic decisions which have already been made, seemingly based on a buzz word a senior manager recently heard or who is drinking buddies with someone who owns the consulting firm that they've already decided to use."
bad,"This was my first job out of college.  I was extremely eager to jump start my career.  While I learned a lot at Lincoln, I feel that I was grossly underpaid for the amount of work I did.  The benefits were horrible and the hours were long."
bad,"Lincoln at first seems like a wonderful company to work for.  It is only after your training has been completed and you have become competent in your position that you begin to realize that corporate leadership is very disjointed to the point where it feels like the blind leading the blind."
bad,When I first started the company culture was family oriented. The management was great.  You were compensated fairly well.  But when the new management came in they were cut throat and unfair.  They micromanaged every thing your did and the production standards were unfair.
bad,Unless you intend on being your bosses best friend and not advancing I would not work here. Management does not care about their employees only their numbers and how good they look.
bad,Lincoln won’t promote within unless your department is stable. When does this ever happen? Working with Indians everyday is a nightmare. Hate this Co.
bad,Work life balance does not exist. Benefits are good. No job security they are out sourcing and management is good old boys system. There are no career paths to move up in the company.
bad,"I had a great experience until my last role. One person does not like you, they will get rid of you. They expect a lot of work in a short period of time."
bad,Istarted at the company and management was very disorganized and the other workers in the department were too busy to assist in training. I felt like an outsider and was treated badly and felt very uncomfortable
bad,"Let me start by saying that I am not a disgruntled employee. In fact, I've done pretty well here so far; however, my success is certainly despite many things. First of all..management is a complete mess. Every week it is a new rule, focus, etc and management changes like the wind. There are some pretty clueless managers..mine hasn't even bothered to learn our systems, for example. There is definitely a lot of favoritism and I can honestly say that I've been the beneficiary of some. This company wants to be awesome but it is stuck in the stone ages (for example, they are just not even thinking about starting a pilot work from home program). Everything you learn in training regarding schedules is shot to hell once you get on the floor. Just please keep looking."
bad,Compensation was not great compared to other companies in the city.
bad,"Short Term disability is a department you do not want to work in.  The management is clicky and they only like you if  you are under 30.   It doesn't matter how well you do the impossible job their if you are not in the click, they look for ways to get rid of you.   It is cold and uninviting.  It is about making money not helping people period.  it is an insurance company. "
bad,"They had a great work life balance with plenty of flexibility, but that was offered to offset the lack of salary and benefits. They required that I become licensed with FINRA but then never used my training or licenses. There was no revenue sharing and the work environment was often uncomfortable with egos clashing and passive aggressive behavior."
bad,Neutral place to work.  Just not many chances to advance or grow.  Need to know someone to advance.  Not necessarily a bad place to work.  Just nothing beyond average.
bad,This company is all about micro management. You do not get the right training and they expect you to know all when you leave training.  Management has their favorites
bad,"Lincoln is a solid company rooted in core values.  The benefit programs are second to none.  However, the culture has changed dramatically over the last few years.  Managers are no longer empowered to make decisions and lead by fear.  Senior Leadership is weak and that filters down to line managers."
bad,"There are two claims departments located in Omaha and Atlanta. The two departments do not process claims in the same manner  and there is an unprecedented lack of communication between the sites. I worked in the Atlanta claims department for three years. The claims staff are some of the most personable people I have ever worked with. Unfortunately, the management are without a doubt the poorest. There are lemonade stands with more business acumen. The middle management are poorly educated and lack critical thinking and problem solving skills. This leads to a culture of hiring lower middle management who are (terrifying) less qualified and thus will present no threat to middle management positions. Sadly, the Atlanta organization runs with little supervision from the Omaha head office and this culture has and will continue.  The corporate culture is exemplified with a lack of accountability hitherto unseen outside of an Enron boardroom meeting. Under no circumstances join this organization looking for promotion through hard work, competency or experience gained. You will be sorely disappointed. Instead, try to cultivate an attitude which blindly follows management ideology regardless of how poorly planned or obviously flawed. All job progression is promoted through the Omaha location with the Atlanta site offering little or no opportunity for advancement. "
bad,"When you are hired in the Call Center you are given a month of training to learn the system and a 2 week of live calls. Once on the floor you will take 60+ calls (Dental, Short and Long Term, Tax Questions, Life Claims) and you will deal with many different people who will be upset over long wait times to speak with you, coverage that didn't pay, to many other problems. Once you get the hang of the calls you will fell like a robot because you will do the same type of call each and everyday. Also, you will have to meet you stats and make sure that you are on time each day. When I started I was told that we will have a career plan, but once you have completed the skills in the call center advancement at Lincoln is bleek."
bad,"Office atmosphere, cubicles, mail room, corner office, etc. Nothing special. A job with no advancement or learning. Just going through the motions each day with subtle nuances."
bad,stressful place to work. no room for advancement in career.  No focus placed in growth. their technology was archaic and it takes a long time to turn everything aroud
bad,"I worked in Compliance, and received barely any training.  The manager was constantly under stress and took it out on all of us.  The company itself expected constant overtime (40+ hours per week) and didn't compensate for those hours in any way.  Horrible atmosphere"
bad,"The broker dealer at Lincoln Financial is no longer in Concord due to poor management.  The company did not hire those who were qualified, but rather, those who knew or were friends with the top managers."
bad,"created files with customer information to load into the system, enrolled customers on a daily basis with insurance benefits and offered benefits, data entry"
bad,"I worked for Lincoln financial for two years and there were a lot of changes, people retired new people came aboard.  I was not happy with one of the Advisor, even though I would babysit and change diapers and play with her child during work hours.  Very stressful place to work."
bad,"The area I was in has VERY poor management -- the management did not manage the work nor did they manage the people. "
bad,i was able to learn about another aspect of the life insurance industry . I was able to look at life differently when it comes to life insurance as a whole.
bad,"In doing much needed modernization, their business structure is to get rid of non revenue producing life policies.  Good for the company, but bad for the client's who have had policies for years and now they can't afford them."
bad,"Just like any other job, ups and downs. This company is moving to a different location soon which should be exciting (april 2016)"
bad,Very well Organized and very Professional. Hardest part is there is no flexibility and the company lacks empathy towards the Employees.
bad,This company is straight out of the 90's. What you have to understand is that there are mostly older people working there so you have to deal with that.
bad,"Responsible for identifying, routing, prepping, and scanning thousands of varying document images, as well as indexing all incoming faxes for the correct business area(s),  to help achieve 99.7% accuracy rating, process returned mail, work on special projects with in Imaging, Incoming Mail or Records."
bad,"There is no room for advancements."
bad,Lincoln provides a very professional atmosphere. I enjoy working with my co workers. We work lots of long hours but we operate as a team.
bad,"Some of the pros are pay, vacation, and bonus. However work life balance is terrible and they give very little telecommute options considering how advanced we are in technology in this time and day. People that advance are favorites to management which is not fair to those who honestly work hard to earn it. Most of all management is horrible because they have their favorites and they are not shy to show that."
bad,"With recent acquisition of Liberty Mutual Benefits they are struggling to find their identity.  They really bit off more than they can handle in my opinion and are starting to make some dramatic cost cuts.  It's going to take years to realize the benefit of this acquisition, if you are in the right place it should be interesting, but it seems like everything is a short term fire drill lately."
bad,In claims the daily production goals and continuous auditing of your work create a very stress full climate.  Add to that continuous email and calls from several types of customers makes for a busy day all day long.
bad,"Working for Lincoln Financial Group was like being back in high school.  If management and your coworkers liked you, you were fine.  If they did not like you, it meant you could not even expect common courtesies such as a hello when you passed in the hall.  Very cliquish.  "
bad,"I was a night bathroom cleaner for multiple floors with a bathroom on both sides of the floor. I was responsible for cleaning, mopping, sweeping and disinfecting all surface areas of each individual bathroom stall as well as larger bathroom sink area. I started the night shift by loading my cart, and continued to re-stock supplies as needed. I was allowed one 15 min. break/shift."
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Lincoln Financial.  I had just celebrated my 7 year anniversary a month before my job was eliminated.  I do feel that there was a lot of great people at Lincoln Financial Group. However, I do not feel that in my area that we had the best leadership.  We as employees were not supported by leadership which made it difficult to ask for help when management refused to offer assistance.  I learned to be very self sufficient."
bad,Not much too say. Took over a month to get hired. Ran a credit check and question my history. No parking priveliges. Had to park on street two blocks away.
bad,"Stuffy working environment, micro-managing enforced, difficult to move up or get promoted.  Low salary and poor salary increases."
bad,Project work was up and down.  Workload did not vary enough to advance.  Co-workers were great.  Management was not supportive of advancement.
bad,"Good benefits, but department I worked in, was horrible.  We were overworked and never had meetings to discuss what could make things better as a unit."
bad,Working here was like a school yard playground. Either the people were tucked away in the cubbie holes or out running around like a chicken with their heads cut off.
bad,"LFG salaries are embarrassingly low.  People are not managed properly in some areas of the company.  I never felt very appreciated there.  HR is not on your side if you have a genuine concern about a manager.  People can be treated like workhorses.  The investment area of Lincoln is horrible.  No appreciation for hard work, there are toxic managers, and there is absolutely no work-life-balance in some areas.  Gaping lack of adequate training and technology."
bad,"This would be a great place for someone who enjoys working in a "
bad,Not like any other place I have worked for. I miss my co workers.
bad,"Entered employment with the company through a temporary service. The employment began with the acquistion of another company which caused the normal training program to be halted serveral times, leaving new hires basically reviewing screens of information in a tiny training room. There was no dynamic trainjng process in place to acclimate new hires to the business model. Placement with team members constituted the bulk of the training in an environment of high stress for the employees, basically the training consisted of listening to phone calls, no real substitive training before placement into call center role."
bad,"I had the misfortune of working for this company for about 9 months. Shortly after I was hired, they brought in a new CIO that thought it would be a good idea to outsource all IT functions to CSC. CSC promised a lot and couldn't deliver. After they laid off practically every employee at the Portland, Maine office, and shut it down, CSC sucked more money out of the company than anyone thought was possible. I heard later that the CIO that initiated the brilliant idea was fired, and the contract with CSC was also terminated. While I was there, I met a lot of good people. The lower level managers were fine, the upper level ones were in way over their head and didn't have a clue."
bad,"You have to department hop to earn more money because the yearly pay raises are awful.  Average 2%"
bad,"Back to back phone calls with very little free time to learn new things. Managers are in meetings most of the time rarely available."
bad,"The training was great, but the call center floor had very bad negative feel. If you were good at your job they didnt want to advance you out of the call center. Which sucked, being on the phone non stop was a burn out. Coworkers were hit and miss on attitude. Some of the managers should not be in management but been there for 10 plus years wouldnt get rid of them."
bad,"You would think that working at the Eagles stadium is exciting...guess again.  They expect you to give your all to the company when you only work maybe 2 times out of the month at most, my last 3 checks from them combined had to be no more than 200 dollars...combined people. You are basically another name and face in there. You're on your feet for 8 hours overseeing a section, ticket taking, or pushing somebody in a wheel chair.  I didn't receive my pay for one of the games I worked.  My co workers were pretty nice and cool people.  The hardest part of the job is knowing you are gonna receive a little check in 2 weeks.  The most enjoyable part was the fans that were there and being able to watch the game for free."
bad,Company is top heavy and they do not properly staff to accommodate the amount of business that is on the books.  Lincoln pushes employees to their maximum and the clients suffer the effects of employees that are spread too thin.  They have unreasonable expectations from sales and service teams.
bad,"I was not a good fit for this position. I did well on licensing and technical understanding but am not good at personal, direct cold call selling. Nofault of the company."
bad,"Culture was different. Facilities are dated, but full of amenities. "
bad,"Most managers are not qualified to lead their departments. They are disrespectful, and do not value your opinions even though they say that they want them. The 401k program is one of the only positive assets that this company offers."
bad,I came in on a team that was to transition jobs from other employees who were being fired after years of working there.  Having to learn the job from them was awkward and we were not allotted adequate training time.
bad,Being employed in a call center is a very fast paced environment.  I like the variety of each day.
bad,"Overall just an average place to work. They are behind in technology in a big way and they are just starting to embrace D&I which most companies embraced in the 90's. "
good,"Stressful, overwhelming with very little breaks to keep Production High, very little room to take a breather. Numbers are priority therefore pressure is applied that causes Unhappiness. LFG Culture needs an adjustment of more freedom/human and non-Factory Environment. A new process of enrolling is strongly needed including the training!"
good,This part time position should be a full time job for the hours you put in for a couple times a month. I was never given any job awards for being there 11 seasons and i didnt intend to stay after the Super Bowl win. Another job that is supposed to be fun but you dont make the money you should for all the gruntwork depending on the department you work for.
good,"Lincoln Financial Group started out to be a comfortable workplace however, the constant changes of your job title and the increase of job responsibilities without the increase in pay became too much.  Management was not honest in their intentions which caused high levels of insecurity."
good,"The culture at Lincoln was almost non-existent with no training, no team building and no focused energy in turning that culture around.  You were simply there to do a task and punch out."
good,"Management did not encourage or support work life balance.  Employees frequently experience burnout.  When challenged, the only response was go look for another job."
good,"Poor management & upper leadership, production atmosphere are morale downers if not supervised/encouraged by solid leadership."
good,"This company has a very relaxed work environment.  Though my time there was short, I had fun while I was there."
good,"Lincoln used to be a wonderful company to work for, this is not the case now. The worst people are promoted, most of the time they neither have management experience or a degree. Most employees who are promoted to management are mediocre at best at their current jobs. Once they are promoted they get rid of those who are excellent performers so that they don't look so bad. It's a rare that you would get far here from working hard. They could care less if you are a parent and want to spend time with your family. It's always work first and everything else whenever. They have also purchased a new computer system for the retirement division that is $33 million and it's a complete disaster. It's very sad to see a great company fail so epically!"
good,I was asked to do things that were outside captured metrics then penalized for not meeting the metric performance numbers.  I asked for training and educational opportunities and was denied.
good,Each case manager has an average of 140 cases. It's impossible to complete the work assigned during an 8 hour day. Expect to spend all of your days at your desk answering calls and emails.
good,"I was in the call center, the customers can be very abusive with no one to back you up, there is lots of office politics you have to be very careful you don't upset any one or they just might fire you on the spot."
good,"Liked the company, hated the managers.  Every time you outperform, all you've done is raised the bar to become the new floor, and if you have a down quarter, they're on your case asking you why you can't perform miracles all day"
good,"The work was very simple, basic administrative work and data entry, minimal phone calls in the indexing department. One huge problem is the people, they speak on diversity and inclusion but some managers will never speak to you face to face, only through instant messaging functions and emails even though they sit right next to you. I've been bumped into walking off of elevators due to people not allowing you to get off before they enter the elevator. The cafeteria food is ok some days, but the fruit smells and taste like lunch meat. Meetings can be very unorganized, some are random in the middle of the day, some are cancelled five minutes before they Management makes promises about opportunities for advancement and setting you up to shadow and train with other but they never commit to those promises. Team dynamics change constantly and without prior notice. Positions were never refilled once employees left the company/went to other departments. The New Business department is falling apartment and the CEO should be concerned."
good,Lincoln can be a great place to work if you get into the preferred areas. Many managers have never done the work of their employees so it can make for very frustrating situations. I love my team mates and they have become like family to me.
good,"Bad sales managers.....very ""used car sales"". Mangers are matrix drive and very controlling. "
good,Handling claims for short term disability employees of various large companies. Fast pace environment. Stressful at times having to complete / meet deadlines on time. Writing numerous letters. Approvals / denials. Claim information sent for medical review by a licensed medical practitioner.
good,Cooked various foods stock vendors very independent job. Job call for changing work load at will. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,my position is simple. Basically greeting customers as they come to park.  I take the money and give them a receipt.  My co-workers are nice and we work well together.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new faces and small talk as i worked.
good,"Was there for 3 yrs, people were friendly, management was clicky and demeaning at times. Did not feel appreciated and quit. Nothing more to say regarding my tenure here."
good,"Part of acquisition, we were originally told there would be no office closures only to be advised of a location closure plan shortly after. Management constantly working to play catch up as directives announced with no clear action plan in place."
good,Lincoln Financial has room to improve with it's compensation and advancement opportunities. This is a good place to break into the industry but lacks value for it's employees.
good,"A typical day at work at the Lincoln Financial Field was a cold day filled with employers handling food, money, and other materials to loads of customers. I learned that working in concessions stand takes a lot of patience especially dealing with difficult customers and co-workers. The management and co-workers were not exactly the most professional often bringing little to no energy to the workplace and letting egos stop them from getting the job done. The hardest part about this job was when the games would go into halftime, loads of drunk customers would get in line for more merchandise. The most enjoyable part would be interacting with those same customers and making them laugh while they wait to be served."
good,"if you are in any thing but sells, you will work a lot of hours. No very patient."
good,"Change is inevitable and with the passing of time comes a great deal of this."
good,This company has potential however they should of stayed under liberty mutual the system is outdated and the resources to assist customers and employees to make the job seamless is not helpful. Compensation is not enough for the amount of claims that is being done along with phone calls.
good,"No guilt about forcing employees to take on unreasonable workloads and hours to avoid having to pay more in wages, while at the same time openly telling them they're going to be laid off in a couple years."
good,"The company is rife with nepotism, so you would have to get very lucky to advance anywhere, skills be damned. There are many good people working there, but just as many who have no idea what they are doing, especially management, who try to shuffle responsibility anywhere but on themselves."
good,"Unorganized, poor structure, no training or stylized manual in place, IT department is lazy. A lot of socialization instead of working. Construction all over the place. No Cafeteria."
good,"Lincoln has a culture where you will either thrive and attach to a click, or you will sink as an outsider. that being said, their culture of diversity is one of the more accepting i've seen in an organization."
good,Worked in Production Support. Involved in two major system conversions from main frame to web based then back to main frame.  Company main focus is on providing to their external consumer.
good,"no respect of life situations that come up. called during PTO/study time. Thank you and I apologize goes a long way but when generosity isn't used you feel unappreciated. Training is needed. When asking questions was told you should know this, expectations are too high."
good,"The average work week for a front line supervisor is 60 hours per week. An average processor is typically required to work a minimum number of overtime hours per week.  Inventory levels, added work, and minimal staff make it difficult, if not impossible, to adhere to standard service level agreements."
good,"Assisting external wholesalers (agents) with expense related business, compliance issues and auditing expenses."
good,"Lincoln is a good way to start your career.  They offer a competitive salary and tuition reimbursement.  Do not plan on a career here, they lack career development tools and like to keep talented people in their current roles when they are performing well."
good,Great employee organization and organization values community involvement and volunteerism.  Challenge as the larger organization adapts to change in insurance industry and new technologies.
good,"Event Staffers have to constantly be aware of changing schedules, long time on your feet and many different work environments.  Sometimes it can be physically demanding but a majority of the time you are busy and rarely bored unless there is a slow event going on.Good look for your resume in terms of team related skills and adapting to change. It is still a great place to work for side money and fun to meet new people"
good,The management from the day I started was disorganized all the way up to the most notable project managers and department heads. The work itself was interesting but the company was more concerned with their bottom line than providing the best stewardship to their customers. Unrealistic expectations were made and in order to meet my goals I would have to work through lunch and barely take any break.
good,This was one that I enjoyed the least. Management used favoritism quite frequently and there was not room for growth.
good,"I had a full day as long as there was work available. Training was pretty good. I learned how to process life insurance applications all the way up to the actual underwriting process (done by the underwriters). Management is not very good. They have their favorites and listen too much to gossip instead of what actually goes on with the employees.  No job security for some, but others get away with murder and still keep their jobs (they play on the internet, steal others work, or do hardly any work at all). Hardest part was dealing with the spoiled agents and listening to their complaining. But they are the bread and butter. The benefits and the holiday events were good. The most enjoyable part of the job was working there when it was still Jefferson Pilot. "
good,"Poor communication from upper management, poor employee engagement. Hard to find sense of motivation at this company. There are flexible work arrangements and opportunities to move laterally in company."
good,My employment was temporary due to the branch owner changing his mind about staffing in his new branch. He preferred someone with additional computer tech skills.
good,Limited work life balance and a stressful office environment.Management tries hard to understand the needs of the employees but is unable to make the changes that are needed to make the work load manageable.
good,"no documentation on processes exist. "
good,"Lincoln Financial was ok to work at, but hard to advance internally. Company promoted health but you don't have much available to get up and stretch your legs"
good,"Lincoln is a wonderful company to work for. There are so many opportunities to get involved with the culture. Benefits are great, and PTO is generous. Management stresses work life balance which is refreshing."
good,I have nothing good or bad to say.  It was just a job. The office was just an office.  People were just there to do work and go home.  Was very difficult to build relationships
good,"The benefits are good, at or above industry standards.  Different offices or locations can have different cultures resulting in a range of experiences depending on where the job is located.  There can be inconsistencies in work life and how the ""rules"" are applied for example work remote opportunites and flexible work arrangements are not consistent across locations, departments and even different managers within a department.  Some managers are great to work for while others may have attained management positions by default and have no clue."
good,Very poor work/life balance. The company struggles to maitain a full work force which leads to bloated caseloads. Employee's are expected to work overtime to make up for the increased caseload.
good,Good place to work. Co-workers great interaction. Enjoyed aspects of the job.  Required travel was no issue. Management for most part followed the lead of their director.
good,"I worked at Lincoln briefly, and for the most part it reminded me of a  sorority, Lincoln is all about who you know, I don't think anyone really did any work, too busy going to meetings, and walking back and forth to the bathroom every 30 minutes or so, you never really saw or heard from management, Managers show favoritism, and they do not hire from within unless you're a management favorite, they only wanted to be bothered when they wanted to meet with you. lack of growth and stability. The pay not up to industry standards. The people were friendly but I would not work at Lincoln again because of the favoritism, and the sorority atmosphere."
good,"The branch dealt with is disability claims. This is just like any other job. Some ups and some downs. Moving to new location in Atlanta, GA in April 2016 and this of course brings everyone closer together"
good,Fun and engaging place to work.  Co-workers are enjoyable to be around.  Pay is not the best in the industry.  Job security seems reasonable but no room for advancement.
good,"Greeting everyone in the department.  Prioritizing the start of the day from tasks at hand but being flexible as things come up.  "
good,Lincoln Financial is a great place to work if you want a career in financial /insurance services. There is ample room for growth and advancement.
good,Ok place to work if you want to be in the insurance/retirement business
good,Typical day is very stressful. Constantly outside of team goals due to staffing situation. Seems to be lack of urgency in hiring more staff and has existing staff working continuous overtime for the last 2 plus years. Co-workers are great.
good,"A typical day was reading what queue we were assigned to for the day and processing enrollments, termination of coverage requests, COBRA requests, etc... all while hitting production guidelines."
good,"A typical day at work starts off checking emails from clients/and or managment correspondence. Review accuracy of processed work from the day before and mail out correspondence. Then you would begin ""Hitting get work"" on the AWD production program. The work would include, changing life insurance ownerships, beneficiaries, reviewing power of attorney paperwork and adding assignments to the clients policy. I've learned a lot about life insurance and how polcies are created and maintained. You gain knowledge of all the legalities and procedures regarding life insurance. When I first started our department was stress free, but now the procedures have changed, the workload is more, with less time to meet production. This year has been the worse, since they added mandatory overtime. I usually don't mind overtime, but I have a little girl and the overtime was 10 hours a week, which put me at 50 or more hours a week. Not only that, but they added a HR procedure to help the managers have a guideline when it came to associates being out for any reason. You have to let them know 24 hours in advance if your going to be out of work , including if your sick, your childs sick or you have an emergency. If you have 6 or more days ""Unexcused"" absense, you are written up and on the 9th time you can be fired. This ""occurence"" they call it, will not come off until the next year. They have no regard for mother's with young children. They talk about life/work balance, which is only for the exempt workers, which do not have to go by this particular rule. This job is great for someone ""without"" young"
good,"This job has given me a strong basis for moving forward within a career. I have learned not only the technical aspects of the job, but I have learned how to be a much more effective communicator and build strong internal and external relationships."
good,"Management is all over the place, there is no consistency, expectations are unrealistic and the pay comes every other friday without fail."
good,"Lincoln Financial Advisors was a good place to work at. It's a place that someone can work at for years and be totally fine with wages and help clients with their retirement account and actually help them plan for the future. Some of the managers have great interpersonal skills and genuinely good hard workers, unfortunately it does not extent to all management and it affects the work culture and implementing new ideas, concepts and technologies.  The hardest part of the job for me, was not meeting my potential, it was just not an environment where I could thrive, adding the commute time to it also complicated matters. The most enjoyable is the people, they have good people working there and the company was fair, especially with benefits."
good,"in my years at Lincoln Financial I learned a lot, I was in claims management and supervised 12 benefit specialist's. Work was stressful and felt there was no autonomy to do your job."
good,"LFG is great at what they do.  Many interesting, smart and funny people.  If you want a challenging workplace, this would be it."
good,"Training takes about a year, and is all over telphone. They have great pay and benefits, but if you can't get to work because of snow or a sick child, management will not understand."
good,"Employer makes certain the bills get paid. Promotions are based on who you know and not what you know; if you aren't who they want for a listed job, the description will change."
good,Good organization with good management. Company culture is a bit blurred as there is a mix of different personalities and attitudes. Compensation is mediocre however they do offer good benefits
good,working with clients to provide group health insurance. nice campus. on site gym available for small fee. human resources needs improving. fair compensation. believes and supports diversity.
good,"Lincoln can be a great place to work for those employees who have moved solidly into management. For the typical office worker, and especially for employees working through an employment agency, chances for advancement or to be brought on as a permanent employee are almost nil. Respect for your efforts is minimal."
good,good company but compensation in India is low and therefore they work with the vendors where the work is more and salaries are low which is a cause of worry per the market standards
good,Lincoln Financial seems like a good company to work for but I'm just burnt out and need a change badly. Not very happy with management in my department at all. We deal with very high stress levels in our line of work and the workload/stress do not match up with the compensation at all.
good,"People I work with are great.  Good, strong company.  Only negative is there's not much room for career advancement for those of us out in the field.  Most opportunities are located in home office cities: Fort Wayne, IN or Philadelphia, PA."
good,"My typical work hours are 8-5 Monday through Friday, although I am typically at work 1/2 hour early each day. My position requires 24/7 availability. All designations have been through my employer. My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of my job is witnessing favoritism- we are all on the same team working toward the same end. Additionally, the commute adds 2 hours to my workday.My most enjoyable part of my job is the strong connections I've made within my organization."
good,"This is not leading edge technology, however was a great place to work socially. Being downtown didn't hurt either."
good,Expect to work long hours and be very flexible. Problems that need to be taken care of arise all the time due to the fast paced nature along with the company trying to accomplish more with fewer resources.
good,Lincoln is an enjoyable workplace. Most of my coworkers were easy to get along with and real team players.
good,Great mentoring program for interns. Allows advisors to build client base for estate planning and provides various other benefits. Good team of employees who are helpful in training.
good,Title says it all. There are people there that are awesome but a lot of them refuse to move as far up as management due to the corrupt managers already in the roles.
good,"During my time at LFG, I was under several different styles of management. I was taught the value of safety in the workplace and was educated from previous management how to remove hazardous materials properly. However during the end of my time at LFG, the change of style in the management did not focus on the proper ways to remove hazardous materials and that cause conflict with my beliefs."
good,This place was a good call center environment with alot of opportunity with upcoming departments. Claims department is overworked and under paid. Overall decent company.
good,The job was really easy to do. The only thing that was frustrating was having to cut off the drunk people and them not reacting too well and having to wait for the employee bus to come in certain weathers.
good,"this was a short stay with Lincoln Financial, in my short internship I was drawn to the office lifestyle but seen it was not for me. all around nice place to be but slow paced and not for someone looking for an active life."
good,"I worked here about 10 years ago.  Things have probably changed a lot since then, or at least I hope so.  A review from me would likely no be accurate of how the company currently is."
good,"Lincoln Financial Group provides advice and solutions that empower people to take charge of their financial lives with confidence and optimism."
good,"Was a good place to work at, not much room to grow. Consistent overtime, and mostly pretty poor management. Not many job openings available with the exception of upper management."
good,"Very Busy. Management is nice. Promoting form within could use work. Depending on the position and the office, could work out well. I enjoy it for the most part."
good,"Good company to work for as a parent... The company focuses of developing products that are well suited for the average american, and at an affordable price"
good,"Unfortunately, I was working in Chattanooga with no management, training, or supervision in place.  The main office was in Nashville, but the travel and time commitment were not reasonable."
good,When Lincoln Financial Group uses temp it has a few issues in communication between the management and the temps. Over all the skills you learn are useful and you do have the chance to apply for jobs with the Company as a temp.
good,"Supportive management, and entertaining in innovative training regarding insurance in general.  It is your typical cubical office settiing, but the view from this building is nice.  Quiet and relaxed atmosphere."
good,"As with most companies there days, the IT environment is changing.  Change can be stressful and right now, that is what the environment is like.   IT jobs were eliminated; business support decreased; management support lacking."
good,Excellent intellectual capital surrounds this company with many opportunities to learn and advance.  Great for those seeking clientele beyond the average crowd.
good,"my day consisted mostly of filling files in alphabetical order and putting data in the customers files, it was a pretty easy job since i was doing this when i was in highschool"
good,"The company as a whole is a good stable company to work for. The call center almost seems like a different company all together. You are chained to your desk by phone calls and the call numbers are usually so high that you cant take part in any of the company funded get together with the rest of the company. Unless you want to sacrifice your 15 min or 30 min lunch.  The support on the floor is scarce , and you find more support in your fellow peers then the managers and team leads."
good,"Normal day to day fast pace group protection environment. LFG is a pretty average employer. I am looking for more of a challenge in my next role. The environment has gotten a bit ""stuffy"" over the last 5 years. LFG use to be more open with great morale throughout the local offices."
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with during my time with the organization.  The Concord office was in a nice location that made walking outside during lunch breaks a regular occurrence.
good,"Not much worklife balance, but the benefit of the 401(k) was outstanding.  Management tried, but there was confusion on direction to go.  Changing process to try something new and then went back to old process."
good,Good place to work. good benefits free lunches massage parlor breastfeeding room full gym. secured buildings and room to grow. good discounts and helpful assistive
good,"Worked in an inbound call center with large call volumes throughout the day • Skilled to work with double monitors • Trained to multitask using over several systems (emails, Microsoft Word, Excel and other "
good,Great organization for the right person.  Cultural fit is crucial to success.  Fast paced day to day in a constantly changing environment.  Very diverse and accepting culture.
good,"Overall, benefits are good.  The company is slowly adjusting to be more flexible with remote working to compete with the rest of the industry but this is a slow change and flexibility can depends on your department and comfort level of your manager."
good,"ok environment...culture is ok...overall this is a large company with a narrow vision and is not involved with the community or Philadelphia region, where it is headquartered"
good,"Great if you have an established book of business and have commissions in excess of $100,000. Not for those who are just starting their career in financial services. However, if you meet these criteria and are earning over 100K, this is a good upgrade in terms of back office support to take your practice to the next level."
good,"offers great benefits, including the 401k plan and health coverage. Opportunity to advance in the company, offers ongoing training and certification courses."
good,"The work is exciting and challenging."
good,Very professional and makes sure that each employee is up to date on the continuing education processes to ensure proper protocol.
good,"The team I worked with at Lincoln was great. Everyone was friendly, personable, team-oriented, and motivated to provide quality services; however, the workload itself was exceptionally dull. A typical work day consisted of hundreds of searches. It could get extremely repetitive and boring very quickly, and productivity was monitored. It was also a temporary position, so there was no telling how long the team would stay together and no guarantee of full-time hire. The real reward in coming to work every day for Cross Search was knowing I was coming onto a closely knit team that fully supported each other."
good,I worked for Lincoln Financial as a temporary worker.  I was contracted through e-Team.  The position lasted two months.  Overall the environment was positive.
good,The job it's self is easy. I like to be a helping hand to fans who come into the stadium and the staff/ co-works I work with. I would just like to get paid more.
good,I worked there for 5 years and advanced twice in my career path. I received great performance review scores and was well liked by my direct reports as well as management.
good,Research supporting documentation for insurance policies and death claim payouts; multiple projects co-workers are nice/ easy to get along with
good,"A call center that is very relaxed with a friendly environment. Iv'e learned more information about retirement planning. Overall, this is a good place to work."
good,Good company to work for within my short time working for them due to the budget cuts the radio station I was working for is not around anymore. I am not sure what happen but they have alot of other great stations to listen too.
good,The company really supports a work life balance culture and the benefits are good but the leadership changes every couple of years meaning the organization reorgs a lot!
good,"Difficult for people of color to move up within the company. It’s an effort to keep people of color in certain positions, though they are qualified but often past over."
good,You have to find the right area to be successful and happy. Everyone seems to tell on everyone to make themselves look good. Rather annoying
good,when i worked at the lincoln field it was fun and it was light work that needed to be done that wasn't so bad. the people i worked with were very nice and we all were hard workers
good,Attention to detail; analytical and excellent relationship builder
good,A typical date at work was reviewing same documents and processing charges. It was quiet and rarely any interaction with other coworkers. I liked the job because I could work with numbers which I love. The hardest part was trying to stay interested because it wasn't very challenging.
good,Good company however they have been throug severl iterations of staff reductions 
good,Very sound company to work for.  Little opportunity for growth.
good,one of the best set of benefits a company offers to date
good,I learned a ton in my time at Lincoln about life and about communicating with people.
good,"This has been the most enjoyable company and group of people that I have worked with. A typical day at work can be very stressful, but rewarding because you have solved an issue and have helped a client, customer and/or co-worker. Management is good, and fair. I have developed a lot of healthy relationships there. My only issue is that my salary is not on par with industry/market standards."
good,"Small independent groups within the larger umbrella of Lincoln. Working for big company in name only, more like working for small family businesses."
good,Good to work but sometimes difficult to work by balancing work life as well as the personal life. But good organization for lateral entries for experienced people.
good,"Very intense, I've learned a lot from the design production. I was limited in creativity yet I enjoyed the challenges of the branding. The experience is something that will stay with me through out my career."
good,"The job was boring, dull, and unimportant. You do the same thing every single day which can be nice but boring. You never really need to talk to anyone during the day which makes it stress-free but lonely and isolating. There really is no forward movement here. It's okay for a temporary job but I want out more than anything else."
good,Fast-paced. Lots of phone and email correspondence. Document review. Plan implementation. Training of clients and financial advisors. Company culture is great. Most enjoyable part of my job is sales support.
good,"overall it was  a good experience because I had such delightful co workers and developed wonderful work relationships. Management was for the most part very friendly and easy to work with. It would be appreciated if they would develop more flexible work arrangements and work life balance more such as letting local people work from home with same qualifications and frequency as remote workers being recruited from outside the company,"
good,The company is exactly what you would expect for a Financial Company.  It does not have the greatest work life balance.  The managers are great as well as the benefits.
good,Lincoln gives lots of attention to Employee Engagement every 18 months and then ignores it until it's time for the Survey.  Maybe this was just my division.
good,Worked in all facets of suitability review and monitoring of trades to protect clients assets and the firm from risk. Escalated issues to upper management as needed.
good,"I provided tech support over the phone to Lincolns Insurance salesman.  It was pretty quick paced, I had to manage an inbox, and incoming calls.  Time went by fast, but some of the insurance salesman were rude"
good,"It's hard to rate Lincoln Financial across the board, because it varies so much from business to business, location to location. The Fort Wayne and Omaha offices are some of the best employers around. The Radnor office (headquarters) is losing people because of the culture and competitive nature of the employees."
good,"I don't have a lot to say about this place. I had a wonderful supervisor, but it was hard trying to post for certain jobs.  It depended on the ""clique"" you were in."
good,typically a day at work is answering calls and not taking any breaks unless it's absolutely necessary. getting the call volume down and giving surveys is the most important aspect as long as first resolution is obtained.
good,"There are many perks with this company.  The perks include decent training, plenty of work, good co-workers and good benefits.  However, work/life balance can be an issue and for me, the commute was long."
good,The company is a hit or miss regarding promotions. HR focuses too much on employees advancement but the maangers follow state rules and other rules not to.
good,Overall Lincoln is a good company to work for. They have great benefits. Enjoyed the people I worked with in the call center. On the other hand some of the managers could use some more interpersonal skills training. In other words learn how to communicate properly with your staff.
good,Excellent benefits package. Call Center environment is undesirable.
good,"Plush offices and working conditions. Many have been employed for long periods of time, often moving up within the company."
good,Good job to get your feet in the door. Great co workers and the learning scale is endless.
good,Great Benefits and unbelievable 401K matching program.
good,Lincoln Financial is a good place to work. But hard to move out of your current position. There are a lot of people applying for the same job. Ive applied to many jobs but have never been chosen for an interview
good,good place. bad position in the call center. good benefits money wasn't bad but just not a position that i could do well. Liked the managers and the people i worked with.
good,"Pay is mediocre, starts off great then impossible to advance. Management is so high school and clicky, but if you're a favorite, you're in, if not, good luck."
good,"Very busy, not a lot of time to develop new workers when training was complete.  Management seemed more concerned about sticking to the book, very little interpersonal contact."
good,You are exposed to so many different aspects of the insurance industry and also learn so much about the financial aspect of insurance like taxes.  Management is encouraging and helpful but the work can be overwhelming at times due to the number of claims that you are responsible for.  Making sure that you are organized and not allowing yourself to get overwhelmed with a variety of tasks is key to success here.
good,"Each day at Lincoln Financial Group is most times a day of great satisfaction.I enjoy being able to assist each customer, whether  they are policy holders,insurance agents, or belonging to another category not listed here. Each day presents new challenges and opportunity to enhance my knowledge of the company as well as the products and services that we provide."
good,"I enjoyed my position at Lincoln for the short two years that I worked there as a Retirement Consultant. Great benefits but pay is based primarily on the location i.e. hospital, school, businesses you are assigned to. Pay can range from 45k-150k depending on your plan sponsors."
good,"Definitely a place to start to move to the next level. I have learned a lot about insurance, different cultures, and awesome teammates who are very helpful."
good,Lincoln is great for work/life balance and relaxed environment.  Limited opportunity in the Hartford office.
good,I feel Lincoln employees are slightly under paid and under compensated for the stress they endure and their time spent at the job and away from their families.
good,"Their work/life balance is really unparalled, but unless you are a PDP or LLP member, the likelihood of advancement is slim."
good,"The culture at Lincoln Financial is ""family"". It really does begin to be a who you know as you grow; however, there is always work that will challenge you throughout your growth."
good,My job was to support the customer support personnel and I was not allowed to do my job. Great job otherwise. Hoping that they are providing support to their employees.
good,A typical day at Lincoln was come in and prepare for my day. Sort and open mail distribute to the approiate areas. Sign for all Fed Ex and UPS packages coming into the building and deliver to the correct employees. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when they were going to outsource our jobs till the day they laid us off...
good,"- Review list of referrals"
good,Good company just not the right fit for me. I work better with the public not over phones and over email.  Managers were great to work for very caring
good,"Lincoln Financial Group is a great place to start a career.  Depending on the department on the area you work in determines your work load and your amount of flexibility.  With a variety of Customer Service and Processing positions, anyone can find something that suits them.  It's a very fast paced environment and there are excellent opportunities for growth within the company.  The hardest part of the job communicating effectively with other groups within the company.  Each area has their own policies and procedures and turn around times that they have to work with.  This can make things a little difficult at times, but in the end everything comes together to provide the customers with the desired results."
good,"I'm working in Lincoln Financial from past 7 month and I feel this place were you can upgrade your self."
good,"Lincoln's culture re career stability/advancement, culture and work/life balance vary wildly, depending solely on the leading manager of each department. However, the benefits are very good: Health care with HSA option, dental, vision, life insurance, excellent matching of 401k, tuition reimbursement (requires manager approval however, which is sometimes difficult to get), charitable matching, annual bonus, and community volunteer events. I've been in departments that had poor morale and departments where everyone worked together and was excited to show up in the morning. Thus the 3 star overall review."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are interested in pursuing a sales or customer service career.  The training and support for those looking to further their education and advance their career is unbeatable. I've never worked for another company with better benefits, though, I believe salary is slightly below average."
good,Work place is very friendly.It is very challenging.Learnt many new things and accepted many challenges.Getting new tasks daily is really good which helps to sharpen our brain.
good,Lincoln has good benefits and the management team works with you to obtain goals.
good,"From a contractor's perspective, the corporate cultrue is great."
good,"I was very excited when I was first hired thinking this would be a great job. But, I was sadly mistaken and broke at the end of the day. The managers act like they care about you but they don't at all. They show favoritism and that becomes annoying very quickly."
good,"On a regular day things would start off with me scanning and or searching everyone who enters the event for any contraband or things we consider prohibited. Then from there once most people has been searched and are inside we usually just circle the event for any outrageous commotion or confrontation and to solve the problem or descalate it. After the event is over we get everyone to exit the building in a safely manner, escort people down the right roads and clear up any equipment we may have left outside. Finally once magarity of the people are gone this is what we call a good days work and home we go!!"
good,It is fairly competitive but staff is rewarded for good efforts. It is a great temp job but I would not want to do that job indefinitely. I did not really feel like I fit in.
good,"The company pay only comisión, "
good,The culture is set in its ways and has difficulties changing when needed.  A few higher level employees are utilized for most important decisions and often times are incorrect or biased toward other employees  involved in decision-making.
good,Lots of work very little recognition. If you like being pulled in a hundred different directions all at once then this is for you.
good,"Good company, good benefits. Just be sure that you have clear expectations with your manager as to schedule, occurrences, etc."
good,"Lincoln Financial Group is a good company to work for as long as you don't have any family problems because they don't work with you taking time off to care for sick family members.  They ""counsel"" , write up & terminate employees for having a long term illness or taking time to care for their sick children."
good,"LFG has terrific people working for it, and are always willing to help out. I enjoyed my time as a consultant there and would go back again in a heartbeat."
good,"working at Lincoln financial field was good but the it was a first come first serve opportunity. as a kid, it was a cool job but the job was a once in a while opportunity."
good,"My role was a little bit different because I worked for Aramark. The "
good,Lincoln was very good to me in the 25 years that I worked there. The balance of work & home life decreases as you climb up the ladder to the point that there isn't a home life.
good,There is a great team in Place at Lincoln Financial Field and the Eagles are a great client to work with. They treat you as if you work with the Philadelphia Eagles.
good,"Lincoln Financial is one of the industry leading insurance providers in the US.  "
good,Lincoln is a good old company. Unfortunately they have no moved ahead from a maturity standpoint. Old antiquated business processes. They did not do CBA's and business cases which are an industry standard.
good,Organized and goid training opportunities. Managers are handling just the right number of employees for their jobs. Benefits and salary are competitve in the market.
good,"The 5 years at Lincoln taught me so much about being part of a team environment. I adored my Boss and my co-worker. I would still be there if circumstances were different. "
good,"very nice co-workers and a support system. Very generous benefits but hard to move vertically."
good,"Lincoln Financial Group is well known not only for it's brand, financial stability and the products offered to ensure consumer financial future.  However, the management system is lacking and promotions are given without merit causing teamwork breakdown and lack of proper advancement.  Lincoln claims to have  pay for performance work bonus system but that has yet to be truly observed in my tenure with the firm.  Co-workers generally exude excellent teamwork but have challenges dealing with inept management.  the hardest part of the job is suppression of workplace efficiency ideas from staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be teamwork and diversity as well as decent salary and benefits."
good,"please don't work here.  there are better jobs.  tied down to a desk, phone and computer.  no work atmosphere"
good,Working for same project for three years and it was a good experience. All the teams are supportive and had many initiatives. This project moved to production.
good,Lincoln offers a learning environment to move forward within your career and open to new business and opportunity to improve job functions. There employees matters and opinions
good,This was my first job out of college. It was a good job. My division was eventually sold off when the market crashed in 2008. I enjoyed working for LFG.
good,Great structured company. Average pay without bonuses.  Enjoyed assisting customers with information regarding new and established retirement accounts.
good,"Good company to work for. Great co-workers and work environment."
good,Great Benefits and Retirement. Pay could be more competitive. Employees feel under appreciated by management at times. PTO is an excellent benefit. Paid Holidays
good,"The company focuses more on its public eye rather than keeping up with current Technology and keeping its employees happy. The Company is very good at providing resources to refer you to other places. It has many local activities that keep you away from doing your specified job which typically is not always best when you are behind. The people that work there are some of the most amazing and friendly people that you will meet. The management has its ups and downs like most places, but the turnover for the majority is high so its hard to move to a different area if you stuck."
good,"Basically getting paid less to do more. Told different info during training sessions. It is a good company to work for, I just do not agree with how Customer Care Rep's are treated."
good,Was able to learn new things and maintained a good work atmosphere. The company was able to provide good work-life balance. The team was so well ordered that it was easy to work.
good,they have one of the better contracts disbaility contracts in the industry. Their service suffers because they are trying to grow too big too fast but their goals remain very high
good,Pleasant environment I really like my position and the the research I had to do in order to process each case. Would highly recommend being a claims processor.
good,Great place to work. Good people hear and the energy is always good. One thing is the building tends to stay cold but that is ok being that I wear a jacket all day
good,"Great people, the internship program was a good one in terms of there were a lot of learning opportunities as well as social and networking ones. I would suggest this internship."
good,"Lincoln Financial is a great place to work. It is a very structured environment with activity requirements to reach each day. I have been in these surroundings for the past 3+ years and know how important the structure has been in my life, both professionally and personally. At this point in time, I am looking to move to San Francisco and take on a more challenging sales role."
good,"Benefits are good, and there seems to be a good work life balance.  However, I just happen to have a great manager, and that is what it comes down to regardless of where you work."
good,Work hour flexibility was a must.  Mandatory overtime was required and made planning outside work life a bit challenging.
good,"prepped, scanned and indexed insurance claims on a daily basis. i was part of the implementation of scanning the paper document into the electronic sysrtem"
good,"Work is rewarding, I like helping people. It feels good going home at night knowing you've helped someone who is going through a difficult time and may not have long to live."
good,"Great internship, lots of fun, learned a lot about advising and how to procure clients and keep current clients. Learned that you need to look after the tiniest of details in order to be extremely successful."
good,"My day is filled with processing insurance policies, answering calls and responding to email correspondence. "
good,Work is hectic - Lots of phone and client interaction.  Cutting edge financial company with Fortune 500 competitors. Management is not micro management - lots of upward mobility.  The hardest part of the job is starting with the company.
good,"Claims Processing"
good,I work with individuals having problems logging in to their online account with Lincoln Financial Group.
good,"Great place to work. Very challenging and fast-paced with lots of opportunities to learn on a daily basis. Great environment, very team-oriented."
good,Opportunity to deliver a wide array of products.   Nice people. Continues to improve its technology.

good,"I really enjoyed my time at Lincoln."
good,"Getting Merchandise set up for the games."
good,"Lincoln National Corporation is a Fortune 250 American holding company, which operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Lincoln provided challenging work and good pay."
good,Nice campus.  Great coworkers.  Very fast paced environment.
good,I have been working here for past two years. This company treat its employee as a family member.
good,Great opportunities to sharpen job skills and structure.  The people are great to work with and it provides great learning atmosphere.
good,Typical Office Environment.Provided marketing resources to help gain new clients and retain current ones while maintaining brand and planner personalization for the future and giving more clients choices & opportunities.
good,"processing 401k distributions, direct deposits, and insurance premiums"
good,- many tools that help you advance
good,Great working environment. The employees are great and you can make a great connections with people within the company
good,"Worked with corporate expenses, reinsurance, broker dealer, sales plans, forecasts and budgets."
good,Lincoln is a great place to work. They provide excellent benefits and 401K program.
good,It was a great place to work and there was a great deal of innovative thought in the company. Great Training for new and seasoned agents. I was being groomed for a staff position that didn't materialize prior to their running out of funds. I was offered an agent position which I declined to accept due to personal circumstances.
good,"The flexibility to work from home a majority of the time. Constantly learning new things. Great company to have a career with, the benefits are very competitive. Hardest part of the job is the varying customer specifics you need to learn. Need to be able to adapt to contract / process changes quickly."
good,"I worked for Lincoln for 19 years, unfortunately I was job eliminated due to re-engineering.  I gained a lot of experience in multiple areas. It is a good company to work for."
good,"The Omaha site is not bad, has all the ""normal"" amenities you might expect at a large business. (Cafe, gym etc.) "
good,Very fast paced and sometimes stressful.  Work load is data determined.  Dress is casual.  excellent employer match to 401K and excellent health insurance benefits
good,"I would show up for my day and go straight to the promotions cubicle to see the break down of my day. If it was just a sign-spinning day or if I was working a concert. From there, I would gather all necessary items; speakers, t-shirts, chairs, inflatables, oversized signs. I would then load up one of the company vehicles and make my way to the destination. Sometimes I would be alone, sometimes with one or two others and other times it was a festival with 20+ of us working. Those were the most fun. I always got along with the management of the station."
good,"After leaving Lincoln, my immediate supervisor was let go which may have cleared up the issues that I have with the company. I was not given to proper tools to advance within the company that likes the promote from within. Other than that, Lincoln was one of the best companies that I've ever worked for. The people were happy and the benefits were amazing."
good,"High volume of claims and complex claims with many parts. The job is not for everyone, and managers admit this. Management was good, actually trained in managing people, lots of coaching instead of yelling. Many calls to be made, many details. They deal with injured or sick people who are disabled. Many different contract provisions. Many STD (Short Term Disability) contracts don't pay much. So you have stressed out sick people who you have to tell might only be getting $100 per week when they are not working. You have to investigate whether it was a pre-existing. Did they seek proper medical care and do the notes from the doctor support the disability. Did the doctor send in his/her paperwork. The paperwork! Tons of it. When you take a new job ask about the disability benefits. The best part of the job was giving people money. The worst part was telling people you could not give them money and having to write long letters explaining the denial."
good,"I worked at this job for over three years. Actually, they were purchased by Lincoln near the end of my time there so I can't really say I worked for Lincoln but more for the other company. It was casual and most of the people in the office came from the MidWest. At the end, though, they had some efficiency 'experts' come in and have us make spreadsheets on how we spent every minute of every day and they found out they didn't like how much time we spent on the phone with the underwriters, who were a major part of our job! It was so much noise so they could justify not paying us any more - or any over time. I walked."
good,"The culture at Lincoln is so diverse.  There are many social events that go on here that you are encouraged to participate. However, don't stay away from your desk for more than 15 minutes."
good,Lincoln days vary depending on department and management.  The typical day is 8-5 with a lunch break and 2 breaks.  Beautiful campus with great walking trails and a gym.
good,"The job was great up until the last 3 years. Got a new manager that knew little to nothing about the department. Was not helpful at all."
good,"The company has been going through a lot of changes in the last several years.  It makes it hard to do your job effectively when there are changes, sometimes on a daily basis, and consistency is an issue also."
good,"Demanding competitive work culture with a high turnover on senior leadership positions. Has an excellent president with a clear strategic vision, but the technology is lagging behind her vision."
good,"Fast paced work place in which one is required to market everyday in order to acquire new clients and to service current clients."
good,"Great place to work, only thing is they could've had a better break area.  Nice staff, great managers.  other department was willing to help you if needed and vice versa."
good,"great place to work and to grow. I would love to still be working there but had to relocate,  I would recommend them to anyone who loves a challenge and want to grow."
good,Lincoln Financial Group cares about it's employees and involves them in business activities.  They promote their employees to strive to do better.  Its a good company.
good,"Lincoln has many nice people and benefits. "
good,I have learned a lot about saving money and how to save money and where to invest it. My co - workers have been a wonderful group of people. I  have enjoyed being a part of Lincoln Financial Advisors.
good,"The benefits and pay is great;  though a call center environment is not for everyone. You must be willing to sit for 8 hours a day taking calls.  The time in between calls is a minimum of seven seconds unless you go into a ""Not ready"" status, which will lower your overall stats.  They have great training classes that will prepare you for the calls, but dealing with Disability and Life insurance claims is not something that I personally enjoy."
good,"Agile Environment typically a day would start with a morning meeting then the issues to be worked on identified then schedule meetings"
good,As Project Manager I had the opportunity to interact with all levels of management and a variety of projects that made it interesting.
good,i liked working here for its good work culture.
good,Great place to work. Great Benefits and 401K packages. Employer who supports the community and major United Way contributor. Diverse atmosphere.
good,"Thought it was going to be a very different experience with Lincoln being such a huge company in the financial industry, but I was wrong. Slow computers,micro managing and not great metric system"
good,They give you too many cases and throw a lot at you at once instead of steadily building up your case load.  There are a lot of great people that work there and most of the senior case managers are very helpful! Just too much stress to deal with for the amount of pay.
good,So much fun to work where everyone wants to play.  Learn so much when you see things as an employee and not just as a fan.  And it's more than just football
good,"Lincoln is an industry leader in annuyities and life insurance.  The expectations are high, but pay and benefits are solid.  Programs to enhance diversity and employee engagement."
good,Providing guidance and support to Lincoln Financial Advisors in various ways of Practice Management. Work closely with Advisors and their staff in order to promote Lincoln as a Broker Dealer of choice in the Independent Broker Dealer Market.
good,Lincoln Financial is a customer driven organization.  Everything that is done is done with the end customer in mind.  
good,"This is a good company once you get your foot in the door. Lots of benefits and good pay. However, there isn't a wide range of opportunities and advancement. There is a lot of flexibility and working remotely."
good,"Most of the work entailed filling out documents for clients on the computer and preparing them for signatures. When more information was needed from clients, I would communicate directly with them. I also did this to follow up with them on service requests. I spent a lot of time on the phone with Lincoln's back office and other financial companies to make sure requests were processed. I learned about the many requirements involved in completing requests and how to communicate these to clients, especially if the situations were complex and/or if time-frames turned out longer than initially expected. The hardest part was dealing with general frustration when companies would ask for additional requirements to complete requests, even though I asked for all requirements up front. The work environment was the most enjoyable. I got along with everyone in the office and felt comfortable asking for help or advice when I needed it."
good,"Lincoln Financial was a great place to work w/ competitive pay and benefits. The team I worked with was amazing, very knowledgeable, helpful, and fun!"
good,"Depending who you work with/for. People on teams are great. Good systems, smart people. You need to have good management.  Without good management.....it's difficult."
good,"The workload was reasonable and co workers were pleasant. The clients appreciated the work we did and that was satisfying. The benefits package is comparable to other large firms and includes PTO, medical, dental and 401k."
good,"Lincoln is a very good company to work for.  Cheap labor from India is their way to save money, no matter the results from 2 outsourcings.  Gov't Visa  overall changes need to be made to help this issue out."
good,"Depends on dept on how your day will flow. Customer Service is super strict, other depts. can be relaxed on if you need a long lunch or to leave early. Very nice people work at LFG."
good,Busy team with lots of work to be done daily. State and government reports that are time sensitive. I enjoy the team I work with and the relationships I have made.
good,"My current role has left me without options for advancement and provides no challenge, therefor very boring. There is a lot of volunteer opportunities and networking available."
good,Overall a good place to work. At times it can be very stressful. I would and have recommended this company to my friends. Depending on the department you work in the culture is good.
good,The people at Lincoln are great to work with. The management could be better.  It's possible to obtain a position and stay in the same role for a long time.
good,"Great place to work. Some management groups need improvement, but majority of the company is great. Some department have the option to work from home."
good,"The tone of the place was very professional. This culture of professionalism standard and hard work came down from top level management. The working environment allowed you to get on with your work with confidence, and there was always someone there to assist when help was required."
good,"A typical day would be taking phone calls regarding retirement accounts."
good,This company is a hard company to advance in. I want a career and I don't feel I can make a career in my area. I have found it easy to communicate with my coworkers and I catch onto the job easily.
good,Great place to work however stability was not good. The benefits were good and the people were good to work with.  The hardest part of the job is being moved to another department that you did not apply for.
good,"Lots of room for growth if you intend on becoming a financial planner. They are also great at reimbursing/paying for educational goals. If you come on as an assistant, I've seen a problem with a high volume of work for non-competitive pay."
good,"Great place to work. With fun, caring people! Cafeteria food is wonderful, small stor in the workplace that has any and everything youll ever need."
good,Lincoln is a strong contender in the marketplace and is a good company to work for although I do not feel there is much room to grow into the career I want to acquire.
good,"The company values and encourages creativity and rewards their employees with a best in class benefits package. The colleagues I have worked with over the past 13 years have taught me a great deal and it has been rewarding to work in a ""pay it forward"" environment."
good,"Its a good company with a lot of different departments for advancement and a lot of diversed people,"
good,A typical day consisted of putting together financial reviews for clients in Excel and scheduling appointments for the Financial Advisor. I learned how to work in a professional setting and work under pressure. Management and co-workers were very fun and helpful. The hardest part was trying to get clients to schedule an appointment with their advisor. The most enjoyable part was the fun co-workers.
good,"Within the Tax Team, I worked with the pre-Legacy system whole life policies where we had to ""recreate"" dividend histories based on file information.  There were no written policies or guidelines and a new work flow system had just been implemented.  I loved the challenge of digging into the process and documenting it, as well as managing the daily work-flow.  Within 18 months, our work inventory went from an average of 600+ hours to less than 200 hours (with a team of 12)."
good,I would give 4 out 5. Really good work enviroment and challanging projects.
good,"On average, I would answer 25 calls a day from policy holders or the beneficiaries of policies. I learned what was required to pay out life insurance policies, and many new computer programs such as Excel, and Lifesys.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customer interaction. I also loved being able to learn so many new things."
good,Enjoyed my teams thoroughly. Culture is laid-back but PMs have a heavy workload.
good,Good Company with Good Benefits
good,A good day would go without any technical problems. I advanced my skills by learning more in my area of expertise. Co-workers were helpful in getting me familiarized. Hardest part of the job was managing system failures in a time critical environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility allowed to work offsite as needed.
good,Typical day was relaxed
good,"I thrive in a team environment where challenges, multi-tasking and detail orientated skills are necessary for a successful outcome."
good,I am a contract employee leading a major data integration and migration project. Its a good place for me.
good,Able to do the job assigned with no micro-management. Physical well-being is always stressed. Very good group of employees in my department. Ability to be flexible goes both ways.
good,"My job was transitioned to a third party vendor so it was not my decision to leave the company. They have excellent benefits with 401k, Stock option, and Life/Work balance. "
good,"As I'm currently still employed at this location, I do not wish to review and do not think this should be mandatory. I do not agree with social media postings being mandatory."
good,"In certain areas of the company, the IT function is undergoing a transition from a mostly in-house business model to an out-source business model.  This change of course introduces uncertainty and stress to the work place.   With this change a new corporate culture will emerge, however at this point it is difficult to comment on the culture."
good,This job is a great way to start off in your security career! The experience and atmosphere is amazing. Sadly I don’t work there anymore but I do recommend this job for young adults coming straight out of high school.
good,"During the 15 years I was at Lincoln Financial Group, it was mainly a great experience. The managers I supported really strove to train you well and were stellar performers in their field of expertise. I felt encouraged and supported and was able to excel in my field. I have a lot of great memories and skills from my time there."
good,Strong work culture that encourages individual work processes with little collaboration. Self directed workers will flourish. Pace of work distribution can vary dramatically based on time of year and management changes.
good,It is difficult to complete the work in a 40 hour weeks so be prepared to work overtime. Work from home capability is provided for some positions but not all. The 401k is good. Overall good people. Nice culture.
good,I have nothing but great things to say going through the takeover from Liberty to Lincoln. Started with Liberty and still employed through the acquisition. Managers are so supportive from day 1! Hardest part of the job would be managing high caseloads.
good,"Many training opportunities, but hard to get promoted."
good,"My day would consist of checking emails and taking calls from Plan Participants, Retirement Consultants, Third Party Administrators, and Plan Adminstrators.  I would provide the paperwork and forms to facilitate loans, distributions, and audits.  I would also work with updating new plan documents."
good,I answer phone calls from claimants. Manage STD claims. Reach out for initial interviews and reach out to doctor offices to obtain information needed for the claim and to obtain medical records.
good,"They seem to be having a lot of layoffs, and most of  IT is being outsourced to India.  They need to remember employees can be their most important asset.   They do provide some training."
good,"I have only been working for the company for a few months. The atmosphere, so far seems to be friendly. I recently relocated to accept employment. I would have to say my days seem like 12 hours because of traffic."
good,Lincoln is a fun place to work and has good job advancement opportunities. There are great benefits to take advantage of and 401K support is readily available.
good,"I was successful at Lincoln because I'm outgoing, and I chose to be collaborative with the HR team. It can be a soloed work environment - if individuals choose for it to be."
good,"Good place to work, not a lot of room for advancement. Good benefits, good PTO and time off schedule. Generally flexible schedule, would be nice to be standard through the company as opposed to departments."
good,"My job was to assist my manager, a financial advisor with his day to day work. I got to connect with clients, allocating assets customized after the clients requirements."
good,No issues with work team or immediate management; vision was sometimes lacking.  System limitations were often the drivers for lack of business advancement. Wouldn't have left if mgmt changes hadn't forced me to evaluate future..
good,LFG is a great company to work for. The company offers great benefits. People are willing to talk to you and give you career advice. The culture is different at each office location.
good,Great company with average benefits. Paid Time Off is excellent.  Upper management is good and well experienced. Lincoln was a very good company to work for overall.

good,Lincoln is a great place to work for anyone looking to advance in their finance career. You learn a lot about the financial industry and ways to plan for your own future.
good,"Lincoln is a very good place to work. The Manager was a very positive person to work for in the computer Operations Department."
good,Great place to work. Hard to advance to different departments. The culture is positive and diversity is encouraged. A typical day at work is very productive and time management is essential.
good,"i have been working here for a long time and enjoy my job, my co-workers are great and bosses are wonderful. i never feel like i have been belittled or have weird looks for ideas or thoughts."
good,i taught myself how to use a cash registered and make anything i had too. I work with the most awesome people in my life. The hardest part of the job was when the people got intoxicated the make racism slur towards  african americans but i always knew how to ignore and provide my services to them.
good,"I worked at LFA for about 6 years.  Great place to work, co-workers great.  Management very understanding and they allow you to own your job.  I can say the job was ever hard unless the switchboard was really busy."
good,Wonderful working atmosphere. Everyone is willing to help you understand your task. Very friendly. I have learned a lot about financial planning in my time here.
good,The job was one of my best jobs I've ever had. Another job where I didn't get any raises at thought. This is a company that has money and they want to keep it that way. The manager would disappear for hours at a time.
good,"My workday is mainly data entry at a speedy pace. I am a temp so I process for many different teams as we handle their overflow.  The processes are different for each team, so you must be able to remember to change your processes accordingly. 4 hours of work, a half hour lunch, and another 4 hours of work per day. Most enjoyable part of this job is being able to work somewhat independently. Most difficult aspect is that the work requires a steep learning curve."
good,"reviewing new and updated procedures on products and services that may be offered to potential or existing clients.  management was available the majority of the time was very accessible and helpful.  the hardest part of the job was not be able to satisfy every client.  the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that i did all i could with in company's policy and procedures to help our clients, and continually meet company's goals."
good,I love Lincoln but for the higher level roles they almost entirely hire from external candidates over internal candidates.
good,I am thankful for Lincoln Financial Group as they hired me from a temp position. The company offers great benefits and has a higher 401(k) contribution match than most companies. LFG has made me stronger in my time management and communication skills as most jobs within the company have a turnaround time. I cannot say anything negative about any of the coworkers or supervisors I had as they were all super friendly. Every month you would have a one on one meeting with your supervisor to see how you are doing at your particular job. They would discuss your goals and aspiration and help you to get to where you want to be. LFG offers a great life:work balance. I never felt burnt out at work and the paid time off accrues quickly and greater every year worked there.
good,"It is a ok place to work.. A job.  Very hard and challenging"
good,Great environment for those that are excited by constant changing and a demanding environment.  People work very hard there and try to have fun at times as a team.
good,A typical day in the office would include interactions with distribution channels that sell Lincoln Products and customers who have purchased products.

good,"although my position at ACE was eliminated, I would return to this company in a second."
good,This job was at first tough to catch on and get used to but once you get the full picture of how the process works it is a breeze.
good,This was a great company to work for. Your fellow coworkers really make you feel like you belong and are always willing to help.
good,Solid culture with good benefits but the pay is a less than competitive companies.  They lack technology but are making efforts to improve. Overall a good company to work for with solid benefits.
good,There are many job opportunities and I do not want to provide just one view of the jobs at Lincoln.  There is a variety of jobs requiring many different skills and the company is dedicated to providing an excellent customer experience.
good,"Meetings, collaboration with co-workers, email communications about upcoming events and learning opportunities. Training is available.  Good management communications and relationships."
good,"Working there was fine, no big issues with management.  Did not see a big area of opportunity to ""work up the ladder"".  Very competitive and faced-paced environment."
good,"Lincoln is a great place to work if you are truly interested in the financial industry. "
good,LFG has phenomenal benefits in comparison to other jobs in the are.  Unfortunately that doesn't supersede the political rivalries that we were subjected to within the finance department.
good,"Lincoln was a great place to work.  You will experience many opportunities to grow and learn.  The people, pay and benefits are amazing.  You will be noticed and quickly be promoted if you are a great worker."
good,"Working at Lincoln Financial Advisors was a great opportunity to apply the skills learned in investment classes to the job.  Once I had learned and built trust with my boss, I was able to take on more responsibility."

good,"I miss this job and would love to go back when they are hiring for the position I was working for. Had to Resign due to health issues, but my boss, is boss, is boss, said I can come back, if there is in opening"
good,"Lincoln Financial Group is a great company to work for and the compensation is worth while.  The day is never the same and you are always faced with different circumstances.  The hardest part of the job is the mental stress that comes with the job.  However, working at this company allows you to network and build strong relations with other departments."
good,"Working at lincoln finanical has a great potential for unlimited income.  hard work pays off.  business oriented workplace. For an advisor, the need to be focused, regimented and diligent to the craft.  For the assistant or team, helping the planner/advisor, there is a potential for a great work environment, flexible schedule, and moments of both highs and lows as far as activity on a daily basis."
good,"Great atmosphere to work, great people to work and solid work ethnics. Lincoln strives to educate and improve their employees."
good,"There were a lot of good things to look at while working for Lincoln, but I felt at times that the exexcutive management made somewhat far-reaching snap decisions and the work itself could be quite tedious. Employees are also held to a very high quality metric that sometimes feels like ""the Sword of Damocles"" hanging above your head, but it wasn't bad. Cafeteria food got a little bit tiring, and it was easy to waste money at the first floor convenience store, but the retirement benefits are great and the job is pretty moderately-paced."
good,Good place to run your practice. You are responsible for your own client base. Unlimited potential of income if you meet your goals.
good,"During a typical day, I would schedule exams for clients applying for life insurance, put product materials together for clients upon approval.  Track and maintain commissions for agent.  Prepare illustrations and proposal for presentation to prospective clients."
good,"My job involves being a processor of non financial requests such as beneficiary, name and address changes. The changes can be anywhere from simple to complex, but there is a wonderful staff to help you with any questions that you may have. Additional training available."
good,"In general, a typical day at work includes processing at least six new claims while also handling phone calls from other claimants you are currently working with. At any given time, an examiner is supposed to be juggling around 120 claimants in their work load. Sometimes we must contact the employer or the doctor of a claimant to acquire necessary information in processing their claim, such as their salary continuance information, their diagnoses, their limitations and restrictions, among other things. In general, examiners can rely on their co-workers and their seniors to discuss information on claims should they need advice on how to proceed. The work is fast-paced and rather stressful, but the days go by quickly."
good,Had my position not been eliminated I would still be there. Lincoln is a great place to work with a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"A fun and lite hearted workplace and yet very business like. A typical day at work was Collection phone calls, releaving Receptionist, greeting visitors and getting prizes for Prize Winners, sorting out mail, receiving incoming phone calls and directing them to the correct person then back to my desk to open all accounting mail and prepair checks for next day deposit and all invoices to the correct person. I learned alot about the computor and office programs ie:excel and many others. I also learned alot from my co-workers and enjoyed the friendships that were made. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the different people I got to speak to or meet in a day. "
good,"I have really enjoyed working at LFG. Overall, the company is a great place and people truly care about the clients. My only issue has been compensation as it's taken almost 9 years to go from a starting salary of $50K to $ 67K. That means it will take at least another 5 to 7 years for me to reach the max salary $75K."
good,"Doing data analysis, campaign analytics, marketing campaigns, statistical analysis, strategy design, hypothesis testing"
good,"My typical day at work is to come in at about 6 a.m. and read through my emails and follow and complete any work from the day prior.  Then I would continue managing my workload for the day by pulling from my sales offices folders.  I learned how to work well with others and communication is key.  Management in that department was ok, I think they could have done a better job with the training aspect for that position.  My co-workers were great people and we all worked well together.  The hardest part about the job is if there was an error made on my behalf, it never came to me directly, it went straight to the manager vs. communicating it with me so I can fix my error.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility and managing my own work, and getting to know other employees and other departments within Lincoln Financial."
good,"Lincoln Financial provides a healthy environment for working and there is a ""we"" attitude, not a management vs employee attitude. if there is a practice that is not working, it is addressed immediately. Lincoln financial believes of doing the right thing for the company while considering the need of the employee."
good,"This was my first experience working collaboratively with a group of people in order to obtain goal, and it was fun. It was also my first experience with corporate culture and all that intailed. I also had the opportunity to make improvments within my position."
good,I worked closely with other functional areas within the organization. Knowledgeable management team. Productive and wonderful work environment. Company offered opportunities for growth and advancement.

good,Lincoln was a great place to work for. I helped to start the Risk Management Team and was one of the founding members there. I helped the team grow to 5 members.
good,"Very good work environment."
good,"It seemed like the structure of the internship could vary widely with which manager you ended up with. It was instructive enough, but not always the most interesting. The people were nice if a little boring, which could make a normal day a little, well, boring."
good,"working for Lincoln is a very team oriented environment, the people are always ready to help when needed and management always has an open door policy"
good,Very good company. Wide variety of products available. Good staff. Other reps were good to work with. Good technology tools and support. Very competitive compensation compared to the industry.
good,"The finance department works hard, but they don't typically require crazy hours.  They also encourage participation in quarterly social events.  They are making many technology improvements resulting in more and more layoffs."
good,Great place to work the call center can be a little stressful due to the fact you are dealing with so many different situations from angry dental providers to someone who just lost a family member and trying to file a life claim but over Lincoln does care about there employees.

good,"Overall, Lincoln has been a good place to work.  Rate of pay was good and we had the ability to work from home.  Work-life balance was decent as well."
good,"Since this is a sales job of sorts, all growth is determined by the amount of work you put in. The team was great and everyone was there to help when needed. At the end of the day, it just wasn't the career that I wanted."
good,Company culture is very good.  Regular employees seem happy with their experience with the company.  Many that I talked with had been with the company for years and had no intention of leaving.  I witnessed several promotions.  Overall an excellent company.  Wished for a longer stint.
good,Great employer and very flexible for senior staff.  Management staff is preety good at communicating current standings and upcoming changes.  Also open to staff comments and concerns.
good,"Lincoln Financial Group provides advice and solutions that empower  to take charge of their financial lives with confidence. Our core business areas—life insurance, annuities, retirement plan services and employee benefits—focus on supporting, preserving and enhancing people’s lifestyles and retirement outcomes.  Lincoln Financial provides a diverse range of financial tools and advice to help people take charge of their futures."

good,"great coworkers and clients. nice company to work for"
good,"- Very balanced work/life environment. "
good,"Relatively well balanced company but if you enter the company via the call center, its difficult to move forward. Benefits are good with non-contributory 401K and match contribution up to 6%.   If you work in the main building the facilities are great.  But if you work in an annex, eat at your desk because there is not even a place to sit down if you bring your lunch.  Eating in the main dining facility is our of question when you have 30 minute lunch and 20 minute wait to get food."
good,"I grew my career at Lincoln and made a lot of life long friends. I was promoted twice so it is possible to build a stable career at Lincoln. The only problem I had with Lincoln was like any other corporate sales environment: there is a lot of politics, gossip and back stabbing. There are sales managers at Lincoln called divisionals and they are some of the worst people to walk this earth. Depending on where you want your career to go, you may need on your side and that is a tough to do."
good,Very easy and low maintenance work.  Was given the opportunity to work with minimal supervision but management and staff was readily available to answer any concerns
good,Entered data from different clients and verified that all necessary information was collected. Management was very friendly and helped with answering questions.

good,Great company for experienced professionals.  Not the best at developing talent for lateral career development but a strong culture for promotion with line of discipline.
good,Make sure you work for the right planner. If you're an assistant it can be difficult if you're with someone you don't gel with.
good,I would go in at 7:30 till 3:30  Monday - Friday sometimes on Saturday just few hours. Family environment  data entry specialist

good,"I really enjoyed this job. I learned a lot about life insurance policies and how they worked. I really enjoyed that they would have a lot of pot lucks and luncheons for the staff on the floor. However, this position did not last long for me due to the fact that it was only temporary. I really enjoyed working for this company. They really treated each other like family in the department that I was in."
good,"Maintain and support existing program applications."

good,"Solid Company with good salary range for multiple jobs, and good benefits."
good,Lincoln was going through a merger and there was some disruption but there was a lot of information to learn.

good,Great company - Fortune 250.  Always looking to improve and meet the needs of the current workforce.  Transforms as needed.  Great reputation in the marketplace.  Currently growing products and services.  Presence in all areas of the United States.  Still growing their remote employee practice but open to more of it.  The hardest part is that it is a very established company so the wheels of turn sometimes are a little slow to evolve.  You must be a self-starter and know that you own the responsibility of your career to advance.  This is a mantra of theirs and one I personally hold true as well.  Benefits of working there are that once you get in the door there are many opportunities to move around to learn new areas and advance. On the flip side it is harder to get into for that very same reason as employees internally are competing with you for the job.
good,"Amazing company to start your career in and develop as a young professional. The workplace culture is great in comparison to other companies in the financial services industry. The people are friendly, collaborative, and helpful."

good,This was a great company to work for. They are laid back. They have a great management team and staff and goals that need to be reached by the bank. They are family oriented.

good,"Overall Lincoln is a great place to work. My reason for leaving is nothing to do with the environment, hours, etc but rather my role is changing into a more sales oriented role."

Fun, Fast Paced environment. Very hands-on, sometimes physically and mentally draining. However once you become acclimated to the work style, flow and pace of the environment, everything from that point should be a breeze. Supervisors are cool, no problems with them or upper management. They have an open door policy. They take problems very serious, especially if it starts to effect ones productivity...Like working there. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter so dress accordingly. Pay is good. No benefits though. Not a lot of days of work unless the football season has started. Lots of standing so wear comfy shoes."
good,LFG is a good company to work for. They have a great culture and coworkers are available to answer questions. There is a lot of fun activities beside work.

good,"I started as his administrative assistant and performed all office functions for the senior producer while studying for my FINRA exam. These daily functions would include paperwork, filing, and sitting in on meetings. Once I passed my exams, in March 2014, my main function was to market for the senior producer while learning the business for my own portfolio and my own clientele. I worked on accounts whether it was filling out paperwork for a client or assisting with the communications to clients. Daily work would consist of  responding to various emails, client services, client meetings, and meeting with wholesalers from various corporations. Also, I single-handedly enhanced the senior producer's communications using Constant Contact, CPA marketing emails, and monthly newsletters. In addition, I worked closely with compliance to be assured all materials were FINRA approved."
good,"This position requires scheduling and conducting phone interviews, including detailed medical information. Maintain effective communication skills with brokers, head underwriters, and external wholesalers. Administrative work and customer service skills. Schedules medical examinations.

Going over claims that have been paid or denied. Answering any questions that they have.The hardest part about the job was the micro management. Even if your giving 150% you still are messed with about being one minute late or using 2 min to long of personal time because maybe you had to us the bathroom a little more that day then the day before. The call center at Lincoln needs a lot of work and new management. That department needs to learn how to care about there employees a little more. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to turn negatives to positives when on the phone with a provider or an insured. Helping them and resolving their issue is always pleasing."
good,"Great place to settle in. Environment is not that competitive unless you are on the sales team. The internship program was in its first year when I joined, there were complaints about the disorganization. "

good,Other business lines include Group Protection and Retirement Plan Services.  Working at Lincoln was a pleasant experience.  Very flexible working environment with an emphasis on work-life balance.
good,"Lincoln Financial Group's work environment is fast paced and challenging from the time you arrive at work.  With a caseload of more than 120 associates and incoming claims at anytime, you never know what you are going to get from compensating a disability for pregnancy to determining a return to work plan for an individual with multiple knee surgeries.  A typical day starts of with reviewing recently sent in medical documentation, phone calls to clients to clarify a return to work date within 2 weeks of the established date, and processing of the daily new claims sent in.  Management is great in that expectations are established each day for each Claims Examiner to ensure we are processing claims timely and partnering with employers to ensure the associate is not missing more time from work than is needed.  The hardest part of this job is anticipating what your day will be as each day any client or employer can call to clarify information or provide additional medical evidence to consider if an individual will be able to return to work on an established day.  The most enjoyable part of this job is realizing that in a clients time of needed , they are relying on you to provide clear and concise information as their compensation is now relying on me."

My co-workers are great, they help me out a lot and guide me through the day. The Hardest part of the Job is standing outside in the cold waiting for hours for fans to start making appearances and then making sure the stadium is clear of any fans. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the football players and enjoying the game on screen. It's a great experience."

The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl this year and every member of the staff had the pleasure of sharing that moment. The management staff appreciates the level of performance based on every individual. It is up to you to improve, advance and challenge yourself to grow with the organization. The most difficult part of the job is the constant turnover of staff. Working at the stadium is fun and exciting, but during severe weather conditions (hot or cold), maintaining a certain level of professionalism can be difficult. This is the main reason for the turnover of staff. People expect to watch the games/concerts and not work as required. Personally, working at the Linc is not a job, it is a new adventure every shift."

The most enjoyable part of the job was again the people that I worked with.    The management some were great and others were not as great as others.  For the majority of the time that I worked at Lincoln, I really liked and got along with most of the managers that I had in the 21 years that I worked there.  Just a typical day at work, was working on the computer, auditing the work of other employees or when they were short, helping out in different areas."
good,"LFG was a great place to work with, with very motivated, yet understanding employers, and great coworkers.  There was a bit of a learning curve at first, but once someone got the hang of the job, it became a lot less stressful and lot more fun.
