rating,review
bad,"Pinnacle was acquired by Penn Gaming in late 2018."
bad,I wish I could get back the time and effort I wasted with this place. Too many cons to list and no pros at all. Literally the worst job I've ever had.
bad,This place is a horrible place. They act like they care about you but they don't. You can't be sick or they will fire you. You have to work till 5 in the morning. 10 hour nights. You have five different managers that tell you all different things. It took 5 weeks to get hired. What a waist of time.
bad,"This place is a cult and they put you through the ringer working like mules to accomplish the impossible with no resources. While the management sits up high in there conference room debating on how to squeeze another penny out of the payroll. It was the most vile and deceptive bunch of people I have ever met. None of the leaders have any values. The workers themselves are fed scraps and are being used to enrich only a few people. If you want long hours back breaking work, virtually no advancement, and zero chance at a living wage while sacrificing your body and well being this place is for you. Extra warning I was told by long term employees that this property itself is built on formerly contaminated land and working there your probably more likely to develop cancer or some form of terminal illness. Is a 12 buck an hour job worth your health. They apparently had to remove many feet of contaminated soil before they could even start building. They have pictures up with all the people who have passed away in the past few years since they have been open and its unreal how many have died. They are a greedy business as the casino business itself is a giant scam on the community. Enter at your own risk."
bad,"Supervisors and managers do not care much about workers, favoritism is a huge problem. Scheduling is just as bad. Would not recommend working here to anyone unless you have no other option."
bad,Valet Management is poor and lazy. All requests for new equipment or things never get approved. Under paid for having to do more than job details. No PTO etc
bad,High Turn Over and team members are paid pennies.  Unfair treatment by management.  Will work you outside of your job description and overload you with work.  River City Casino is not a good place to be employed.  HR department is full of dysfunction.
bad,"Promotions based purely on who you know not what you know."
bad,The management in this company is horrible. The workloads are heavy with little pay when it comes to working in the warehouse.
bad,"Upper management here uses this company to benefit themselves, with no regard for the lower management and the line level employees. They have really good core values posted all over the building, but none of them are followed, and actually a lot of the time it's the opposite. They only value they hold are the ones that benefit the gain of the upper management."
bad,"Nepotism,  nepotism,  nepotism . Also management doesn't provide help when needed and think to be Gods! Many have issues and quid pro quo is relevant to getting promoted!"
bad,"Very,very poor management alot of job elimination for that casino to make a lot of money you are not paid for what you are worth....??????"
bad,I have been in the business for awhile. I have never had such uncaring manages before. Brook Campbell is the worst there with Austin a close second. Never was anything the same for everyone. It was all about their version of teamwork. If you couldn’t do what they wanted to you was out the door. You have to work 8.5 hours but was only paid for 8.
bad,This company vehemently discriminates against people based on physical appearances.  The chauvinistic males that run this company are vile misogynist.
bad,If you like to be over worked and under paid then this job is for you.  They say they are all about employees but listen to that .  We went from getting Christmas bonuses the last 7 years to nothing from this company not even a Christmas party to thank us for making the casino what it is today.  Their policies are terrible   Its like you work in a jail.  They cannot even provide a parking area that is suitable for employees.  If you wanna work 8hrs on your feet then walk up a hill and 4 flights of steps then this job is for you.  Free lunch provided but only because of union contract else you would be paying for you lunches that were always free with other company.  Please take my word and look else where.  They will tell you what you want to hear to get you hired on then you will be sorry you work here.
bad,All anyone seems to care about is making money. I find it hard to do my job when I can not rely on my coworkers to follow protocol because an opportunity presents itself for them to make more money.
bad,"I understand that there is a business to run, but when it comes to it, it's the business over family.  For example, there was a time that I needed to leave because not only was I feeling ill, but I needed to get home to my step son.  They told me that there was nothing that they could do, and that I had to stay around until the end of my shift."
bad,"It was station casino then ameristar .The  director let me go after 10 years of working in surveillance   The director herself years later was let go then moved to table games manager then to security director.   Talk about total bs!  After 10 years they walked me out because  I had 38 reports for the month, she said I needed 40 even though I gave 2 reports to new agents and taught them how to write the reports and gave them credit.  I blame the hire ups that let her destroy 7 other agents jobs as well as a supervisor.  Most of us  now work for other casinos in the area.  From Hollywood to Lumiere and river city.  All I can say is I wouldn't want to work in security as long as she still there.  Good luck  and if I was you - I'd check out the other casinos to see what they have to offer!"
bad,"Thought this job would be everything I wanted and more, a dream come true. After a year plus, I can tell you definitively that it is a nightmare. At least at the property I’m at."
bad,"There is no typical day to describe at Pinnacle, but giving sub-par customer service to casino guests is frequent and accepted.  Employees who have poor grammar and spelling are in frequent written communication with guests and provide a poor image to guests."
bad,"overall my experience working there was fun but was drama! co worker dislike you because they have problems and is unstable with themselves. "
bad,Working for a boat is for people that have no life or is looking for something to pass time. It has its pros and cons but it's really the people that you come in contact with that makes you wanna return. It's not a job u want to make a career.
bad,"Culture promoted toxic attitudes and offices politics or competition. C-suite leadership spent ridiculous amounts of time on minor operating details instead of trusting and empowering leadership in business units. They failed to set and establish major strategic priorities like brand differentiation, public relation tactics, customer value propositioning to ensure success. Much of the decisions were ego driven and not based on clear and well-aligned strategy execution. It is not surprise that those leaders found themself only to be acquired just a few short years later."
bad,"Previous HR Business Partner who loved the job duties....but management soon wiped out any motivation team members had.  The head of HR is HORRIBLE worst ever HR ""professional"" I have ever encountered in 25 years of working in HR.  The head of training was dangerous and malicious and the two of them ruined the HR department as well as morale throughout the casino."
bad,"Great place to work if you have no personal or social life. Mangers are sneaky and cut throat like Cage Manager Cautoi Richard. Overall, the money is great but managers have secret hate and motives when they are jealous of you."
bad,They need to clean house all the way up from casino to Human Resource.Can’t keep good people but love the bad ones working there. Like family members.
bad,"I have learned much in my time in the casino business. I have enjoyed learning how to run many reports, plan and produce events of all types and sizes."
bad,"My only comment has to do with General Manager I worked under.  Not comfortable with diverse environment.  Co-workers were great, upper management didn't do enough to support them however."
bad,Worst place I ever worked......Worst leader in the vp of operation....Hypocrite....Liar.....And a manipulator......Extremely poor overall leadership.....
bad,"I've been in many different security fields over the prior 20 years but I didn't have any casino experience so I decided to give it a try. I did learn a lot, some good and some bad. My ""DIRECT"" supervisors and managers were awesome and as for the rest I was taught if you do have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all. Just as an end note, I used to love going to casinos but now that I know how they are run and what they really think of the people, I have not been back to one since leaving and will NEVER go to another one ever again!"
bad,"The company is a good company to work for the pay is decent, depending on job title the hours are pretty secure. I disliked the department I worked in (Housekeeping) the executive supervisor is un-professional and she doesn't know how to talk to or treat her employees. She doesn't actively assist her employees at all....She sucks!!!!"
bad,Pros:
good,Past leadership positioned the company into into the solid position it occupies today. Current leadership is composed of ex-Harrah's people and the culture has drastically changed. People are no longer valued. Assets are valued.
good,"Middle management allows frontline employees be abused verbally by guests, there is no support from them to supervisory or front line staff."
good,"Great company if you need a stepping stone to another company. Pinnacle is 2nd to none for guest service, the company however does not instill the same quality of service to the team."
good,"I worked for the Engineering Department...It was an ok experience to say the most. Pay less than desirable, on the extreme low end for the market pay rate. A huge amount of arrogant Egos running about. Less than knowledgable staff in most departments and management and supervisors spend a great deal of time conducting formal meetings way to often. More training and education opportunities for employess would have made it a more desirable work environment."
good,"Nice place to work, not a lot of opportunity to advance in my career.  Enjoyed all my co-workers and my time there.  Lost the Pinnacle culture after the Ameristar merger of 2013."
good,"Management does not handle situations the way they should. They let a lot of people start a lot of confusion, and never put an end to the problems. They have favorites in my workplace, which is not fair! I have learned to deal with different types of people without letting their actions get to me. The best part of my job, i met some nice, caring people well let me say friends. If management was more effective and fair the workplace would be awesome, but everywhere you go there will always be that one crazy person but you have to be bigger than them and keep doing your job the correct way!"
good,Position at Pinnacle was great until changes took place over the last few years. Management wasn't as intellectual as the previous management/executive team from 2006 to 2010.
good,"great co-workers, always busy, learned a lot. Upper management is very weak. Do not care about employees needs. I love my job, fun place to work"
good,had to work no less than 10 hours a day.  sometimes more and could possibly work 14 days straight with no days off.  company sold out and does not exist anymore.
good,"Any good ideas you have most times a manger will say it was their idea. I've had it happen to me a few times. Moving up is really based on who you know and sucking up not hard work. If you do work hard they will throw more on you, basically having you do the work of 3 people. Communication is not the best between departments and shifts. One outlet gets all the attention while the others get screwed over. Some people are expected to break others and aren't able to go on break themselves."
good,I work as an IT Sr. Systems Analyst and have been on the job for about one year. The Lauberge Casino and Hotel in Baton Rouge is a nice facility with nice people.
good,I loved my time with this company supervisors and higher were amazing and there were many great benefits however my manager directly above me were manipulative and took advantage of workers and threatened us with termination.
good,Neutral rating on all aspects.  I really cannot say much about the position other than the fact that all applicants much be prepared for a smoke filled environment.  It could be a challenge some days.
good,"Socially involved job. Lots of fun, but pay is not all that great. If you work your way up, they end up getting read of you. Budget is very important and upper management is going to get there bonuses."
good,"A company is nothing without it's employees.  I believe that this company really wants to take care of its employees but since the merger with Ameristar; the company has begun penny pinching overall moral of employees is down.  I love this company and I know it can do better, I will never be satisfied with the outlook it currently has."
good,"I had a lot of fond memories working there and met a lot of very talented music artists, whom have praised my work. we were able to sell a really good portion of flyers, cd albums and pamphlets that I have designed altogether."
good,"Every day was busy and full of multiple tasks or projects. Management was very conscious of the heavy workload and put forth a lot of effort to keep team member morale high, offering much support and team building events."
good,"My work day consisted of walking on average 6miles, watching out for guests who were underage, had had to much to drink and were sleeping on the floor or possibly becoming a distraction to other guests having a good time and in checking roooms on all floors.  I was also involved in transporting large amounts of money from the bank to the tables and walking guests from the floor to the bank if need be, to collect their winnings."
good,"Merged with Ameristar Casinos, an excellent company with great values, people and atmosphere."
good,"There really is no typical day at work. The business day can be fast paced and dynamic all the way to slow and even mundane at times. However, there is always something to do. When I'm not tackling guest or employee issues I'm conducting my day to day tasks of scheduling, payroll, and implementing training. I have learned the appreciation for accountability, ownership, and good management. The most difficult part of the job is the balancing between being a good employee and being a good employer. Finding that fine line between making your boss happy and your own employees happy is crucial. The most enjoyable part of my day would be connecting with a guest or employee - little things to make them happy can go a long way."
good,Great people to work with but very low retention. Which lead to low emplyee morale.
good,"I  have the skills you are  looking for to work this  job.  I have work for pinnacle before, but as a temporary worker. I worked in the costume area and costumer services. Sometimes I was even laundry room service."
good,Pinnacle does not have any QA engineers as FT - they are all on contract bases. They have a lot of apps and s/w and nobody is testing those. They could easily employ at least 5 QA FT people and keep them very busy if company is taking testing seriously. They opened new casino - major achievement - but no QA was done on any of the s/w. At least not by qualified QA people. Their IT is small shop where majority of IT personnel reports directly to CIO. No middle management.
good,"I deal cards at a Casino, so i work with people all day. My co-workers are nice most of them. The rude ones don't make us any tips. And they get more hours then me. The hardest part of my job is physically taking peoples money from them daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is when people win. :) But then they don't give you any money on blackjack they're just like thanks for the $900 bucks. I don't get my 40 hours a week and no overtime that is why I'm looking for a new job."
good,"The Internal Audit department at Pinnacle Entertainment provided a great work life balance and opportunities for experience in SOX, regulatory and operational audits. However, management does not actively strive to develop their employees for advancement and showed little desire to improve the audit process or focus audits on a risk oriented basis. The audit programs had not been updated or evaluated in at least five years and management did not care to devote the time to ensure the testing provided the best assurance possible."
good,"When you think of a casino, you think fun, fast-paced, ups and downs... and that's exactly the same for working for one. Great place to work, like one big family, but a huge opportunity in management and the development of management. The higher up you get, the worse of a leader you become. Lazy, entitled and finger-pointing. Hardest decision of my life to even start looking for a new job as I loved so much about my job and company, but just could not develop under leaders like the ones at Belterra Park."
good,"It took one month to start working, I also had to spend money to get this job. I was hired on as fulltime, but every night after 2am they would send u home in the wee hours so I never seen 35 hours. Another thing being a cage cashier feels like you are in prison and every time you touch anything including yourself you would have throw your hands in the air just to prove you aren't stealing anything and no weekends off at all."
good,A place to gain experience that can translate to advancement at other companies.
good,"Fast paced work environment with good benefits but management is poor. Benefits are good, and most of the people you work with are good to with. Culture is okay."
good,"Good money. Enjoyed working there until customers start losing and get angry(occasionally). Some of the customers were racially insensitive(racist pet names, jokes etc.)"
good,"If you like meeting new people, this is the place to be.  If you are not a people person, then you are in the wrong business. Don't get me wrong, it can have it's down side when you get rude unappreciated guest. For example, you will have guest that will try to curse you out because they are loosing. They act like it's your fault, but you as a dealer know it's not your fault because you didn't make them put their money on the table. :)"
good,I enjoyed my work at Avery. The shared service center was moved to India. The environment was relaxed and my co-workers worked really well together
good,I enjoyed working at L'auberge du Lac. I was able to meet many different people from all over the world. I was always learning new things on how to do my job.
good,"A typical day at work is to organize your tasks and hit the floor running.  I learned that a little thank you and I appreciate you goes a long way.  Management was supportive.  My co-workers work well together.  Nothing was too hard, everything was routine with minor adjustments here and there. Posting payroll by deadline was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working here but if you plan to have children or work part time, this is not for you. Management sucks and will try to give you the run around."
good,I have worked at many places...small regional private to huge international public organizations and Pinnacle truly walks the walk when it comes to how they say they want the Team Members to be treated etc....  so much so that it took me a while to believe it was legitimate and not just the same ol same ol lip service I've dealt with in my past.
good,"A typical day at work at River City is very challenging but worth every second and minute of it. Serving guest with the highest expectation was the key to business, making a great impression on the guest first and maybe last experience of a life time to keep them coming back. There were good and bad management styles but that's every where I guest and some of the co-workers complained about the smallest things to avoid doing their jobs. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everybody on the same page and my opinion this comes from the top to the bottom, management. Overall I think Pinnacle Entertainment is a wonderful place to work after all I worked for three of their companies. President (Admiral), Lumiere Casino and River City Casino & Hotel."
good,"A typical day often consists of following leadership functions, and abiding by a strict code. Babysitters, more often than not, and the front line of the property for securing important function. Not a lot of hands-on involvement in the job, simply just escorting funds, and making notes of unusual behaviors. Securing Patrons and Employees with shuttle runs, and being able to physically climb stairs, and be on your feet constantly."
good,Learned team work and great communication skills with others. Fantastic work environment and very supportive management team. Lots of benefits from working here.
good,"Typical corporate culture. Lots of politics. If you're willing to play the game, you'll do great there."
good,"They seemed to move me all around.  I was doing taxes, but they decided to put me on garnishments with no training, the person that took my place missed many tax deposits, where I missed not any."
good,"I was not a full time employee of Pinnacle, but they treated me well and were very gracious. It is a very modern office and all their computers were updated and maintained."
good,"great co-workers, fun and exciting environment, great opportunities, they promote from within, competitive wages"
good,"The culture at Pinnacle Entertainment is better than most other casino companies, there's a sense that work should not be rushed if it's not going to be a value add, or if it's going to be flawed in one way or another. Deadlines are rare here and there's more of a focus on quality rather than getting something out the door."
good,Work day is always exciting.  I'm always ready for new challenges and opportunities that may arise.  Be they good or bad one must always remain flexible to be able to achieve the customer service goals of the department.
good,Overall company was good to work for. Pinnacle Entertainment was sold to Penn National Gaming and a lot of changes are happening. At the moment I cannot speculate on the new company.
good,Great company and culture!  Very friendly and team member oriented.  Always looking for ways to improve and does a great job on team member recognition.
good,There are many opportunities for advancement and many locations to choose from. The benefits are excellent.  The company really cares  for it's team members.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're a hard worker without a degree looking to advance within the company ranks.  Very demanding job, however, and this made it near impossible to return to college while working."
good,"Verify inventory in the warehouse, also verify invoices for A/P on a daily basis.  My day may consist of filing, contacting vendors, assist warehouse team when needed. "
good,"Work was typically fun, most of the time everyone was in a good mood. My co-workers & I were close because we opened the Casino in Feb. 2009. The job was hard because you had to stand for 10 hr. shifts. It was enjoyable because we were allowed free food & occasional appreciation days. We were on a strict point system."
good,I love working at LDL-LC. There are only a couple of changes I would make (separating Casino Ops and remodeling/upgradeing property). Otherwise the money and benefits are nice. Upper Management is always on the floor to discuss any concerns. The promotions could be a little better being as though they are competing with GNLC right next door. The property has everything they need to be a casino/resort. Its organized and I would call it the Best Casino in Lake Charles!
good,Working for pinnacle was fine. I worked nights and weekend and holidays so it was tough to see my family or have a social life but other than that i enjoyed the people and did not mind the job.
good,"I worked at 2 locations for this company.  rivercity had a much better culture as it was always a pinnicale property.  i had a great experience transferring to another location and they were amazing at working around my school schedule, i felt supported by my team both at work and with what i was trying to do with my education."
good,"Great work/life balance as long as you are consistently producing."
good,"A typical day at work included completing staff schedules, leading staff and speaking with customers as well as operations meetings."
good,Typical work day includes courtesy phone calls and visits to many casino players. Offering them assistance with dinner and hotel accomodations. Providing the best possible customer service to ensure a memorable gaming experience.
good,Managed a heavy workload that relied on accurately assigning data to patrons accounts by using heavy excel and campaign automated systems.
good,"I only left because according to a shift manager an anonymous call was placed accusing me of holding private classes to improve customers chances of winning. Completely bogus and i felt like i was being picked on. No formal accusation was filed, but for a manager to actually ask me about this with no proof was disrespectful."
good,"Pinnacle entertainment as a whole is a good company to work for, the department at the particular site that i worked for was not. Did not get promotion as promised"
good,"Good place to work and the fellow employees are lots of fun to work with. The hours can be demanding, but there is advanced notice most of the time. Overall- very rewarding."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lauberge very much.   It was a relaxed work environment with a lot of great employee perks.    My supervisors were very supportive of me and my co workers.     I would recommend it as a great place to work.
good,"Its a good working place where you can enjoy food, music, jackpots, & good people so I have nothing bad to say at where I work its good mangers an good people here!"
good,"The company has been great to me. Pinnacle Entertainment has great advancement opportunities, and the options are endless. I could not ask for a better company to start a new career with."
good,"Completed my internship here, started as an internal auditor and moved to Human Resources. They try to keep you if you are a hard worker."
good,"Great place to work in business intelligence and data analytics. Company was recently acquired by Penn National Gaming. I will not be continuing my career with the new company, but it was a great environment to work in with a great culture. My manager gave me room to learn and grow and has been a tremendous help as well as my co-workers, as I move on to the next chapter in my career"
good,"The worst thing I dealt with was the hours. I worked every weekend all weekend and every holiday, but it is a casino and it was expected before hiring on. Also, the late nights do take some getting used to. If you work hard it is easy to make a name for yourself and move up. The managers and supervisors are amazing. I had a great experience working here. I worked in retail there also and loved it more than anything. Retail is a great department to work in, but the casino floor and tip jobs are where you would want to go if you're looking for a job with pay."
good,Pinnacle has been one of the stand-out companies in my career. They have always treated their employees very good and have rewarded hard work with good pay.
good,"Came in on feb.21,2014 got number of "
good,Working in the entertainment industry sure can be hectic and fast paced. you really gotta have a love for fast paced work. The management is great as well. The evironment is just fun in itself. 
good,"Company is a good place to work, open door policy very friendly. Great working team, would still be with company, but relocated to Las Vegas!"
good,"Environment was great. Management was awesome. Great tips from a server/bartender standpoint. However, had to deal with a wide range of customer types. Always worked nights and weekends and holidays...but thats expected in the food and beverage industry. Great experience!"
good,"My day starts with either picking up paperwork or fixing meters. As the day proceeds audit assignments are already divided out. Sorting through paperwork depending on what your were auditing determines how much stress you will encounter. Management has its moments, one person can create an unnecessary flow of paranoid behavior. We work with some managers and some we work around them. The most cool part about the job is the joy and zeal that each team member projects. We know when to be serious and know when to be cool. The culture does a lot for the employees showing how much you are appreciated. The hardest part of the job is the team leaders who hold the department back because of their attitudes. I learned data entry, posting, reporting to corporate and how assist other departments."
good,"Great company to work for.  The Leaders are easy to talk to and aren't about their ""Titles"". They are very flexible with you as far as having a work life balance.  As long as you are getting your work done Management will work with you if you need to leave early or take time off. Pinnacle recently got bought out by Penn Gaming.  Not sure what their culture is like but Pinnacle is a fantastic company to work for."
good,Work days varied according to the projects.  Some days were strictly travel and others in the office or on-site. While at Pinnacle I continued to grow my management skills and had great leadership that was always there to support me.
good,This is a great place to work. I felt very supported and enjoyed the work as well as my teammates! I highly recommend this company for anyone looking for a good place to plug in to.
good,Fun times at pinnacle.... it is a great company where employees are treated fairly and nicely
good,"It's a great place to work. People are friendly and easy to work with."
good,From the minute you walk in you feel the culture of family.  Kindness and caring.Community philanthropy.  Trust. Pay for performance.  Team work.  Fast paced environment.
good,Day to day included working on new projects and technologies.  Marketing and Operations projects usually dictated new software and other technology challenges on a regular basis.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day since everyday is full of new experiences in the gaming industry.  With the right leaders you will be able to advance far in your career with Pinnacle Entertainment.  Management is caring and the culture is team member-focused.  The most difficult part of the job is not taking things too personally, as customers can be exceedingly difficult to please in this high-stress environment.  Most people that you work with and service are truly good, kind people and you will enjoy your job."
good,"Worked on the expansion and quality improvement of the Food Service Division"
good,"Fun, productive company and yes...they have a ping pong table! Executive management is extremely well-qualified, smart, competent individuals. Great asset to the company!"
good,"Fun work place, friendly coworkers, learn most customer service skills"
good,I am a Host/Cashier. My typical day involves running the register and seating guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. The management team is very easy to work for.
good,"If you can handle the smoking environment, you can get by, day to day just fine. The staff and management are quality and the corporate priorities are sound."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs.  I really enjoyed it!  It was unfortunate that I was laid off, but I'm grateful for the experience and the L'auberge Baton Rouge HR Department."
good,"Ive been a security officer for River City for almost 2 years now. Its a great place to work. Good management and my co workers are awesome. There's alot of SOP's and gaming laws to learn, but once you get it all down, its no problem. Easy money!! Weekends are really busy and exciting. Ya never know what you'll get. One minute your walking someone to their car and the next your assisting the gaming agents with a warrant arrest. It can be exciting and boring. But that's the way security work goes."
good,"I loved the management, the team members, the fun exciting atmosphere and the ability to share your ideas.  "
good,"By far, this is the best work experience of my career.  It is very sad that Pinnacle is merging with Penn National Gaming; however, I am hopeful that Penn has the same corporate culture as Pinnacle."
good,"PNK is a great company to work for. Great culture, great leaders & they live their core values at the Service Center and at properties. I am proud to be PNK!"
good,cage cashiering is a great job if you can be flexible with your hours or like working night/graveyard shifts and weekends. it has its perks to the job
good,"Highly competitive company with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of operating successful casinos, hotels and resorts. "
good,"get in at 3:30 "
good,"Allows growth within the company A great place to work, to learn, the culture overall is amazing I couldnt ask for a better place to work. great pay.."
good,"Pinnacle Entertainment is an American gaming and hospitality company. It operates sixteen casino properties, located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Ohio,"
good,Pinnacle Entertainment is a good place to work for with a lot of advancement opportunities. There are many careers within the company that are available so you can move around until you find your niche.
good,No one day is the same.  Opportunity is abundant and so is employee engagement. Great employer if you're looking to grow with a company.
good,"I started at Ameristar two years ago and have enjoyed the challenges and learning opportunities. The management is very proactive in advancing your career there. I have been encouraged to take part in the coaching training and leadership development programs, both of which I have taken. My coworkers are fun and knowledgeable and make going to work enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is probably the day to day challenges that pop up. There is always something new to learn."
good,I enjoyed working with this company and would recommend other people to this company. I have more than 10+yeards in the Entertainment industry with guest relations experience and supervisory experience.
good,"I didnt realize it at first but pinnacle is the best casino company to work for. As a dealer, we got away with murder. Things you would often get written up for was allowed to do. I didnt realize this until i started talking to dealers from other casino. We use to get tipped a lot and i didnt notice that was because of all the promotion they sent out to get the players coming back everyday. I got away with saying things to guest that would get you fired. My floor would even back me up a lot of the times. Pinnacle is one of those companies that understand if you take care of the employees, the employees will take care of the guest. We all know that is what its all about. the only reason i left was because i wanted my life back. working overnight and every weekend and holiday was not a fit for me. this has nothing against the company. i am the one who signed up for it."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of opening table games by checking each deck of cards and counting the bankroll of each game. Then, I oversaw the dealers while they dealt each game usually six games at a time. I handled dealer/player disputes along with awarding compensations to players based on their play. I interacted with the players and the dealers in a positive way as to ensure a positive work environment and building relationships with the guests building the client base for the casino. Then at the end of the day, I would close each table by counting the bank role of each table and ensuring each table was securely locked and everything was in it's proper place. Most of the management were pleasant and my co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was having to resolve customer disputes that continued to escalate regardless of my efforts. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I received from ensuring the environment was enjoyable for my players and dealers."
