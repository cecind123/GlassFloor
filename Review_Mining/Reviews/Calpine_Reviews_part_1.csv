bad,"Their website says they encourage veterans to apply, but how many veterans work as Operations Technician/Stationary Steam Engineers.Its all Maine Maritime grad, it's kind of a discrimination issue I would say. On the job training is and always will be the best qualifications for any job."
bad,"Company management has no clue on running a buisness or electric generation. They are doomed for a 2nd bankruptcy. Pay there executives lots of $. Poor ethics, will not survive."
bad,Do more with less due to a buy out.  The new management is focused on over working the newly acquired staff to make it look better for bottom line.  Management and staff are only concerned with meeting the goals to show they are merging teams and being productive regardless of the out come or staff.  Totally mismanaged transition that is pulling apart a successful business to merge into one that is not as successful.
bad,I worked at Calpine for one year. It was a stressful year due to management. The actual expectations for the role did not match what was discussed during the interview process. Severe lack of training contributed to the stress level.
bad,Enjoyed my brief time there.. Would be glad to return as a full time individual.. Was convenient to get to ..
bad,"Upper management talks a good talk, but doesn't have a clue about what's really going on in the power plant trenches. Very low moral at the plant level, no passion. Seems like people just CYA because there's a fear of getting let go."
bad,The people who make the internal mechanisms of the company need to and should ALWAYS be appreciated.
bad,Company went bankrupt and moved to texas. Does it really matter that there is a review for companies that went bankrupt.
good,Management is really bad. Calpine needs to evaluate them as they play favoritism. A lot of employees have been let go do to mngmnt behavior. Constant threat of firing. Very non professional
good,Average for companies in this market. Management and co-workers very cutthroat now
good,"Great stepping stone, because there is not a lot of room for advancement. The organization runs extremely lean. Work/Life Balance needs work. The culture needs work, as the morale is quite low."
good,"Corporate Middle Management Heavy"
good,"Like any company that is recuperating from debt this company still trying to find the path to success.  "
good,I worked for 10 years at Calpine and what started as a great company with excellent management ended with a bad company and poor management. Management become a closed knit community of robots that were told what and when to do all activities. If you where part of that group it was a great experience but once you fell out of the group you where on your on. I was told by management on more than one occasion that forward thinking individuals would not be tolerated.
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  Had several issues that were out of my control.  There was no culture in doing the right thing. Everyone concerned about themselves and not those working for them.
good,"I worked there for 11 months as a IC&E tech.  I was falsely accused of falsifying company PM’S. The plant went through 3 plant managers , 1 Operations manager,  1 Maintenance manager , 1 warehouse tech, 2 IC&E techs. If they want you gone they will make up some bs to get you out of there. They plant is falling apart and we were not given the money to make repairs. Not a great long term place to work at. Baytown Energy plant management are back stabbing picks"
good,"Good workplace culture, for the most part a good work/life balance. Management does not put any effort into retaining employees or growth opportunities. Very little consideration for employee needs."
good,Co-workers at North American Power & Gas (Calpine Corporation) taught me numerous skills and techniques to complete all my daily tasks as efficiently as possible.
good,"After 17 plus years with Calpine the best thing I got from them was all the training I received on how to best effectively manage my team members at my various plants. each day was fun and original, never a repeat moment."
good,There is a lot of politics at play and click groups that have the advantage or are in the 'know' from the rest. People are looking for their best interest and there is not much of a community/family sentiment.
good,I enjoyed my role in HR until company went thru a reorganization. My coworkers were positive and supportive. Management changed dramatically during my association.
good,"A decent place to work."
good,"I learned lot of things like technical, management from this company."
good,Ok company. Work/life balance is there. Growth opportunities very few. Pay is not competitive. Work can get boring. This is an intern's perspective.
good,"I was a I.C.E. TECH III, I review any work orders for the day with my pears."
good,Operating at Calpine is a great position. If your management is good you will have a good time. Work life balance is hard to do when you first start.
good,"Calpine is to big to rate overall. Simply put, it all depends on what management team you work under. The benefits are not bad at all. Pay is not so competitive. The benefits package as a whole very generous and the bonuses are great. Try to stay out of the western region. And try to stay out of california. Few contracts and no real plan or direction for the future in california. This is due to aging plants and changing legislation in california. They have a real focus on developing in the north east. And whatever you do stay out of Hayward/ Russell City Energy Center. This plant has a Bad reputation fleet wide."
good,The plant is in a state of disrepair and management is too concerned about exceeding the budget to fix anything. The job itself is relaxed and the work schedule is awesome. Operations is currently working 7on/7off rotating days/nights. Co-workers are easy to get along with as well.The hardest part of the job is dealing with all of the broken and retired in place equipment. Pay raises are on the lacking side. You get one per year and it's less than inflation. (about 2.5-3%max)
good,A good company to work for. Learnt a lot about power and gas industry. Professional and nice teammates.  Good work-life balance. Good work culture in this company.
good,Excellent company atmosphere with friendly people who are willing to take the time to teach you how to do your job properly. Ability to move between departments in this Company is a plus.

good,"Co-workers and department managers were all professional, competent and pleasant to work with/for.  Unfortunately senior leadership in IT was less than competent, overtly political and a major roadblock on most projects.  Odds are that this issue may no longer be relevant as the persons causing the disharmony are most likely no longer with the company,"
good,"Enjoyed learning under the Investor Relations VP. The VP was very knowledgeable, patient, and a well-respected individual amongst his peers."
good,"An excellent company to work for, with a few bad seeds in management.  Amazing benefits, good balance of duties for it's various crews."
good,"I would manage a library of electronic and physical data, delivering manuals and plans to engineers. I was the point of contact between major companies and our own. I learned various computer programs quickly and managed myself daily. The hardest part of my job was interpreting the tasks needed by the engineers, as I am not an engineer myself and I had to learn their lingo. The most enjoyable part of the job was managing myself to complete tasks before schedule."
good,"Calpine was a fast growing company built on a business model of rapidly developing and acquiring power generation assets.  This growth environment provided outstanding opportunities to lead challenging project developments and marketing portfolio products and services."
good,"The typical work day varied as the duties could change sparactically. While working for them I learned how they processed their SEC filings. Management was good, they had an open door policy. The culture of the workforce was diverse. The hardest part of the job was working it first-line managers who did not take responsibility for their mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting deadlines and celebrating with the team."
good,"I have a great work record. I lead by example, keeping all the key players on track for a decisive positive outcome that's safe and challenging to the work force. Upper management needs a better Mission Statement and strategist leading the company values and future."
good,"I worked with some of the engineers at Calpine Corporation.  The engineers were very productive and courteous.  I learned about the  necessities of engineers working on a power plant.  As a Administrative Assistant was in charge of answering phone calls from the contacts for the engineers.  I was in charge of making copies of blue prints of the plant.  I also, prepare the room for conference meetings, i.e., ordering lunch, setting up conference telephone, setting out the handouts, beverages and etc."
good,"Working at my job typical day starts at 4a.m. and get off at 4p.m.  I have learned about cogeneration working out here.  Working with gas turbines and steam turbines and all there inner workings producing electricity.  The management out here is not interested in fixing anything until it breaks.  Other guys that work out here dont want to retire so there is no room for advancement anytime soon.  There really is nothing hard about this job, its very laid back.  The most enjoyable part of my job is producing the electricity to be put onto the grid.  The company does take very good care of us feed us lunch once a week, always giving us gifts."
good,Great company to work for. Overtime is included and often expected.
good,Working in the geothermal industry is challenging and rewarding as no two days will be alike. I started at an entry level position and worked my way up to a journeyman mechanic. We had some great management teams. The job was physically and mentally challenging but it was always fun working with skilled team members.
good,Decent company. My only concern are the layoff issues. You just never know when you're the next one to be... Other than that the culture is great and pay is as well.

good,"Everyone at work is super friendly and always have a smile on their face. They taught me a lot about expenses and I have developed a ton of new connections. The hardest part of the job is opening up to everyone especially if you arent a talkative person. The easiest part of the job is the work given. Most of the work is self-explanatory, but some of it may require some help but everyone is willing to help if they know how."

I began as a outside operator and in no time worked my way up to a control room operator.  I consider myself to be a fast learner with little or no supervision.
