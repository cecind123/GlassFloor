good,A typical weekday consist of me putting together the frosty machines and setting up front line and stocking drive through for breakfast. Then when we transition into lunch the pace start to pick up so I am in the back window as order taker. I have learned that time management is key. My co-workers are awsome I can't complain. The hardest part about the job is multitasking alot of the time people don't come to work so we are picking up slack. The most enjoyable part about the job is that on the weekends its a little laid back.
good,I worked well with others and ran my shifts with no problems. Like working as the night manager. I help clean make hamburgs. at closing time did the paper work.
good,"I enjoyed the front line customer service. I had learned how to use the cash register and how to deal with an unsatisfied customer. I felt at the time that Management was not very supportive, I used to feel sorry for the young co-workers that I use to work with. I felt there was no team work amongst our crew workers."
good,ever since last year they have cut back on overtime and will not give raises.
good,"i would come in and wash my hands. i would clock in, say hi to everybody! i would count my til in then i would service the customers by takin their order and handin them their food and drink! At the end of the day i would count my til in them clean the resturaunt for tomorrow mopping,dishes,grills.frosty machines,salad bar ect. i learnedd alot from wendys they taught me most of what i know. my co -worker were great except for a few. the hardest part was going into the fridge all the time i think and having moring sickness! i love going to work for them they were great i really cant complain"
good,Wendys was a good work enviroment the food and service was always good. Some of the management were easier to get along with compared to others
good,I go to work ready to get the job done. Always willing to help others and make sure the customers are satisfied with their service.
good,On a regular basis an the sandwiich maker at work. I work with a friendly crew and we work really hard. We are bust between 11am and 2pm than again between 5pm and 8pm. The only issue it that we frequently get people that call off alot. I enjoy working there but I want to persue more to have a better future.
good,good company.
good,Wendys is a very good company to work for if your in school. It doesnt offer good pay and benfits for a family life.
good,"Its the same thing everyday, although the things I do are ones I somewhat enjoy-which I lucked out with. Overall, things go alright unless the crew works against each other or management makes it a high-stress atmosphere."
good,Working for this company was pretty cool. It was my first job while I was in high school. The management as well as the co workers were pretty friendly and would help you out whenever you needed. The pay was that great but I was only 16.
good,Pay and benefits were good. However you worked very long hours. Sometimes up to 60 a week. And it always seemed like you were taking work home to do. Not enough time in the day to get everything done.
good,"A typical day at work varies on the business we get, whether we're slow or busy"
good,Assisting customers with their orders. How to interact with an arrange of customers. Management lack a bond with their teams. Co-workers are willing to help each other. Hardest part of the job was the dinner time rush. Most enjoyable part of the job was the environment.
good,Wendy's is a very nice place to work to. Everyday is a busy day. I learned that you have to be fast to be able to finish a order especially in a busy time. The management is okay. Co workers are not too friendly. The hardest part of the job is when there's only two/three of you in the store and it becomes busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see customers satisfied in what they are eating.
good,Learned supervisory skills and how to manage a crew in fast food.
good,"strict management, but always kept you busy, never a dull day at Wendy's!"
good,A friendly first time job with many responsibilities.
good,I took on this opportunity with Wendy's because they had a new focus they wanted to revamp there stores and try to make it to the #1 spot in fast food. I felt I could learn and also share my knowledge with the company and help them strive for success. I have enjoyed the face to face contact and hearing customer reviews first hand on how to Improve. The Hardest part of the job is keeping Employees and maintaing a good work schedule and balance with work and home.
good,"Typical day was unhappy people, managers that didn't do anything except stay at the window. The co-workers never helped each other out and some took forever to do specific jobs. The hardest part of the job was being the only sandwich maker at night, then you would have to do the front sandwiches and back."
good,"Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The experience was made by the people there, and they were what made it enjoyable. Four and a half years of working there gave me plenty of experience handling cash and helping guests with orders. Unfortunately, the pace was a bit much for me, but not enough for it to ruin the experience. Would certainly work there again if needed."
good,"never worked day shift which was my ultimate goal, always had me closing the same thing even tho i could work all positions, management was great, and co workers were friendly, the hardest part about the job was being short handed and being slammed, the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers"
good,"The manager's were nice, and had a knack for employing great employees. For as much as people work in fast food, I feel they should be paid more. Work was fast, we were always busy. I cooked, ran the register, bagged oders, prepped food, there was always something to do."
good,co worker were great to work with.really no hard parts of the job.learned to have a great work ethic.
good,I did like working there but i worked very hard and i went from 8 dollars to 9 in 3 years i never got the respect and appreciation i deserved
good,"overall good job. learned a lot there, like how to treat people nicely."
good,The work and the enviroment are pretty relaxed. The managers are caring and fun and the workers are easy to get along with. I learned to interact with customers and to treat them the way that I want to be treated.
good,"My day started at 8:00am an it would end at 2:00pm. I would come in an prepare to make all of the salads for the day. I also cooked on the grill, made sandwiches, an run the register in drive-thru an in the front of the store as well. I learned how to make all kinds of food an also how to store them and how long they would last as well. I loved my managers. They are very understanding people. My co-workers where great as well, we all worked as a team to get the job done. Nothing was hard about my job. The most enjoyable part about the job I was doing was making the customers happy."
good,Oppritunities for raises and advancements and little to none and only for years of work. Management is mostly great working with people who know their positions and who are hard workers. The job is not difficult as long as you can deal with the repetition and he detail ore-anted work
good,Only a hard working and determined individual can survive working at wendys. Its fast paced and demand individual work are willing and able to keep up with the pace. Customers can be difficult at time but as a good employee its is your job to help them out and assist with any of their question or demand because the main goal about working at wendys is customers satifaction. Wendys is a fun and diverse environment the employees and mangement team is great and them all work and assist each other.
good,"wendys had many great aspects to it, good managers flexible schedules. i was able to learn alot there."
good,"Great co-workers, monotonous day-to-day tasks, bad office politics"
good,"A typical day is rather steady. Some customer are angry and some understand that we, as in the people serving them, are human too."
good,Fast paced can be stressful at time management can vary in strengths and weeknesses.
good,"A typical day at work would be severing over 300 to 400 customer thru are drive thru or in are dining room, greeting very customer5 that walks through are door with a smile and serving nothing but quality food,at the same time having fun with are co-workers, well watching the sale, are labor, and are cleanliness. At the end of the shift we let are crew members know that they did a wonderful job to day and let them know the the areas on improvement."
good,fast paced job at times but the people are great. the food is good and we try our best to please.
good,This is a good place to start your 1st job . I really enjoyed myself there. I was a cashier and made a good amount to be one.
good,"A typical work day was work with customers, clean and do my job and help out the team. I learned that some people just don't want to work and that you need to treat customers the way you would wish to be treated if you were to go to my work. I enjoyed some co-workers but there was a lot of childish things that would happen such as people breaking items and other people being angry at the other person so they would go break something. Managers would talk down about each other in front of and too employees which set a horrible example for other employees. Hardest part of the job was not the actual job itself it was the poor management skills. What I enjoyed most out of my job was the learning experience."
good,if not busy you were sent home for the day buisness usually picked up by lunch
good,"taking orders and making sandwiches, learned to make salads, my co workers are ok to work with and the hardest part of the job is when its time to close and there is still customers in the drive thru, the most enjoyable part of the job is incentives"
good,It Helped pay the bills. Its a great JOB but not a CAREER. Ideal for high school students or part time collage students
good,I liked being able to do different tasks throughout the day. Management was very personable and approachable. Myself and my co-workers always pulled together as a team.
good,Co-workers were fun to work with but the management could be a little bit better with the employees.
good,Very physical job. Long hours as management. Hard to schedule any time off for family or illness.
good,Typical day would be cahiering and serving customers in a timley matter. The hardest part of my job was not pleasing every customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.
good,"During my time there I had various different jobs from running the register, to ordering trucks, labor management, inventory, etc..."
good,"The work is repetitive and always on the move. I have learned to manage my time to be able to finish my duties before my shift ends. I don't like being punched out automatically. My co-workers are great, we help each other. The hardest part of the job is closing. Too much too do but too little time. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving people and seeing satisfaction in their eyes when they leave."
good,"When I worked at Wendys for the first few months working there it was great, everyone treated you good, and made you feel like you were at home, I learned a lot about good costumer service at Wendys. The management team at Wendys was not the greatest, further into my work period it became hard to work with some of the employees and managers. There was a lot of drama created in the work environment and was tough to focus on my job. The hardest part of working at Wendys was having to deal with the drama and inconsiderate people everyday. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendys was probably being able to satisfy my costumers and being able to put a smile on their face every day."
good,i deal with the pubilc and sometimes it can be very hard to do.but when get those people who take the time to than you for the job that you do that its makes the day better
good,I enjoyed working for Wendy's. The managers treated employees with the respect we deserved. Worked around student schedules and gave employees the opportunity to move up the ladder if they wanted to. The pay was minimum wage but the hours were more than satisfactory. For someone who's fresh out of High School or needs a second job I would definitely recommend applying at Wendy's.
good,"Wendy's is a job with no benefits, they move up the wrong people. They dont care about their employments."
good,"Worked with different cultures, greeted customers, took orders, cleaned dining area, money handling/operated cash register, and trained in different work areas as a cook."
good,"Na minha opniao , trabalhar para wendys foi um experience ok, dei o meu suor e nao fui apreciado por nem uim dos gerente de area 256 operating assoates from nashua-nh."
good,Great for a first time job. a big eye opener for how tough it is to be a part of the work force is feeding the work force and rush hour. I loved working for Wendy's. If you can keep up and your fast on your feet and up for a challenge its a great place to work. and a great place to eat.
good,"enjoyed the work as met so many people,learnt a lot more as well."
good,"With such a tight-knit area of work it is difficult to be everyone's friend. There will be good days and bad, depending on your team. But overall, Wendy's is an enjoying place to work. If it weren't for minimum wages one could happily work for a company such as this for the rest of their life."
good,You must be a hard worker and work very fast to work at any fast food.
good,The co-workers are wonderful. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet new people everyday.
good,"This is a fast food job so there is always something to do and never a dull moment. I learned that it is good to rush things but you must also keep the quality of the product. The hardest part was dealing with customers whose orders where incorrect. However, the enjoyable part is knowing that you fixed their problem and accommodated them as best as possible."
good,"It is fun place to work and atmosphere, it is a fast paced environment with quality customer skills. Exiting and challenging at the same time especially when you are a new employee."
good,no one gets along with each other their. no one their is motivated.
good,"I really had an learning experience,many great people I've met. The stress level is not as high as other stores but can get very busy . Its an high volume store. The General Manager is a team player very knowlegable of the store and is great in helping others."
good,"i have worked here for five years and for the most part i love it, good enviorment , fun people, & flexible schedual."
good,I enjoyed my experience at this company because it allowed me to get to know how to service the public and learn how to deal with tough crowds in a fast paced motion.
good,Worked alot of hours and gave 130 percent and only got drilled for the smallest things. I still make the best out of any situation and saw right through the greedyness and made it a better place to work
good,"Productive workplace at times, but poor management. Pay was good and the team members were great. However, as I previously stated, poor management. Would love t see improvement"
good,"endy's has some of the healthiest choices of any fast-food restaurant I know. And, to the best of my knowledge, they give a military discount which none of the others do...This makes for an even greater value. Burgers are top-notch for fast food and salads are wonderful....like the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad with cran- berries...especially for health conscious individuals."
good,"Everybody treated me bad I didn't like it"
good,I arrived at work and immediately started dishes. I learned to work hard and more efficiently. Management was alright. Hardest part of the job was making time to work. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people
good,Wendy’s help me get money for the rent I needed to pay and it helped with my customer services and I had a better time with people and I have a blast with the customers.
good,They paid good the work wasn't that difficult but I had things come up in my life that I had to stop working there and take a break from working for a while and now i'm looking for a new job to start making a steady income so when I become an adult I will have the money to pay for the things I want and need.
good,The managers help me succeed and all but the job culture is not too great. Also the management isn’t so consistent with scheduling so the hours there are hard to come by when scheduling changes
good,"It was a great place to flip burgers. I saved so much and I brought a nice car. I still have my toyota today. Great experience, and great working environment"
good,"Good first job! Nice people!"
good,The company was a great place to work for I just had wish they had gave more hours and paid more I couldn’t make a living off 7.25 and hour. The employees their was very nice
good,"Wendy’s cashier performs a multitude of job duties. Key responsibilities include greeting customers, submitting orders, and operating the cash register and Wendy’s cashiers perform food preparation and drive-thru duties."
good,"Typical fast food job. High stress environment with either high-schoolers trying to make a quick buck to buy the new 'Call of Duty,' or ex-inmates working to try and get back on their feet. All the employees were good people and we had a good bond during my time working here."
good,It is a good place to work for many individuals giving many of us a place to earn an income. Many individuals can work for the company and grow both positionally as well as financially.
good,It’s a good place to work just need more hours and a better environment some employees were not to friendly and most of the managers as well but the hours they do work with you on.
good,Work drive through window make sandwiches and prep for all shif just a starter job when first moved to Tennessee wonderful place to meet people and learn how to cook.
good,Wendy’s was an okay place to work but I definitely would not go back. The environment was kind of toxic and there was a lot of drama in the work place which was tiring.
good,"Wendys is a good place to work at when its going to be your first job but its not  defenitly not a job you want to stay at for years. The Wendys I work at is not diverse at all, some employees there are not professional at all. Some of them talk about the other employees or bring there personal life to work. I am currently out of high school and decided to get a job at Wendys but I highly recommend not to get a job at fast food after high school."
good,Was really easy to learn and lots of different things to do. Gained a lot of experiences in stressful situations. Have to work in a coordinated group to complete task on a daily bases
good,"Working as a supervisor at wendys was OK, you do learn ALOT as far as customer service and management. I do feel like management could of been a little better, and maybe more organized. Dealing with customers was a whole lot of work, they can get very nasty."
good,Great hours great people flexible schedule. So all in all it's a pretty fair job everyone is nice and friendly no drama smooth sailing they help you when you need help
good,I felt miserable every day. They treat their employees like they’re slaves. They treat you like you have to be uptight and strict all the time and no fun.
good,"I loved working at wendy, although I lived in Florida minimum wage suck I was only get paid $8.50 an hour. They were very flexible with me and the hours as I have kids. But overall it was great working there."
good,Wendy’s can be okay if you work with the right people but the Wendy’s that I work at can be very harsh. If we don’t have enough people working a shift it can be frustrating.
good,"Good job at times,it does depend on management at specific location. There are many different things that are necessary to get the job done properly but overall not a very difficult job."
good,well i guess there all the same yes in riverside ca us we went through the same ever where good food but bad management will never work there again the job wasnt bad i loved the fast pase and there are some times that i had to closed with just me and a maniger or i worked 15 hour shifts but yeah it wasnt that bad
good,"The job is very fast paced. You must be prepared to handle upset customers, always be on your feet, and work as a team. Communication is key at this job."
good,"It was a good job it was a bit of a hard drive but I enjoyed the work. Even in slow times, the day didn't drag along. It was nice to have a place to be in earn money"
good,Wendys was a very fast job. Fast food jobs aren't typically what I care for working. It was just one of those jobs were you have to do what you have to do.
good,"Work was simple and not too difficult, depending on who you work with is the biggest factor on how much you will enjoy/dislike the job. Customers can be rude."
good,ok job be your first job or if your retired and just want something to do the mangers were pretty cool even though it was shut down and turn into a viatmese resturant
good,"Job is very interesting, working with customers all day can get stressful so you have to be positive and always happy. As your attitude affects all of the other workers."
good,"I loved the customer service, and enjoyed greeting the people and even for a brief second. However their wasn’t a lot of diversity and the pay wasn’t what I was looking for."
good,Working at wendy's was pretty straight forward nothing really hard. I got out of the job what i put into the job. Nothing more Nothing less just had to do my job.
good,"Typical day at work was easy going on the morning shifts, then as the day went on it eventually started to become more busy so the pace was always sped up in the middle of the day and by night everything calmed down, maybe a couple customers every 10 minutes."
good,Most days working here at Wendy's was a struggle in the beginning but The manager's take extra time and effect to make you feel as home. I would recommend Wendy's for a first time job if asked.
good,At Wendy’s the manager would belittle us.  It was more important to give out orders on time then a a works situation. The work was to much for a teenager to handle. They would over work us and only pay us 9.75.
good,I feel working as a cashier for this company is more so for a high school student. It was pretty fun but not enough hours or money for me to live off of
good,"Job pay is low about $9.00 for doing a lot of work, but what do you expect for fast food jobs. The management is good to work with, friendly overall.."
good,When i first started working at Wendy’s it felt amazing. I was really exited to work there. But the longer i stayed it became exhausting. People did a “no call a no show “ and the management didn’t call nobody else in so we had to work short staffed.
good,This is a good place to work at. Good job to work at and good paying job for a person still in school. It can be a fun environment to be around but mostly not.
good,Wendy’s is an overall good company I worked with a lot of my friends so I felt right at home working there and I also had fun while working there to be able to meet a lot of nice people
good,I learned almost everything I know now about customer services from my boss she was always hard on me but I know now is because she saw potential in me.
good,"Ok to work at, offers flexibility with your hours. Can move up very quickly especially if you take your job seriously and show up on time. Starting pay decent  doesn’t offer raises often and not much when do."
good,"Very fast paced work, lots of smiling faces. You'll be working with people lots of them some aren't the nicest but that's any job working with people."
good,I Was a manager at Wendy's for a little under two years and it was hands down the most stressful and underappreciated jobs I've ever had in my life. I would not recommend employment there.
good,The crew at Wendy's is great but is more focused on friendship based not more on business per say with me I'm about work and nothing but work friendships are for outside of work
good,"Wendys is definitely a company where its best to work in order to gain experience. It's a fast paced food service with plenty of customer service, face to face as well as through the phone or intercom."
good,"Wendys was a good first job, tasks were easy, management was average, and I got discounted food and worked with young people. Definitely don't advise people to stay there long term."
good,"As a team member I place orders from drive thru, and help bag up their food items and hand them out the window to the paying customers. I also take orders on the front counter for the customers, help bag up their food items and give food items to the customer. As a front counter cashier i also make sure the dinning room is cleaned and make sure trash is empty."
good,"Speed and accuracy for taking and delivering orders. "
good,A typical work day you would come in and bring your things to the back and if your working the grill you go to the back grab some meat and put it on the grill
good,This is a good starter job for a teenager or someone just getting into the workforce. You can get manager quickly with hard work and get more hours over others.
good,This company was great t work with but their unfairness was why I had to leave they don’t work with even if you dying but the pay was good and the environment was great
good,"I worked here during high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the fast paced work environment. There were times it was rough, but it was a very decent learning time as a teen in school."
good,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. The pay is horrible, depending on if it's a franchise or corporate - usually corporate offers raises several times a year. If it's a franchise it's probably not worth it. The franchise that took over my store before I quit only raised the shift manager pay by 50 cents when minimum wage went up to $12."
good,I’d say it was enjoyable but also complicated due to factors from the workplace. I would do it again but probably in a better environment or headspace.
good,"Great company, I would go back if the right opportunity presented it self. Career advancement is great though. I wish anyone the best who can put up with customer issues."
good,good learning experience.  This was a good first time job. I would recommend this to someone with more experience as the management struggled  and this could be felt by the team members.
good,Everything has its ups and downs it's just like any regular place to work nothing to fancy..................not very hard place to work at all........
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work and less stress and nice managers and"
good,"Good people to work with, excellent job conditions, the best food to eat, always great with the customers. Bad at teaching what needs to be taught. Oh well."
good,I believe that working here will give you great hours if you are just trying to save.  Management was not the best but payday was amazing with the right overtime.
good,"Under paid for the tedious things that are required. 50 hour work week but not guaranteed hours. Great teamwork, fun environment. Bonuses were a plus!"
good,"Good work environment in the beginning, and then we got a bunch of high schoolers which later sucked. I t was a nice environment to work at. It helped me better my speech with strangers."
good,"For the state I lived in and the living and getting paid 7.25 and only receiving 15 hour or 20 hours, it's was a funny job but wasn't for me. So I had to let it go"
good,This is a fast food restaurant and it is pretty straight forward. You do what you see people doing while they work here. Super easy fast paced and can be fun.
good,When i worked at Wendy i delt with it because i had bills to pay but i had some good days but mainly bad days. I probably will not go back to the work enviroment.
good,"I liked working at Wendy’s , but the manager was annoying and always making it hard for you to concentrate because she’s always yelling , and nagging about the small things"
good,"This was a good experience for my first real job. I start off as cashier, then move on to get to cook fries and other food items. You assemble the food and distribute to customers. It's all about coordination and not getting orders mixed up. The people were friendly, some customers are strange. But that's expected at Wendy's lol. You would also do the expected duties of cleaning and organizing and stocking up on some food in the pantry."
good,"It was too much drama the employees wasn't helpful at all or the mangers  , My first day I basically had to figure out what i need to do without any help"
good,"Wendy's was the first promo company i worked for, i enjoyed working there even though i feel like some supervisors didn't see the efforts i took n my hard work. But it was a great experience."
good,"Willingness to work weekends, evenings and holidays as required"
good,"Management is somewhat disrespectful,  not all, but definitely a few select individuals. However good hours, decent pay, pretty fast paced. Usually good to get loads of hours so you can make a good amount per week."
good,"It is a good place to learn communication skills, how to work as a member of a team, and developing a strong work ethic. Its not something anyone particularly ever wants to do, but something that can humble you, allow you learn many life skills, and make you appreciative of other future opportunities."
good,It was an ok experience. Sometimes professional atmosphere. Downtime. Sometimes not enough work than what I am used too. Sometimes encouraging. sometimes not.
good,During rush hour it is necessary to be efficient in taking and receiving orders as well as providing a sense of ease towards the consumers. A clean work environment is as necessary of a task as keeping the costumer happy and satiated.
good,A typical day you're continuously busy catering to the customers need but there is a high turnaround I believe is because of employee compensation and appreciation.
good,"At this Job, I did literally everything but make the Sandwiches for the public. My fellow Employees and my Management really helped me out and care about each other as well as the Customer, because with this Job that's who you work for."
good,The people are fun to work with but you have to learn to keep your cool when it comes to the customers because they can be trying at times. Just do your job and keep the drama at home and everything will be peachy
good,"a normal work day would be to make sure the store is clean, make sure the food is cooked well, make sure we are proud of what we serve the customer and that they are happy with what they are receiving"
good,"Every second in the kitchen, management was under control and the workers all completed their weekly tasks. There were times when things were 'too busy', but things such as breaks ever prevented someone from over working."
good,As a part-time employee this was a job that allowed me to manage my school workload while earning money to contribute to my family income. The company did offer some training but little opportunity for advancement.
good,"This place is for people who wants to learn how to multi-task and communicate. I recommend you start here because when you apply other job, other workers would do the same process as them reaching there beyond goals so are you."
good,Average not the best Management. Could have more detailed training. Some of the managers are very unprofessional as well as employees. Nothing else to say.
good,"The manager had OCD and you could never do your job right in his eyes. Even if we were missing staff he still expected all the tasks to be done, no excuses. Very stressful to work there."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wendy's but they did not pay enough..I showed up to work everyday and was on time..the job was fast passed which I enjoy..I am eager to learn new things..
good,"Good job for teenagers. "
good,Being a staff member at Wendy’s was a great learning experience and thought me a lot about the fast food industry and working with other. Working with people and speaking with costumers helped improve my people skills and thought me lots about self regulation.
good,Work days were usually busy.  Learned a lot appropriate  customer service.  Learned about management of fast food facility and serving individuals with a smile.
good,worst place to work ever. the benefits and the pay are terrible... i would not reccomend working here. the only good thing about working here was the food.
good,"I've been with the brand for many years and learned a lot. I enjoyed meeting new customers, making them happy.  working and training the employees was also enjoyable."
good,Had fun while it lasted but it wasn't paying much. Customers had lots of complaints but the crew members did their best to make them happy. Mangers did more too help out their employees figure out tough situations
good,"Very very bad I didn’t like it . I’ll prefer to work at five and below or at a movie theater or something , Wendy’s is bad and something I’ll never want to work at"
good,I learned different ways to communicate with others while working together. I also learned how to maintain a clean food eating environment also providing good quality food and maintain good speed level to keep customers happy.
good,"Wendy’s Is a fast paced fast food chain who’s priority is the customer and taking care of the employees that work there. Wendy’s is striving to be America’s number 1 fast food company where customers will experience top notch service in a fast , friendly, and clean environment."
good,"Wendys is a great place to work as a first job because it is a relaxed environment with a lot of opportunities to learn. Although this is true, it is hard to advance to management positions and to receive proper raises. The schedule can sometimes be difficult to manage because of the lack of employees."
good,"easy going place to work at"
good,I love the people and the company I enjoy working with good people the food was good counsom was nice the store was clean i meet new people i learn how to do new things
good,"Not the cleanest place to work."
good,"You will learn a lot from the training that they have, they are very detailed. And the training will continue right through. It’s very hands on I love it"
good,It was a great place to work at everyone wast happy there the GM had her days but otherwise it was fun working there. The schedule was great other then you can’t have holidays off if requested off and no paid vacation days.
good,Unorganized poor pay can’t really say anything else as much as it was the worst job I had in my life and all everyone do is argue with each other and with the customers.
good,But overall it was a nice place to work in for the experience....i got along qith mostly everyone one of my coworkers. They treated me like we were a team or family
good,The workplace is pretty nice and organized i learned a lot about time management and the customer service  . The hardest part of the job is when we are short staffed and get huge rushes
good,Wendy's wasn't a bad company just the ppl that work there. Otherwise it's a good place to work. Kinda family friendly and good pay. And they give medical benefit.
good,"The managers were really nice, although for my first job, they didn’t teach very well, it was more learn as you go, but I loved working with the people there and the rushes were manageable"
good,Wendy's dedicates their name with not only creating jobs but training people so that they have different job skills. They place you in different areas on a daily basic. You will learn how to do just about everything at Wendy's
good,It was very bed experience for me all wage short crew every single shift have same problems it's understandable if some shift short but it's not so I don't want to recommend any body
good,Working at Wendy’s for me wasn’t very pleasant. I felt I wasn’t paid very fairly for how much I worked. I also didn’t get the hours I wanted and things were very confusing for me
good,"Your always on your toes at Wendy's and serving customers around the clock. A great starter job for those you need the work experience, or just a foot in the door to find a trade job."
good,"Good environment and place to work. Everyone works hard and pull their weight to meet goals. Clean, safe and productive environment. I would recommend this job to a friend.  The biggest con is the low pages."
good,"The experience was good, It just isn't enough pay.overall I would not be working in fast food anymore. The food is good. ........................................."
good,If you like to work with food at a fast pace this is for you. I worked with a bunch of great people and my boss was fair. I personally do not like to work with food.
good,The job at Wendys was okay. Not the best and not the worst. The store manager is now gone so I am sure its running better but the women I worked with was not fit for the job
good,I'm a great worker I like to move around communicate with others work in a good environment. Wendy's was pretty cool it was some bad days but it got Bette.
good,"Very busy place, can be stressful. The drive thrus were always hectic, and customers were rude. The management tried their best and succeeded at most. However, the lack of organization sometimes overwhelmed us all."
good,Decent job. However pay is lacking and flexibility with hours is very poor. There is room to move up if you work hard. The higher management seems disorganized.
good,Its just fine for first timers and those with few options. So if you like smelling like hamburgers and rude customers and inexperienced staff this place is for you
good,"A typical day at work would be going in clocking in and either I'm making orders , frying fries and nuggets or I'm on the register . Around 12:00 I'm cleaning my station and restocking everything that needs to be stock ."
good,"My short time working at this place, I found managers were always very unorganized. As an employee i never felt appreciated and that is why i left because, they didn't recognize my hard work."
good,The company has a habit of making issues seem like they dont exist. They fire people over stupid stuff and only train for a short while. Some managers are cruel and dont care about anyone unless it effect their plans.
good,"Wendy’s was a good environment to work in. Co-workers of Wendy’s are a teamwork motivated employees. I learned how to work hard, get things done at work in a orderly fashion."
good,Actually Don’t have very much to really say about this job other then it’ll be your last choice if you didn’t have any other options that job wasn’t something u wanted to work long term
good,all my managers i really liked left so I wasn't too keen on trying to keep working there. I was pushed out after the highers ups decided to try working with us and I just couldn't handle them doing all that.
good,"Depending on the day, the night shift can be slow or extremely busy.  For the most part they work with your scheduling and can accommodate any changes within given days."
good,I really like working with the crew and the coustmar when u work somewhere u like it ant even like u r at work it is just another home and family with the worker and the coustmar
good,"The workload itself was fair, but management was really bad, as you would quickly take the fall for things which you had no control over, and most managers were always yelling."
good,Loved my job at Wendy's hoping to ethier get rehired at same store or a different store . Management are very fair . And the fast pace flow made the days go faster .
good,This job was good at first but after the first few months it just really got bad. So in conclusion this isn't a long term job so don't work there if you're looking for a long term job.
good,The Wendy's I worked at was the best Wendy's I had seen. Still not a great job but it was money to live by. the people I worked with made my job easier most days because it was easy to communicate and my boss and I got along and could joke around.
good,"lots of movement, being around hot food and serving it to customers, trying to get customers orders out on time at fast consistent rate always make sure to dress appropriately"
good,Working at Wendy’s is not bad as they make it seem it’s fairly easy just gotta stay on top of your job assignment .. The Managers Teach You Step By Step On what to do and instruct u
good,Choose another company with a stronger people plan. Some people are really nice and just want to assist with your growth. Unfortunately it's not the people who can take you to the next level. Noone wants to take ownership of training.
good,Wendys is a okay if your in high school . It is great foe your first job experience. It teachers you how to be in a work environment and it teaches you the basics of having a job.
good,A typical work day considered people calling out and everything was left up t o you. Always had inspections and everything always had to be tip-top shape.
good,The amount of pay does not equal to the cost of living plus poor management. Some days can be extra stressful. A lot of petty and childish people working there. The most enjoyable part of the job is opening the store.
good,It was a great company to work for. I learned a lot as well as it helped me to be a great manager. If I could do it all over again I probably would just at a different store
good,"The way the store was organized, it was messy. The management only had a handful of good people and was mostly everyone else talking about one another behind their back. It may as well be that it was diverse and were always short on people that caught everyone on the edge, and also stressed."
good,"I didnt like it, the managers were very unprofessional and didnt care anout anything. All thwy did was sit in the office especially while its busy...."
good,"you will lern how to cook all the food, clean the dishes, use the register and the menu. there will be times when it is very busy and late, but the co-workers and managers keep it fast paced"
good,You have no set position. You don’t get off at the time they say you do. They are somewhat unprofessional. The customers can be very rude when it comes to anything.
good,It was okay only because yes you had crew members and managers that wasn't so nice and a lot that didn't do they work at all. It was very stressful but not everyone was like that there are some good people there.
good,"Good place to work if you love the fast food industry and love meeting new people, teaches you patience and a lot of life lessons that are good to know"
good,Se Trabajo Regular y sin posibilidades de ascender
good,it was my first job in high school and i enjoyed my time it was quite the learning experance. i quit for personal reasons but i wouldnt mind working there again. for a fast food job it wasn't half bad.
good,"Was fast paced and you didn't get paid enough for what you have to put up with. Mangement was rude for no reason, drama between employees, and wasn't managed in the right way"
good,I would show up for work and find out where I was assigned that day and head to my area and complete the daily tasks for that area. I've learned alot of different things over time but the main thing I learned is how to not let a stress affect my work. I got along with everyone I worked with.
good,"When I was working at Wendy’s, I did not like it because I was always worn out and I feel like when I can to work I would be doing everybody’s job. Also I ya d aanoying managers"
good,"Muy could treat their employees with more respect, other then that a good company to work for. Muy recently bought Wendys and is still learning how to run it."
good,wendys is not a bad place for a part time job and the only reason i don't  recommend it other than part time is because you are working with food all day and if you are around the fryers you feel really gross even after a short shift
good,I was able to keep a smile and keep doing my work avoiding any type of rude or negative comments made .
good,"I don't particularly want to review this company as i was a teenager  when i worked here and i wasn't mature enough to understand the situation, so i refuse to give a biased review"
good,My job at Wendy’s was to help all customers weather it be a question or to take their order. I also help with food prep and making sandwiches for the guests as well.
good,"Usually I enjoy my shifts at wendys but, i get paid $13.15/hour to put up with rude customers along with working with lazy crew members who don’t help when it’s needed. It’s a good first job but very intense"
good,"I opened the story for service, made sure all supplies were in place, cash drops and change exchange at bank, managed a crew of 10 employees, learned a lot of food safety"
good,"It was fun working here, many people to talk to/interact with. Everything was good until a supervisor got hired and she acted like she was better than everybody else."
good,"I feel that my time at Wendy's has allowed me to develop more team-centered skills as well as help improve my own communication skills. The work at times could be very fast depending on the time of day or year, but in all, work was good."
good,My experience as a manager at the Wendy’s I worked at was poor just because of the district manager he was a but hole I didn’t get what he said I was going to make
good,"The Wendy’s I worked at was great for a couple of weeks then it wasn’t a great experience at all, I just wouldn't want to work there again with the same people. I don’t want to be treated badly for doing better than others."
good,"Almost impossible to satisfy upper management. Work very hard, but are hardly rewarded. Love the customers and fast paced environment. Enjoyed the schedule."
good,Wendy's wasn't too bad but wasn't too great either. It was EXTREMELY hot due to the fact the A/C went out and I basically left because of that. It was hotter inside than it was outside during the summer.
good,Working at Wendy's was my first job. Wendy's helped start and shape my work ethic. It was stressful at time and very rewarding at times. Enjoyed my staff members.
good,The job was what one would expect when working at a fast food place. I did the drive thru and cashier. I didn't mind that part of the job. Also I cleaned up at night which I didn't like too much. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.
good,Easy and relaxed job although for a part-time position they could work a little more harder on people that go to school but would still need enough hours where its working perfect for their schedule.
good,"I worked my but off for months learning everything about how to run a store and even though it was supposed to come with the training I did not get the raise I was promised, and after everything was forced to work 50+ hours a week because I was the only person who was aloud to get overtime due to being the only hourly paid manager."
good,It was my first job it was cool and i mostly worked the fry station. I eventually moved up in the workplace and was working all stations. It was fun. The people were fun to be around and the customers were interesting to say the least. The managers did their job well and so did the supervisors.
good,I don't care to work for this company again but they do have great benefits. they are flexible with scheduling but depending on what store your at management is cool.
good,"It’s a good place to work, not everything is the best. It’s like having another family. You get to know people and meet a lot of people so it is very good."
good,"A great first job to learn about customer service. The job is very easy to learn, but difficult to move up into management. Also, difficult to gain raises."
good,Workplace was fun but very demanding. Employers and managers would often get into verbal altercations. Employees would often quit to then be re-hired.
good,"I didn't really like working there. However, for my first official job they were pretty flexible with my schedule and gave me the opportunity to have positive interactions."
good,The company itself is okay. The store I worked at was stressful and over worked their employees. Always under staffed and minimal training efforts were exhausted
good,It was a good company to work for but it just didn’t work out long because I was moving out of Wilson so I had to let the job go but while I was there I loved the work atmosphere
good,Working at this particular location started out great. Management changed a few times. Each time getting worse on the managerial level. Being a manager meant being the fall guy for the GM.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty simple. As long as we were set up for success the day ran pretty smooth. It takes a hands on supervisor to get team motivated and excited to do their best at their job. Being one of few who actually made an effort it made the job that much more stressful. Even after promotion, the work that fell back on me wasnt worth the pay. Knew my skills would be better appreciated elsewhere"
good,Good company to work for in fast food. They treat their employees well. Great work environment. Great first job to get started with. Great after school job.
good,"I really enjoyed their motto, which goes the customer is always right. I always took pride in customer service and everything that was assigned to,weather that be preparing food or cleanliness of the business."
good,Its good cool an calm people great people to be around nice working place good drinks great food fast working rtujjfyh ok jhdtyhvhkitdhi on bffuijgd th jgfy
good,It's not for me. I need a better job. That pays more. It's a nice place to work. I just need something else better than this. I have a son to take care of.
good,Wendy's had provided me with alot of people skills also learned how to control the bottom line in the restaurant business I have very high standards I have learned hiring practices ordering msintances profit and loss issues and how to solve them
good,"It's an alright place to work, they just want more out of you that they pay you. If the pay was better, the job would be worth it. The people that own it care more about the customers than how much negativity the employees go threw with some customers. Plus they don't reward the employees like they should."
good,"I say that because when I first started under one GM it had its days but had the employees. Now being ran by another GM the store went down hill, prime example short staffed ."
good,you have to make a lot of sacrifices ehen working at a Wendy’s. Can be a good and bad thing. Management is ok. Hours are most likely suitable. It’s an Ok job.
good,Working at Wendy's is a fast pace environment which I enjoy however sometimes others personal life tends to get involved in their work relationships which for me was not a good thing
good,"fast paced when busy but when its not busy you have spare time to replenish product in your working area. overall not a bad place to work as a teenager but harder to get hours full time but perfect for part timers. however, the customers in the area are rude and disrespectful but other then that it was decent."
good,very disorganized not enough staff and to much bullying and harassment going on behind the scenes. Improper practices and safety hazards that are over looked.
good,"It was easy at first because they make you close to everyone and they are all helpful. Later on, only a few days later it sucks. People make you do their work when they are lazy and managers don’t care and everyone curses and mess up orders and you get blamed on."
good,Wendy's is a fast pace job but fun.  Waiting on customer is fun and changeling.  The work place culture is interesting.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the employees and the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers.
good,"The hardest part about the job was the job. Its soul crushing but its a good character builder ig. I hated every single day. People came in late everyday so i had to stay over on multiple occasions, managers would be no where to be found. Everybody would do their own thing and everything was all over the place. If you can handle all of that, go for it."
good,Wendys wasnt difficult to work at i would work again.  Good atmosphere its hot in the kitchen . You did get paid bi weekly im not fan of that personally.
good,"Good entry position into the work-force or even as a student. You learn how to take orders and input them into the system so the cooks can make them. You then give the food to customers and clean up the dining area when able. Only hard part was how stressful some customers can be, but also fulfilling when you service kind regulars."
good,When I first got there I was disoriented but over time I got used to it and they became family bc their always helping me out.so when I had trouble I always had someone to talk to
good,I had Fun Working For the Company and very thankful for a chance to experience Job Such as this. The food was great the people where friendly it was a great experience.
good,"Okay company to work for. They allow high school students to work. "
good,"At first it was just a job,then the longer i stayed i began to enjoy it my co-workers became my family. My GM passed away then the acting GM made our store a nightmare."
good,"Only left because I had a better offer and the GM made very inappropriate jokes about race. Other than that it's a simple job, just having the skills to multi-task and time management make or breaks the job."
good,Good experience as a teen. I was not a fan of standing around doing nothing for a good portion of the day but it's a good starter job to learn some basic jobs skills.
good,"come in and make sure everything is stoked"
good,"Hacer producción de el local, limpiar implementos de cocina y espacios comunes."
good,Restaurant has growth for improvement General manager was a pleasure to work for she was very understanding and compassionate for her employees would work for her again in an improved atmosphere
good,"I caught on to the work fairly easy while working at Wendy’s. I was in charge of being a cashier,stocking, and dinning every day. Unfortunately I had to end my employment due to harassment."
good,There were many arguments and physical altercations involving customers and staff. Management was unprofessional and lazy. The complaints from customers fell on deaf ears.
good,"It's like everyother fast food place. The management is alright. The job is as average as it can get. You can get free frostys though, that's awesome."
good,"Overall my time at Wendy's was on okay experience as it taught me skills that will come in handy at future jobs. However, the main issue with the job is that they would overwork the staff when we were paid near minimum wage."
good,"Not everyone can handle a fast paced working environment in which multiple tasks need to be balanced. But this is a great place to start out as a first job to get more experience and learn the value of the dollar. Over all, this establishment is more for learning and pocket money rather  than making a lasting career or to support a family."
good,"Between the ever-changing hours and odd management, the workplace is mostly stress. You'll get paid, but sometimes it won't feel worth it. Late nights are the worst since the gm sometimes doesn't schedule enough people. The GM and Managers usually clash in terms of authority. The timers for drive-through add to the stress. And at times co-workers will not show up and throw order out if there aren't enough people to fill positions. So you'll have to work more than one positions. No overtime for regular staff, not very good benefits, and dealing with customers can be painful at times. In all the job should only be a part-time or temporary/"
good,It was an okay job it was just for the moment to put some money in my pockets I had resigned because of poor management and unfair treatment I was something
good,This is a job for someone in high school that wants to start earning money i wouldnt recommend for full time job it can also be a bit stressful but its fast food nothing you can really do about it
good,"The people i worked with were great, but due to the store being run poorly, and lack of competent coworkers the store was always a mess and speed of service was greatly impacted."
good,It was a okay job at it really stressful moment we’re i need time. But overall the manager and employees were fantastic to work with I really endured my time I had with them
good,"I worked there for about 2 years I believe that this is a good paying job, you go in get your work done and learn new things even when you come in and help people. I had a fairly good experience there."
good,I got to have some experience with customer services and managing money. The hard part was having to stand for eight hours a day while cleaning when we didn't have customers. The best part was making some new friends and learning how to work with others.
good,"i feel as if you are underpaid at this job for the work that you have to do. Other than that working there is not bad, employees are kind and very responsible."
good,"The floors were always slick and required special shoes. Heat was often a problem, and there was rarely a moment of reprieve. It was easy to become overwhelmed, with new instructions coming only seconds apart and from multiple sources, through the background noise of a fast food restaurant. The most enjoyable aspect was the coworkers I had, all of which were kind and considerate. Management was great, I am still friends with one of my former managers from this job. Overall, I learned that taking a job in fast food is accepting less pay for more work than other job options."
good,"Wendy’s isn’t such a bad place to work but when I got hired, I barely got any training, I barely got shown around, unfriendly manager. Overall,it’s ok"
good,One of the more decent businesses to start of working at 18 or younger. I would not recomend being there for the rest of you life but you can learn some good teambuild skills from wendys for sure.
good,Wanna learn money handling and how to hold  your tongue and think on your feet great place.  The staff you become friends quick and learn everyones work load
good,I worked on a naval base which made a lot of things more difficult than if it were somewhere else. We were constantly short staffed and super crowded with a lack of communication between managers. We also had to comply to navy requirements though never actually being in the service. A different location would be a more manageable job.
good,Working here was an ok experience overall. The employees were great and the customers were very friendly. Only down side about it was the pay was very low and the manager wasn't very pleasant to work for.
good,"Wendy's is not a bad place to work if you are a teenager or are looking for summer employment as a college student. Personally, I do not like working fast food because of how rude people are but Wendy's is not too bad of a place to work."
good,"Wendys is not as fast paced but its still productive with decent pay for the job. Advancement for wendys, specifically my location, is easy but fair. Great first job."
good,"Worked for 3 years here, had a healthy work environment for 1/2 a year. After becoming manager it wasn't uncommon for me to receive calls to come into work at 2300 because of some employee quitting or what have you. No time for myself or family."
good,Another fast paced work place. Team efforts to make the day go smoothly very things in place to make sure that you're day goes by without too much difficulty.
good,"I only worked there for about 3 months due to relocating, but for the time I was there I had very limited hours sometimes less than 10 a week, but other than that it was a great job."
good,Don’t come in too make friends. Just do your job and as told don’t get to comfortable with your schedule. Has too many young workers. Try to always be on time.
good,Wendy's can be a little over whelming. But once you get used to it you'll be fine. The hardest part about working there is the drive thru. To me there's no enjoyable part about this job but if I had to choose it will be the workers.
good,Giving faced service instead of friendly service should be their moto. I chatty friendly guest at the drive thru should not be met with disappointment because you can't hit the timer goal.
good,"At the Wendy’s franchise, you can learn a great deal of customer service skills while also learning to collaborate with team members. A great career for someone do you has little to no food/customer service experience ."
good,My experience here was very challenging. You deal with a lot of people that come in angry but you have to keep a smile on your face no matter what the situation is. My manager was very understanding in certain situations.
good,the management along with the customers just made you go insane for just minimum wage.  I don't recommend working for fast food try anything else like a grocery store.
good,My time😧😡😡😡😡😡 was not appreciateed and kept getting worse I traveled and all but need better leadership but I dealed with it and did my job and some free followed we just needed a great story manager but I guess he did his best with what he was dealt
good,it was a job for me to pay my bills but just wasn’t enough to pay everything . great people just lazy employees. good customers and patients is the key here.
good,It was a good place to work but they were understaffed so they often called me when I wasn't supposed to work and kept scheduling me more hours than I wanted.
good,The manager at this location was not professional and had issues when it came to the staff that were hired. He was making inappropriate comments to the female workers.
good,It was a fun place to work and the other people that I work were kind and entertaining. It got pretty slow sometimes and I just really wanted to sit down so if we could have a stools or something that would be awesome.
good,"I was told I was going to be promoted to a supervisor position. Then management changed, and they never gave me solid reasoning for NOT promoting me. Instead, they promoted about 5 other people, 3 of which I had to teach how to do multiple tasks."
good,it was a good first job gave lots of hours if needed but it was very stressful and very unorganized.some managers were rude and wasnt understanding some were nice and understaning
good,"Smooth interview and made it excited to work at Wendy’s, although at first it’s tough to accept a new person, they were kind of rude about training me. After you get to meet the people it becomes family. My problem was not getting enough hours after working for almost a year. The most I got was 25hrs. They also weren’t  understanding that I couldn’t work Thursday’s and weekends."
good,wouldn't recommend as a first job simply because the employees are always under some type of pressure. I would only recommend this job if you can be in a fast-paced and a good multitasker.
good,Management was new and still learning the operations side of the business. Although i was part time i was never offered stable shift and was often asked to stay over and not compensated.
good,I loved the fast paced work. I met some awesome co-workers. I worked there for almost 3 years and i learned so much within that time. It definitely showed me i like making sales and doing customer service.
good,"The managers were picky and choosy of who they let do the stuff they want.  The people who were more social usually got more training despite them being new, and the more quiet people were stuck on the same job for months. I would ask every week to be put on sandwiches/ coordinator and they would always have an excuse of why I couldn't do it. I did, however, make some good friends there and I did like the majority of my coworkers. My only problem was that the managers treated me unfairly and I think it's because I'm black and shy."
good,Nice people. This was a job for when I was young. i loved working with the people there. i just needed a better job as i have grown. so i would suggest this for a great starter job.
good,while working there it was alright some of the workers were nice but some of the others were pretty rude to everyone The managers were good with people but if the head manager didn't like one of the workers then she didn't put it on the schedule.
good,Great place to get your foot in the door as a teenager with no experience. I must say it does get old pretty fast however. My management there was amazing but the kind of work you do isn't all that great plus you deal with rudest of customers day in and day out. The upside is they work with your school schedule.
good,Basic fast food chain with basic starting wage and reasonable advancement opportunities. Decent benefits for management team members. Recommended for those looking for part time work.
good,"Go clock in during day shift start to prep for day to get started"
good,"Well, the work environment is really stressfull and alot of multi-tasking with hard labour. It gave me alot to learn but its just not a job for a long term if you want physical/mental damage to yourself that is."
good,Sometimes there at good days sometimes there’s Bae. But bad days always seem to out-weight. I feel like there isn’t any team work being played in between dayshift and night shift. Night shift have WAY MORE responsibility than day side and it’s not fair at all.
good,"I worked at one of the busiest Wendy's in the nation, on the night shift. My shift was often at the bare minimum for staffing requirements, often putting a great deal of stress into the work day. Work was very fast-paced and strenuous, although they pay was decent. Shift managers were often excellent while regional managers were sometimes less personable. This was an excellent place to begin to develop a resume by picking up customer service skills and work experience. While I wouldn't say I enjoyed the experience, it was beneficial."
good,"Wendys is a fast food place.. every fast food restaurant will always be very fast-paced, stressful, and tiring. Good for a summer job. Not a career though."
good,Overall I'd say it is a great job to start off at but not something that I would recommend as a forever job. This job teaches you a lot about having a good work ethic.
good,"this is a job that is hard. you work all the stations in Wendy's. one day its register, next its burgers, next its fries. not that flexible with hours. when it comes to high school kids the hours are a little crazy."
good,I enjoyed working there but it was unfair at the end. I learned alot there in the 3 years I worked there it gave me skills that I can take with me to another job.
good,"Working at Wendy's was a good experience all around. Working there was fun at times and also demanding at times. Wendy's is a good place to learn responsibilities, and how to manage a work place in a timely manner."
good,"This was a nice job to have but for the pay and the condition it was not. During the winter it’s a fine place but they constantly have a broken AC and a bad group of customers, so the heat can get unbareable and you can literally sweat the whole day. The managers don’t like giving breaks but will , don’t allow you to take a moment even in the sweltering heat. Sounds so bad but it’s a good place for a teen to start working but if you need more in your life to maintain your living status this isn’t it."
good,"As a cashier, I Implement health and safety guidelines, possess strong and highly efficient customer service skills, responsible for balanced cash drawer at the close of shift, accountable for shelf stocking and maintaining a clean work environment."
good,"for part time job for a student, it was a good experience. I got to learn a bit of the food industry and what goes on in the fast food process. however, the hours didn't work out for me when it came time for homework/studying"
good,Your customer service skills must be up to par. It’s a fast paced high stress environment. Must comply with uniform codes or won’t be allowed to work.
good,"As long as you have a great manager there, professional workers and the workplace set-up for fast efficiency things will run smoothly. The hardest part of the job was being on the register by myself with a huge line of customers. Trying to balance receiving orders and how much I'm supposed to help my co-workers with preparing the orders."
good,Low pay and no benefits for entry level. Great place for high school and/or first job. No experience needed and learn to work as a team. Weird hours and split shifts.
good,"I like a fast paced keep me busy job, I like working in fast food and having customer service skills and communicating with people. Also making them happy and keeping them coming back to spend their money."
good,"typical day at work.. I would be placed one place and then bounce from position to position more then anyone else that was there. "
good,was an okay company to work for it was an interesting experience to learn new and exiting things and work at fast pace the environment was a clean and safe place to work in
good,"Didn't get paid well, too much drama, didn't get paid for overtime, everyone slacks and goofed off, people stole food and money. People were late all the time."
good,"Very routine, Sometimes have unrealistic goal for there employees,"
good,"Ambiente tranquilo y agradable, buen sueldo y beneficios."
good,good work place for people who is in need of their first job. I believe this place provide great experience or people who just entering the work world.
good,"Very stressful environment, needs help in cleanliness. I work with a bunch of teenagers and constantly feel as though I am back in high school with all of the drama."
good,"As soon as i get to work everyday, I would clock in, wash my hands, put my gloves on and get right to work. It made me learn that you must always be ready for any tasks that comes at you."
good,The typical day at this work place is very fast paced and can get very hectic. The hardest part of the job is ensuring customer satisfaction. Dealing with ones food is a critical area of customer service.
good,Es un trabajo muy bueno pero aveces se pone lento es bueno
good,"Was able to take customer orders, prepare, take change and hand out meals in a quick manner. Was on the night closing crew, so on top of serving customers was also in charge of things such as cleaning dishes and closing down equipment and making sure it was well cleaned and organized for the opening crew."
good,Working at wendy's was a fun experience for me. It got me used to working in a fast paced environment. The management was a little shaky at times. But over all it was great
good,"face paced, mangers were cool, i had friends, wasn't anything special but i liked the money. i left for better opportunity so yea . I worked at the one in grand parkway and mason"
good,It was obvious which stores were corporate and which were franchise. Corporate seemed to update everything more timely and treat or pay their employees a bit better than at the franchise stores.
good,Very fast paced so you have to learn very quick. The attitude is great working with the team is awesome because most of the team is young. I liked it. I would definitely recommend to a teenager who is looking for a job.
good,It's a good company but requires a lot of patience. Disorganized but a lot of the management staff is great and understanding. It is a long haul job meaning advancement does not happen quickly.
good,Wendys was a job I took to pay the bills. It is OK but there is not much room for employment opportunities without sacrificing alot in life. Everyone is also not given the option to move around and work on multiple stations.
good,It was a ok place to work but in schenctady the workers played around to much but other then that i like it i like maken the sanwiches i wad one of the two fasted samdwich makers
good,"I will not judge, not enough pay was its downfall for me. I do not feel as if you can live off of the job unless you were a manager, maybe then I don't know."
good,"a typical work day was to make sure job duties were assigned , i learned that no matter how hard you work sometimes it get over looked, workplace culture was okay the hardest part of my job was the diversity that went on, the most enjoyable part was the knowledge i learned"
good,"A very fun place to work,,i recommend for teens looking for a first job or summer job, always worked around my schedule, had very fleible hours, and great people to work with"
good,"busy all day "
good,If you want to get burnt by grease you can go here but the place was not pain-safe. The workers were very lazy and the orders often got messed up. There was constant conflict between workers.
good,"Great entry level job, just be prepared to work with very young employees with no work etiquette who call off constantly.  Managment is great at this location though"
good,"It's a very dynamic job, you have multiple tasks to do when there are no customers and you have to be sharp on lunch hours. Trust me, you don't want to be the person who's short on product because you are going to delay all the line during a stressful lunch break."
good,"When I first got this job I was told I would be working on the grill, but on day one after being hired I was immediately pushed to work on being a cashier. I also didn't leave on the best of terms I gave my 2 weeks notice because I was moving and got fired right then and there."
good,"The job was stressful, forced to work overtime and was not paid for such time worked. Was told to become a Manager or else I'd lose my job. As a Manager worked more hours than most others and was always left with little to no crew for closing hours."
good,Wendys is a slow paced workplace and pay is unfair thay don’t treat their workers right but they Ltd is always room for advancement and they do let you listen to music while on the job
good,It had its up and downs but other coworkers helped me to keep moving forward and complete my shift. You just have to learn how to deal with customers in a respectful manner.
good,It was a learning experience as a cashier and a crew leader learned a lot during my time there and it is a challenge which I enjoy. Was the leader of the crew so that was a lot of learning and growing.
good,I was a great learning e experience. And would do it again mostly with better staff and mangment.and also if there was a was for me to climb the ladder in the company.
good,Working for Wendy's really taught me a lot about the workplace environment. The job itself was very easy to get the hang of and my interactions with our guests were always amazing. But as for the management they were very toxic and it made it very hard to go to work and get through a whole shift. As an employee I know that I was worth more than what management treated me as.
good,"I worked as a cashier, cleaned the dining room, filling up the condiments, working the drive thru, making sandwiches, fries ect."
good,"This isn’t an ideal job for someone with career goals. However, it is an excellent start, if any, to learn valuable skills, such as patience and customer service, integrity and diligence, even faithfulness. Above all, it’s the beginning of hard work."
good,"1 day work mean for me like one mission one target  which our working team should achieve, from these  work i  learn how to treat with the customers how to work in group as a team, for me hardest part of  job is to stand almost 16 hours and enjoyable part is working in team and achieve the goal."
good,"The fast-paced environment, the management is great, the most enjoyable part the job is the discounts and the motivation  and team work. I learned how to multitask."
good,"working there was fast paced and like every other fast food place, i was a chasier and i was on drive thru, i was alos on grill sometimes, they never really put me on sandwhiches even tho i wanted to learn bc that was the last position i needed to learn before i could move up,  which i wanted to do. i would recommend working here bc it prepares you for a lot of other jobs and i had fun when i was working there. the culture there, we joked around alot but when it got busy it was kind of bad because not everybody was perfect at there job but when you have good experienced people it goes very well. the hardest part of the job is dealing with cusomers who are disrespectful, and doing dishes hurts your back and you get wet. The most enjoyable part of the job is joking around and having fun and dealing with customers who are respectful."
good,I worked here for a short period of time but the boss was cool could have paid more but what can you expect from a fast food restaurant was a little far to travel
good,"Wendy's is a very clean and nice place to work, you are always treated with respect from the manager and other employees. Seeing new customers everyday was nice, it made you learn more respect"
good,"A typical day is I walk in, check in then started to make the sandwiches. That's it. I learned that people don't care about the quality of things but more about the speed of it to keep the line going. I also learned that there are nice people out there who will help others in need, because we're a team trying to just keep things afloat. The hardest part about the job was standing for long hours making the same thing over and over and over. The workers have to make the job fun. I enjoyed the breaks ofc."
good,this job was interesting to say the least.  long hours no appreciation shown to employees for jobs well done.  Called to fill in when some one decided to call off.
good,The job just really wasn’t for me I just had to work could not just stay home & do nothing. The hours what my job was. Just didn’t really wanna work there
good,Love their food. Clean and I still eat there. I can't say that about all restaurants that I've worked in. Quality food and definitely clean is a big deal with company.
good,Low pay. Asked for raise only got a 50 cent raise. It was $9 per hour then after raise $9.50 per hour. Asked to stop working to 3am and to not close anymore and got hours cut from full time to part time. General manager and other co-workers are rude to customers during closing shift. Fast paced most of the time.
good,When i first started at Wendy's it did not take me long to learn how to make the food. I was making very good hours and a large majority of the time i got along with everyone that i worked with.
good,"I liked working at  Wendy's, but there can be some improvement in management.Poor Communication and High turnover rate. Employee s received a good discounts. Overall it's a ok place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working here I would of stayed a little longer if they would of payed more, they start at $7.25 maybe $7.50 if you get lucky. The only problem I had was this one manager she would fiscally but her hands on surten employees and all the managers would turn and walked away, I worked there 2 years was pregnant pretty much the whole time. She would constantly shake my stomach while pregnant and would try and play fight with me or get mad if I sat down for a couple of minutes when it was dead cuz my feet where so swollen. That same manager was trying to fight another girl that was pregnant as well,I still sweapet and mopped got my job done it just took me a little longer being 8-9 months pregnant. Everyone else was great"
good,working at a fast food restaurant is not for everybody but wendys certainly makes as many adjustments as it can to make you feel more comfortable. They also showed me how to deal with upset customers
good,"Fast paced environment that always keeps you on you toes. The day constantly goes from slow with nothing to do, to all of a sudden to much work to do so you always have to be prepared to transition from slow to fast."
good,This is a good job but I personally would recommend high school students for this job only because you cant really make a living off $7.25. Wendy's is a good place to come up in from high school growing into a mature adult.
good,it was my favorite job working at Wendy's. Wasn't always professional but we got the job done and it was a good starter job. i loved being cashier to be honest.
good,I opened the restaurant so I prepped salads and the dinning room for the day. You spend all day on your feet meeting and serving plenty of very interesting people.
good,"A typical day would consist of me rotating with somebody who is going to leave, because their shift was over. I would be on my feet for long hours but I did not care because I enjoy doing work. I would make sandwiches and salads, clean dishes, take orders, and pass out food to the customers."
good,wendys was my first job i learn a lot i grew there. But it was to much to handel and not enough of help and you loose a lot of personal and family working there.
good,The people are great the customers are great never a slow day always on your toes training is very easy management were great nothing was really too hard more annoying tasks overall but still able to stand the people really work as a team and i really appreciate that
good,I really enjoyed working here in the beginning and I learned all positions possible so I was busy and occupied every day but as time went on my hours decreased inappropriately so I had to move on
good,"50% off on lunch for crew members and free for managers."
good,I do not want to include a review on Indeed for Wendy's.  It is a fast food working environment and customer service related business focusing in growth in sales.
good,"My work in Wendy's was a service crew. Serving clients in a fast food chain.  Here I learned to be accommodating and have enough patience to those demanding and impatient customers."
good,I wouldn’t recommend it to someone that wasn’t in high school or college because there are jobs with better pay and benifits available in the world today.
good,Was very slow and production was always behind. Most the time people did not know what order was going out or which to work on. I had a avery easy time working their though
good,I kind of enjoyed working here. At times it could be stressful but it never felt overwhelming. I didn't like the favoritism in the workplace which was the main reason I left.
good,I would take orders either up front or in drive thru. I would stock the napkins cups and straws when empty. I would help my supervisors with money drops and draw exchanges
good,"I spent the best years of my life in Wendy's."
good,"This job is very steady paced. The hours are late night so it gives you the opportunity to work various shifts that fit your life. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unhappy guest. Wendy's is one of the most organized fast food industries to work in. If they follow the guidelines and systems that are set in place to operate the business will run smoothly, making a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is serving hot fresh food, and giving excellent customer service."
good,"préparer la viande et le poulet pour les commande des client"
good,"The work environment is not good , the employees was always arguing it wasn’t professional at all .the pay was not worth my time for being there and all the work that I had to put in too"
good,"not the most enjoyable job in the world, the management was rather poor, and didn't give very much room to improve. the establishment was incredibly small, leaving no room to maneuver for different tasks because it was always so crowded."
good,"This was a perfect job for me while I was still in high school. I worked just from after school until close almost every night and it was great. Really fast paced, worked with the public and food a lot. The only bad part was the management was not really that effective."
good,this is a great starter job for younger people. It helps give you a job while you are in school and can work around school hours. You are constantly on your feet.
good,during the day when I go into work things are smooth every body was working hard. the managers made sure every body was doing there job. Work place was clean and ready for the next shift. but the hardest part of the job was when the fryers went down s and credit card machine went down at the drive thru. But the part I like about my job was when I make the food and serve it to the customers.
good,"working at wendys was ok , just come in and do your job and get your work done. its a job its better then nothing , its a good teenager not really good for grown person inless your a manager."
good,Some of the managers there were pretty cool and we got along well but the store manager was weird and i think a lot of things could have been handled differently as far as that
good,"This corporation is a struggling environment, there is a lot to do a lot of safety procedures and a lot of customer service relations needed. hours are everywhere most times. a lot of no call no show issues."
good,It was stressful when we were busy and I worked at the station alone after being trained. When I had free time and it was slow I did food prep until we were busy or an order came in.
good,"Personally it was a nice place to work while I was in high school because they gave me enough hours so that I was satisfied, but not too many so that I was stressed."
good,"the co-workers and management where awful. Hours got way too low, but some of the workers there were very nice and helpful, I saw a few safety violations including just stacks of unopened/partially opened boxes on the floor. It was in Peyton and we got a lot of complaints, I never really even had a chance to make patties or sandwiches."
good,"staff was great, but stressful to work with, not much hours or shifts. This was a good experience for a first job, I learned a lot and in my next job i was more outgoing and able to progress quickly."
good,Wendy’s is a good place to work and you’ll met some good friends their but it was a lot to handle you had to help other with their jobs when they wasn’t doing it and I wasn’t getting paid enough
good,It was a fine place to work at that stage of my life. I enjoyed managing the employees. The management team was good and I felt respected in my role. I felt that I had their support of my decisions.
good,it was fun because the manager was always active not boring and they were nice at times because their attitude can be sometimes terrible but dont get on their nerves
good,"The management at Wendy's was good, but there were times when people would get in fights in the Wendys or people would argue back with the manager and not get fired."
good,Working at Wendy's was extremely stressful. Managers expected you to be supernatural when taking orders and preparing food. A typical day at work consisted of getting yelled at if the order was not to their liking.
good,"-It was a part time job while in school"
good,The place was decent  and the people were nice but afterwards is what I was thinking about and after the interview was done I  was treated differently  and  o learned that things aren't always what they appear
good,Lots of long hours. Work doesn’t stop you get free meals and the people are nice but the pay isn’t good Enough for the amount of money you are earning.
good,"Poor manangment and unprofessional "
good,"There were Lazy employees , nothing done about it , favoritism to people like the managers wife. The schedule wasn’t my necessary choice and the pay wasn’t great."
good,I had fun we all work together as a team cashier and it's fine once you get to know the screen and what you're doing other than that everything is good
good,Was a place to improve skills . As a manager I was learning and getting better experiences in my field. My management co workers was excellent and the team members also was stunning
good,great company to start off working. flexible hours good training room for growth to management. great for after school job and part time. A good place for 1st job
good,Learned a lot about the fast food industry. They are all about the customer service experience. The food is always made fresh. Great place to learn customer service.
good,"Be wary of working for franchisees. The quality control can be a real issue; the place I worked at had a dangerous conflict of interest between managers and employees, with hiring relatives as the norm. It was a fairly awful environment and many of the favored employees did not pull their own weight."
good,its a cool fast layed back job for the most part but sometimes it can get stressful . depends on the day and what time of the day it is. Wendys as a whole is good but sometimes its bad .
good,"fast paced, friendly atmosphere. great place to start your fist job. Easy to advance through the company as long as you show your dedicated and willing to learn new things"
good,wendys is awesome because they like give you all the food you want at the end of the day and they show you love like fureal you know what im saying i really like it
good,come in to  work  then get set up look over the work place see what is needed then get all the stuff and  start  to work take the ppl in the lobys order
good,"My co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. Our location had a high traffic of customers making for a busy environment. My hours varied and I was often working until midnight, despite being a high school student."
good,"I liked working at Wendy's i honestly didnt want to leave the job, but i had no choice because i didnt want the managers to get in trouble just for having me still working there because of my background"
good,"Fast paced work environment. understanding managers.  flexible scheduling. Little to no opportunity for advancement.  Difficult to get raises.  "
good,"Working at Wendy’s was a good first job where I learned many applicable skills including working as a cashier, customer service, and cleaning. It was very fast paced and being a fast food restaurant and that could be stressful especially if you are new."
good,"I worked at wendys for a year which means that it was not THAT bad, of course there are a lot of bad stuff in this job but it is like that with all jobs involving food, there will always be complaints no matter how good you are at the job."
good,This was a great learning experience. I learned that I'm not a fast food person. the pace is real fast. And that is not my M. O. I like to work in clam places
good,pretty flexible hours if you work hard you can progress in the company i feel like it would be a great 1st job for anyone. managers were nice foods pretty good to
good,Although there would be times of extreme pressure my team would pull through by everyone doing their job. Overall my experience at Wendys was pleasant
good,when working for Wendy's there is a lot of stress on the cook  working a lot of things  at once. I feel there pay should be paid a lot more because of what is asked of them
good,"It is a great friendly environment to work in, if it wasn't for them not having enough hours for me, i  would probably still be working there, and flourishing."
good,Good job for a first job or if you need a job quick. Thier are multiple positions to learn so work doesn’t get too boring. The best part is the discounts on food
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. It was a simple job with good managers. I believe I should have gotten paid more. It was stressful at times when were understaffed.
good,"Cooked food orders and maintained proficiency at every station, backed up other crew members to keep workflow at an efficient leve, performed closing duties which included cleaning kitchen surfaces cooking utensils."
good,not my type of job not enough exercise in it just something i did temporarily to see if i would like it. may suit others nice coworkers and lively environment.
good,Ok place to work until you can find something better. They could pay more money and offer crew members paid time off    ..............................
good,"Its an okay job jusg not enough pay very stressful i love working with customers and employes amazing, loved being a cashier cooking and cleaning is the best part"
good,Wendy's is another place the way you have to work at a fast pace they give you 50% off on your meals but you don't get overtime must be able to interact with customers and get along with co-workers as well as management
good,Every Wendys atmosphere is different. Hopefully the one your applying to is a great one!! I. worked for wicked bosses that were Russian and was treated very badly
good,"Stock condiments , wash dishes , cook and prepare food , take orders handling money , end of shift cleaning trash cans, bathrooms, dinning area and stove tops ."
good,"the always tell me to do everything and make me work more than says in my job statement, I don't recommend wendys to nobody, and less if u have family"
good,It was my first actual job so it was a little crazy to handle sometimes but I caught on pretty quick and loved interacting with people so it was a pretty good job!
good,"I really don't care to write a review, it kept me for 3 years and paid well enough to pay my bills, nothing to write home about. Management really depended on your district."
good,Its was a fun environment with employees. Management was horrible. There was no pair time off. Was able to work overtime but worked a little too hard and still wasn't good enough pay.
good,At Wendy's I learned about  different people..How do faster at what I do it not a slow job..I learned how to run a shift. I learned that you have to take charge.
good,Just wasn’t for me. Didn’t how they deel with people.. and there isn’t much room for growth!  General manager was great.. and two other managers were great.
good,Wendys was my first job and it taught me more about customer service and patience. I enjoyed working there and enjoyed the other crew members which made my work day better.
good,What I learned while working at Wendy's was to stay busy. I was in charged with cooking the product and cashier. The hardest part was changing the cooking oil.
good,This was a great starter job for someone in high school. I did it for less than a year because I knew I was leaving for the US military. The manager was personable and was reasonable with hours.
good,its a wonderful place to work and if you really enjoyed that type of job then it really is the place to be i honestly have nothing else to say  but there you go
good,it has its time when it was a fast paced and slow paced depending on the time of day. kept you on your toes always thjng to get done. never a dull moment. management was always nice
good,"Pretty laid back when i worked there, managers were good, not much advancement in this industry in my opinion but it is an excellent starting job. I would recommend to most. i learned so much customer service in this job."
good,"I worked there 4 years, did everything right made sure I was young and let them take advantage of my work ethic and how hard I worked, I don’t how it is know out there but it was not a place to grow"
good,Wendy's was my first job. I don't remember much about it. This where I first started working. It was a job for high school just to have money in my pocket.
good,"Very supportive upper management and franchise owners, they understand the business and usually make the right business decision The pay structure is not very competitive for hourly team member and make it difficult to recruit and retain"
good,A great place to learn basic management principles and application. Skills learned at this company can be incorporated into a wide range of future jobs.
good,"its was good job really flexible with hours , help me with my school"
good,Fast food is fast food. But I can say out of all the fast food places I've worked at Wendy's was by far the cleanest and freshest place I've worked at.
good,Working at Wendy's was very unorganized. It was hard for me to grow in the company. I didn't believe my best interest was in the company. It was hard for me to tell when my next advancement opportunity would come.
good,My work place is fun. Can get boring at times though. But overall I love. Things could be a little better but I see myself here for awhile. The insurance is good.
good,It was a pretty nice job to have but at the same time it is fast food but the only reason I left was cause they kept messing up my paycheck and I talked to them but nothing ever got fix so I just quit and put in my 2 weeks
good,"It was my first job it taught me a lot but it got too much , I was running the joint. I needed something more so I left. I had an overall good time because of the coworkers"
good,The pay was mad. The managers expected a lot . Hardly ever any hel. A lot for us to do. People didn’t get along with each other. Rude customer making the job harder.
good,I would consider this better than working at McDonald's. Pay at the time was low but the working experience was fun. Would only recommend this for beginners.
good,"I liked the employees and employers. The pay was good. Enjoyed getting to know the customers that came in everyday. Pretty good hours, but needed more."
good,So it's fast food.it's basic skills and basic people. People seem to be petty and you don't make enough to deal with some things. It's a beginner level job.
good,"I worked here because i needed a job and i was young but they still payed me well, nothing bad to say about them but that type of job is not the type of job i want for life"
good,This is a good place to work. You get the training that you need to provide service to the customers. Good chance for advancement and management. Work hard and you will advance.
good,A great place to learn how to manage money in skills work your way up into management must be very eager to learn and always follow the rules other than that I believe that it has potential to be more but u g po t to want it...
good,It was very stressful and everyone thought it was just a joke and it was very tiring at that moment I was only 16 years old and having to work 50 plus hours every week the managers were not helpful they were like little children and I wanted to go back to school and get an education and work.
good,"Wendy’s is job that will teach you work ethics, move at a fast pace. Also, customer service because on the everyday basis you will interact with customers ."
good,"Always listening something new, never a full moment when working a shift. Meet great people of all types of characters with different personalities and everyone brings something different."
good,The customers are very rude sometimes. They fuss at you when there order is wrong. The employees overall are very loving. A lot of the employees that are students have left.
good,Wendy is the worst place to work for because you don’t get time off on vacation and not time for your family and friends or went you sick you still have to go to work
good,was a part of the management team it was a very back stabbing team would not recommend management to anyone no one was on the same page as a team to better the store
good,"It's better then nothing.... It's very fast paced, always busy, people are friendly, food is good,we get half off on our meals, always getting new employees"
good,For me Wendy’s was an OK job I just work there just to get money to get by and just to make ends meet and to pay my bills and provide for my kids if it wasn’t for all of that I would’ve been quit working at Wendy’s.
good,Typical QSR experience. Fast paced. Excellent and effective systems when followed correctly. Online training system is thorough and effective. People are fun to work with.
good,"Management was constantly spotty in terms of quality, same with people. We were also always short people because nobody wanted to work under such inconsistent management. The managers also had a tendency to disregard the days we had booked off well in advance (sometimes even months beforehand) only to tell us to our face that we ""Should have booked it off two weeks prior."" I feel bad for the people still working there, they deserved better. They were generally pretty cool people, some I still keep in touch with years after they left. I really only enjoyed the times where I wasn't on the Drive-Thru window or Front cashier, I really preferred working on the grill or helping put away the food deliveries we got three times a week."
good,Disrespectful co-workers; immature. The hardest part of the job is when the team members don't communicate and alarm you on certain orders. I learned to be more efficient and keep pushing even though the environment may be a bit of a drag.
good,Was fast pace at times but also had down time to got along with everyone and we all worked as a team loved working with the public liked switching up jobs sometimes to
good,"It was a decent place to work, typically I would clock in and take customers food orders on the cash register, clean restock the restaurant and then clock out when another employee would come in to cover the next shift."
good,get to work with a lot of different people. nice hours and you can learn other positions easily. Rush hours can be hard to handle if you don't have a well working team.
good,show them the numbers and increases and you might get a pat on the back. Up 10% the first year as the GM and didn't even get a pat on the back or a good job
good,They are rude not good people they dont treat employees the way they should and they cant keep people because of that and they are always hiring people
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being put under pressure and being yelled at constantly to do better, not in a nice way, high expectations for little respect."
good,"As a teenager I feel this fast food restaurant(Robinsonville,MS) would be a good start, of course you would have rude guest and maybe sometimes rude coworkers"
good,"Barley had any hours. Very little business,  employees were rude to other employees. It was to the point where I was only working two hours a week and I would basically just stand there the whole time and do little to nothing."
good,Wendy's was my first real job. It taught me how to become independent and taught me the basics and I was able to open my own resturant with what I was taught there
good,Some hard work and lazy managers but nothing too crazy. Sweat is a guarantee so if you're not fond of some discomfort then maybe working in fast food isn't a good idea.
good,The company does strive for excellence but rarely acknowledges those employees that are not of higher management for their exceptional work and dedication.
good,I was able to get promoted quickly. Was able to work overtime.  The customers where the best thing about the job.  I loved to see customers happy. The team I had under me worked together and it was mostly a smooth shift.
good,Fast paced as to be expected in the fast food industry. Major differences when working for corporate and franchise. Numbers and customer service driven.
good,As long as you were working with others that do what they are supposed to it wasn’t a bad experience and it was a relatively easy job. The managers tended to help when needed to keep everything going
good,Wendy’s was my first job and it was definitely a good starting point. Working with people around my age and management that was understanding in the fact that it was my first job and i didn’t exactly know what to do
good,I had to work at the Wendy's near my high school right before I graduated and had to leave due to my shipping off to basic training for the United States Marine Corps.
good,"Irrelevant as I have not been employed by the organization for more than 30 years. Unfortunately, I have not worked for the company for thirty years so this review is irrelevant."
good,"Although stressful and fast paced, I often met a lot of great people, either as co-workers, lower management, or customers. It also provides a lot of quick, easy experience in the fast food industry."
good,"show up on time and get the job done, I learned that hard work is always required at the work place. Management is good, they get the workers to do the work. The coworkers are all nice and fun to talk to. The hardest part of the job would be to keep up the fast pace for hours, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be when it gets slow and you have a chance to speak to your coworkers."
good,It was a great job that gave me the freedom to raise my daughters and pay my bills without being on assistance. management was ok during my years working there.
good,the management were understanding about personal issues. And the workplace was a warm place to where  you could be yourself. I've learn  how  to work with  so many different personalities and learned about how to prep some foods and the safe way to handle them.
good,Wendy's is a great part time job to pick you up off your feet and start working again and have money coming in while not focusing on making it your career.
good,Great first job for experience. Great company with many opportunities to move up into management. My management team was everything you could ask for.
good,Quick paste easy work fast food great customer service good attendance fun people to be around help customers with any questions they have reported to management when a problem was involved
good,"While working with the Wendy's Company, they really try their best to always get the job done. No matter the situation, they always try to get the job done."
good,A typical day would be i come in clock in see where they want me and go there make sure everything is restocked and pick up where the person before me left off.  The most enjoyable part is making new friends and having new job experiences and learning new skills.
good,Management was poor training personnel. The non management personnel was very enjoyable to work with. The training thst management gavebwas very poor in judgement
good,"Cooperated with the service line workers to process customer orders on a daily basis, ensuring excellent customer satisfaction and positive ratings"
good,"I mean this job was ok ,the only thing I can say that I really didn't like was that we wasn't organized at the time. I fell like if we would've stayed organized it wouldn't have been so tuff."
good,Was a good place at first but when management switched all things changed really fast and a lot of favoritism with workers and I couldn’t further my experience there because kinda racial
good,Wish the place was a little more spacious but overall everything is okay love working with the employees and working as a beautiful team we make it happen even in stressful times and we manage to get the job done
good,"The wendy's I worked at, the people made it great. However it is a corporate job, so the employees are expected to be slaves, but what can you expect."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's but fast food restaurants are sometimes stressful, but I was able to handle it well.  Because the ""team"" worked as a team, we were successful in making the customers happy with their orders."
good,"Alot of ppl don't do their job and it makes me mad "
good,Being at Wendy's it was a good paying job to work while i was in high school. management was okay . My experience wasn't the best there but i enjoyed the people i worked with which made it more enjoyable to work there.
good,"The schedule was weekly, hard to plan anything around that. The managers were understanding for the most part but they could be quite harsh. I would not want to work there again"
good,"As far as the experience of working at Wendys goes, I believe everyone should have some experience in working fast food and Wendys is the same as the rest. It may have low pay and benefits, but can be a good start to move into management or use the skills you develop on the job to move further into the food service industry."
good,"The work environment was so unprofessional. It was very stressful when the manages would yell at me over minor mistakes. Other then that though, I wish they paid better. I learned a lot from working there and would've continued to if the management wasn't so bad."
good,"This was my first job that I worked at through high school. For a fast food restaurant it is mainly fast paced, of course there are some hours in the day when it's not as fast, however those times where used to clean and get ready for the next rush."
good,Its like your typical fast food work place. It was ok management when i was there. I dont really know what its like  now. Would recommend this job for anyone
good,"I Hated Working There It Was So Dramafilled "
good,"I worked there a few years ago while I was in high school. You had to stay busy at all times, no breaks. We got 50% off all food. The management wasn’t all that great but I made some friends while working there."
good,This is a job for younger people unless you have management skills. It takes a lot of patience to work in the fast food industry. I did it along time and learned a lot
good,"Wendy's is an alright job. I think the company is good, but the management in the store I worked in was bad and that is the reason I didn't enjoy my experience there."
good,It was an okay place it was not up to my likings. I didn’t feel comfortable to working there I felt like I was singled out cause I was a new worker there
good,Working in fast food you have to be quick on your feet. That’s the point of a “Fast” food restaurant. Customers doesn’t like to wait a whole 30 minutes for their food.
good,A typical day in fast food was busy than ever had to deal with 2 or 3 positions at a time i didnt mine but had 2 do it all.managers a little rude at time customers excellent..no career opportunities at all i didnt understand that at all..the pay was fair with little hours
good,Well it’s. A bit stressful cause it gets very busy and you got l alway be doing something. But overall it’s a good Amount of hours to work for a good pay.
good,started here when was 16 years old. worked my way up to crew trinner.then cuple years made.crew leadder loved worken with the public.this were i leand how cook a buager.
good,"A typical day at wendys some days i would be on the register,some days i would be making sandwiches. Ive learned how to make sandwiches, take orders , collect cash and pass out the proper food. The hardest part about wendys was the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was the group parties."
good,"Good for the most part but, it's sometimes stressful. Good place to make friends, management can be nice if you have the right people, some days you're busy some days it will be slow."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the first three years, the crew was efficient and the managerial staff was decent. After I reached manager status, I noticed that the work didn't meet the pay. I worked a lot of hours but didn't receive he overtime."
good,"Wendys was a good second job. Very fast pace workplace and with great managers. Enjoyed working there at the time, when changed my hours to the morning shift it had become to stressful for me."
good,Its a nice place to work if you are a high school or college student its a very fast pace job. But it gives you skills on how deal under stress and how to communication to customers and staff.
good,"didn't like the management, it was a way to get my foot in the door with management experience. your schedule is all over the place. always under staffed."
good,"Typical day at Wendy's laid back, it picks up in certain hours, normally lunch. Then it's fast pace, a lot of orders, a lot, movements. Trying to get the food out to the customers in a timely fashion, and the way the ordered it."
good,"My job was to help pre-closed the restaurant. I prep foods, I cook the foods, I take garbage's out. I work with different managers. I put foods away. It was alright."
good,Working with this company was good i learned how to be better at customer service and dealing with angry customers. The Part i most enjoyed was working the Drive-thru window
good,"A typical day come in at 6, may be on the grill or cash register and washing dishes, and clean floors around 12 and leave at 2am. I learned sometimes you have to be a leader even when you don't want to and tell people what they have to do to get the job done. Hardest part of the job is doing others peoples job and mine at the same time."
good,ok job to work at.  Busy at times with not enough help.  Not sure why open so late when don't do any business that late.  Would rather be home than sitting around.
good,"worked here for two years, only making 8.10 by the end despite taking extra classes and advancing to shift manager. store was not run very well by GM, high turnover rate for employees"
good,Learned how to work as team in a fast paced environment. Learned how to communicate with customers. Math skills increased with cash handling. Kept track of inventory and cleaning supplies.
good,You learn many things at wendys going from slow paced to fast paced.Advancement on management and career oppertunities. The most enjoyable part is when it slows down and restaurant closes.
good,"It's a good job , but u have to work extra hard for that extra money sometimes,at times co-workers didn't get along with other employees no tips, very fast paced invirenment,"
good,The location at my first Wendy's was great!! Whatever you do always ask if you can be shown how to work all area. The more you know the better hours you will get.
good,"I'm perhaps not the kind of person to like working in fast food, but I just didn't like the experience. While the managers were at least quite understanding, the other employees seemed too stressed to make a good environment for me. The managers are too focused on serving people and not enough on making a good work environment, which is understandable, but it's just not for me."
good,"very busy place to work, good part time work for high school students and college students or retired people or seniors. I learned good customer service skills and learned how to be on time since this was my first job in High school."
good,"it was ok. Love meeting people and helping others and make sure areas are clean,  friendly coworkers and very helpful when you learn new things. It was a fun place to work"
good,Working there was easy but some days it wasn’t. I learned a lot working there and dealing with different kinds of people. Everyday it was something different working there.
good,"I Enjoyed the fast paced , always busy , great people all around , The Boss Is Very Friendly She Made Work Better . The place always being busy helped the day go by I Love the people that come in ."
good,It was a job that helped me stay out of the way while I was going to school at the time. it was also something that helped me stay on track and stay positive at the same time.
good,I liked working at Wendy's the people that you get to know become more of a family. There is a lot of new faces you see everyday and some people daily.
good,I worked there for 8 months preparing salads in the morning and working as a crew member. They were about to promote me as a keyholder who do most of the manager thing in the morning.
good,It was a decent job would be good for high school kids looking to make some money of their own but would not make it a long term or a career job. Unless you can become a manager.
good,If your going in training for GM might want to think twice as they dont give ou the proper training to achieve the position. just thrown in position and had to learn hands on
good,Good culture and work enviroment. Strong support and development from all levels of leadership. spent a full day with fouder and CEO. Strong internal advancement opportunities
good,It was an ok job you get your hours but the pay wasn’t worth it so I left so to s better job opportunity if they start paying more I would consider working there again
good,"We are all around on this company we are usually busy because the location is in downtown and front of mcewan school, I learned here how to place an order and the work place is happy people and helping each other, the hardest part is when i am in the sandwich i am alone making sandwich for front and drive thru, because most of the time we are lack of staff that time. The most enjoyable part is we all get along and help each other when we need most."
good,This was my first job right out of high school. it was a nice job because they worked with my school schedule. they would always work around my schedule
good,When I worked at Wendy's I was a hard worker and always remained punctual. I never called out unless due to an emergency. I also was a very respectful employee with a politeful attitude. i got along with my co-workers without any altercations.
good,A typical day for me is to work in drive thru and help any customer thay comes my way. Things that i have learned is to know how yo work as a team. The management could be better.we are a diverse place.The hardest part is when we are short staff and its busy.The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers.
good,Food business very stressful demanding. Long hours minimum wage.  Long working hours. Mandatory work weekends. Get discount on food. management don't care.
good,Fast paced nice first job for a high schooler people were easy to get along with customers could get a little out of hand. Nice to job to say the least
good,This is another great job for teenagers. They have good ups and downs. Managers don't just stand around they actually get in and do the work needed to make there business thrive
good,I basic did everything I was suppose to do even helpin other in there jobs an making sandwiches for the customers I enjoy workin there for the time I was there for
good,I did not like working at Wendy’s. The managers where very rude and little respect. I would not work there again due to the fact. And I would not recommend anyone to work there.
good,"The Franchisee, Bronco Burgers, left my previous location without a lot of needed equipment for a long period of time until they shut my location down giving its employees a day’s notice for relocation. People are fun to work with but a mismanaged mess in a lot of ways."
good,The pay rate doesn't match the work requirements and responsibilities. Benefits and vacation are not competitive but they do offer discount on food which unfortunately is unhealthy!
good,i like to work for this company because i think it would be a good place to start off and work my way up. like to cook know how to do carpenter run a saw and a nailgun. i am  a very decaticated hard working indevidule who takes pride in my work place and my co workers around me
good,"Pretty well wish there was more pay, really liked the workers if they ever showed up, hours are really good just wish there was more pay of course, really liked though"
good,"I worked at Wendy's in the drive-thru section. I would take orders, cash out, and give people their drinks and food. I liked working their because you could eat for a discounted price."
good,"It was okay, the manager was a little cranky sometimes, but the workers were cool to be around. It was my first job and I have to see people do it first, so I can learn and they were a little rushy with me about learning how to make the sandwiches. They just gave me a paper to look at, while someone was beside me telling me if I was doing it right or wrong or if I was too slow."
good,"Fast paced, fast food environment. Works around school schedules. No clock-out breaks for those over 18.  Different shifts that vary.  Opportunities to advance to shift manager"
good,It was fun while it lasted. The job is easy . Supervisor aren’t the best but other than that the Job is well mannered. So help yourself and apply. Thanks
good,"You have to deal with customers at certain positions. Some of the managers were fun to work with but the others were not that great. Some of them were too strict or just didn't understand certain things and yelled at you for stupid reasons. The workplace culture depends on who you are working with that shift. If it's people you don't like, it will be a bad day, but if it's with people you do like and get along with, your day will be great. The hardest part of the job would be some of the customers you have to deal with and some of your coworkers if you don't get along with them very well. The best part of the job is you get a discount whenever you work."
good,"Working at Wendy's was good, see days was faster than others. My personal experience working there was up and down sometimes I'll have customers begin rude to me over the little things."
good,"cant really complain. you go there, work, get paid bi weekly. dealing with customers is a daily thing, if you are uninterested in working with others i dont recommend"
good,"It was okay,  for a teenager in high school. They was okay if you needed to call in.  I didn't like my hours and days.  They could be more organized and friendlier."
good,It was more so of the co workers that made it stressful...the job it self could be great if everybody worked as a team. Other than that it was an OK job
good,Overall Wendys was way better than Burger King.  wendys was more laid back and everyone got alone.  Every one did there own job and cleaned up behind themselves. Whatever it was that u were scheduled to work u did just that and got off at a decent  time.  I would work there again the only reason I left was they said family members couldn't work together and I wad the last one that got hired so they had of let me go.
good,it was my secoind job so i guess it was ok i didnt had too much experience but they definitely were helpful all the time to show me what i had to do in there.
good,Working at Wendy's was a good start for me entering the working world but it was kinda hard because my location was very busy at all times. I learned every position and was a good help to the staff.
good,Working for Wendy's was a great but the managment their needed helped because things were not in order. I disagreed with the way the store was ran everyday so decieded  to stick with job I alread had.
good,"very strict about rules,  but decent pay. If you do your job and keep a positive attitude you can definitely move up in the company very fast. managers start at 10 dollars"
good,"Its was a good job when I first started until they kept getting bought but different corporates, I also enjoy the employees I worked with it was a good experience for a first time job."
good,"It was ok for an first job but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone that thinks about working there. Its not that fun, your clothes get dirty to often..."
good,"This place was run exactly like you think it would. Wasn't a hard job by any means, just not in a great location so the type of people you had to deal with were the hardest part of the job."
good,"Stressful workplace with stressful management. Learned good time management. Helped me learn how to better myself in multitasking, precision on food making, and teamwork."
good,The managers are fun to work with. They listen to you when you have to tell them something. The pay was great. Was a fun work place. Is a very fast paced.
good,Working at Wendy’s you have to always be prepared for anything. If is a rush or a big group of people or a large order. You have to stay on your game and always remember your orders.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but rarely ever saw the management. When I did see them my experiences were not very good. Lack of communication and respect were quite present, which is why I left."
good,Fast food is a job everyone should do once in life. Teaches you basics for customer service. Its not the worst and its not the best. Management varies some are cool some are too serious but its a fun enviornment
good,This was my first job and it helped me learn to work in customer service and the staff and management were friendly and supportive. I worked here for 4.5 years.
good,"I loved working with my co workers. Everyone was so hard working and even though we were all miserable, we still got through it together. The management was a different story."
good,"Wendy's is definitely not the easiest job. It is a very fast paced job with a constant flow of customers. It is a job that definitely poses challenge, but its certainly can be fun if you make it that way."
good,Working at Wendy’s was an experience it was my first job I like it I just didn’t like the fact my manager couldn’t understand why I was a few minutes late for work and that’s because I worked in Orland hills but lived in dolton and I caught public transportation which would have me at least 5min late at the most.
good,It was exhausting. Morning shifts were fine but it gets very busy around mid day. A lot of the customers weren't the nicest but overall most were very nice.
good,"Wendy's was a good job. the managers were good. I worked the back window for the drive thru, so I had other duties. I would recommend people to work at this location."
good,"Fast paced, hot at times, customer service, can move up fairly easy, you get discounts on food before you clock in, fairly easy, very cooperative work environment."
good,I likemy job. I just don't love the hours. I have a 13 year old at home and dont get to spend the time with him he wants. Im a single mother and in all honestyvnot making what i need to make.
good,It was my first job really had to prove myself from the beginning. Made it tho was put on cashier but cross trained on everything. worked well with my manager and other coworkers.
good,Constatnly Stressing out. Co-workers constantly spreading drama and managers do nothing. Raises are promised but never recieved. I always felt unappreciated.
good,"It was fast paced and kept me on my feet. Im trying to get out of the industry all together.  There is always extra work to do and at times that can be fulfilling to help get the job done, but then there are times when you feel very overworked and underpaid."
good,Its a fast pace job thats easy to do. The time goes by fast do to the fact that your constantly moving throughout the day. As long as you work at a fast pace and keep the rotation going you will succeed very well in this job.
good,A good entry level  job for someone working thru school or college. Long term this wasn’t the job for me just being honest. I would recommend to a young person.
good,"Wendys is a great job to gain experience and everybody I worked with got along great. Only downfall is the pay, which is why its good for something temporary."
good,You have a lot of fun working there with the coworkers. You always enjoy your costumers. Everyone there has a job to do and get the job done. We work has a team at Wendy’s.
good,Long hours very fast paced you did get discounts and not everyone worked together they had their picks and they did care about families if someone needed to be off
good,"This is an ok job mostly for teens and young adults just starting out. you earn the chance to learn to operate different machines, learn to cook different things, learn interacting with new people."
good,not a good place to work management slacks off a lot so does the employees worked here for a while and finally got out of that place finally not a nice place to work
good,"I enjoyed working here personal things happens so I had to leave. But overall it a great place to work I would recomend it to other people, nice working environment nice co workers."
good,"Flexible shifts and hours depending on extracurricular activities. Perfect for those who love fast paced easy going co workers, Positions are straight forward and doesn't require any degree of education."
good,I loved working at this place. The managers were nice. I did not recieve many benefits. I'm not a fan of working in fast food due to the fast pace environment.
good,normal fast food work. Managers were very unprofessional.  Very strict.  Customers were mean.  The job is really not the place to work for unless you have nothing else.
good,"Wendy’s is a great place to work. The managers are nice and helpful, as well as understanding. Fellow employees are respectful and kind, as well as positive."
good,Pay was low but they pay minimun wage and i knew what i signed up for. some managers were very sweet and caring others very rude and pushy. I enjoyed my new work buddies they were very helpful
good,"Every day walking in felt like torture. The managers could not care less about the employees. Barely trained you and expected you to know things when they never even told you how they work. Better off homeless, since either way the pay won't be enough to live off of."
good,Wendys is a decent place to work if you have the right management and if they know how to do their job correctly. jobs fast paced but at times very relaxed.
good,"It’s your typical fast food break. The crew that I worked with was pretty nice and willing to help out. Other than that, it was a relatively easy job."
good,Always very busy and fast pace. Management things personally. I felt it was very friend base.  Not something I would see myself doing  for a career choice.
good,Staff at this location for about the post year (since a change in management)  seem to be improved.  We encounter friendly staff with smiles. Orders have been correct and service speed is reasonable.
good,Sometimes unorganized but I got my hours. It was a clean restaurant and the staff was ok. It was my very first job. Sometimes I worked late hours but didn’t mind
good,Mine and everyone else hours were cut back. They were understaffed then hired too many employees. We should have had the opportunity to pick up extra hours.  I feel that I should have been promoted
good,"Overall fun job. Worth the pay, gained a lot of experience. Management was terrible. Almost every night shift i would have to do 2 or more jobs, being that its fast paced we should have enough people to cover each position. Some managers are bias, pick favorites and neglect sanitation. Other managers are really laid back and get their job done great."
good,Trained j-1 international students to work as cashiers and cooks at one of the busiest locations in the colorado mountains. Provided foreign language assistance to international employees with limited english skills.
good,"They pay decent for the job to be done, but they will want you to live at the store day and night. You will have a schedule that says 10-8 but you will end up working 9:30 to 10 on a daily. The management is ok, but will want a lot of extra stuff done during the day. The crew will be the reason you stay you will love working with some of them and they will seem like family. The hardest part of the job is always being there and never seeming to get caught up."
good,Wendys is a place for young people to work starting out for a first job.  As you get older you would want a job where you are valued as apart of the team.
good,My days at Wendy's were exciting because of the fast pace of the job. I learned how to be kind and courteous as well as direct with fellow employees and customers. Management was helpful and strict.  The hardest part of the job was the lunch rushes and the most enjoyable part was the benefits.
good,"the job entails dealing with food and customers. As a cashier we had to take orders and prepare the takeaway orders. Was very fast paced, and needed to have a goos memory of the menu quickly. I do not particularly enjoy working with food."
good,I think I was fun work experience and great skilled to learn but the people I worked with were also not very fun but the job itself was great all in all great place to work
good,"it is a good for anyone look for a start up job. I was a college athlete  so the schedule was complicated for me. great people, great environment and excellent food."
good,it was a faced paced job at times and a little rough when customers made complaints about their orders not being right but once the problems were fixed it became a calm and enjoyable day
good,"for the most part i built a nice relationship with the people that work there , at times it gets very hecktick but thats apart of the job i usually work the busy days friday satuday overall its an okay job"
good,"It was a great first experience to work in a fast food restaurant. I learned a lot about the teamwork n the dynamics of working as a single organism. It was fun, but I never had the chance to be a cashier. Shame."
good,I liked the job and i feel every teenager should work at Wendy’s or any fast food restaurant to really learn what they go through and learn people skills. I’ve learned a lot by working at Wendy’s and met many lifetime people & customers.
good,some of the staff was pretty cool. at times it could be very crazy but over all it was a good time at work. everyone treated me like a family member. it was great.
good,it was a good place to work the crew was friendly and help the customer when they can .we had team work there we all work together.the food was good to eat.
good,good place to start if you have never had a job before. probably why mostly teenagers work there. not someplace you would look for advancement or career options unless you lack options
good,Always be good to the customers even if they in the wrong. Respect people like how you wanted to be treated. Always get alone with your teammates and your manager.
good,I've made lots of friends through this job. The fast paced environment makes me feel accomplished after a day at work. I've enjoyed working more closely with customers with this job.
good,"Wendys was tough because it is fast food and there would always be a rush but this job taught me how to communicate, how to multitask, and work as a team."
good,"I learned to have patience and be respectful to customers. The hardest part of working at Wendy's was multitasking, as in placing orders, making the drinks, collecting money and bagging the food."
good,"Nothing was hard at Wendy's, a typical day at work felt like I was at a cook out sometimes, because I was flipping burgers n just having good time at work with my coworkers getting to know them and the job."
good,"I didnt work there very long, but it was nice, not to stressfull, all the people there was cool , they got a donation program thats for kids who are sick, so i think thats awesome for them to do that"
good,The typical work day was nice of you know people that worked there the staff is very nice and warm they get busy around noon to two and then again at 4:30 to 6
good,temp job good place to work though... great job for a teen starting out... def will need another job to meet living requirements..... but good if you are a roommate and the full responsibility isnt all on you
good,"It was an high school experience only. They don’t pay enough for the type of work that is required. Poor management skills, managers belittle some employees."
good,"I would clock in and go on the grill, to grill burgers, bake bacon, wash dishes, baking fries, chicken. I had to change the trash and clean the dining area."
good,I liked working here but I would like to do something else. The job was very faced paced during the lunch around and slow during morning hours. I liked working with other people.
good,"I love being a leader who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way... In all universal aspects. Working several locations and having the opportunity to meet several people has had a huge workforce influence."
good,Wendy's takes advantage of their hard working employees and is lienient with their slackers. The franchise company I worked for only gave bonuses to the GM and not every manager like the franchise company before them. It makes the GM ride everyone while they sit in their office cashing the checks.
good,"I would have liked to have been trained a day longer or so.  "
good,Wendys would provide benefits. It’s was fast paced and busy all the time. It was fun to work and make food. Wendys would become a big team and sometimes closer to family.
good,Working at Wendy's taught me many things. I grew as a person working at Wendy's and as an individual. If the pay was higher than the work would be worth it.
good,"A typical work day could go both ways , you would have the manager sitting on their behind not helping other work members. I learned you have to do it yourself if you want the job done , no work ethic at all. Hardest part of the job was training myself & catching up on things so we don't be behind. I had to watch others so I know what to do for the work day. The managements was not good , you could ask for a certain day off & have your reason & he'll end up giving you a whole week off."
good,"it is what it is food quality is great but for sure employees should make more, pay scale and raises can be deceiving. sometime .05-.10 cent raises every 6 months"
good,Wendy’s is a good place to work. You have to be able to be a team and work well with others. It’s a great job for teenagers and students in school who want to work.
good,"I am looking to change careers and move on into the manufacturing field. My job as a manager. I am responsible for getting everyone time in on time, making the work schedule for the week, hiring as well as firing as need be.  Making sure the store stays clean and we pass the inspection each and every time.  I take a lot of pride in what I do and I expect my employees to do the same."
good,It's just not for me anymore. Want to do something i love. I love helping out people and being useful.  Wendy's just don't need me anymore so its time for me to leave.
good,It’s for a person who know how to handle a lot of situations at once and having a face pace it’s was easy for me to stay on focus u build team working skills
good,Wendy’s employees are always happy. So happy employees makes happy customers. Customers are always right policy so we do our best to keep customers faithful customers to our place of business.
good,A typical day of work starts out slow then quickly builds into a mob of people which takes a couple hours to peter out till the dinner rush which isn't quite as bad. I learned that I need to be able to multi task and be capable of performing many different and barely related task.
good,it was a ok job to have as a high school student. a typical day at work would be energetic and up beat constantly. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's for the time being that I was with them. The other employees and management were cordial and wam and the customers were usually cooperative and friendly. Each day would pose a challenge for me, but I always did my best to try and work through using whatever problem-solving skills I could use and with the help of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was that the pace, like with most food-service jobs, was very quick. I was able to adapt most times despite the unexpected problems that would pop up. The most enjoyable part of the job was the yummy food served that we got to eat like the saladds and burgers"
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work. But it when it comes to lunch rush, there is no help from managers. They will just see you rush to do things and they would just sit in the office using their phones."
good,Easiest part of the job is ensuring the work place is clean and clutter free. The hardest part is making sure everyone is happy. Lesson learned; you cannot please everyone.
good,Poor management style.  Never received training.  Didn't enforce proper handwashing and sanitation practices.  Didn't hold crew accountable if they didn't show up.
good,"Don’t play around a lot."
good,"well in the morning are faster then the nights, the people are nice good to get along, also theres a lot of cleaning but easy. the hardest is not to get mad at the customer "
good,"A typical day at work leading crew, preparing food  and providing quality customer service in a fast paced setting was generally pleasant and rewarding."
good,"this is a fast paced position where you can learn great customer care, and learn how to be a good team player. great opportunity. I cashed out customers, clean lobby and bathrooms, and keep a smile on my face."
good,"Wendy's was a fast paced job, manager was helpful and pushes you to do better.  coworkers were easy to get along with and there were no issues. Customers were always satisfied with my service."
good,"I haven't worked here for 13 years, but when I did, I enjoyed it. I learned a lot while I was there. I always thought Wendy's was one of the cleaner fast food restaurants to work for."
good,"It was fun but its gets stressful when it get packed. I learned how to cook, make burgers, and get along with new people. The hardest part of the job was the rush hour."
good,Had no vacation days or paid days off and no benefits and the work hours were limited to 30 per week.  Benefits are very important in a work environment.
good,"It is a great place to start your career.  There are a lot of opportunities to expand your skillset, but the organization has gone through so many cost saving initiatives that the work-life balance has become very poor and has created a culture where there is limited room for advancement."
good,My boss was a good boss. I advanced quickly so i feel that they do offer advancement to good employees who deserve it. The pay wasnt great but there was plenty of hours offered.
good,"My time at Wendy's was an experience. It was my first job, I had a great time working there the people i work with was nice and support my manager showed leadership, but the was in the beginning, during my last two months working there the general manager change and there was some new managers. During this there was a lack of work being taken place while i was one of the main people coming in an hour or two early and leaving and hour or two late sometimes not having a break. At certain point I had enough so i quit."
good,It was a bit much for me. The manager was not very reasonable and aggressive. There were many days that I just wanted to quit and call it a day because I was being treated unfairly.
good,Working different shifts through out Barrie and areas was good experience. Dealing with customers complaints and staff was good experience. It was fun
good,it was pretty hard labor... need a lot of strength to get the jobs done.. So i would say need to be physically strong... it was not to bad not to good.. just alright..
good,"HArdwork "
good,Working at Wendys was fun but sometimes very stressful and cut-throat. During busy times people would get stresed and upset but in the slower work prouctive times of the shift t was enjoyable.
good,I love working with food.. I like being around customers. It can be very stressful because you have to move on a fast pace and greet and thank every customer
good,"Besides the management and lack of benefits, I was a good experience. I learned that you're recognized for the extra work you put into a company. Also that there is always someone important looking at the extra effort you put in and it will not go unrecognized."
good,Ok place to work .Managers are cool and team members are too bit this is a place where you have to bite your tongue and stay humble. The supervisors are all related.
good,"I have been working at Wendy's full-time (More than a year)"
good,"I haven't worked with Wendy's since 2014, so don't really know what to say about them. I enjoyed working there but the pay wasn't enough to survive on my own"
good,"Wendys was a alright job I was surrounded by people my ago so of course I wanted to work there, but the pay was horrible for all the stuff I was doing"
good,Just want paying enough and the managers plays too much with the kids.you don't get any respect from anybody at the work place I'm just ready to move to bigger and better
good,"Working at wendy's is annoying. You meet some interesting people, theres always a rush and I work with Lazy people. Some days are better than others. You learn to like, but then something happens where you hate it again."
good,trabajar bajo presión y mucha tensión con los clientes
good,enjoyable place to work learning experience. workplace culture. i learn customer service and how to cook within the parameters. I pass inspections with ease.
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's the staff was nice, management was very helpful. If you ever needed help a crew member was there helping. I liked working cause you was always had something to do or you wouldn't be bored."
good,"Go to work and making sure our customers are always first is our policy. I feel it is a great place for someone to start a career and get the experience of responsibility of being on time, customer service."
good,"Does not take employees thoughts, concerns or suggestions into consideration, will make rash decisions due to personal views. The owner is very hands on and isn't afraid to get dirty. Pay does not compensate to the cost of living."
good,My position as the grill cook was a hard/ stressful job. I wasn’t able to choose what I wanted to work as. When the job would get stressful sometimes the manager would yell at me.
good,It was a great starting job but nothing more than that. I wouldn't be able to see myself growing with the company. The money was minimum wage and it was hard to sustain myself with just that one job.
good,"Clock in, get handed instruction for first few tasks almost immediately. Management was strict. No breaks, not even 15 minutes to grab a drink or quick snack. When I asked for more hours they refused because they had too many workers, not flexible at all. Hardest part of job was not eating anything almost every shift. Most enjoyable part of job was giving people their orders and seeing the customers enjoy it in front of me."
good,Management wasn't really great to me because you couldn't really reserve a day off for family situations easily and would most likely end up working on the day you requested off even if you rarely ask for days off.
good,"Financially-speaking, Wendy's isn't a good place to stay long-term. However, it is the perfect working place to get your feet off the ground, or if you're looking for a first job to make some disposable income. It's also a great place to work as a college student, because the hours are flexible. "
good,"no activities are provided.A TYPICAL WORKDAY IS 10-15 HOURS."
good,It was OK what I want to care again probably not I don’t care for fast food restaurant to be working at in the beginning not necessarily in my line of work but it may fit someone else who knows different strokes for different folks
good,It has been years since I have worked here. Guess I enjoyed working with the staff and the customers were always nice and had great hours. Pay back then was different but still eat there seems friendly and nice still.
good,"Wendy's was a workplace that was very challenging because of the team members not working together, such as communication which is super important in a work place that is always busy like wendy's"
good,It was okay for a first job. It got me started in customer service and helped me gain experience for my next jobs. I wouldn't recommend it to any one not started out working
good,"At work I have discovered new ways of interacting with customers and people of all cultures.  At sometimes one of my supervisors was racist but I got had to continue on with my day and proceed to give excellent customer service.  Very fast paced to work and sometimes could be stressful when wrong things were made and customers were upset.  What I enjoyed most of being apart of the Wendy's Crew was being a drive thru coordinator (making drinks, bagging food) or even taking the orders and exchanging money (cashier or drive thru which also handled doing the dishes as a dishwasher)"
good,"wendys was a very nice company, everyone there was great, we got along very well.it was a easy going place not to hard to say anything good here. The hardest part is probably having alot of young kids working for you, They think they can do anything they want."
good,"it was busy during lunch and dinner time. But working there is much fun because you get close to your crew members. Also, you get 50% off on your lunch when you work"
good,I enjoy working here. It’s a very positive environment to be in. I say the people who work there make it a place of business you’d want to come work at .
good,"wendys has taught me a lot of my knowledge I have today, excellent company to work for and grow.thier is always room to grow within.overall good compnay"
good,"I enjoyed working there at first. There was alot of drama though and to many people but not enough hours. The manager was great, I really liked her. The pay wasn't that great. I did like the fast pace work though."
good,I liked the job a lot becuase they gave me a lot of hours but the only thing i didnt like was the management. one manager openly cursed at me when it was my 3rd week working and it was a friday afternoon and it was extremely busy. This would have been a permanent job if the managers would have gotten better.
good,"make and cook food"
good,The expectations that they hold their employees or managers to are not consistent and gives everyone mixed signals of what is expected because one can get away with something while someone else cannot do the same thing without repercussions.
good,The managers I work with are pretty cool it's just stressful when we have higher management come. When higher management is there the managers are in more stress causing the crew to get stressed out more.
good,"wendys is a great company to work for, they have competitive pay, great management, the employees are very easily to work with. my boss was very knowledgeable of his job."
good,"I met a lot of new people and experienced some new things. It was just a job to keep me helping the person I was living with at the time. The manager was pretty nice, but didn't provide me with enough hours or pay."
good,"good job, nice people, fun to work there, good experience, good food, clean place, close to home, on the bus line, near he mall, fast drive through service"
good,"working here was very challenging, some customers just want to ruin your day and you just have to show them kindness,its nice to see all the team work when the restaurant was super busy."
good,"You just have to do your work and be on task. You have to make sure everything is done properly such as orders , meals , drinks and cash.  Be polite and smile"
good,It wasn't terrible. It was a job and I wasn't trying to pay bills with the income so I can't complain. Obviously it's not enough to live off of but it's enough for someone who got their first job.
good,I don't usually recommend a fast food job but Wendy's wasn't a bad place to work. I was a cashier most days so it wasn't horrible but it had it's days like any job.
good,"Currently the benefits have been reduced, "
good,Some stores seem to stand out more than others. When i worked for wendy's the management wasnt all that great. I also witnessed aome thinvs tjat make me not even want to eat fast food. Some times u have to realize that some things just aint for u.
good,Co workers become like family. like a big dysfunctional family who all care about one another but dont necessarily get along.can be fun work environment to work in but can also be intense and stressful.
good,"I was a shift supervisor with this company and worked a lot of hours for little pay,Very face paced job and able to work with the public was nice. hours we all over the place."
good,It's a good place fur high school kids not for older one but a good place to workto make a little money on the side nice to eat sometimes good i like it but was no money for me
good,Quick paced every day with many customers coming . I learned many positions at my work place and used my communication skills everyday with a customer. Managers a nice and fun to be with. The hardest part of the job is uncooperative customers. It is fun being there with the fellow coworkers.
good,if you need a job while your in school this would be the perfect fit for you . unless your trying to become a manager there is not much advancement in the cashier postion
good,"I only took this job because I needed a job that could work with my school schedule and it ended up that it's a job that is not right for me. I'm sure for high school kids or kids right out of high school it is a great starting point, but for me, coming from jobs that had more respect, this was hard for me to do. Customers really judge you for working there and the management could be improved."
good,"Working here was alright, the fellow staff were friendly but the customers could be unbearable at times. Imagine how cranky people are at a normal fast food restaurant. Now imagine that, but they're sick, or waiting on someone sick or injured, and in a hospital."
good,"While working at Wendy's I had the opportunity to enhance and exceed at my customer service skills and my communication skills by working as a team while satisfying all customer needs and and successfuly completing requests safely and on time. I exceeded at my problem solving skills in a fast paced environment while emanating a positive attitude for a positive environment. Always working by the safety guidelines and keeping up with all safety regulation updates. Promote new items, discounts and seasonal promotions until canceled."
good,Working at Wendy's was my first job and it taught me a lot about myself. I learned what I need to work on which can improve my overall personality and make me very likable and allows me to stand out.
good,"It was very stressful a lot and a lot of crew and managers would be sneaky and talk about everyone else's business with everyone. I learned not to trust too many people and just go in, do your job and then leave."
good,Enthusiastic work environment. collaborative and team work spirit. very comprehensive management always helping each crem member to give his best while concentrate on the work in a relaxe atmosphere
good,You have to work with a variety of people and many have no interest in doing their job or giving good customer service which can make your job very challenging. I do appreciate Wendy's food quality and cleanliness.
good,"the job was alright to work at if you love helping rude costumers and poor pay, not much to enjoy working there good for high school kids to work and earn easy money"
good,Wendy’s is a good company to work first as a first job. It can be very fun. It is very face pace and at all times you most stay positive and have great customer service.
good,The owner was a good person. He cared about the business. The restaurant was kept to standards that made working there easy. The district manager was actively assisting where and when needed.
good,Very slow pace job at most times gets busy at night time because of the lack of workers on a shift lots of changes but pretty good management now . Good job overall
good,busy daytime. I learned teamwork at Wendy's. The job was easy.you are set to one position. It was a positive environment. Everyone knew their task. we worked well together.
good,Typical day is good but horrible if you have a bad manager. fastfood is to much stress. i learned to work at a quicker pace and how to be quick paced.
good,Gm was rude and always went back to change your schedule it was fun at times but i did not like the fact that they would often leave me to do the work myself
good,"Fast paced job, stressful but easy to handle. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers and their needs/giving them what they want fast enough. The most enjoyable part was helping out customers and them having satisfaction."
good,Was a fast paced job could be very stressful sometimes being that it was located right beside a local mall. The breaks were 30 minutes. I cross trained in a lot of areas did get an pay raise before i left on .50 cents
good,wendy's is a decent place for someone who is just starting out in the workforce. it was a pretty good first job and I would recommend it to others. it wasn't nessacilriy fun but it paid over minimum wage.
good,It was a friendly place to work meeting new people getting to know new people a very very fun place to work you get all your hours and . It's a respectable place to work
good,"A typical day at work would consist to everyday costumers. i have learned many different skills after working there for about 6 years. Managers are alright, everyone has bad days at time."
good,"Work from 6am until 7pm. I have learned to a lot of patience. Management wise I am usally the one who gets a call to help out when they can't figure something out or need help to run other stores.The most enjoyable part about my job is the employee's, I like to teach the new things."
good,"I loved it my first year of working there. Its great for getting as many hours as you want although it can be stressful and there will always be people that you just won't be able to stand, but I suppose that is true for all types of work."
good,A typical day for working at Wendy's i would clock in and go wash my hands and go straight to the grill . i would grill all the meat patties and chicken . I would pass the meat patties to the sandwich maker. once it was near closing time i would take apart the grill and clean the grill off... then i would sweep and mop the floors and make sure the freezer is restocked and organized
good,"this is a fast food restaurant.It has been several years since I worked there.This was a fairly nice place to work,with room for advancement within the company."
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and making decisions based on the situation to help resolve any issues. I learned how to speak to both employees and customers in a way which is inviting and truthful to comfort them in knowing they will get what they want
good,L'employeur nous formes convenablement nous permettant d'être à l'aise dans notre travail.
good,"Quick Paced, good hours, the manager is awesome and worked with me numerous times on my scheduling. I eventually had to leave because i had complications with my pregnancy but i would definitely go back there if I was hired."
good,The day would start off with a rush that would last more than 5 hours. I would stock the inventory and operate the drive thru and front counter register.
good,"When I worked at Wendy, I worked the window working with the cash register, taking cash, giving out there change, taking orders, if needed help, I also helped cleaning, restocking items."
good,"On your feet non-stop."
good,I feel its fast food so anybody who is looking just to start working Wendy's is a great job. Its pretty simple but also teaches how to work with a team.
good,"For the most part it was all good just the hours,    but the.   management in the co-workers were good.   And I also.   didn't mind.    the fast pace."
good,Can sometimes be very stressful and at other times be very enjoyable. Mostly depends on the attitude you show up to work with. Takes a ton of patience.
good,It was a good learning experience. It was just a first job to learn about the workforce. I learned valuable people skills and employees and ma augment were wonderful.
good,"Working for Wendy's was just a temporary job, but I like working for the company and the people I work with we're good people. Met alot nice customer too"
good,It's a fast-paced work place you have your typical rushes. The management team is great and push you to strive for goals and the employes are nice and make a work day better.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy. the people I worked with were great fun. It can get really busy and stressful but we managed to pull through it. i would recommend this job for students.
good,Working for a fast food company isn't as easy as it sounds. as a cashier you double as a janitor and if theres messes in the bathroom then expect to be the one to have to clean them
good,"Wendy's was an okay place to work. People were not as friendly, and some hard to work with at the time. I have no idea what the work place is like now, maybe its better!"
good,"- I worked at Wendy's from 15 - 19 years old. It was a great place to work as a teenager who did not have any real bills to pay and just wanted a little money to get by. "
good,"It was the best people, crew, management, supervisors and store manager, we were a team, skills, communication, and a lot of friendship willing to offer you a hand to help you out to do your job"
good,I like the atmosphere but I need more hours and pay and they couldn't provide that for me so I left. Would love to work there again if offered the Pay and hours needed.
good,"Wendy's is a good first job, it gives you customer service experience and the possibility to learn how to manipulate a cash register or other skills. However, hours are very fixed and, unfortunately, not very flexible."
good,hard workers but never receive good feed back its drama managers are poor at the work the do they rush you into management and you become salaried where they can take your money for food cost and labor cost i was a hard worker and got rush into promotion my first few weeks of being there but i accepted it and learned from my mistakes i was paid fairly as a crew member when i became manger my pay starting changing
good,I worked with a lot of great people and everyone was great at helping each other out when needed. I learned how to be the best manager I could and to push others to be great as well.
good,"Its fast paced and you meet a lot of different people. Hours are pretty flexible. It teaches you how to multitask and manage your money. Overall, it's a decent job to work at."
good,Working at Wendy's was different to me. only because I was 16 and needed a job at the time. The longer I was there the better the service became and I could relate to the customers. I've learned how to be more comfortable with myself. The job itself is not a problem only if you do your job the way how it's suppose to be done.
good,"Good for first jobs, but is full of drama and high-schoolers, not worth the pay or hours you are given to deal with any of it. other than that its okay"
good,"I wasn't there very long but while I was there I did enjoy working there, the staff was friendly and fun people to work with. management was fair and very understanding people."
good,Working front cashier and daily cleaning
good,I was in school so it was okay for high school. I would not want it for a career. Fast food equals fast pace and customer oriented. Real customer service.
good,"For the most part it was a laid back company to work for. Some of the management could definitely been better. I feel like some of the crew could of done their job better, and was never credited for it."
good,a typical day as a cashier at wendys was simple. I just took orders and made sandwiches. Sometimes it can be stressful because hungry customers can be rude.
good,I enjoyed working because I learned some experience. I enjoyed working. It was tough at times but I always pulled through. I am ready for my next job.
good,the work place was safe friendly it was always nice and busy the costumes injoyed the food and thanked the crew and leave but the most fun was meeting my co workers
good,"not too bad, fast paced. hard workers, bad hours. the schedule is usually delayed, never really enough people on one shift or theres too many people on one shift"
good,Wendy's is what you would expect from working in a fast food restaurant. Fast paced. Stressful during busy hours. It wasn't fun having to close every night.
good,A great first Job for young teens looking to make some cash. The environment is clean and friendly. A great first job. Nothing too fast paced. Very easy if you know how to stay on task.
good,"If you are going to school it is good for extra money and part time hrs,  teaches you many different jobs and skils.  Teaches you how to interact with people."
good,Good job experience for beginner.My job was to greet customer and take orders.I server the customer fresh french fries.I aslo problem solve if there any wrong.
good,it was a high school job i do not remember much about. It was a normal burger shop job like every other place. They worked with my high school schedule and i ended up liking it.
good,All the employees were childish and always goofing around many of the jobs were handed to more than 1 person and all the positions were usually worked by less than 2-3 employees which stresses out the worker
good,"Great job to have if your looking for lots of different tasks to do, and also looking for a fast paced challenging work environment. "
good,The employees always brought personal matters to work and this made it challenging to actually focus on our tasks. The management seemed to never be on the same page and this was frustrating.
good,I learned to respect other people especially  the customers and co workers. And self confidence to face any trial comes. Loves your jobs and willing to learned more.
good,"It has been a very long time since i have worked for this company. I have no idea what they are like now, but i am sure they have only got better with their endeavors."
good,"lovely place to work, always clean and kept. Managers were great to work under and the employees are a blast to be around. Wendy's also has great food and is always  fresh"
good,it can be a fun environment but management is bipolar due to lack of communication. it can be stressful at times but never routine.and sometimes dealing with difficult customers
good,The managers are nice and try to work around your schedule. It is a clean restaurant to work at and to eat at. I don't think they paid as well as other fast food places.
good,"This was an alright place to work for a first job, learning about money and learning about how to interact with customers. the manager was good to work for."
good,"I liked Wendy's it was a decent place to work for and the boss was laid back and cool hardly ever had a bad thing to say to the workers"
good,its an ok job for when times are tough and difficult to find anything else. with the right managers it can be a fun environment to work in. the long hours when closing can be a pain and dealing with grease is a downside. however it has been a generally good place to work for me.
good,"I constantly either closed or opened. Rarely had mid-day shifts. Dishwasher and cashier. A lot of back and forth, with little breathing time. It was not a long-term job, but it did well for the short run."
good,it was very full most of the time it was nice working there I worked with all kinds of culture and nationalities it was a real challenge to learn new things
good,Everyday at work i always had learned something new . There were times when i needed help or im having a difficult time setting something up.  At first the employees  would help me with some things on how setting it up eventually I got the hang of it and it was just turned out to be an everyday thing . Theres is nothing hard about a job . I always like things done with work or not . I love to smile at our cilents and wave them goodbye and to have a nice day .  It's important for me is when i know they had ate something at my store.
good,"This was my first job while I was in high school, it wasn't memorable. It was just fast food. My only gripe was that I didn't get as many hours that I wanted."
good,"its alright to work here, its a tough job but at the end of the day you will still have a job. you just have to be nice and friendly to the rest of your employees and your customers."
good,"Its an ok place to work, Just not what I was wanting to do the rest of my life. Co workers was nice and always helped each other. I did enjoy closing."
good,"usually busy but sometimes we have slow dyas. very clean and organized. management is laid back. works with your schedule. cant stand around, you have look busy and find something to do."
good,"At wendys, I was expected to do alot for little to no compensation. For an average person just getting into the workplace this may be acceptable, but with someone with more experience, not as much. Cleanliness is a must as is having great customer service skills. You must know how to control yourself around a irritable or upset customer as well as knowing how to resolve it. It can be difficult for the average worker, but it builds character. If you are willing to move fast you will love this."
good,Its an okay place to work at if you don't mind being stuck at minimum wage for years but the people can be fun to work with and the hours are steady just the pay could be better
good,"In this fast pace environment you will learn how to be accurate, quick, and communicate with people of different backgrounds and walks of life while fulfilling a basic need in their lives food."
good,Wendy's is a fast food restaurant. I would recommend this job to someone to just starting out working. It's a job paying minimum wage so it's not that much but it's more than nothing.
good,"It was fine. Pay was decent, plenty of hours.  Management was fairly inconsistent.  Corporate doesnt know what they're doing.  But employees were treated fairly"
good,I worked at both locations and each is fdofferent bc both were ran by two different people it’s what you make out of working at a fast food restaurants. Just make sure to stay on top of what you need to do and stay focused.
good,"very stressful... I managed to be able to help others with tasks.im a hard worker, fun to be around and I would never work at Wendy's ever again. not a good starting job doesn't pay enough."
good,"Typical Wendy's, not a long term option but a good entry start. Management is fair and co-workers typically make it a good environment. Better suited for high school students rather than adults."
good,"Fast paced............"
good,Never have time for myself or my family and I’m always tired because they have me work extra long shifts like ten hour shifts. They’d have me work 4 8 hours shifts and a 10 hour shift
good,"Although I did not like the General Manager's attitude, she was very helpful on how to improve my working skill. I learned how to use a cash register, mulittasked better, and showed me ways on how to excel in my experience at working for a fast food restaurant."
good,"Every day is a long day, even during the week is long. No time for talking unless its a question about food. Never left the store at the time you were suppose to be off. Sometimes 3 in the morning were walking out the building. Tiredsome"
good,Most of my time was either spent on grill or drive thru.  Quite stressful when you are trying to learn everything but once you get the hang of it its not to bad.
good,Need to hire better management to have successful workers and a better team members. Was a privilege to work there. I appreciate the job and was sad to leave but needed a change of environment.
good,some times i dont know the people at Wendy are still working because some people are lazy and expect other workers to do there job for someone and get mad at the hours that they receive for the week ? and the older people is taking all the hours
good,"It was a fast food job, I'm not sure what else to say. It wasn't the best job, it wasn't the worst job. It was a good job for me as a high school student."
good,"The manager was not good, the wage was unfair,  unfavorable conditions. I would not recommend working here if you are trying to make a living. It is an okay job to get on your feet but would not recommend making a living out of it."
good,"it was an okay job, would not recommend it to some over the age of 20.co workers were fine but pay was bad. management was decent though depending what shift you had."
good,"Explotan mucho al personal, pero ofrecen crecimiento laboral"
good,its a good job for someone who is just starting their career journey or someone who is driven enough to move through the ranks and get into management. can be very stressful.
good,Should try working its great for moms and dads  who needs a job we work together help each other and we work fast because it's a fast food restaurant anyways right
good,Very understaffed and restaurant is not run correctly. Not an environment someone wants to come to work at every day. Very quick paced though it taught me how to work very quickly.
good,I would recommend this job to others they had decent pay and management was also okay benefits was not bad either but was also a long time ago when I work there I do not know how it is now
good,I looked forward to going to work everyday for this was my first official job (first job was selling knives). I am forever grateful for the experience. Management was unprofessional
good,"Working at Wendy's, I learned what it is like to work at a fast paced workplace. One of the best parts of the job was meeting new people and learning how to work together with everyone. The management was not so great but they would try their best, one of the hardest parts about working here was when there was not enough staff working and having to multi task various jobs no matter how difficult it was. This was a great place for me to interact with the customers and learn how to have good customer service and give them the best experience possible when they visit."
good,"Wendy’s showed me another side , I never ate Wendy’s until I started working there and they came out wit some pretty good food I loved the ghost fries even though I made them my own way"

good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's restaurant as a young male starting out in the work force. There were many hours that you can work to earn extra income for yourself. A typical day at Wendy's was busy from beginning to end. This keep your day moving.Never a dull moment.The hardest part of this job was I would work so hard, and put in many hours, and don't get paid. You shouldn't have to email the company for 2-3 weeks to get your pay check. The Management Team needs a little more training."
good,"Typical fast food job, i did enjoy working at wendys but it just sometimes entailed me cooking, making the food, bagging it, and taking care of customers.  Becomes a bit overwhelming after working at this job for awhile because you learn how to do everything and expected to be able to do everything."
good,"you can move up if you try hard and show them you have adesire to. its a fun place to work at the crew like to party hardy espicaly at Christmas time wooho, but don't go out behind the dumster after dark unless you want to get high high but hay mabe you like that i don't and any how for the most the work is not hard at all but you get some lazy people who i guess think they can clock in and go hide or get some one else to do it if i waite long enough or after i yell i needa enough some one will."
good,"Everyone is very competetive and the hours given to me were not enough at all. They gave me about 12 hours a week if I was lucky. However, my manager was very nice."
good,"Wendy's Restaurant is a good place to work it allow u to learn a lot and how to handle situation. Working there helped me to learned a lot, the hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy when it gets really you have to manage your station and make sure everything runs accordingly  not saying there wont be problems but your job is to help everyone when you can. Otherwise its a fun place to work it teaches you a lot on how to deal with customers when they starts to act up, the customers always comes first so if they have an issue its your job to fix it and make sure they're ok after everything."
good,"This was my worst job experience so far in my life, I did my best but the main boss' attitude towards me forced me to go find something else. Lucky for me it wasn't a job I planned on staying at for too long."

good,Working at Wendy's was like a family. We had our brothers and sisters that we fought with and we loved. Never felt I was ever underpaid. Or mistreated
good,"I generally enjoyed working at Wendy's, I was sad to leave. It was my first real job, it gave me real world experience, and taught me what the work place is supposed to be like. My work day usually was running a til or the drive thru window. the management was friendly and flexible, especially with my schooling."
good,working at wendy's i recevied a leaning experience on how to really work at an really quick step environment and better my skills as a everyday worker

good,"It was a little bit stressful, I got a lot of racist people there so that was not very nice.......I had to work at a fast paced but over all I got experience."
good,"Interviewed and hired employees. Provided and evaluated their training. Educated the employees on the Wendy's philosophy. Enjoyed helping to instill work pride in the employees and respect for the customers. Enjoyed the interaction with public, the paying customer."
good,"It was a fast food job. The pay was ok, work was fast. Surprisingly they had vacation days, a 401k, and pay raises. But only if you stay at the job for over a year, and where 18 or older."
good,Wendy’s was a job to start off with. You can move up in Wendy’s also. It can be a bit much for the lil pay. The pay need to be a lil more then min wage.
good,"Sometimes, it is busy at work. I learned being a cashier, making sandwiches, and handling drive-thru. the hardest part of the job is being a sandwich maker."
good,"Working at Wendy's was very fun. I got along well with all co workers and managers, which made the job easier.  The longer you work and stay engaged in your position, the more you learn everyday"
good,"Wendy's in the Edgewood Town Center preceded its reputation "
good,Typical day at work was preparing food and making food. I learned team-working skills and food making skills. The hardest part of the job was the food preparing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that worked there.
good,"In my year working here, I have learned so much from my co-workers and supervisors, have gained experience in my field, and have met some amazing people. I love how flexible they are with my schedule and how they give feedback about your work."
good,"I don't know what to say except that you get what you would usually expect from a fast food restaurant. Cruddy benefits, stressful job. You begin to dread coming into work. You get sick and tired of junk food covered in grease. The usual."
good,"Wendys was my first job , it wasnt hard or easy . but the pay did not match the work that i was doin . i would have liked it much better if i was getting paid every week."
good,"I worked the front register, drive thru, I bagged, did fries,  and Worked grill. Dealt with customers, helped closed the store. Cleaned, took out trash and made sandwiches, etc"
good,"For a job for a high school student looking to work in the summer and in the evenings during the school year, the job is fine.  I learned to be on time and to do a job to the best of my ability.  Some of the managers were very good and very helpful.  They offered to send me to become a manager for their company but food service was not the job that I intended to do as a future career.  A typical day was working at the counter or drive thru and giving quality service and to clean the dining room and work on the operation of the machines in the kitchen."
good,"Start work clock in and take orders or sometimes bring customers food I really didn’t learn nuin new "
good,"I spent six years working for Wendy's and loved it. I really only quit this job because the District manager wouldn't pay me what I really needed to be paid, and I'm not saying that just because I didn't think I was being paid enough. I say this because I was more qualified than other managers and was still being paid the same as them. I was servsafe certified for two years and was able to run a shift by myself and was making the same amount of money as a manager in TRAINING. A manager, that as soon as she passed her servsafe would get a raise, and hadn't been with the company for that long. I felt cheated and disrespected so I found employment elsewhere."
good,This job is really nice and it helped me open my social skills. I really like everyone and the job task at hand. Not to bad of a job. I would recommend to friends
good,"a typical day at work was peaceful. We worked as a team. My wife was my manager and everyone loved her. We operated as a unit and"
good,Good start out job to get some experience. Didn't like waiting on the next person to come in when my shift was long over. but overall it was a decent job
good,"I just dont like fast food personally. Not bad by any means. Can get hectic at times, due to customer demand. Pay was what made me quit. I didnt get paid but maybe 200 each check. I couldnt live off of it."
good,Fast paced job with good people can be fun at times but can also long hours 6 am to 6 pm.  Not good if you have a family to go home to but still a good place.
good,Was a very up beat fast paced job you have to be on it toes and pay attention have fun but not to much that your not working keep a smile on your face have good customer service.
good,Could be better if we weren’t always short staffed and over worked. Don’t know when you will get a raise and communication is not the best.It was my first job and now I’m seeking better.
good,"What I learned at Wendy's was how to do schedule, food order, deal with many employees and all the differences that they have, Managing time and team work."
good,"Loved the job and the work. Loved my manager and team players, enjoyed the customers. The environment was amazing and job was easy. Pay was small but it is fast food"
good,The food is great and served on time cleanings is great love the customers the managers were on point the employees where on point fun place to work love it there
good,"its a great job for kids in high school, or college students, or people looking for a second job. As a primary source of income I wouldn't recommend it."
good,It was an ok summer job. Very stressful due to the lack of coworkers to help out. The night shift was the best due to it being less busy. Although the day shift does go by faster.
good,depending on your location and what shift your working it can be a lot of work . i learned a lot about multitasking and timing out different tasks . the management was laid back but stern and fair when needed . the hardest part of the job was multitasking and making sure all of your tasks are completed.
good,I've worked up to 14 hours in a day with no breaks. Experienced employee s were held back from progressing into managers due to lack of employees. For better pay and treatment it would be okay
good,Make sure customers left happy and made sure shifts ran smoothly and employees were safe and proper safety and food safety was in order. As well as proper moneys were in order and take inventory and stock
good,The only thing that makes the te job tolerable is that you getr to because close associates with the people who work there and they pay for you lunch.
good,Fue un buen tiempo de trabajo pero ya no esta bajo el mismo líder y ahora el ambiente laboral no está padre
good,They give you the opportunity to grwo there which I really liked. I would recommend it if it’s your first job. Fun place to work I’ve learned so much working there
good,"I closed almost 4-5 days a week it was an okay just didn't like that it was so late i learned to use my time wisely, i learned how to count inventory the management was very supportive the hardest part were the last minutes custumers"
good,Fun friendly fast paced environment with lots of different things to concentrate on making the day go by quickly. Plenty of room to grow in the company and good management willing to train majority of different areas.
good,"I learned to multi task in very busy times, made me a stronger and more efficient worker. The hardest part of the job was working nights on times when other workers call off, the most enjoyable is making customers smile and satisfied with good food quality and fast orders"
good,"After the GM level, advancement is hard to come by."
good,"Everyday Wendy was busy, i learn how to make sandwich and work drive thur cashier. The management was not on point.The hardest part at wendy theirs team work is horrible."
good,it was a fast paced place. I pretty much had to do everything there by myself. co-workers and managers didn't really help so I would be doing everything on my own the whole time.
good,They reach you and then from there they teach you to pick up your pace. The managers are very good and keep up with the communication and making sure the store is clean and up to quality. They care more than most should
good,"At this job a typical day included everything from cooking and assembling sandwiches, to cleaning and maintaining the dining area, as well as interacting with the customers."
good,I did drive thru cashier fries grill it was definitely a learning experience. During rush hours you couldn't let the drive thru get backed up and walk in you had to get the customers in and out
good,great first job or part time job.  Nothing you can support a family on but can be a great supplement income. Very fast paced work place as it is fast food.
good,They dont give you any discounts . The manager was loud and obnoxious . The team always joked around . I basically trained myself the first two weeks and they always kept me two hrs more than i belonged
good,"The manager was mean always had an attitude, the pay was low, the employees were rude and disrespectful, the manager showed favoritism, just had to much going on. I personally wouldn't work at that location ever again"
good,it is a fast pace job u are constanly busy it is fun an the team is great to work with u also prep stuff for the next shift an make sure ur area is clean before your shift is over
good,"Wendy's is a fast pace environment with many hours to offer if one needs them."
good,"great first job, fast paced fast food industry work. minimum wage pay and not much chance for advancement. best suited for people who are working on gaining experience to move forward"
good,Wendys is a decent place to work if you are willing to put the time in team work environment wide customer based competitive wages flexible schedules.
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. The work details were consistent, which allowed for a comfortably routine. I enjoyed my coworkers, and the majority of the managers.  Unfortunately toward the end, of working ar wendys my experience changed. I felt as if the store was severely compromised. The mangers certified to train Mr. Larry Berkowitz  was out for several months but the store was still ran as a training store. With the right mangers there Wendy's on southside is an excellent place to work."
good,"Working at Wendy’s was very exciting and fun. But, also very quick paced. You had to have very good customer service skills and a great attitude. Considering the fact I had both it was a very good establishment!"
good,Work's pretty fast paced. Not too bad of a place to work just a little stressful.Management team is excellent at what they do. They help where needed.
good,Like most places it depends on location and management. But it can be an incredibly fun job. I've worked with some of the best people. The company is talking about expanding and new things to come.
good,"Good to work at during highschool when you are still trying to figure yourself out, but when you have a manager who is 40 and does drugs on his break, it kind of makes you want to leave ASAP."
good,"Right out of high school it was a great temporary job. Like all fast food places, it was fast paced and full of young employees. The workplace culture is very teen based. A lot of drama between employees."
good,"Wendy's was a time based job, everything revolved around what time it was so lunch and dinner were the most crowded times and I had to have food ready before that. Any other time would be very laid back not much work going on and really relaxed, even with the occasional customer that walked in I was usually prepared."
good,I started as a crew member working the closing shift. Ended up becoming a shift supervisor and my manager worked with my school schedule. I worked with some awesome managers and crew.
good,"I would like to find another job that’s pays more and have respectful works like managers. Employees don’t come in on time, they don’t know how to work together. Managers are rude and disrespectful."
good,I did not like my experience working at the wndys on sunset. Its was just to much and they were slow paced everthing was not done how it was suppose to
good,They're are hardworkers and I appreciate every single last one of them. They made me feel like family working there. I wish them all the best in their future.
good,It was a very fast pace you had to be able to do pertly of tesk but all in all it was a very nice company to work with just need to work on being able to move up in the company quicker
good,I worked there while in high school it was far from where I lived so I had to stop working there. It was a good work environment though. I have no complaints.
good,"Great job if your a people person and hard working, on the other hand the pay is not great for the amount of responsibility’s you have, not managed properly"
good,This job mainly dealt with taking customers orders on a touch screen register. I eventually started making food and opening up the store. It was a very easy job.
good,"There were days that were extremely busy, but after a while, you'll get the hang of it. The busiest time of day was during lunch hour. You will busy all the time and you might actually make a few new friends."
good,Wendy's is a very fast paste but very productive. There's always something to do. Great place to start for newbies starting out in the work force. Would defiantly recommend for young teens.
good,As an employee once I understood the duties expected in the kitchen I quickly jumped in wherever was needed.  The job was easy going once you knew what you were doing.
good,"It is very busy all the time, and to satisfy customer needs you always have to move quickly. I learned how to take temperatures of chili and how to make some of the special drinks. I learned the differences with all the cleaning supplies. The hardest part on the job is being able to take everyone's order on the front cashier and trying to make food at the same time."
good,Nothing particularly extraordinary or exceedingly abysmal her. Just an average food service job at an average fast food restaurant. Not much else to say really.
good,"Management at the store I worked at was poor.  Loved the first store I worked for but the second lacked leadership, and fallow through from the management team."
good,"It was a very easy job, but you did have you moment when you would have a lot of customers to serve so it could be stressful sometimes. I new every position there so depending on what you would rather do depended on what your day was like. I worked as food prep and also made food for the customers. that was would be my favorite position."
good,"wendys in macedonia ,ohio was an okay place to work, lots of people kind of ran on their own agendas to benefit themselves...discounts on food was very nice"
good,I don't remember much of Wendy's because it's been such a long time since I worked there. My daughter was so young. It was the only place I could bring my daughter and I was newly remarried. Before I became shift leader I used to bring my daughter with me to work sometimes and they let me.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is running the business and meeting customer expectations. Another enjoyable thing was going above and beyond to making our customers happy.
good,I love wendys but when u tryna crame 30people in a lil spot an cut hours it wont working but all in all it was poor an fare the mangers was not on time at times but everybody done they part
good,"Minimun wage, great place to start working and get customer service experience. No complaints about management and it was a great first place to work."
good,It’s an alright place to work if you’re in the right area with the right staff. The only thing that was bad was that there were a couple rude costumers here and there.
good,it is good for multitasking working environment they have good flexible time for employees. the hardest job is being in grill person as back crew however everyone helps you out when your are behind.
good,It was my first job and great for working after school was out in high school. It's exactly like all fast food jobs. No matter how hard you work you'll get passed over for a management position and you and everything you own will smell like grease.
good,"A typical day at work includes taking orders, making food, and general sanitation duties. It is very fast paced and often stressful but, it teaches you good work ethic and how to deal with difficult people. The management I worked with made a huge impact on how I treated my future jobs. The hardest part was the angry and difficult customers. The most enjoyable was when everything ran smoothly."
good,This job was very stressful. They were dealing drugs out the back door. When I approached upper management they said to look the other way. They said that happens all the time in the city.
good,Fast paced job that requires you to deal with a lot of people on the go and in a rush. The hardest part about this job is timing. Most enjoyable part of this job is knowing u made the customer happy in a timely manner.
good,"It was an okay job, but just didn't get the hours that I wanted. They are a face paced moving company. I worked & got all the things done that they needed & then I would have to leave."
good,This company is very fast paced and they give you the basic or lowest rate that they are allowed also the improvement rate of wendy's is very low and you cant really get promoted here but really fun people though. It was fun to be there but also very frustrating at the same time.
good,"It's a great place to work but as well as any other fast food restaurant there is stress, fun, and team work all in one. You may or may not get a break, that all depends on the manager. You will probably be able to get along with most of your coworkers and some of your managers."
good,"Start to work here as a part-timer , one of the most enjoyable place I ever work friendly team , fun work our smile make us happy working without getting tired ."
good,it is an okay job. workers are friendly. sometime there are rude and very impatient customers. lunch time is the most dreadful time of the day. and customers tend to be very messy
good,the job was annoying the coworkers sucked. the whole staff was lacking. wendys was the worst job i ever had. the pay was very good and they were very flexable with school.
good,"there where great people work with everyone worked together ,the mangers ,supervisors where great at training new employers at there job .and the hours where great ."
good,The management was unfair. They talked down to you constantly. I got paid min wage. This was also my first job and its been several years since I worked here so management has changed since.
good,"I loved my time at Wendy's but i decided it was time to reach further into my career as i do wish to pursue a Culinary Arts."
good,I think all fast food jobs are relatively the same. I only worked at Wendy's while in high school. It was a great first job. I learned a lot about life.
good,"Flexible with school schedule, but demanding and fast paced. They always work my class schedule, and encourage their employees to better themselves. However, it is very fast paced and demanding."
good,Wendys had one drive thru window...so I took orders handed out money bagged my food make my drinks and hand everything out to the customers.....I was thrown on sandwiches and made them for drive thru....the only bad thing I can say was while we were short staff or very busy....most of the managers sat in the office and watched us on the cameras
good,It was a good first job for me.  I learned the basics of running a register and providing customer service to all sorts of people.  I also learned to get along with co-workers.
good,Cool place to work at or start at the environment. Is cool the workers are friendly its just a regular environment. To work at the culture is great i like it
good,I started out as Drive thru cashier and worked my way up to Assistant Manager in 5 years. I loved the people I worked with and the customers were amazing.
good,"You learn a lot of basic work place habits from working here such as TLC, counting money, working with customers, and working with coworkers. I wouldn't recommend this job for a permanent job but it is definitely a great starter job."
good,"pay was good, got a reasonable amount of hours, discount on food was great, paid training, food was fully cooked , and tasted great, coworkers were rude"
good,"Fast paced environment, not hard work unless you make it hard. Lots of menu items to remember when taking orders or preparing orders. Not a bad company to work for."
good,"Wendy's overall is a good fast food restaurant, at the time, the staff was short, leaving me with several different tasks while being on drive thru, but overall I would recommend it to any unexperienced person looking for job experience."
good,Come in get ready to work instantly. Hopefully when you get off you do not have to wait for the next person to come in so you can be released. It was a lot of drama here as well. Management changed often in  turn took a toll on crew members.
good,I took orders prepared the food counted the drawers and money for the safe and the bank I was a manager to the employees opened the store and closed the store
good,"Everyone worked together to get the job done. We have The fry person, sandwich makers, drive thru and front in cashiers we have neaty maintenance' prep people for the earlier mornings and the closers. Believe me you have to have great communication skills and make sure you give out direct orders or otherwise co-workers and customers will be misunderstood."
good,Fast food wasn’t really my cup of tea because of the low pay and no hours the mangers was Also rude and showed a lot favoritism’s and didn’t give any breaks or good benefits.
good,"They are rude to employees, dont allow enough hours, discount is 50% when i think it should be more. there is basically no where to move around hard to mover around"
good,Typical day would be you working at a register usually alone some help employees would help when things picked up. Management was always to busy smoking or outside in customers faces taking a smoke break
good,Wendys is a great place to work. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity to advance either at the franchise level or with the corporate office. with
good,"I've been working at Wendy's for three years and ten months. Wendy's was my first job as I worked there I've learned how to work under pressure, social skills and push myself harder to get my work down. when my other co-workers called out or don't come in I learned to pick up a big responsivities and take on double shifts. The management is great, the mangers are strict but respectful and hard working. The hardest part of working at Wendy's is when were short handed and a lot of customers start ordering food and were under staff, hats when we all must challenge ourselves and push through it."
good,"a typical day work is to fulfilled management tasts as well as overseeing team members throughout the day. i learn how to make speed with great customer services. management is always well trained in all faces of operations, administration, services and maintaining facility."
good,"I dint work there long. It was fast paced and I liked my coworkers. It was an okay first job. I cashiered, cleaned and interacted with customers on a daily basis."
good,"i learned how to become a great cook"
good,Wendy's was a good place to work. I learned a lot there and definitely sharpened my people skills. I wouldn't trade the experience i learned there for anything.
good,Wendy's is a good workplace when in need of a job. If you like working in a customer service and fast paced environment then you will definitely enjoy working here.
good,"Was an okay place to work, gave a lot of hours if I asked for them. The only thing that I would change about working there is the people that work there they seemed like they hired anyone."
good,"If working front cash you will take orders from customers and handle money, also be able to keep dining and bathrooms tidy. If working drive thru cash you will take orders over headset, handle cash and wash dishes."
good,business put up 11:30 and slow down maybe 1:30 .Never see the same person more then 3 times a week..It fast pace and coworkers try to do the best they can.
good,The most fun part about working at Wendy`s were the customers and my crew members. I enjoyed working at Wendy`s. It was a nice environment and fun place to work.
good,"Wendy's is Fast pasted, well managed, and has  good hrs."
good,I was 16 and very naive. It was an eye opening experience. I worked with great people for the most part. My 1st job and it was a great way for me to enter the workforce.
good,"Provided service at the register and drive thru"
good,"Report to work, wait on an available manager to clock me in. Then the manager tells me which station I would be attending for the day, Most days it was on the Drive Thru. I would take orders, collect money and hand orders thru the window. I would clean the dining area and check to make sure ladies restroom was in ok shape."
good,"Good atmosphere, food is fresh and the people there make working there very fun and exciting, the management is respectable and also very understanding"
good,Not very impressed when I was working there. They did not seem to have all ducks in a row on multiple aspects. Some friendly coworkers and some not. Could use some help with organization.
good,"Typical day includes working line making sandwiches, working fryers, working cash register, customer service, working grill, washing dishes and doing daily restaurant duties."
good,i enjoyed the job but it was verry busy and fast paced .i was only canadian one who worked there at the time so it was a bit stressful trying to communicate in high stress situations but it got better
good,I have work for several Wendy's companies I have at least 4 years experience I don't understand why I wasn't able to move up in positions as far as be a store manager that they needed to train very little
good,only get discounts with low hours and low pay no help on the clock and breaks be small . when you come back you have to restock your own and serve your own  customers
good,"Work days are usually busy. Co-workers and manager can get stressed out, but at the end of the day, things calm down and everyone walks out happily. Rush hours can be short or long, depends on the day."
good,The old manager was replaced and things went downhill. Orders were getting messed up and things were running out fast and we were using wrong size things just to get by.
good,It was a good job and for a starter job it was decent pay I hadn’t plenty of hours but it was a bad work environment and a percentage of the managers wasn’t good at all.
good,Working at Wendy's was a start for me. Wendy's was my first fast food job and during the time of working there I learned a lot of things about the food industry. There were times were I struggle but with the help of my peers I was able to get through the day. Also working here gave me the experiences of handling customer service such as having to deal with situations that involve kicking out unwanted customers. Communication and patience would be the greatest thing that I learned from working here and I have no regrets of working here.
good,this is a good first job. You work with a team of nice people. They are willing to teach you new things. When you need help on something all you had to do was ask
good,This is a place were we serve food and we had to make the order right. I work as a shift leader and had my own crew. We were always busy so we had to move really fast to get everyone's orders out on time.
good,not a bad place to work if you are willing to do the work of 3 people at one time.  Usually u will not get a break. And you have to deal with obnoxious customers all day.
good,"Working at Wendy's can be stressful at times, but for the most part it is a fairly balanced job (with stress level.) I learned to grow as a person and as a manager during my time at Wendy's. Moving up to the Restaurant Manager position definitely brought on more stress. The crew does come to bond with each other creating a friendly work environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store flowing smoothly on understaffed days and keeping everyone level headed during that time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the store move smoothly and the crew and customers leaving happy."
good,Easy to learn postions fast paced enviorment room to advance in postions easy. Somewhat coheasive crew an managers flexablie work scheduale. Not a long term job though
good,The employees didn't care about their surroundings no good leadership. No respect towards others not treating other how they wanted to be treated. We weren't being trained well.
good,"Great cowokers, good staff, fast paced environment. The typical day was fast paced but exciting. Being a manager involved managing sales quota and communicating with the employees, along with providing great customer service."
good,"working at wendy's wasn't the best. The pay was low however the hours were high. The work was stressful and quick paced, but making friends at the work place was quick from the combined hatred toward the tasks we had to complete. The job was fun, but not recommended to everybody."
good,"A typical day was providing fresh never frozen food, with a smile. Inventory and cash management was a great learning experience.  Also, you see the same people every day, to the point to you knew there name and order"
good,This was fast food and it was super fun and exciting because there was always something going on.  I laughed a lot at this job and yah... I cried too.
good,"I was just a teenager when I worked here but from what I remember my boss was fairly nice and the people I worked with where also great, I was just a sandwich maker."
good,The employees and managers wasn't as cooperative. It was more like favortism in the work place. The employees were very rude and weren't easy to work with.
good,"pretty easy when you know what you're doing, cool team to work with everybody gets along with each other. hardest part cleaning the oli or taking the oli out"
good,This organization should closely examine the choices for middle management level employees. What the founder desired the company to reflect is not well reflected in the middle management layer.
good,"●	My duties consisted of providing customer service, such as preparing clients food orders and charging. the hardest part was to deal with customers sometimes"
good,"Great place to work"
good,Wendys is a renown food chain company in north America. They have really good on the job training they tells you what they expect from the employees. But the problem is there manager are not at all friendly too much bossy.
good,"Great place to work, if you can keep up with the fast pace. Great for people that work will in a group.  Great place to work if you are a people person."
good,"it was a good first job. the people was nice hard workers, team work n good management. it a good place for a first job n it keep working n it teach u how to handle your responsibility"
good,"Very fast and update day, the normal to expect from fast food. However Wendy's in our area is exceptionally clean, detailed and handled with care by management in charge."
good,"If you open, you start by making coffee. If your store is open for breakfast I assume you help out making the hash browns and such, but our wendys was not. So I would start by making coffee. If i was cashier in the morning through lunch rush, I would stay on the register all day, sometimes making drinks and coffee. If I was a bagger during lunch rush I would pack bags and put them on trays for customers, along with their drinks. I also put chili in cups, and mixed shakes and dipped the ice cream. If I was a closer, I would help make the fries and nuggets, I would clean the lobby, I would prep for the next day's front cashier, and I would clean up the front end for the night. This cleaning included the bathrooms, lobby, behind the counter, the drink machine, and the chili warmer. Sometimes I would also help with dishes. Every cashier was responsible for counting down their own drawer. If it was under by a certain amount, you had to pay out of pocket to make up for it."
good,Was a good high school job. I wouldn't recommend to work there more than a few years. Very little opportunity to rise amongst the ranks in the store. You are better off going to college and getting an education if you want a better job.
good,"I enjoyed working here for the meantime, but it wasn't a really organized, fair, or balanced workplace. Each manager did things differently and didn't really agree on what each did. I also wasn't properly trained."
good,As with all fast food it is a very fast-paced work environment and can leave you very confused and agitated if you don't stay focused but the work experience is still rewarding and teaches you many work skill you can use in everyday life or other employers.
good,A typical day work would consist of me going to work checking on how much of the duties have been performed by the previous shift. Clocking into work. Taking around 150- 200 orders on avg. Doing my daily duties. The hardest part is having to sometimes do the duties of the previous shift before me to leave on time. Management always set out to improve customer and employee relations. While I was there I learned to take orders and sell products. What I enjoyed the most while I was the sense of teamwork while working there.
good,"I worked here for two years and I enjoyed it. My coworkers are what made it fun. My first manager was nice, but the second one was racist and sexist. I would work there again."
good,"was an alright position, was hoping to advance to management. Was unable to advance. hoping for advancement opportunities in future positions in which I may be working in"
good,"the food is good it just wasnt my type of work i ,ike everyone i worked with i made new friends and still have the same friends to this day. i wanna thank the comdany for given a chance"
good,During the busy hours it is fast paced. During the slow hours is the best time to work on catching up on your cleaning and stocking duties. Loved meeting new people.
good,honestly you cant expect fast food to be much of anything but a minimum wage job unless you can prove yourself and work you the ladder which takes quite some time to do.
good,Better appreciation for up and coming managers and potential candidates. Higher pay for management positions. Training should be taken seriously. Never should it be cut short under no circumstances.
good,"Ive learned how to operate a cash register,and fryer. The management was alright, I liked it. The hardest part about the job was the customers. most enjoyable was the free food"
good,Too much drama from all the high school kids that are hired on a regular basis. Hard to promote within when the management isnt very good either. Too much favoritism.
good,very busy and stressful. young people don't like to work these day while working in fast food. Wendy's has a high turn over rate and it's typically hard trying to run a company.
good,"This job is a great job for when you're still in high school, after that, if you arent a manager, its still worth it. The management is sometimes stressful, but they work with any schedule."
good,"Good first job for students, while also providing opportunities for advancement to a management position. Formal set of regulations and a large company ensures that employees are treated fairly."
good,"when i first started wendys it was okay. i liked the people there. it was a corporate company at first. i became a manager a few months after i started. then we became franchise, and then everything started to go downhill"
good,"The job is mostly dealing with public constantly in a busy store.  Challenges deal with staffing, policies, and expectations of higher management.  Wendy's is constantly changing with product promotions."
good,"The Wendy's I worked at was more or less average, typical customers, typical fast-paced environment. One needs to be good at taking criticism for this job and needs to be good under pressure."
good,"It is an awesome place to work if you make friends, but if you ever have an issue - it will not be dealt with by management. I was sexually harassed by a male employee and he was never fired even though he was groping female staff. This is what you can look forward to."
good,"come in at 8 start serving customers i learned how to work ah cashier and good customer service skills "
good,You have days where people love your work and days where they don’t . Just go in and mind your business and make your money like you planned on doing when you got the job . Some workers are mad they have to come in on their off day or either people that’s training make them mad .
good,It was ok.  I enjoyed working there because I learned a lot when it came to the paper work and do a little inventory as far as counting and keeping track of making sure we have enough food until the truck comes in.
good,this was my first job honestly it was just boring and paid 645 a hour but what other places do have to work at in school i was fired the first time because i was 5 minutes late with out calling and it was the first time i was late
good,"> I came in and clocked in and went to my station ."
good,"It was a nice job starting off, right after high school but the age I’m at now I can not live or benefit off it. Wendy’s has lack of hours and could only do so much with a single mother"
good,"Certain times of the day it would get super busy. I loved talking to customers, even if some were rude I never got rude back. I dealt with a deaf man and he was so sweet. Wendy's is a great place to eat. I would go back, but driving tp there from where I live the money wasn't paying for the gas. I made about $130.00 every two weeks."
good,"Nice Place to work "
good,"I got good hours for a first job, customers were ok. but the managers were a bit rude most days. they had they're days, but I still kept a smile on my face."
good,"It was a fast paced that was Adventurous. If your a fast learner like me then you can catch on quite fast. Everything is so simple ,it's all on your pace and memory"
good,"Very good , quick paced, the managers were kind for the most part. The work is stressful, and the customers were rude. But it was ok for the most part."
good,Everyone there seemed to treat it like a highschool classroom. I find myself more than not listening to gossip about nothing that pertains to the work environment.
good,"Amazing coworkers but very poorly managed, at least when I worked there anyway.Pay was decent but not worth all the work I had to do while working here."
good,"Prepared fountain drinks and ice cream items."
good,Its not somewhere you can advance but its a quick aandeasy way to make a quick pay. It is anjob that requires allot of energy and fast base people.  Over will its a decent environment.
good,"It’s a good place to work, but I am only working 3 days a week. I ain’t getting but about 24 hours in. They are really friendly and nice to work with I just need another job."
good,"In the months I worked at wendys, I moved up very quickly. Only thing was they were not paying me the right rate, for the work I was doing. Didn't stick around because if that. But I Did become LOT I cut all the fresh vegetables in the morning  hours 7am-4pm."
good,Already written a review on this one. An okay job for part time if you really need the money but other than that it isn't all that great. Every day you deal with costumers who can be really rude or can be very nice but every day you have to deal with workers as well. you can put so much hours into one place and you will grow tired of it.
good,"It was okay working here just wasn't enough hours and they always"
good,"long hours, short handed, poor upper management, low pay for employees, no benefits for hourly employees, never had effort"
good,"It was a good place to work steady hours "
good,Made sure food or patties were thoroughly cooked made sure area was clean to cook and food was put away and put on grill to cook to perfection to eat good
good,"This job is somewhat complicated, hardworking and nice at times to be working at but, it's the people with negative mind ways in the today's world of society."
good,Fast pace staff wasnt very professional but I wasn't there to make friends I was there to make money so I did my job correctly and got out of there on time
good,"The hardest part of the job is angry customers.Customers will get angry and yell at you for no reason.For example, if your food was made wrong it's no reason for you to come yell or take your anger out at everyone in the store,All you have to do is ask to speak to the manager and he/she will take care of everything."
good,I didn't like the pay at Wendy's and the managers their we're not the best they did everything they weren't supposed to be doing and they were cutting people hours for no reason at all
good,Wendy’s was very poorly managed. The hourly pay wasn’t fair in my opinion. The schedule was very unorganized. If you had to call in for whatever reason you might have recieve threats about losing your job.
good,I loved it alot of oppurtunity to advance also gave me my first oppurtunity to advance and become a shift leader. team work was very  big and made me appreciate coming to work.
good,"They tend to take managers that care and run them ragged until you're so exhausted you don't even have time or energy to look for a new job. "
good,good people to work with had fun learning everything I could in the fast food company.was able to work the shift I wanted and if my kids needed me I was able to work something out and take care of my kids.
good,Wendy's was a fast paced job and got very busy at times. You have to remain on task and keep your work area clean at all times. The food was always fresh when given to the customers.
good,its what you expect from a fast food job. you cook you clean you take orders. there was some fun people there but all in all not the best jobs. no breaks and favorites were played
good,"Wendy's is a great company with good food. I enjoyed working with different individuals and interacting with the customers. I found the hours to be difficult at times, but the pay was consistent. I felt Wendy's was a nice start in the employment world."
good,"utilizing knowledge of positional skills, customer service and courtesy health and safety regulations and all Wendy’s policies and procedures providing quality products and service in a clean in a clean and safe environment to each and every customer."
good,Its a fast food job. Deal with all the incompetence of your coworkers and bosses while just trying to make edible food fast. Its fine for highschoolers.
good,Love This place fun with animals plus with the customers loved being the event coordinator liked driving the atvs and lawn mower and zero turns fun all the way around
good,"Overall decent workplace, not an ideal job but not horrible. Things go smoothly when everyone does their job correctly. Most coworkers were okay to work with."
good,I had to schedule had to train people had to fire people manage the money had to close had to order the food product for the store do inventory had to count the inventory for the week
good,"Fast paste, The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with an unhappy customer about an order, because the job wasn't hard at all I actually enjoyed this job just wasn't enough pay or hours."
good,"A typical day at work. Just got there and start doing my sandwiches. Always in my area, trying keep it clean. Good times. But no raise, and I need id more than $7.40"
good,"Lots of discounts and i learned a lot from cashier too cooking the food and drive-thru, I also had a bit of trouble when i worked since i was only 16 and didn't have a car to get there."
good,"Fun to work, great place, very quick paced, discounted lunch.. co workers are very friendly great to talk to. Hours are flexible, easy to work around."
good,"My job responsibilities were to prepare food items consistently. I cook and serve food in appropriate time. Provided friendly customer services and heartful hospitality. I was responsible for cleaning all parts of my station and make sure all the food was properly fully stocked. Operation a cash register for cash, checks and credit cards transactions with 100% accuracy."
good,The day would start by clocking in and checking with the manager to see which position you would be working. A cashier would count their drawer. The remaining positions would just make sure that the previous employee would have prepared them for the next rush.
good,"the district manager is incapable of feeling, therefore he will not understand how to run a proper store, he'd let the team fall apart before helping the T"
good,"It really wasn't too bad at Wendy's the work was fast paced but because of good management it wasn't stressful, however the pay wasn't enough and they didn't offer any benefits"
good,"The people I worked with got along great and everything. The managers were really cool and helped me with everything I asked. It was cool, I wasnt the only one that was working my first time"
good,quick rude at the one location in oxon hill md area not sure if all the other location are like that manger let everyone do what they want and do not care if your sick
good,Eight out of ten times it is easy work when you get your work done. Our rushes are our hardest part and it doesn't last long. During rushes we all worked together and get the job done.
good,I honestly had a hard time learning from my managers and catching on to things I was supposed to be doing. It was stressful and my manager wasn't doing her job when it came to training me as a new employee.
good,"Wendy's, in my opinion, was always a nice place to work. The managers were laid back but at the same time got on you if needed to. There was great chemistry between the coworkers and the rushes were a handful but we always worked together to keep each other in the right direction."
good,Wendys is a job that I would say a first time teenager should apply for! I don't think Wendy is for adults! Their pay is very low! You do a lot of work for a little bit of nothing!
good,Fast paste job with high demands for a small pay. It is hard to progress financially in this industry.                                               .
good,You have to know how to work at a fast paced and listen at the same time. You have to have patients with customers. You have to be well hygiene and cleanliness when working and dealing with food for sanitary.
good,Good first time job. People are tuff st a fast food place. People can become lazy. Many steps to every section. Easy to get down. Good high school job
good,"Often the District Manager would hate losing talent so even if you're ready for a promotion, if there isn't a place in the district, you're denied a promotion.There's a very linear upward mobility path which hinders talent."
good,"I didn't mind working at Wendy's I just really hated the slow pace we seemed to always have. I feel like the reason it was always so slow because the employees weren't doing there job. Well there wasn't enough employees and when your short staff the load gets pushed off on the employees that are working. We would barely get our breaks; there were times when I would go my entire 8 hour shift with no break or a 10 min break, because we were so short staff. They would say they couldn't give us break because they were short staff. We called the upper management and when they showed up that's when we would get our breaks, but as soon as they left it was back to normal. I really disliked it. If it wasn't for the poor management, lack of staff and low pay I would still be working there."
good,It was a good job. Also the crew was fine they helped me with anything I needed or asked for. Everyone had manners. The upper staff were very professional an outgoing
good,"There was poor management. The number of staff members was very less. The number of customers was more. So, it created pressure among the workers. It was dissatisfactory working there."
good,Had fun working here but only because of the people I was working with. The pay didn't equal the amount of things we had to deal with. Especially the closing shifts. We had to do a lot of detailed cleaning that I thought we should've hired professionals for. But if you work any other shifts it's pretty easy.
good,Good job if looking for something entry level and for a first job or starter to your life if your willing to work hard to give yourself a good start to kife
good,"I worked there my senior year of High School to get some experience under my belt. It was okay. I'd go and work from 5pm to 11pm most nights after school, and then on the weekends. During the summer it was usually 3pm to 10pm. We had busy days and slow days, some of the coworkers were nice, others were just there to work and not socialize."
good,Worked for Wendy's for over a decade. Always a learning adventure- from new promotions to new procedures it was never dull. Favorite part of the job was team work.
good,This was a good job if you just starting out . at first company was great then they switched General Managers and it went to dumps because he didnt know how to talk to people.
good,It was okay working here once you got used to it. But the management sucks and I never got my breaks. That is why I quit. It was also stressful and people get in bad moods because its stressful.
good,I liked Wendy's the food is good the pay is not worth all the trouble and hassle you'll have to go through I would recommend this job to someone who is in high school
good,Really nice place to work if your in to food. Fast paced routine. Meet new people that you work with. Learn alot stay busy. And you also gets benefits when you work there faithfully.
good,"When I worked at Wendy's, there was constant health code violations, the sandwich makers would get grease and sauces on their gloves and smear that on your burger when making it, have u ever wondered why the bun is so greasy? It's from that. The workplace is poorly cleaned, the managers don't care if your sick they'll make you come in and they don't care whether or not you are contaminating the food. If you object even though you have a right to you may get fired and replaced with someone else like that."
good,"its a fast food restaurant, which means business often slows down and picks up, but never stops. very reliable job, but again the pay is not all that so you'd have to work crazy hours to maintain."
good,Manager expected me to do a lot of things at one time with no ones help. Made me work hours that weren't even on my schedule. I once worked from 11am-3am and then was expected to work the next day again at 9 am. I worked more hours in one day than i had to.
good,For my first job I loved it because first it was way so I would be so stressed and confused about it & there was a lot of people around my age that also worked there so you could really relate to the coworker. The manager was so nice and sweet to everyone . Everyone treated her with respect and love
good,We are busy during lunch. We are always on duty with a great manager. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people. The most fun part about wendy's is when all of  your customers walk off with a smile on their face which means you have done something right.
good,"It does get super busy at this restaurant, however the hours were a lil lacking. I did enjoy working with the staff and the customers were super friendly."
good,"12 Hour long shifts. "
good,Working for Wendy's was my first job! I literally loved going every day! I'd even go in on my off days! The crew members and managers  welcomed me in like family! Everyone was nice and cordial! We worked as a team and made sure every customer knew we enjoyed our job! I loved it! 💕
good,"I loved all management there, worked with me and were very understandable with my hours if i had to change my schedule a couple of times.I enjoyed the atmosphere and flexibility of my job."
good,The Job is very flexible with my schedule and work with my personal life. The job has friendly and supportive employees and management. I say working with the company has been ni
good,"Alot of work for minimum wage. Managers could be treated better"
good,Wendys was a very easy laid back place to work. Every position you could be put into you can easily excel at. Wendy's is also a very easy place to move up in rank if you stick to your work and stay focused and follow all rules and regulations.
good,"Every day you start with prep/goals to be done within 3 hrs. From this, I've learned time management. The work environment made sure everyone was treated like family. The hardest part was making sure everyone was showing up for work."
good,"I'm a college student. As such, minimum wage burger flipping jobs are a must at some point or another. Wendy's was a good experience, at least development wise,  not a glamourous job but in general a jobs a job."
good,It's fast food. Hours weren't what were needed and there were no benefits. Definitely not enough to live on. Needed to have a second job. Good for when you have to school
good,I worked here when I was 16. It was an okay job for a teenager but I do not like working with food so it was not for me. The crew I worked with was great though.
good,"This was a great experience I wish I could work some more, the manager there was great she worked with me. The business was fast paced which I love and the customers were great."
good,"Waiting on the customers, making sure that the dinningroom was clean, making sure that the bathrooms were clean. I learn alot from the job and that is to treat people like human being. I told the manager what was going about workers playing on their phone an standing around with the others workers while I was cleaning and she never did anything about it. Learning different areas of wendy's. Getting ready for exspectation day. We had to clean everything in the building.  Their was nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed the customers coming in sand waiting on them."
good,I have learned more about fast food restaurant cooking. Replenishing stock has a certain order to follow. Taking customers orders was challenging and fun.
good,I really didn't like working with them I had to move on and find another job I just didn't like the way they were treated me after being there for 3 year's
good,"stressful workplace, very high pace most of the time. sometimes coworkers were rude. typical day would include making fries, grilling meat and baking bacon and taking orders."
good,when I worked there it was okay the restaurant is clean the food is good you had the opportunity to work in different areas of the restaurant and not confined to one area
good,I worked there from highschool until i was 21 it was a great experience. good and bad mangers and employees to work with. but i got through it. days were very busy
good,Wendys was a nice job for my very first job. It was very easy to learn my manager taught me very well. I enjoyed going to work and being around my co workers.. I would definitely recommend to job to someone straight from High School.
good,Everything is always at a fast pace. If you can't work with multiple stations its not for you. The training is fast and quick paced. The pay is well. Closing isn't hard at all.
good,The job there was very stressful. Most the things were calm but as with all jobs there are always ups and downs. Great benefits as well as great people to work with. Upper management was always a delight to be with. would work there again if the occasion arises but im happy where i am right now
good,Wendy's is a wonderful place to work. This company take care of there employee's and the pay is good. Wendy's is a great start for beginning workers and some
good,"Very busy needs a fast pace worker"
good,"It was overall a good work experience, the hours were great. If you are a night owl and stay up late I would recommend being a closer. Everyone is very nice and helped me learn everything quickly."
good,it is a great place to start working if you want to build work experience somewhere and possibly  build a team and go and the food benefit are great to have
good,It is a very special place to work when you are involved with others . If you are a person who loves to deal with customer service then this is the perfect job for you.
good,this was one of my first jobs and it was pretty cool. I learned how to interact with employees and how to operate different stations and use my versatilities
good,"Good way to put your foot in the door to gain experience"
good,"Very fast paced, a good job for adults and teens. Flexible with hours. Not really good management, but a good company. The pay is fair for most. Easy transportation for work."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's for the most part. Working there was fun. I enjoyed some of the management. I had some arguments and disagreements with some of our management but who doesn't at their jobs
good,i really don't have much to say about this job. if you are young then this is a good first job. if your an adult you'll need to get an additional job.
good,Fast-paced and sometimes stressful place to work.  Enjoyed most customers and some are really funny.  work load expectations way too high. need more staff in order to get all that needs to be done in the manner it needs to be done in
good,Very busy place to work but had little to no help due to staff shortage. Had to deal with the management every body is trying to get on there good side to advance
good,This is a good starter job for high schoolers and people wanting a part time job. Very flexible hours and Useful when trying to make some money while going to school.
good,Wendys was a nice place to start my life as an employed adult. They work with you and your schedule and are understanding when things come up. Was a pretty easy system to learn.
good,"This job was honestly awful when it came to working environment, cleanliness, and future job opportunity. This was a temporary job for me. I am so glad I worked here. This job showed me how much better life can be with a little hard work to get out of customer service. The managers were nice, but the customers were awful."
good,I worked hard to perform the best job I could. The restaurant was not organized managerial wise. I got a better job making more money. I believe Wendy's could use more organization
good,Wendy's is a fast-paced food service environment. We follow strict food safety regulations. It gets a little rough sometimes being busy. Sometimes being short-staffed please a very large roll and how the business can operate. At times it can get stressful but trying to stay level-headed in times of Chaos helps.
good,Great place to work when you are a student as the hours are very flexible.  Also got to work with a lot of great people.  Most of the managers were okay to deal with.
good,I enjoyed having multiple people around me all the time. Usually never a dull moment especially when you have good people around you. Its all about the team work.
good,"great work experience"
good,"It  was a nice place to work at, but the pay was not good enough.  I was love by so many that worked there.  Also, I interact with all the customer, I never had any problems with any of the customers.  Was a good environment to work in."
good,I didn't stay at Wendy's for too long I was there maybe 2 months before I went to another Job I did enjoy my spot though as a cashier but not to much where I had to use harsh chemicals every morning all on my own.
good,"Wendy's is a great place for a first time job, however, it can be very demanding as we are relatively busy during most of the day. The managers a fun to work wit if they like you, but it can be difficult to get along with some of them as well."
good,The most tiring job ive ever had not just physically but mentally. Only the people that you work with will determine if its gonna be fun or exhausting.
good,"working the front and back cashier"
good,A typical day for a DM was to follow up on previous day's results in the morning. Phone calls and emails soon followed with store visits. Training on operations/food safety and customer courtesy were the main focus areas of each day.
good,"Typically you have to be taught how to work at each station at Wendy's so you can switch and cover for people. This can get hectic during a rush and people are missing so you have to move in between stations. Depending on where you work it's either really busy or really quiet and boring there is not much of an in between. At the very least the job is easy to get and while you have to deal with annoying customers from time to time it's not the worst. I, however, had difficulties with settling my schedule time with my manager which ended up giving me nothing but closing shifts. A lot of people quit or leave so there is either a period of short staff or new recruits that need to be trained which is annoying. This is an okay first job"
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking customers the customers order while taking the customers money counting out the right change as well as making sure that they got the right order.  I was also in charge of cleaning and sanitizing the dishes.
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy considering it is fast food. I learned that it is always about fulfilling the customers wants/needs to maintain business and a good customer satisfaction rating. The management is not terrible but isn't the greatest. Sometimes the managers aren't understanding of things but overall I enjoyed being around them. The workplace culture was well balanced and organized. Everyone was treated equally and never judged for their different beliefs and opinions. Team members were mostly respectful. There wasn't really a hard part about the job if you remained calm in stressful times, when it was busy around rush hour. The most enjoyable part was being around my coworkers and making jokes to help the time go by faster."
good,"The job was fast paced work place. Always on the move, had a good crew to work with though and friendly managers there to help out anyone who had questions."
good,With this job at first I liked and enjoyed it. The only thing I really hated is that they didn't let me take off days I really needed off. sometimes I wouldn't get enough hours throughout the week.
good,I started when I was 16 as a cashier and worked my way into a manager position. It was stressful as a manager at times but I succeeded through. My crew was awesome to work with and always listened.
good,"It used to be nice when the old crew was there. Everybody did there part and we all got along. Nowdays it seems like you do everybody else's job and the management has gone greatly downhill here recently. They underappreciate people who do there job and do it well, most everybody is paid the same also which really gets me nowdays. People walk in and start making $9-$9.25 to make them happy and stay, but people like me who have been there 3years or more, can do every position, almost never calls in, does posts(change fry filters,trash takeout, box takeout, backroom floor sweep and mop etc. It's not worth it anymore."
good,"experience working at Wendy's was very different. Management was not so understanding and overall it wasn't a very good experience for me. The working environment was a mess, many others did not know ow to communicate during a rush."
good,"I loved working here, a typical day at work consisted of making sure my customers were satisfied, assuring orders were correct, and got out in a timely manner."
good,Even at a slower store we we're almost constantly busy. Barely had help from the managers unless it was lunchtime. Unless corporate was there no one really cared. Crew members would steal all the time
good,"The job itself is typically alright, but the culture of belittling and demeaning fast food employers from both the perspective of the customer but the employer as well can get you down sometimes. But overall, if you're lucky to find a good and positive team, it can be tolerable."
good,Not fun at all. Management sucks the place is disgusting and the restrooms are a mess . Food is served cold . Orders are inaccurate. Please work somewhere else
good,a typical day of work for Wendy's is a bit stressful. What I've learned from the job is that you have to have full alert of yourself and others around you. The management is okay but its mainly about your work peers that keep you coming back to keep going with the job. the most enjoyable part of the job is the breaks with your work peers.
good,Typical day was getting everything ready for the shift to began smoothly. I learned to multi-task. The team management team was great. It was quieter then cracker barrel. Where I had to learn to take orders and take money and make drinks. The people were nice.
good,"it was a okay first job, very fast paced, i wouldn't recommend this job to someone else but it is a good first job, learned a lot. i wouldnt stay there forever"
good,It gets pretty busy from an hour after they open to about eight o'clock at night. You can learn all of the positions and they prefer it. Management has been off and on good and bad. You get to meet a lot of people with different backgrounds. Its hard to work when some people aren't working as hard as others but its fun at night when you get to goof off a little.
good,"Take orders, make food, and help drive thru "
good,If you enjoy being confused constantly of what youre supposed to do then work at Wendys. You can get away with a lot but not a whole lot gets done that needs to get done. Not a bad place but not a great place either
good,OUR manger was by far  one of the most unprofessional person I have ever met. She was very judgmental. The store was always dirty. They never was opened on time .
good,"Working at my job I usually greet the customers and do my best to fulfill their needs, which helped me learn that in order to meet each individual's needs you will have to take your time to understand what each customer wants. The hardest part about my job is making sure I fully service the customer while maintaining a fast pace. I enjoy seeing a very satisfied customer leave knowing I did great customer service."
good,"Wendy's taught me how to be a good manager and employee and how to better myself how to have a good costumers service and how i can benefits myself for another job,"
good,"Though I never received a shortage of hours working for Wendy's, I did not feel the environment was very well structured. The atmosphere and working conditions were poorly regulated and insufficiently managed."
good,"Working at Wendy's in Lufkin, Texas was a decent experience. I enjoyed the work crew, but hated the atmosphere from customers. Its a job that will pay the bills."
good,Very fun environment and you learn new things and meet new people. very good for high school students first job. it is a great way to start off your resturant career
good,"Wendy's is pretty much the best when it comes to fast food. My top favorite chicken sandwich is the spicy one, and there Baconator fries are sooo good."
good,alot of people worked there got done alot faster it was just a summer job but i would love to work there again. everyone was nice loved everyone there
good,Wendys is a fun place to work at. It is a good option for those who are in high school or transitioning out of high school. It will be a great work experience.
good,Everyday I went in and checked the schedule to see who was working and see what my job would be for the day because they alternated my position daily. Then I would go to my station restock clean and begin working
good,The employees and managers had their days some good and some bad but most of all everyone got along and was great with the guests. Only hot and fresh food was sold
good,"Its a decent place to work, especially if you are young and in experienced. Its a good stepping stone for anyone. a stable work hours, interpersonal skills can be acquired for future jobs."
good,Its a great start opportunity for growth and to obtain a position just no space to move to more it seem like a stand still job but it a great start out to learn things
good,"Not a very good atmosphere as you are required to meet some unattainable matrixes as it pertains to drive through times and the "
good,Fast paces fun working environment loved making sandwiches loved serving customers. Loved the employees no drama all family oriented great manager always believe in you and worked with you no matter what the reason was.
good,It's a fast paced job with paid vacations and pay raise with in ever year. You can work from 15 hours a week to 40+. You also can get a lot of over time.
good,It was many years ago since I've worked there but it was an enjoyable experience thanks to the co-workers. Not my cup of tea to work there so I left but recommended for anyone looking to get a start up job.
good,everyday is was good every other day it would get slow and fast at other times but other times i had an good day i learned how to grill make chilli cut up the bacon
good,First job just doing the basics. Preparing food according to the order. Having to stay fast pace. Greeting guests and properly taking orders. Restocking low supplies and foods. Cleaning and taking down equipment after hours. Taking out the garbage. Preparing ice cream.
good,Wendy's was my first job. Its good to work at Wendy's when you are looking for a first job because Wendy's management will teach you basic knowledge on how to handle and perform in a fast working environment.
good,I enjoyed my job at Wendys but I was not paid what I deserved as a manager and also they did not take very good care of their employees and customers.
good,"my review is its a nice high school job easy hours easy days sometimes gets stressful. Can work up towards being a manager, can get raises based on your work. Easy shifts or Long shifts depends what you want in a job"
good,A great first starter job. Great for high school students. You get to have great people to work with. Learn how to use a cash register. And learn how to work as a team.
good,Wendy's is a good place to work as a first job. The mangers and shift supervisors make it easy for you to transition into the working world and the place as a whole is relatively lenient on rules. But the employees can be very petty and high school and the drama can get overwhelming
good,"Hard to work with kids that just don't care or take pride in their work. Very rude customers that look at you as if you were just a walking, talking fish. Short staffed because again, none of the highschoolers want to be there, so they call in ""sick"" all the time."
good,I say work here only if this is your only option at the moment.. hungry people are crazy and mean    the customers are mean loud rude disrespectful and just bad.
good,Wendy's is a good place to work when you are young and have a lot of energy because it is very exhausting. multitasking is needed at all times and cleaning is required.
good,I had to attend to customers and take their orders. Also had the responsibility of keeping the lobby clean. I learned how to deal with people. Hardest part was staying to clean and the most enjoyable was being around coworkers (sometimes).
good,"It's basically the best thing you're gonna get out of a fast food restaurant. That being said, the work is fast paced, the pay is low, and the management can sometimes be frustrating."
good,Good management team. Typical day was prepping food or taking care of the deep fryer and pressure fryer. The crew and management  had to be the most enjoyable part.
good,Good places to start your work experience plenty of hours and a good test of team work skills because you will be part of a crew the food is good as well
good,"the management left much to be desired but overall the environment and working conditions were okay and i guess as a first job you could do worse "
good,A typical day at Wendys was good. It was very fast paced. I learned how to prep and cook food in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was having people there that made the workplace fun.
good,It was close to home and everything same pretty much as a regular fast food job managers were decent pretty good and cooking and everything. It was a good first Job
good,working at the wendys on lake harbour was good when i first started then after so long they started showing favoritism with the hours that you have to work
good,"I enjoyed working at wendys for the most part but sometimes working was very stressful, just depending on the day. I would recommend this job to pretty much anyone."
good,"Wendys was a great place to work, It was really fun and I enjoyed working with all of my fellow coworkers. You can just be you at wendys and not have to worry about being someone your not. It's not really a hard job to do. Wendys gets you the money you need and in a fun way"
good,"On a typical day at work I set things up for the kitchen, dining room and register. I took orders, prepped and cooked food, handled money, and cleaned all sections. I learned to multitask in a high energy environment. Management was good, but I felt that I did more of the work as a new person than the people who had been there for years. I loved talking to the customers."
good,"Take customers’ orders, receive payment by cash or credit card."
good,very quick paced specially on busy days. always cleaning and keeping things stocked. learned how to move fast. hardest part was taking out orders at a very fast pace because we were timed on how long we took. the enjoyable part was interacting with customers and serving them.
good,"Dealing with angry customers, a lot of oil. Fast paced work environment. Friendly people. Hours are ok, if you like working in the fast-food business."
good,I enjoyed workin at wendys.i loved da hours and the pay.i would like to go back to work there.when i go to work i like to help people wit there food.it was a clean environment to work at also.
good,"The basic fast food experience...grease, complaints, try to keep customers happy even if you see the thing the try to complain about is false. If you like fast food jobs go for it."
good,Not a bad job however management was weak and there was minimal professionalism displayed within the company. They are quite willing to work with desired days off and hours of availability so that is a bonus. Plus the people who work there tend to be fun and outgoing people.
good,It was a very challenging and fast paced atmosphere which helped me to learn time management and optimization of tasks. I would challenge myself to be the fastest employee.
good,"Its a rough job, but at the same time its simple but sometimes I can get a bit Frustrated from time to time. but other than that I, am a good worker. and reliable"
good,Lifeguarding here is a great summer job for young teens looking to start their job experience. Fulfills a sense of responsibility that helps you feel like you're contributing to something.
good,"During holiday season, call volume is high, customers are rude, training not long enough. Schedules are silly. Attendence system is the only good thing about this company."
good,I was very young it was an exciting job for me and I learn the basics to and for a carry out food environment.Good manager love the hours of operation great team and great performance training.
good,This is a fast food restaurant where you actually flip burgers. The food is better quality than a lot of places. I only made minimum wage. Drive thru times were timed.
good,"Everyone likes to work together at my job & that's good because without team work , nothing will get done & the food will never get done. I like cleaning & stocking up"
good,"Mostly a fast paced working environment with little downtime. Hours are fair, albeit sometimes long. Only major complaint is how the management interacts with each other, lots of passive aggressive comments make for some tense shifts."
good,Wendy's is a fast food place that always has customers and some angry ones too . It's hard to keep up with everything and those rude customers........
good,job for students flexible time work hours can be horrible but overall my manger was funny and made time move faster.. best place to work out customer service
good,A typical day would be clock in make shore all your fresh foods are there.  I learned how to make the burger's the way they wanted me to. M.G.M was vary good with there workers and customers.
good,Not the best but a great job when you need one. Good pay great hours always needing people . Always great business never slow always busy and on your toes
good,I would arrive at work and prepare my station. I learned to fry burgers and work the cash register. The first manager was very nice and helpful. The hardest part of working there were the customers. But the most enjoyable part was the discount on food.
good,"it was smooth , at certain times of the day it got really fast and you had to keep up to keep the customers satisfied. The hardest part was getting a rush and trying not to get orders confused."
good,"wendy's was a decent place to work if you're still in or fresh out of high school. I would not wish to make this place a career, nothing personal, just not for me. the people there were friendly and helpful."
good,"plainfield Wendy's is a phase two training store, meaning that they are held to higher standards during the audit process, and also train management for the sister stores in the district. It's a fast paced work environment in which you deal face to face with the customer, whose perception is 95% of the business. Customer service is the number one priority, as well as a friendly environment, and a clean work space. Cash handling, cooking and food prep, as well as food safety guidelines are all taught and followed."
good,"This job did not offer much experience or work place knowledge as it was the same simple tasks every single day. It did however prepare me for busy rushes, annoyed customers, and failing systems."
good,A typical workday involved lots of customers and being busy all the time. I learned how to handle things when in a rush or a tight spot.Hardest part of this job was having to the job of 3 different people.
good,"This was a great company they allowed flexible hours to accommodate my full time job."
good,"it is fine everything is fine"
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's would be greeting new customers , cleaning up my area (front end ,grill , bathrooms , dining room, drive thru counter)"
good,over all wendys wa not a bad place to work. i work with some very nice individuales. However my hours were offten cut short for a lack of patrons and I was thrown into my job with little to no idea what i was doing. i had to learn on my own what needed to be done and do it often times beyond what was expected with no rewards or recognition for my efforts.
good,"It was just a stressful and  claustrophobic area for me to work in. The speed wasn't an issue, however some workers didn't hold up their end, so other workers were doing several jobs."
good,"fast paced, they are very competitive... work long hours and almost asked to stay late after every shift. they require you to do too  much for the pay you're receiving"
good,To much drama in the work place. Everyone is always arguing with each other over nonsense and the people who do not try at all always get rewarded while everyone else has to work hard for just above minimum wage.
good,"I liked my job there but I was have medical problem at that time and couldn't return back to work, so I was let go after my second day I believe. But I did enjoy working there"
good,Was a decent first job.  Had good management and co-workers.  Just basic fast food job.  Was always better when busy so the work day went faster.  Left for college.
good,"you have to work fast as you can but safe is important,,,.. be smart to do the task,, sometimes is fun when everyone work together, as a team ... always follow the leader , dont make decision by yourself when doing the job..."
good,"Good Co-workers, good working environment, wage wasn't great but for a entry level it was good. You learn a lot about customer service as well as anything else that comes with fast food industry."
good,"not the idealistic job, but it gets you the money you need. the enviornment is very fast paced and you need to be aware of everything your position requires you to keep an eye on. working with others is critical to being efficient in not only your position, but for the rest of your co workers."
good,"Work hard and you will be recognized by others including managers. The workers are great to work with and will make sure you are happy. It is a clean, safe environment."
good,Great place for teenagers who are just starting out in the work force. It gave me responsibility and I was able to maintain my own paying for my car and the insurance.
good,The job wasn't all that bad. The managers were okay except one. She was very rude. I did a lot of multitask stuff. No I would not work for any Wendy's again
good,A typical day at work was fast very fast what I learned was that I was not very good at cooking that I was better with people.the hardest think was it was fast enjoyable was the people
good,"drop meat on the grill, make sure products are always stocked"
good,I liked working for this company. as a cashier this work place help my level of customers service good team work I will love to go back and work for this company.
good,"Wendy's is a great corporation and I have great customers. The Wendy's experience is an nice, clean, welcoming environment. Wendy's has great quick food."
good,taking customers order and receiving money and distributing money back. keeping area clean and keeping customers happy.Teamwork!!! Making sure that the food is properly fixed.
good,"I loved working here until they got new management and they didnt have a clue about customer service which took them down hill fast but when I worked here it was awesome, we all worked as a team and it was not really a job cause it was family!"
good,"I'm not really the person to ask about this.... I would say that it came out even, it had pros and cons. I didn't leave because of anything that they did, and I'm still in good personal standing with the management."
good,"Working at Wendy's was a fun learning process for a high school student, you can get some experience and learn the fundamentals of running a fast food store."
good,Best place If you like working for trash. Worst job of my life and will never go back to it because of how horrible it is. Sorry not sorry. Best of luck to you though
good,The crew members were great they help each other willing to teach if ask managers was nice but also still professional needed to communicate more with each other
good,I like that we got trained on all positions. Everyone works together. Management is very lenient. Fast paced job. Quick drive thru. Clean dining room.
good,its was a fast paced environment good people great customers cooking for customers its was a great experience  and I enjoy it and the hours was lovely and the manager was good
good,It was a great working environment for a year or so. The second year that I have been here it has gone down hill quite a bit. I have only gotten one raise in over two years of employment.
good,"It's a fast food place with ok management, and nice workers. The job was to keep stock of food and to prepare food for the customer so that food was always ready or would soon be ready."
good,Wendys has its good days and most days are the worse. You also have to maintain a smile on your face and also always have to make sure you give the person the correct order. If not you could get a very bad review where you have to go through inspections for your job.
good,I haven't been at this job for  over 10 years so my experiences back then wouldnt really help anyone out now. the do have really good food though so thats a plus
good,"Great place to work for young teenaagers to get a feel of working and becoming independent."
good,I wasn't trained how to do much of anything other than the simple jobs. Management seemed too concerned with getting things done in a timely manner to take a few minutes and properly train some employees
good,Its a nice job to start out with as your first job. It helps you get nice base of work experience but i do not recommend staying to long. Will begin to get irritating.
good,"It was an okay job , not really into fast food work . Not every one was hard workers . Rude customers , it was clean and food was good . But it wasn't for me"
good,"All in al a great first time job, but its a job with in the fast food industry, not much room to grow once I was fully trained, moved on shortly after"
good,It was fun sometimes depending on what shift manager was there the work was great but that type of job really is for high school students with no bills or any major responsibilities. Thats all i got to say on wendys.
good,"You meet lots of different people everyday, always gotta on your toes,delicious food, easy work for a high school person or even an older person who wants to stay busy, always keep a cool head and do not take anything personally."
good,"whether it was to open or close, it was busy, i loved working at wendy's. i learned every station and actually trained new crew members. i did a managers job. u have fun, but it stinks when manager is not that great."
good,I love to learn new things and I'm a honest fast worker I'm eager to be part of a team. I have customer service certificate and have great skills helping people
good,Had a blast everyone worked together and was respectful. I always worked over 40 hours per week and came in anytime there was a no call no show or when someone needed me to cover.
good,"i was cashier and worked drive thru"
good,Its not a very fun work place but is very productive. You have to be out spoken and play a leadership role at times. The hardest part would be closing.
good,Working the late night shift here was amazingly fun. I enjoyed everything form the training to the fry and nugget station. Working with down to earth people made it easy to get work done.
good,Working with this corporation taught be the benefits of customer service and well as familiarize myself with unorthodox hours. I was also able to view this company expand and advance in training and security.
good,I really liked working for Wendys. Even though they pay minimum wage it's still a decent place to work. There really are things you can learn from fast food.
good,"I worked for twenty one years for this franchise. The salary was great, and I had a company car. Also I invested my own money in the business which yielded between 40-60K yearly.  Basically that was it though. Get out of it what you put in. No pension, no 401k,"
good,It is a great place to work. Assistant management out up with a lot more then what their job requirements are. Ownership of the one I was at was very unorganized and lazy.
good,"A typical day at work would me start by counting my register to make sure it was 100 dollars. After that i would take orders, and if we were not busy the other cashier would take front counter and i would help with drive thru."
good,"- Didn't like the fact that minimum wage was 6.15 and worked few hours. Also had to work in fast pace in a small, hot work environment."
good,"This workplace was not the best. I wasn't taught much and coming in, was expected to know what was supposed to be done or how everything works. No one really spoke to each other, people were very isolated. They also did not really care much about peoples availability's and for those who were part- time and still in high school were forced to take night shifts which they would explain they could not do but no one listened."
good,"I like Wendy's They just don't pay enough. i need a job that's willing to give more hours instead of three days out of seven. I was a cook, and cashier, and cleaner."
good,Can be good and quick if you work really hard and focus on what your duties are. learned alot from former co-workers and managers. management could be better.
good,If you like and easy wok place with steady pay for an entry level job this is a great place to work. Though there is a little bit of drama but what can you ask for with a fast food job. My personal opinion is that it is a great entry level fast food job.
good,"The work was ok, however the management was awful. Overall it was somewhat enjoyable, but the managers made it difficult to to enjoy your time working."
good,A typical day at work would consist of opening the sandwich area. Cleaning  the area. Wrapping sandwiches. Closing area. Cleaning the lobby. Helping other coworkers when needed.
good,"Honesty, Integrity, Desire to help people, Confidence, Personal Strength, and Action oriented"
good,The kitchen was usually rather uncomfortable by way of how much room and the amount of people. Depending on the day it could either be too busy for comfort or too slow for time to feel like it was moving.
good,"I started in 2014, was a crew member making about $8 an hr after 2 years.  They will work with you on your schedule,  however once you have done every position there for not even $8 an hr it's just not worth it any more. Was fun while it lasted,  made a bunch of friends on the way."
good,"At times I enjoyed going there but it can be stressful because we're busy and you have to be quick at all times. It be no time to relax but the crew so,etimes make it fun to be there."
good,"Fun and productive, nice coworkers, clean and tidy environment. Training was smooth sailing. Managment and scheduling very flexible. Indeed recommended."
good,I don't think it's a job you'd want to keep. It's more of a temporary type of thing. You get paid minimum wage to be disrespected by customers & rushed all hours of the day.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me coming in, clocking in, grabbing a headset then hitting the register to take orders for the drive through or collect money in the drive through. I learned a lot about computer systems and how to work with people. My management was great it was very stable and i feel they did a good job running the store. The hardest part of the job was the grease and things I was around."
good,"Had the opportunity to try lots of different jobs and learn new skills, gained a sense of responsibility and enjoyed working for the company during this time"
good,It is a very fast paced job. Not hard at all. management was very nice and you would usually get all the days you ask to get off which is always nice to have available.
good,I enjoyed my few months as a Wendy's Crew member; everyone was friendly and enjoyed what they were doing. Not once did I see anyone get on anyone else's bad side. Very well managed.
good,My experience at Wendy's was very hard for it being my first job the people were rude . I like the customers but management was rude all the time .  Great food though
good,My customer service is excellent working with the public it is good...my customers to they love me....my co-workers said you know your customers love you...lol..lol..
good,"A typical day at Wendy's for me consisted of making sandwiches, making fries and nuggets, organizing bags that go out the window, and interracting with customers. The hardest part of this job was dealing with management. They were so unorganized."
good,Easy job but like most fast food restaurants it tends to be subject to the whims of management for both good and bad results. If you need a job bad then this is a place for you.
good,This job is not very demanding because like any fast food restaurants some times it's really busy and other times you have no customers. Working in front of the grill was the hardest part as you need to be really careful for your safety and safety of others.
good,I worked there during senior year of high school.  While its been a while it relatively relies heavily on pace and quality of product produced especially during lunch rush.
good,"You will get by as long as you do your part. Working environment depends on your co-workers. I worked part-time while attending college full-time. It is easy to get a hang of everything. Communicate with your team and time flies. The hardest part is facing the unhappy/drunk/drugged up customers (my location was very close to a University so we had an assortment of craziness, especially in the drive-thru at 3AM in the morning)."
good,"Work environment is good, people are pleasant to work with."
good,"The typical day includes many duties including constant upkeep of your station, cleaning of the lobby, garbage duties and servicing the endless amount of customers. Many times understaffed, due to management having never ending longing to save money through labour cutbacks. Backroom for breaks are cramped and messy. the long hours and low wage teaches youth the value of money. Wendy's is a job that should be filled by the youth who are looking a first job. Highly recommend to any teenagers looking to earn their keep."
good,"It's only decent when you're an RM, other than that you'll be struggling. They pay you enough to not find better, but do not pay you enough for what you do."
good,You are working anywhere from 50 to 70 hours a week which is very tiring.  The upper management of the company could do a better job taking care of their employees.
good,"while here the management was okay, the work environment wasnt that bad. the work crew usually is very bad. no one cares about the work so things get done in bad fashions."
good,"i personally do not enjoy working in fast food because it is stressful without much benefit in return. compared to other jobs for teens working in fast food restaurants means you must work after school and sometimes late at night, working late at night means you have to stay later to clean up."
good,its a good job if you just got out of high school but thats about it its not for me i would not go back but its something to start you off if yuo just need a job
good,"Some days were amazing and definitely a great learning experience. This was my very first job so everything was very exciting. The hardest part of the job is dealing with hungry, angry people. After having some other jobs now I have come to learn that there will be amazing customers and some awful ones. Appreciate the great ones and take care of the awful ones and move on!"
good,"working at wendy's i loved to see the people, but like all fast food restaurants customers can sometimes be irritating. most people who come to wendy's are more concerned with the speed than quality. though we made high quality food i just didn't feel very satisfied."
good,I liked working there it helped me provide. For my son but working fast food is not what I really want to do I want to branch out I like to challenge myself
good,"A typical workday at Wendy's would be working the first window, taking the customers money, and washing the dishes. I eventually moved to the front line and drive-thru. "
good,Doesn't pay anything and the hours suck if you're a single or in school you either get no hours or you close every night the old people work day shift.
good,The job was okay but I felt like I needed more money. I hated having to manage kids who did not care. I suppose that is what happens when they are all young and only making minimum wage.
good,"Absorbed in work politics and Upper Management is always hostile. The DM threatens your job no matter how well you are doing and the Regional Manager is by far the worst. No value for anyone else's time or feelings. Unstable environment. However, the GM is the only thing holding that store together. She is a genuine person who cares about people as a whole."
good,"I'd come in open the sandwich stations, then make salads. Sometimes get the bacon start cooking the bacon. Other mornings I'd cut up all the lettuce for the day. I pretty much, knew and did almost everything. Then I worked the drive thru all day. I was good at the speaker."
good,"As with my previous jobs, everything is customer oriented. We are only there because the of the customer. The standards at Wendy's were different from other fast food joints I worked at. It really taught me to focus purely on the customer and make the customer happy, because that is what is most important. If the customer is happy with the service provided and has a good experience there, they will continue to return and keep the business going. Not only that, but word will spread and generate more business. Making the customers happy should make you happy, and I learned that here."
good,"The people you work with really make the place. I loved my fellow employees. Starting off I didn't receive many hours, overtime I work 40 plus hours a week, generally 2 days off. The management was outstanding and understanding. The hardest was I when you make it hard."
good,"when i went into wendys, some staff made you feel welcome. others made it feel like they were whispering behind your back.  bit clueless at understanding whats going on around them."
good,"Managers, as a rule, are very easy to get along with. They get to know you on a personal level as well as an employee. I've been with the company for quite some time now and each and every review that I received, I was always awarded the highest amount of raise that was allowed."
good,"Wendy's is a hard working company. Everyone communicates, its fast food so it's fast passed. Everyone there can be nice. They are all outstanding people, who try to make people happy."
good,It was plenty fun & goals achieved. The crew workers & customers were day making also. Mangers there not only guided us bug they also help with all & any work.
good,I didn't like it. The management and hours were ridiculous and we work to hard to be earning 7.50. Overall I'll say it was a smooth business. Just the people that was working there was very young and immature.
good,"Simple, and doesnt take much skill. A good entry postion into the food business.This was one of my first food jobs. simple and to the point. Helps you create good personality to handle customer situations."
good,"It's a good starting job and you can advance fairly easily if you apply yourself and work hard.  Most customers are fine, but some are rude just because you work in fast food."
good,"I never really liked working here personally, but it did have some perks. You learn very fast that there is not a lot that they teach you and give you time to learn. They bascailly teach you by just throwing you on the line."
good,Productive work place but you do not get and recognition for any good you do for the business... No bonuses and benefits are extremely expensive. I had to branch outside of the wendys company to seek affordable benefits
good,Wendy was good at first but changing management and thing became difficult to deal with and not good pay for someone trying to better them self so I started looking for a better job placement
good,good place to succeed from a manger to higher in  the ladder of management but its a tough journey so be prepared to have ups and down while on that clock .
good,this was a horrible place tiny place not much room to move the people where nice but when you got a rush everyone stopped working together benefit were horrible never was offered but they do have
good,Working at Wendy's I learned how to multi task and work as a team. I work many hours and at the time it was a good experience just ready to find a different opportunity with different challenges.
good,Wendy's was a very productive place to work. We were always busy and working with customers. It also was a fun place to work everyone got along with each other.
good,Quick past easy everyone was accepting and friendly. Busy consistant  gave good hours. Flexible with hours . manager was patient good at training. Never had any prodlems.
good,This is great company to work for with great food. I like being able to cook fresh ingredients. The atmosphere is pleasent and warm and most of the employee are nice.
good,It was very busy and fast pace working here. During my training they didnt spend too much time teaching me how to do certain tasks they needed done. I also wasnt informed on when i was allowed to take my lunch or breaks and there wasnt much time for using the restroom.
good,started here my sophomore yer in high school. Really nice first job. Almost everyone here was very helpful during the training process. The work is simple and easy.
good,Some days it be fun and some days people have attitudes. I've learned a lot being this is my first job. The managers are nice...some of them. workplace is nice and neat.
good,fast pace job. requires patients with customer service. management wasn't on top of things. i learned how to deal with impossible people with customer service.
good,"It was a fast paced environment but I learned quickly and was able to run every station, and eventually started training new employees on the different stations."
good,"This job was my first and it was actually great. Opportunity for growth was little, but that did not matter. Training took one day, and was extremely easy. Customers are not that bad."
good,They put as full time and  only worked me about 10 hours a week and my manager was mean to me and they don't give you any time to take a break so I quit
good,"this was my first job, so i dont remember much about it besides the fact it was very uninteresting and i practically had to do majority of the things even the managers did, but for a smaller pay."
good,"I made sure the employees were doing their job correctly, making sure all the customers food/orders we made correctly and given out on time and also making sure the customers left happy."
good,"I had a very short time there. The staff was productive, and the management was responsive. Other than that, I was not there long enough to give a full review."
good,Wendy's was fun for me. I worked there when David Thomas was still alive so its been awhile ago. But I enjoyed working there and the upper management seemed to really care about their people. I don't know about current management. I've heard they have sold a lot of their stores which normally means bad news for customers and employee's alike.
good,"great work running the grill, and helpinh other co- workers. run the place, being a closer, I was able to use the cashier, grill drive thru experience and feel great that I accomplished things."
good,"I worked for Wendy's for about 8 years. I started as a crew member and worked my way up to a Shift Manager within a year. Although the pay was not that good, it was a good job to have as my first. They were very good at working around my busy schedule, and very understanding when it came to needing time off. It is a very fast pace place to work and a little dirty. Overall, I'd say Wendy's was a great first job."
good,"Its a fun place to work...Management was very helpful in training and overall support...I learned to deal with different types of customers..."
good,the fast food industry sucks when it comes to working there. Discounts in food are a plus. Learned how to deal with customers and provide great service.
good,"Worked night shift, so breaks were an hour in of clocking in. "
good,a typical day at work was nice you get to see many people and you feel good when provide good service for them and see them leave with a smile on there face.
good,I was young but I took what I learned with to  the job I have now. That was where I learned how important it was to make sure the things you did was right or you would have to redo them.
good,Very good experience great managers and kind very helpful team everyone got along. Very long hours and shifts also many of the customers were rude.
good,"My job was to make sure we had fresh fries, meat on the grill' and fresh nuggets. I also had to make sure we didn't run out of food. I cleaned the floors, washed the dishes a few times, and preped tomatos and onions."
good,"A very friendly, fast-paced work environment. "
good,I learned how to gain an understanding of different cultures and personalities. I gained leadership skills and how to become a great team player working for Wendy's was fun because the team worked together as a team
good,Fun and not fun at the same time. Always being covered in grease wasn't the best feeling in the world. Working at a fast pace constantly is a lot more effort than it would seem.
good,Probably my worst experience working in fast food. Equipment and grill were barely functional. Everything ran just enough to past health inspection. It would be a great place to work if GM and DM work together on having things work properly.
good,A good start up job it was my first job if you never work a day in your life before I recommend you work  at Wendy's you will learn some good work ethics and good customer service experiences also it's a good summer job
good,The hardest part of working at Wendys was dealing with nasty attitudes not from customers but from co workers. I'm an upbeat very cheerful person so I don't like being around negative vibes. I understand we all have bad days but let's not have bad days everyday.
good,nice environment ok place to work always room for improvement. always room for promotion if its the right time. nice people nice customers
good,"The pilot Wendy's , is a rather  place to work at, with it's amazing customer and the very eager worker ready to do nothing but the best. However pay could be better, and also job security"
good,"While at Wendy's I was constantly stressed, the women there were very loud with each other and usually had disagreements every day. the pay was decent for the work load I was given though so I assume in all reality that it was worth the pay!"
good,Hours are very flexible good for students! Also very friendly co-workers and will assist if help is needed! Management was also very co-operative and didn't abuse the power
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier was attending customers as well as making sure Wendy's restaurant was neat and tidy."
good,"It was a decent on campus job, a lot of customers. You always had to make sure you were showing you were in a good mood and it was very interactive with all the students coming and going."
good,"over all a good work place, fast environment for fast learners, fun and friendly staff, managers are always on the floor assisting with customers"
good,"This was my first job and as many i struggled in thee beginning.I had the chance to build up my confidence, communication skills and responsibilities. My co workers where very helpful and treated me like family. We looked out for one another and made sure our tasks was up to date. In the fast food industry the hardest part was serving angry customers and the rushes. Being a teenager the best part about working with food is getting free food and having extra cash to go out and have fun with family and friends."
good,Learned team work and great customer skills. I handled cash and managed my area. I always kept my area clean and gave a great customer service. Being the cashier means face of the company so satisfy your customers.
good,"Temporary simple job, requires friendly and fast assistance, easy to move up with hard work and determination, easy learning experience"
good,I loved the people i worked with. Alot of team work. We made it real fun. My boss was nice and undrestanding. Helped out when needed. Hardest part was not staying nice. Sometimes i can over do it
good,Wendys was a fast paced company. Many hours were given and everyone worked as a team. The only thing i didnt like was it was full of dramam between co workers and not enough pay.
good,It helped me learn how to work as part of a team effectively to get orders put together fast and efficiently. It also taught me how to deal with certain kinds of customers in acceptable ways even if that isn't the way you personally would have wanted to deal with it.
good,"working at this company involves a lot of movement , bumping and sliding to different stations to get stuff together, it also involves helping each other out to get orders out as quickly as possible with little to no mistakes."
good,I worked at a Truck stop and bus stop for one of those fancy charter bus lines so i was able to meet a lot of cool people. i enjoyed my superiors as well as the people i worked with.  we became a good team and family and other workers took me under their wing and helped me when i was less experienced.
good,"I worked at Wendy's Pharmacy from 8 am down to 8 pm but there is a long lunch break from 12 noon to 3 pm which I like."
good,"Line trays, greet customers, take orders and serve food, clean dining room, mop, vacuum. Clean fryers, Clean appliances"
good,Make food to orders quickly. Clean areas always. Alot of great people work there.LOVED MY G.M.'s.. Everyone doesn't know about food safety
good,"It was hard to work here because the main manager at the time was rough. they are unfair but its easy to get over, do your job right and it wasnt so bad."
good,It was a good place to work for a teenager. It was nice for learning a rush and time management. I also liked the food. Nice for learning basic math and computer skills.
good,"it was lack of communicatiion and poor management , there wasnt much to the job but the cash register , bagging food and washing dishes . the hardest part was the cash control part you had to remember to drop money every hour on the hour, but it wasnt very much hard. something enjoyable about the job was talking to some of the co workers that was there"
good,"Constant training and review. This company values the need for hands on by all members 0f the management staff. A s a manager you have very little time to complete all the duties you were assigned in one shift, Over time was cut for the managers that were needed to get everything donw."
good,"I enjoy working with people, time goes fast. I learned how to interact with people and customer service is the number one priority.  To respect those above you and to follow the orders of management to make for a friendly working environment. A happy building attitude helps build a stronger company. The hardest part of my job is to be at a fast pace finishing your orders. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with friends and having a good relationship with my coworkers."
good,"Ran shifts, helped train employees, did food prep, helped count some inventory, did customer service. Cleaned as needed. I learned how to help train more. I learned how to be a stronger manager. To take charge over employees & how to handle customers & complaints."
good,"it was okay . had trouble with a few of my workers . Other than that, it was pretty good. i enjoyed waking up and going to work. i got long with my co workers and also my costumers"
good,"If you're a people's person, then this is the place to see. New faces and personalities everyday. I was fast at learning everything. And never afraid to ask questions."
good,8 hour shift starting on sandwich station and closing down the store throughout the night. by working here added to my great customer service I already had. management was okay. okay for your first job but don't stay here long
good,This is a great first job to teach someone about handling stress in a fast paced environment. Can be stressful but can also be a whole lot of fun with the right people.
good,"Very understanding, very close- net work space, like a family. Everyday you are in a different position. Team building/ team-work. Can be exhausting work."
good,It was very so-so. I just didn't under stand why every one there was so unprofessional and unmotivated. I didn't like the aspect of that but everything else was fine.
good,"There was always something new going on at work. We always had new people also. Some of the management is great, some not so great. I made a lot of friends working there and it was a good job."
good,Interacting with customers was the most enjoyable moments but it was also a struggle when taking orders. Management was very strict had to make sure I had 5 or less customer through my line. I had learn that patients is the key when dealing with different people
good,"working the grill, taking out the trash stocking frozen goods, working fry station, stocking food, taking orders, throwing away out of date food, making sure everything is in order."
good,the job was not to bad and all the workers were friendly. the job was fast paste and was not to hard of work. the manager did not really care about workers schedules
good,"Everything at Wendy's was fast pace. I loved working there because it gave me a good sense of what real team work was like when it came down to rush hour. Yes the work was hectic but everyone made it work, the hardest part was having to multitask but enjoyed being able to do it and become a better employee because of it."
good,"A typical work day was always busy."
good,Clock in. Start prepping food for your shift. Ensure everything is clean at all times. Interact with the customers.  Manage the cash register. Never cross contaminate
good,Cool place to work if it is your first job. its a good way to ease into bigger and better responsibilities and a better way to get some quick easy money and gain experience.
good,"Working at Wendy was the first Job that I was able to have that provided a Steady Flow of income. The Beef is really never frozen and i loved the friends that i was able to make. Wendy's was the perect Blend of an easy hard job. I did work hard but i alot worked easy if that makes since. I laughed a lot with my supervisors and I also disagreed a lot. I guess you can say Wendy's became my Family from home those early years out of high school, Its  Not something you want to stay in forever, but if your are just stating out this is a smart choice just make sure you know your bosses way of thinking or you may quit. And also do not be afraid to quit if your not being treated right its foolish to stay somewhere where your not being treated with respect."
good,"Friendly environment , good people and good food. Left for school and work on my degree. I would recommend college kids and kids that are just starting out in job field."
good,I enjoyed the people just not the work or environment. The hours were funny and going to work was never pleasant and I would never get back in that line of work.
good,"received no breaks doing a 9 hour shift, managers are friendly, food was always prepared fresh, training was relatively easy, would not recommend to someone who becomes overwhelmed easily."
good,"I appreciate to get this kind of work experience. But the atmosphere at work can vary depends on team work and support: it can exist and absent as well."
good,"depending on who you worked for would determine how good the service would be that day. it was okay at times, the staff was great but management wasnt"
good,They cared about you and tried to do what they could but it would take too much time and the mangers would be rude some times
good,It's a good environment to work just ready for something new learned to deal with different personalities and behaviors.
good,You learn what its like to what on people and to respect the staff when they have a rush because you can please everyone at once. Management was great very professional and nice people. It was a drama free zone when you went to work. Hardest part of the job would have to be keeping the timer down while in a rush
good,"I really liked working there, loved working with the people. The only thing i didn't like, was they knew i needed atleast 15 hours a week for school. And they would give me maybe 12 hours a week."
good,well i had great time working for wendys it has some of my favorite options on the menu and i love the way the prep salads fresh daily and that should promote that more
good,"I learned a lot working at Wendy's. I learned how to use the register well. I learned how to take orders, bag the orders, make the burgers, and make sure the customers had a great experience when visiting Wendys resturaunt. I also learned how to properly greet the customers and made sure they left with a smile on their face. What i enjoyed most about working at Wendys was just making sure the customers were satisfied with their visit. There was nothng hard about the job at all. I learned a lo working here."
good,"This was an average high school job. The one I was working for imparticular wasn't the greatest but as a beginner job wasn't horrid. The management seemed to change around a lot, the other people I worked with were all from the same small town which was nice."
good,"I loved working at Wendy's , the only reason I left was because I was leaving for college. The pay wasn't the best but it is a minimum wage job, therefore you cant expect much. Nice atmosphere and we cleaned non-stop."
good,"The schedule was flexible and the pay was good. Management was organized and helpful.  Plenty of room for advancement, good benefits and frequent pay raises."
good,"Working in wendy's, there is no such thing as one position because you will work all positions. You would learn how to work the grill station, Sandwich making station, Bagging, window register, counter register, Fry station, dish washing, and janitorial cleaning of the dining area."
good,While working here I had to deal with very rude customers but I learned not to take any comments personal. I learned to work at a very fast pace and multitask and stay productive. having experience in the dental field I incorporated my organizing and cleaning skills into being a cashier which helped a lot by keeping everything clean and presentable at all times .
good,good energy everyone was ready and willing to help one another also I enjoyed working with others and getting feed back on my work and job duties
good,"It wasn't that bad but there was some hostile people that I had to work with. I always stayed busy, there was always something to be done."
good,It's a cool place to work for sure the only real problem is that don't pay enough other then that it's usually cool people to work with and make the day fly by
good,Ppl were nice it was slow on some days fast on others the ppl were friendly & everybody knew almost everybody so it was a well known organization that it was
good,Great great great job just didn't have time enough as a college student with studying and class hours. Great for young people looking to get the best job for the next season in their life.
good,This job was not my favorite as I was in college while working here and it was hard to focus on school when I was always working til midnight. Overall you get enough hours to support yourself.
good,Wendy's was pretty cool they did they jobs most of the time And we had a Little support and help as needed. I learned that team work makes the dream work and Wendy's was missing that.
good,Wendys was a good fast pace work place its was good always had me movibg and doing something. Didnt really like all the co workers but thats life we not here to like each other.
good,A typical day at Wendy's was fun but the way they treated they're customers sometimes was unprofessional. The time I spent here taught me a little about different ways to cook food and proper ways to store food. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after my shift because many people showed me different ways and techniques on how to do it properly. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my co-workers throughout the shift.
good,I did not like working here at all. However if you need hours then you get them. You have great co workers. However the management is terrible. I would not recommend working here unless you are in great need for a job.
good,a typical day at Wendys consisted of fast paced work and ALOT of work. i believe that the amount of work that you are put through should have shown through the pay but in order to get a decent check you had to work as much overtime as was given. if you truly have a love for hard work wendys is the place to be.
good,"Early morning set up."
good,I was employed at a young age which inside me into the world of employment. It was a good experience to be working with different types of people and dealing with a variety of customers.
good,Fast pasted work environment and it seemed to always be busy. This was okay because I don't like to be bored. It was not a bad place to work. Had opportunities for advancement.
good,"a good environment to work with other if you like interacting with other. alright pay, treats employs wit respect. and very compromising  . food is awesome"
good,The first job that i had was very busy i had to leaned so much things i had good cowoker but sometimes my manager did not communice the best way with us the bad part was work every over hour and still do not feel good with you paid but i learned alot that was the best.
good,good and friendly co workers.but sometimes rude general manager. the condiments are not organized. lack of staff and inconsiderate general manager.
good,"It was my first job, and I didn't hate it but didn't love it either. It can be stressful working drive-thru at first, but you get used to it. Customers can be very difficult, and they always take it out on you. Just have to be respectful and polite."
good,Responsibility and give job experience learn people skills and had more training in food preparation learn how to manage my time
good,I think Wendy's should raise they're hourly pay its way to low of pay and alot of work for students who try to pay bills on they're own and teenagers. Overall good job for part time not full.
good,"Generalmente yo trabajo por las manianas , es decir yo abria el local , me gustaba por que teníamos muchas actividades que hacer antes de la hora que empezaba la atención  al cliente. "
good,"your average fast food joint that gets busy and has down time. its a easy first job for a teenager which is when i worked there, i was 18. not a good job if your over 20 and not in management."
good,"A good job as a stepping stone"
good,"As a employee of this establishment and going to college, I found it not paying enough for gas and school supplies, along with not giving me the opportunity to balance life, school, and work. I did learn some more customer service skills. On a typical day, I run grill, making sure the meat is cooked for the food. Some of the management was awesome to work with, but the others didn't help at all. I'd say the hardest part of working there is, the stress. The most enjoyable part, is working with some of the cool coworkers."
good,"Overall i enjoyed the job the people were nice and very caring,i liked this job because it gave me alot of skills like communication, when dealing with customers i had to have a positive attitude. This also help me gain people skills, i left the job due to finishing school"
good,This was a place I chose to have as a second job. It is no difference than I was working at the  City Schools I did about the same greeted my customers/ took orders prepare the also stock my area. I quick after where rob it was a very scary and I just good not understand why
good,"Enjoyed working there, met a lot of new nice people and gained a lot of experience in the work field. All the staff were friendly and easy to get along with. Helped me better myself and learned how to handle a social school life, while having a job."
good,"I can work morning,mid, or day. I am one of the very few how can do any position in the store. I can order take under 45 seconds, I know how to make sure that every customer is highly satisfied before they leave the store. Mainly when I come on shift the store seems to be a mess for the crew, we always try to stock up after the crew that just left. the management team is to easy on the crew and don't want to follow procedures.the crew runs the store. my years of a manager i have never seen in my life of this. When i was a manager I always made sure my store ran properly and the crew did what they were suppose to do. I enjoy my job but with the problems that the store is having its makes it hard on the crew to do their job when there isn't structure. the most enjoyable part of my job is when we all work together as a team ."
good,Enjoy the atmosphere when I arrive in the mornings  Very quiet and focused to get ready for the work day.  Everyone is a team player and very willing to help fellow team members
good,"Co workers are annoying, but it's like that everywhere. People aren't trained very well. Typical day at work would be cleaning, smiling at people, and deal with their compaints."
good,"I opened the grill and ran the grill from 10 am to 4 pm. my co-workers were okay, management was good. a typical day was to stock, prepare food, and clean. the hardest part was to stock the food boxes in the freezers."
good,"I made friends with nearly all of my co workers"
good,great place to work just wasnt cooperating with my school schedule. coworkers are fun. Managers friendly everything was cool.
good,I sometimes opened and others days I closed. So it depended on the job at hand that day. I liked running the register and drive thru. They were 2 of my favorite things to do. The hardest part was closing making sure everything was cleaned right and sometimes they were long nights. The most enjoyable was talking to the customers and making new friends.
good,Working here was good just out of high school. I needed a job to get me by until I got onto the next phase of my life and I worked at Wendy's. It was a good place to work and I made some good friends.
good,"Customer service was great, I have learned a lot from working at Wendy's. I also gained a lot of customer service skills."
good,"Trabajar en Wendys era un poco dificil, ya que era mi primera vez trabajando con comida. Ensamblar la comida era un poco complicado, preparar las carnes era dificil. Pero a pesar de todos aprendi muy rapido y mis compañeros y superiores me alagaban. La pero parte del trabajo era cuando eramos pocos empleados y se llenaba el establecimiento. Lo mas que me gusto del trabajo fue que aprendi a ser tolerante y que tenia que bregar con personas y me encanta bregar con las personas"
good,I usually worked graveyard shifts we would take apart and clean all greasers and fry bats maintaine cleanliness cashier take care of general questions cooked and closed down
good,Working at this place definitely gave me a different outlook on customer service. I learned that you might not always make the customers happy or may be able to fix every problem but knowing that you did your best is all that matters.
good,Enjoyed being in drive thur n on fryer its fun. not A fan of running cash register .cleaning up a must . Co worker worked very little.
good,"To prepare meals for customers, work along side managers making sure the store meet criteria. Clean the facility and restrooms."
good,"great coworkers, this company will keep you busy, time will fly by, you will meet life long friends, the work is fun, love making customer laugh"
good,cool work but the boss was hella rude and yelled at employees in front of customers and then the customers would yell at you for having bad customer service skills even tho u were just fine before the boss yelled at you
good,I usually get there on time.  I learn how to deal with different customers and different coworkers.  Not every manager will be fair because favoritism is definitely shown. Co-workers are alright.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who are scattered brain and people who get annoyed or anger too easily. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk to customer and to be able to make their day.
good,Though there is not room for advancement with this company overall I enjoyed working here. I met regular customers and the staff was friendly and fun to work with.
good,"what can you expect from a fast food place. that is about all i have to say about that, once you have worked at one they all seem about the same!"
good,I worked with a really good crew for 1 year and 6 months. The menu is constantly growing and the work was fast paced. Management was friendly and professional.
good,"I have learned alot from working at many different places, i've met many of people. Not everyone is nice, but thats what you have to learn to deal with and accept. I enjoy every day i come to work. I never bring my problems from home to work. Even though i have children that doesn't stop me from coming to work. I am a very hard worker."
good,Manger was family friend and was friendly and helpful to me. I received free meals and enjoyed working with Co- workers. Food was easy to cook and serve and I enjoyed being a cashier.
good,"Simple job but very up beat job at times. Fairly easy to pick up methods and concept."
good,"This was my first job where I was taught to give customers quick yet amazing service. This is also were I learned how to multitask. I didn't really like the general manger but she liked me. She could just be passive aggressive and would show her anger. Even if you get frustrated or upset, always smile and make the best of your job. You are the reason if you enjoy it or not. I loved what I did, and if I had to go back in time and rework here I would."
good,"Wendy's is an alright company to work for."
good,"can be fun and easy to move up positions just be careful at a young age, i worked for about 9 months as a fryer and moved up to cashier within 2 months or less"
good,"It was fun while it lasted, but I'm growing up and it was time for me to look for a better job. Its a good place to start when you're in and graduating from high school."
good,Wendy's was my first job it was okay as a teenager out of high school everything was great I fall in love with that thought I became a shift manager at the age of 18 Stills in school then afterwards my store closed down and I actually stopped working for fast food after that Wendy's was great to work at
good,"good job, Wendy's Taco Salad - I paid over $7 for the large and looked like the small. I heard everything came separate, but when I got my order the chili was on top and I questioned and told I have to order to go. Was my first time ordering. So I got the salad and I noticed that a lot of the salad underneath was rotten. I ate most of the top and I had ordered a Jr. Bacon CB too. Well that saved me from actually going up and complaining. I was hungry. I know better next time."
good,"standard fast food job. about what you'd expect. somewhat decent pay, decent hours, good workers, some workers are super lazy. Restaurant closed years ago"
good,"Working at Wendy's is a decent job to get started with, especially for teens in search of a job, but in essence do not stay any longer than necessary, many of these restaurants tend to have sub par to decent quality."
good,I like working at Wendy's. The crew we had were cool to work around. It was just management. They were to unorganized. Certain things that wasn't acceptable.
good,Working here was not a bad first job. I really enjoyed my time here and the people I met at the job. I had no issues with management or issues with customers. The reason for leaving personally was reduced hours.
good,"I start off checking in, and then I proceed to my position. In terms of co-workers, they were all very nice people and very helpful. Therefore it is a good job for a student who is seeking for a part time job."
good,"Crew workers"
good,"I needed to go to the hospital one night and the manager refused it, my grandmother had to finish all my work just for me to be able to go to the hosptial to get the treatment i needed."
good,i wrote a review already. the job was decent. i didn't enjoy the greasy environment but the people that i worked with were great.
good,"We had 4 managers and all but 1 were horrible. As employees, we kinda just did what we wanted to. thats how bad it got. Lots of calloffs. Chaotic mess"
good,Friendly co workers. Fast paced environment. Terrible management. Manager sat around a day. Some policies are ridiculous. Long 30 minuet breaks.
good,"Opening, food prep. "
good,Environment provides opportunity to gain management experience and develop positive customer service. Each store is different depending on the manager at the location.
good,Nice comfortable environment with friendly people who work together as a team. Clean tables and take customers orders successfully and provide service
good,nice environment to work in i got along with all my employees.Also was a great experience working their i learned i work good with others.
good,"The fast food job primarily consists of taking customer orders, preparing menu items, and displaying friendly attitudes at all times."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I learned that the cashier side of a fast food restaurant is more stressful than I expected. The hardest part of the job would be to keep customers busy and keep their minds off of their orders if their orders took a while to make, and taking rude comments from them. The most enjoyable part would be when customers would compliment how I worked, and my co-workers cracking some jokes here and there, making the job less stressful."
good,drove over 50 miles to work to work 10 hr shifts at a 24 hr store with 40-50 employees it was also opened every day of the year.my emplyees and customers were great tp work with.
good,There were really long work days  and it got really stressful at times and the manager's were not very good at all but the people that worked there were pretty cool
good,"Some mean workers, and did not give you the work time that you required. Always need to work 8 hours a day. Did not care about your own feeling."
good,"place used to be better but under new management it has changed a lot. You will not have any personal life as they call you 10 times per day on your days off just for little things. everybody blames everything on each other, no respect from higher up managers."
good,"good money, good benefits, company makes sure us managers get a 5 year food certification course that is good   in all 50 states .good training ,and some pretty great people"
good,I loved working at Wendy's everybody I worked for was very understanding of me being a highschool student stuff came up and they understanded we would talk and joke all day too make the day go by faster
good,"This job was such a laid back job to work for. The management team was outstanding to work for, and my coworkers were always there when I needed them. Basically they gave a family atmosphere."
good,most of the time very good and easy going place but absolutely no team work between managers and crew members poor attitude
good,"the staff was unprofessional and had no discipline. The pay was minimum wage and part time, so I barely got hours, unable to provide for a family with this type of pay. The location I was at, wouldn't let me transfer."
good,Busy a lot and the managers weren't really that nice to me. Helped me a lot with cashier skills because I was put on register most of the time. When we were hit with a rush I was working at drive thru taking orders and I had to be quick because there were cars waiting behind.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced usually when busy"
good,Wendys was faced paced there was no time to sit down the workplace was clean employees were great they helped me get into the flow of things quickly the mmanager helped a lot to during rush hours
good,This was like every other fast food restaurant I have worked for. Typical ups and downs. You have to have some what tough skin working in fast food places. You can really be tested. Everything has a certain system that they go by that just works for them. You have to look at your co-workers and figure out how to make them blend together as a unit. I loved having timed competitions and hated rude customers.
good,"I learned how to have good manners, my communication skills are on point  and customer service skills are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to satisfy the customers so they can come back again"
good,"This was my first job I ever had. I loved the place, loved the people. Management was amazing and they were also very nice and organized people. If I could have stayed I would have.."
good,"It's a job, but at least most of the crew are nice though there are one or two bad managers that can ruin your day. all in all you could do worse for minimum wage."
good,I had an easy job securing the area but the supervisor's here were very rude and not understanding I told them will start back in college again and that I need weekend shifts only which I made them aware of this before they even hired me they were not understandable so I quit
good,"This job is perfect for students in high school or college. My experience was great. The managers were friendly and professional. The co-workers were fine. Overall, the store was neat and welcoming."
good,This job is mainly good for improving customer relations skills and building management skills. Hardest part of the job is being patient and making sure that you can learn all aspects of the job. Best part of the job is dealing with different people.
good,"I will never work at Wendy's again, they make you work so hard for only $7.50 an hr. As a cashier there I had to clean the restrooms and the lobby, and dirty trays when it wasn't busy and helping by getting customers orders ready."
good,"Wendy's have good workers and managers. You will most definitely get the hours, you just have been willing to do the work."
good,Wendys is a fun filled working environment with love staff and customers. it serves Quality and is the definition f old fashioned. dave thomas would be proud
good,decent job for a college student keeps u busy during out of school hours and the pay makes sure you can keep a little money in your pocket
good,"Great work environment , with great staff and management. There where purks working at this job but overall they worked with me to get the job done , and that was greatly appreciated"
good,"Wendy's was a friendly place to work. It was good to get to know the customers that were loyal to the store. Once you got to know them and what the order regularly, you could make their food before they even order it. I liked to dance and sing while making sandwiches, and the customer enjoy every bit of it. You have to work as a team or the flow of things will not meet customer satisfaction."
good,It is a cool and clean work environment. Hours are decent and so is pay. Managers are friendly and employees are mostly easy to work with. Benefits are average.
good,I learned to get alone with the customer work at a fast paste to get the orders out correctly and to keep work area clean and hazard free at the end of the day to clean the work area for the next day
good,"The pay isn't the greatest, but you get to be in an air conditioned building with snack machines and you don't have to work over the weekend which is a plus for everybody."
good,Typical fast-food restaurant. I was the Customer Service Representative which meant I dealt with a lot of different people with different personality making work quite interesting.
good,"Wendy's keep you real busy, dealing with customers in drive thru and customers at the front counter. They could use a little more help focusing on upfront then having everyone help in drive thru."
good,"N"
good,Co-workers were easy to get along with! Learning experience and easy to move up in company. The pay is pretty low needed something a little bit consistent.
good,Never board. Never the same day twice. A different fast ball to hit daily.Competitive pay. . 55hrs a week tops. five weeks paid vacation .
good,Wendy's was a good first job to have i enjoyed working  with my coworkers. I Learned how to put my differences aside and sure that my costumers get what they deserve.
good,Great work environment. Offers lots of skills and gives you the ability to improve your customer service speed and reaction time.
good,"working at Wendy's was a challenging and learning experience. Going to work I would have to leave all personal problems a home and come to work with a positive and helpful attitude. I only manage my area and that was the window.  never gave my manager a problem. When I was ask to do something, even if it wasn't my job, I did it. I got along with mostly every co-worker. the hardest part of my job is having everything done before the store is ready for close. Most enjoyable part of the day is when all I had to do was clean up because it was time to go home."
good,great people fun job easy going learning new things always something to do never just standing around staff treated the way they should be manager worked with you
good,"They have very good structure , systems & applications. They provide an intense training period & teach you all aspects of the business"
good,Wendys was my first job so I really did enjoy working there that's why I stayed so long don't mind going back just witch it was open 24 hours  it was a lot of multitasking todo but I got the job done mangers were lazy
good,"On a day to day basis I would be responsible for cashier, dish washer, bathroom maintenance and vacuuming floors. I had multiple jobs while working in a fast paced restaurant. I enjoyed working with my co-workers if I ever had a problem they would help me."
good,"While working at Wendy's, I have learned quite a lot about food service. I have gotten to know some interesting people and learned how to prepare different food items."
good,I liked working here but I felt as if I was being mistreated and I wasn't getting enough hours and pay was not good at all. Managers were nice but most costumers gave me a hard time!
good,great people and workers could get very busy but i like busy.   a lot of skills could be learned here and room to grow in the field and others
good,It is a good place to work for someone who needs flexible hours and part time work. Things are not repaired like they should be. The kitchen didn't have an air conditioning for a whole year to the point the onions on the prep table at times were beginning to slime. These are unbearable conditions.
good,"Don't be nervous. Try to study the menu as much as you can. If you are starting off on the register then you will need to learn the menu so that you can answer customer questions and be able to ring in items accurately. You need to know how all of the sandwiches/wraps are topped, what items go with the salads, what items you can pair with the salads/substitute in combos etc.etc. You really should be learning a production position before touching a cash register so that you actually are preparing the items first. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. Wendy's has a training system in place so that you are given plenty of information about your duties."
good,"went smooth an fast"
good,it was an ok job. I got treated somewhat unpoorly by co workers and didn't appreciate.it was an ok job though. wasnt the best job because of how I was being treated mainly due to the fact their were people that did not like me because my sister also worked there.
good,Hours were too flip floppy. Work wasn't hard. Enjoyed working with customers. Good job for teens looking for a temporary job while in school but I wouldn't recommend trying to have a career there.
good,"It was a good starter job. I worked There in high school the employees and managers got along good and had no problems. I would not want to make it my career though, but that's my opinion."
good,it was the okay place but not the workers they were very lazy and they kind of slacked off a lot when I was there nad when I would ask to transfir to another store closer to me my gm that was there just told me what was wrong with the bus I was 16 and I didn't have money yet and I lived in the west side goiong to the wendys passing north star mall like it was far but she didn't want to do it because she said that she needed me to be there because I help keep the workers on track but over all it was okay
good,management was awesome. Awesome teamwork from everybody. No problems. There was always a positive vibe when you walked through the doors. I never felt like i was at a bad job.
good,"Great place to work. The atmosphere is very busy, and unpredictable. I really enjoying working with the people, they are fun and I love the environment."
good,A very fast pace during lunch hours. Challenging to make sure all area were running properly. The hardest part was to smile even when someone has been rude to you.
good,"I learned a lot of things. I learned grill station, fry station, sandwich station, somewhat.. I know how to work a register, I know how to handle and count cash, especially if you went to school. The people are...ok. Its all stressful, ain't no flowers and happy days and songs of joy. It's hard work and I like it, I'm on my feet nonstop. I can't stand there and do nothing."
good,"Not the best job, but certainly not bad. The job itself was not much fun, often having to deal with uncooperative, impatient, or rude customers, however there are also several nice regulars whom you get to know over a long span of working there. For me it was the managers and coworkers that provided the most enjoyment on the job, several of whom made the days go much smoother, and faster."
good,"Awesome place to work because you get to learn a whole lot, as a first job it was decent but in the end it wasnt enough pay for what you end up dpoing for them."
good,"Taking customers order, Making food, Make sure the store is organized and clean. Things I learn from this job is to deal with customers issues, customers service and time management. The hardest part of this job is that it does go well with school scheduled. The most enjoyable of the job is hanging out with co workers."
good,"the managers are very mentally abusive and the co workers bully other coworkers and are rude to customers."
good,"Any typical day would start out fine with making meals and doing chores. I learn work schedules, experience and other things like stocking, cooking and cleaning. The management and co-workers were alright at first, but the work ethnics got worst as time goes on. The hardest part is to deal with multiply situations like handling food, giving the food to the customers, and also micromanage the orders in order from first customer to the next. The job felt fun with the cooking cause I like to cook and stocking and cleaning I don't really mine."
good,Hey ... Its Wendy's. .. Its a pretty laid back atmosphere but can get hectic at times ... Its a good start off job to get your feet wet in the working world ...
good,i learned even if there is bad management the relationship with coworkers can over poweer it in so many ways. the most enjoyable part of this job are meeting new people
good,Working for this company was fun for the employee aspect but management not so much very rude and unprofessional poor characteristics in handling situations. bonus were great
good,"A Typical day at work will be giving a customer excellent satisfaction  of there visited to the restaurant, fast pace working environment "
good,I only worked at Wendy's as a summer job in High school. It was a pretty nice work environment overall. The only Negative aspect about working with Wendy's my hours were very low.
good,a typical day working at Wendy's in Merrimack which is closed now wasn't my favorite. i learened alot after awhile everything became quick and easy to do. most of my co-workers never showed up to work so we never really had a strong team. The hardest part about my job was having rude and disrespectful customers
good,Managers are trying to keep the work place fun filled to ease the work pressure. Some manager can't handle the work pressure. biggest thing i have learned here is to keep yourself calm and cool during the busy hours.
good,When working with Wendy's I had many duties to do but the work there was fairly easy I was always in a fast paste as well to but other than that it was great working there
good,"At Wendy’s I had the job title working in the kitchen as a fry cook. When working in the kitchen, I acquired the skills to prepare food in a fast pace."
good,Typically you will go in on a Monday morning at 6 AM for full store inventory. You will have to send payroll every other week and sales every day to the DM. You order truck 3 times a week. Do checklists to make sure everything is ready for the day. I have learned how to manage the employees and the store.
good,"fast paced working days"
good,this job right here is no good to work for wendy's it was a manager try to change me so she took me off the schedule and she try to take my job a way from me...but i did not change for her i change for my kids...at that time i left that job.
good,it is a fast food place do i really have to say more the store i work at all my friends work there so it was pretty nice. We all grew up and got new jobs and careers
good,"There is always something to do, almost always busy.   The managers are never far away, and often help with getting food prepared.   I do my best every day,  and I get along with my managers.  It is a good first job, but you would need to be a manager to get significant pay."
good,Wendy's overall was a good fun and productive workplace but the managers themselves could use a lot of improvement. From talking behind their employees backs to choosing favorites. The crew members were great and I enjoyed working with them.
good,I learned basic cooking and cleaning. I learned how to read with all different types of people. Everyone is different in their own way and I learned to accept that.
good,"Move way too fast and gave you zero chance to breath."
good,I was able to work different areas of the job. I learned a lot. We made a good team. I liked the ability to work different shifts and learn a variety of tasks
good,"As my first official job, Wendy's was an amazing experience, the friends I made there changed my life for the better. I learned so much like how to work with computers, money, registers and discipline in the work place."
good,"Got along great with my boss and coworkers. Pretty fast paced, never bored, always something to do. Did not get enough hours though. Lots of different people to work with, met a few friends."
good,"Good place to learn how to multitask, work as a part of a team, and take care of customers' needs. The worst part of the job is having to take care of unappreciative customers, while the best part is building relationships with customers who reciprocate their appreciation for the workers."
good,Wendy's is flexible with work your schedule if you are looking to work part time.  They do not really give you full time hours unless you are a manager.
good,"- Learned to work under stressful situations"
good,"Easy job, easy responsibility, but I'm not the kind to be stuck in one position all day, everyday."
good,"I like that it was fast pace, interacted with new people everyday, but I didn't like some of the employees, because they were High School rivals"
good,This was not a bad place to work but the people you worked with mad it hard! There was a lot of favoritism at this job! However it was really fast paste just like I like it I learned a lot of patients working at this job!
good,"the day went by fast a nd the people were really cool "
good,"Works well with college and high school students, you must learn fast and you should never make excuses for why you can not preform your job will."
good,"Its a good job but the General Manager doesn't know what she's doing. "
good,"Wendy's corporate was up for sale so the situation was strange, not knowing what was next. I had found a different job so I left."
good,"Daily activities consisted of cleaning, talking to costumers, lifting and moving packages, and making food.  It was a good working experience."
good,"They have their favorite employers and show favoritism."
good,"A typical day at work was generally busy and long. I developed many skills such as dealing with peers all day, and being constantly productive."
good,this company doesnt care about its employee and treats u like a number when i had a family emergency they told me if i left i wouldnt have a job
good,I worked at Wendy's as I went to school and my schedule was adjusted accordingly. Not being able to work full time meant I never really got to climb the ladder or get a significant pay raise though.
good,this was my first job as a cook. Pay wasn't so great had to work several hours in order to get a good paycheck.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, and we are usually under staffed. I always come to work and do my best, but the environment is sometimes disorganized. But remaining professional at all times is the key ! What I have learned from my experience at this job is patience and how to deal with others, and how I can implement these things into my career path. The hardest part of the job is being able to adjust to others who may not work as hard as I do, and being able to manage time when we are short staffed.But even though it is a hard part is also a learning experience that makes me work harder and I can benefit from the experience in the future. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers and also being able to enjoy quality time with my fellow co-workers."
good,Wendys was very fast pace very organized place.There was always something to do never down time. the manager was amazing very hands on always ready to help. co workers would present drama but management keep it very causal. Best part was having a store manager who loved an stayed on her job.
good,wendys was okay to work at for a while then the gm started under staffing half the shifts and would never train the new workers it would get busy and the manager would never help out the hours were bad from week to week the coworkers were the best though some of them really do work hard but with all the new people who didn't know how to do half the stuff around the store it was kind of hard to get all your work done right and correct and efficient.
good,Very different work environment people were very hostile and unhappy. I was let go because I was going on vacation for too many days ( a week).
good,"it was excited lering new mchnees that came out into the store . new sandwhices, etc I like working with the crew mangmants sucks they don't cre bout employees at all."
good,"wendys was an alright first job experience. the managing was somewhat great, I felt as though there was lack of teamwork. the customers made me feel very welcomed."
good,For this being my first job it was great! I had done tons of volunteering and this was a great transition because of the experience I had with working with all types of people and customers.
good,While I was there I learned how to operate the cash register and all the other equipment required. The hardest part of the job was getting used to having to go so fast at first but after awhile I got the hang of it. The management was good and and the co-workers were okay other then some of them brought personal stuff to the job on occasion.
good,it is too busy  and rush hour suck and the work place suck also i like my friends coworker  but not the mangers . the food place was not very clean
good,"A typical day at work consisted with me taking orders from customers and providing them with a friendly experience. I learned responsibility,management and food safety."
good,This was fun as it was my first fast food job. The job just closed down and relocated. I figured it was time to get in a bigger kitchen.
good,"not a place to make a career. dirty place to work, Management is lacking. only stuck to one specific job. Worked with a lot of kids."
good,"ok overall learn sanitation, food safety, customer service. had some management training in the company, learn labor cuts, counting and depositing money, great team building skills and connecting with the costumer management was decent"
good,"during the week we had slow days sometime we were busy but on weekends we were busy and all day. learn how to make the sandwiches, run the grill. management was good they were nice and fun to work with and so was my co-workers. we had fun but still had the our jobs done and we help each other when we need too."
good,love working here just not with the drama love my boss she is fair and kind and caring. she is understanding to everyone's needs wouldn't mind working for her In the future
good,It is a good workplace. There is sometimes some drama but I don't like drama and always try to avoid it. Overall good workplace.
good,They push us to work hard and do our best. The team is fun to work with and management is a delight. If you do your job and do it well they give you the hours you need. They reward the good workers.
good,a typical day at work is very busy and productive helping the costamers get what they want but id say the hardest thing is making the food and trying to listen to orders coming in but also learning how to make the sandwitches but what the good thing about it is learning how to grill and cook
good,I enjoyed this job because of my co-workers and management. i never mind getting dirty and they didn't mind giving me overtime when i needed it
good,"Working at Wendy's was the worst experience every, For that to be my very first job i really hated it. i felt like the work we was doing was not good enough and no one worked as a team. The job had me very over whelmed,"
good,"I love being a manager. My general manger is a wonder man, he works with me to develop my potential as a training restaurant manager. My typical day is managing anywhere between 9-10 employees on a shift. It can be a opening shift. I enforce the my Wendys culture. Ensuring that when a customer walks into the store that they welcomed from the time that they walk in, to the time they leave. If a customer come to me with a issue, i use problem solving to make the customer happy. The hardest part of my job, is sometime with all the power that I have, some customers are just not happy. The most enjoyable part of my job, is my employees are happy and that my customers keep coming back.The management is wonderful we work together as a team, to ensure that employees and customer have a great experience. I learned that I should customers how I want to be treated, because at the end of day I'm also a customer when I go to their job."
good,Wendy's was a fast operating place. The management team was great. My co-workers were fun to work around. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with professional and kind co workers.
good,"I learned how to work with customers and give respect, the co-workers were awesome, management was good, I enjoyed working their for a high school job"
good,"I enjoyed working there as the cook. I learned to save time and work quickly yet carefully. The most difficult part about this job was the pay. Its a fairly easy job, just not worth what I was earning."
good,I believe wendy's is a good place to work. It allows you to gain confidence with customers and gain customer service experience.
good,"Simple and easy busy-work, but becomes really annoying stand-around that begins to bore. If you aren't looking for a job that's mostly standing around and pushing buttons, avoid this job"
good,I like the people I worked with but they were horrible in keeping the facility drama free and the managers were very rude. They were very bad with working around my school schedule and very rude to their employers.
good,busy stressful fun management wendys is life kids mean 4 for 4 frosty management sucks a good start into the work field easy to work your way up in management
good,"not interesting work"
good,A typical day is very fast pace. i learned how to operate the computer and make sandwiches. The management is okay. I loved my co-workers. we all tried to get a long. the hardest part of the job is when we get rushed with a long of people. the most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
good,"A typical workday at wendys was very busy & usually short-handed. it was stressful, but it paid the bills. I was able to obtain full time employment and receive a raise over time."
good,I really needed a job so I took this one just because I needed the money. I really didn't like it. I didn't like when you the one doing all the work and others are playing around.
good,"this wasn't my first job ever but it was my first. this is where I learned all of my hard work my dedication and how to work around a schedule and multitask. I've worked here since high school then through college, and during other jobs so the people there were like family to me"
good,"I worked there for a small period of time and there were to many issues with staff and management. Overall it was a good job, besides the issues going on inside with staff."
good,flexible hours... very knowledgeable and supportive... learned all aspects of retail store operations  manager very good at service and support...
good,Good co-workers. Friendly people. Sometimes not enough staff. Benefits okay. Pay rate could be better. Not enough hours and slow to advance staff.
good,"very nice owners, nice managers, cool crew, new general manager came in and ruined a lot of things. I learned a lot and connected well with the crew and managers. hardest part of the day was during rush with new people. most enjoyable part were times of low flow."
good,This was my first job. I learned a lot here about food safety and working with the public. As a manager I learned how to do inventory and ordering. I also learned how to lead the crew as a team.
good,"Although working for the most busiest Wendys is hard, its also fun depending on who is working. You will get pushed to you limits but that helps establish yourself in that line of work."
good,It was a place to work when I needed it the most. The people were great the hours were long and it's minimum wage. But it was a fun experience
good,"I was required to work with cash registers, & short tempered customers. I also was involved in the food prep & taking orders in the drive thru."
good,"The work is great, The company is well established, the people I worked with were awesome, because they were friendly and tea oriented."
good,"While I enjoyed my time at Wendy's, the location was a bit different because it was controlled by the Pilot Travel Store,"
good,"The pay is minimum wage at best, there's little benefits, you do get a discount on their fast food,  the hours are all over the place sometimes and can be stressful at times on busy days.  but all in all it is a wonderful environment for those that are looking for their first job, great co workers awesome managers and great christmas events, perfect for those that are just looking for part time work."
good,"I am happy that I chose Wendy's as my first job. Working there was a good model for what to expect in the work force. They did not offer much for benefits, however they did allow me to work full time and even overtime on occasion."
good,I learnt about how to prioritize and manage my free time effectively. Also I learnt that every tiny task goes a long way and contributes to the entire restaurant effectiveness and efficiency.
good,Each store has its own atmosphere. Each has their own problem customers and their problem employees. It comes with the fast food territory.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consists of taking orders at a fast pace, making sure the customers are happy, I learned how to work with people under extreme stress. The co-workers are friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was the managers pick about every little thing and they barely let you attempt your job independently. The most enjoyable part is working the drive thru window during night shift."
good,it is a good work place were the coworkers get along well and all there for the people. I have enjoyed my time as a cahier at wendys
good,"A typical day at Wendy's could go three different ways, this would include a busy day when full staffed, a busy day when understaffed, and a slow day understaffed. With the seasons always changing so does the appetite of consumers, and it is because of this that right before a rush hits that people are sent home because of labor being so high and when it is slow we are constant on cleaning and prepping for the next rush to hit. During my time at Wendy's I have learned about how to take care of customers, making the store clean and desirable to eat in, and preparing food for the customers to eat."
good,"Interacting with guests, co-workers were great, learned a great deal about running a company, not only from a customer point of view, but also from the business point of view."
good,"co workers great, friendly customer service, very up beat and fast pace. Was always a challenge managing a crew when people called off."
good,"A typical deals with taking and getting orders together, helping the customers with their orders, and in between orders i find time to stock my station, do pre-close. Also to make sure before i leave, that my station is ready and prepared for the next shift. The management is okay, but could use improvement. My co-workers is very pleasant and friendly, I made great Friends that help make the shift go by quicker and to help handle rushes. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers, knowing that you say or react to ignorance while clocked in is frustrating and tiresome. Last but not least the most enjoyable part of my job is being at the Drive-Thru window and seeing my customers leave my line satisfied, and a great big smile on their faces to show me that I'm doing my job right. And the multiply compliments on a daily basis is very touching."
good,"I liked working for Wendy's it's just some stores management needs improvement, everybody needs to be properly trained to do their jobs, other than that Wendy's is a great place to work especially for a first job"
good,Working here I was able to different people from different states. I learned a lot about fast food. I really enjoyed working with the public.
good,"Very helpful learning environment, some management was difficult to work with."
good,It was a good job the hours were good and I liked the people. It was just very difficult to work full time hours while going to school at the same time.
good,teamwork was a big area in this job it was in fort mcmurry lived out the for about a 2 years never thought I would see myself flipping burgers.
good,"Job is repetitive and the hours are long. Boss don't replace broken equipment, and we often run out of food because they are trying to cut down on food costs."
good,As a General manager you are held accountable for all areas of the restaurant.  The hardest part is dealing with low wages and limited hours for employees
good,Work was fun here at Wendy's. You learned how to deal with all different personalities and work hard. Management was great here. Every single person on the staff worked hard. Hardest part of the job was being sort staffed. It was a very busy location always. Most enjoyable part was the bosses always bought you pizza when you did a good job.
good,"Everyday gave me more to learn with more responsibility. Being able to handle certain tasks that not everyone could do was a good experience. This was because it gave me a higher sense of responsibility showing me how important some jobs were over others. You learn that one simple task such as putting enough salt in the salt-shakers while opening before everyone arrives, can help a lot when business starts to kick in. You also meet a lot of different personalities. Always learn to work with everyone is something I keep within my head.One of the difficult aspects of working for a fast food restaurant is pace. One hour your cleaning to pass time, and the next you have a dozen customers waiting for thirty dollar orders. Its called ""Fast Food"" for a reason though."
good,"managers are costumer oriented, the service is normally fast, if the flow of food is slow it will pick up in ten minutes. working their was really fun and fast paced. the employees are very friendly."
good,"I got the job in high school people i worked with were fun up beat yet very hard workers; when something needed to be done they did it "
good,This company was run by an incompetent area director making it incredibly difficult to follow constant changing procedures and succeed.  The changes weren't the issue it was the person presenting them
good,if you like fast paced working this is the job for u makes your time go by really fast especially during lunch rush. Great place to work and start off pay ain't that bad and you can work you way up to a even better position where the pay and benefits are even better
good,"it's enjoyable to serve customers and giving satisfaction to every customers by simply rendering fast,friendly and efficient service to everyone, establish quality product and promote fantastic dining experience. Everyday is a learning experience i have encountered."
good,I wouldn't recommend wendys if you don't like people or rude people.. constantly getting blamed for prices and other things you have no control over
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's would be full of laughter, positive energy and a lot of moving around. There has to be constant communication and you have to be able to always stay on your feet and make sure you have fun doing your job."
good,There was a lot chaos and the staff a lot of the time were unorganized. It was also very hard to stay focused on just one task at times because the environment often was to chaotic with little supervision.
good,I was closing grill mostly. Grill closers basically clean everything in the store but the dishes. When I first joined I didnt really like any of my co-workers but slowly the bad workers quit or were fired so after a while it was a solid team of workers.
good,"A typical day of work is extremely busy. During our lunch and dinner hours we handled high volumes of customers. I experienced a very busy environment and learned not only to be a cashier, but I also ensured a clean restaurant. I cleaned the dining room and bathrooms, also in the kitchen. I was a drive-thru cashier as well and that was quite the experience, also very busy area. Management was quite excellent. I became friends with my supervisors and manager. Although there was a bit of favoritism when giving out hours. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the dining room clean at our rush hour times. Sometimes no one could make it out to clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely talking to the customers. We had a lot of regulars and they were all very friendly. Since I am also a very friendly and sociable person, I got along extremely well with not only my co-workers but the customers as well."
good,"This company is good company to work for.  Overall attitude is good, and every thing is laid back and easy-going.  I like the benefits and the independent work environment."
good,This was a good first job for me to have. It got me into the door to have more job opportunities. I loved the coworkers that I was with although sometimes it was personal conflicts interfering with the job environment and some managers were not being fair with the raises and giving people days off.
good,"Management level was a breeze, GM's allowed us to control what employees we had and where we placed them. The Wendy's company is a organized work place where very little gets by with out being completed the proper way."
good,I enjoyed working there even though most employees were not serious about the service they provided within the company.
good,"food safety"
good,"Working for Wendy's was ok, I always had something to do and had fun coworkers but I got very little hours and I thought that that wasn't worth the heart ache."
good,well I didn't work here very long. actually this was my first job coming out of high school then I went straight into the military. but it was ok. got along with everyone and learned how to work in fast pasting environments.
good,"plenty of interesting things to learn. learned how to manage and troubleshoot store operations including but not limited to store openiung nd closing, as well as maintaining shifts and products. learned how to do invoices nd truck orders through sygma.  co- workers were generally friendly and helpful with each other as well as myself"
good,I did enjoy working at Wendy's but some of the other employees were very hard to get along with and most were very childish in the work place.
good,"The management worked with me and my school schedule. Although working the night shift was way too much for me. The pay was not that great either. I did work hard, but I feel as though I wasn't appreciated for it."
good,"Typical day at work very stressful environment,  most Co-workers and customers are what make the job nice, Most generally a good place to work."
good,I was on a minimum salary. scheduled for 50 hours weekly but found myself doing 60. If you left on time you were frowned upon by upper management.
good,Wendys was very unprofessional. The people they had in charge was very sneaky and very much rude. I would never go back to wendys
good,Good job to work. Decent hours if you re willing to work. Recommended for hard workers only. Working with friendly people.
good,"Working with the public always a challenge that i love facing,The benefits were good and so some of the perks.Management was very fair and flexible."
good,"Worked during high school, and it worked out very well. A typical day at work was sometimes criticized with delays or customer rants but we got through it."
good,You just run the cash register and be nice to the customers. At the location I was at the managers were pretty nice. Closing the store was fun. The hardest part was cleaning the grill.
good,"Wendy's is a great job for when you need some change during high school. However, looking at it as a long term job or a career isn't great, Customers aren't very friendly and a lot of the employees aren't either, you just have to have patience and self control."
good,A typical day at Wendy's was just getting up going. what  i learn from Wendy's is how to move up and find better. My management team could learn better  to being a manager. the hardest part was being there for 6 years. the great part was meeting new people thru cashier.
good,my day would start out by opening the store starting the salads and cooking bacon for the day. then I was responsible for the customers until employees would come in. the hardest part of the job was jus tryin to please the gm manger
good,"It was too much of a high school atmosphere, however management was helpful and job was balanced on busy work and downtime"
good,Great learning opportunity. Working here gives you the chance to meet different type of people. Great stress tester when working under pressure. Great opportunity to grow in the company but it will take years.
good,This place really cares about their employee's well being and are very motivating. They also are very lenient when it comes to taking time off.
good,I work their at fourteen and half loved that let teens work their at early age I need to get my own car and did so as I work their
good,The owners want to see results but when u have manager in competition with each other than helping and want to progress . The DM use to always scream at you and be defensive instead of walking through the step and coaching u. The DM always micro managing not letting GM run their store .
good,"working at Wendy's was like working at any other typical fast food restaurant. A typical day at work consist of non-stop customers all day so you have to be fast, but orders must be right. There's a competition between all fast food restaurant who can provide the fastest quality customer service."
good,I learned so much in the amount of time I was there and earned a promotion. It always feels great to satisfy a persons' needs with a smile in return
good,hard work when busy. alot of work for be paid less. but good co workers. manager needs to take care of workers. needs to pay more workers.
good,"again, another generic fast food job involving cleaning/cooking ect. nothing good or bad to say. ""insert random filler for 20 word min count here"""
good,Here it was a typical day at any regular fast food restaurant. The Best part of the job was making a customer satisfied and wanting to come back.
good,"Over the 14+ years I had worked for the company, I saw it switch hands from corporate to franchise. At the beginning it was wonderful. The company does have high expectations which I thoroughly enjoyed. They are not friendly to employees that have a family or children. Best bet or hire for them is for a single person with no outside lifestyle. The co-workers are all very likeable. It is a very stressful job since most people don't understand how hard you actually have to work in fast food and customers treat you badly. Depending on the store you work in the management are nice to work with. They do pay well and they do offer benefits. They do give you hours based on your availability. The more available you are, the more hours you receive."
good,"you had good days the you had your bad days , good days everyone worked and did what they were suppose too do then your day days when 2-3 workers called off and you worked so hard that no one could help anyone and guest were mad management didn't help much"
good,It is a good job for a stepping stone. If you are in high school I would say go for it. teaches good work ethic. Other than dicounts on food they have no benefits
good,"good learnt new things, different environment not much communication between workers, everyone had a role to play, was organised and got on with the job at hand"
good,It was my first job I learned how to do everything around the restaurant from opening to closing. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I had a good time working there and it was some cash in my pocket. Love the food there so it was a plus as well.
good,friendly outgoing people..love working here and everyone that worked there with me.. loved talking with the custmours
good,"job stability, good group to work with. the hardest part of the job is when employees didn't show up to work and we had to have extra work to do which made our jobs harder and customers became angry"
good,Customer Service is the most important factory in working in a fast food restaurant such as Wendy`s you will learn how to be patient with the customers and learn how to deal with different attitudes that each customer may have.
good,"Couldn't communicate with my co-workers properly."
good,"I work at the Wendy's in Pickens when it was first built. it was a very clean place but the people there are not. Id go in and start cooking on the grill, and dropping chicken in the friars. after we closed we would start cleaning up, scrubbing the floors and washing dishes.  we'd lock the doors and go home."
good,"Wendy's ,is a good company to work at for your first job.However they should pay more because you are expected to work long hr."
good,This I a great job but you have some mean customers from time to time and some managers show favoritism between the crew members
good,its one of the most cleanest places I have worked its very professional and your expected to maintain a high level of customer volume
good,The location was great and management was awesome. It was a very fast paced work environment. I met friends that I will have for life and overall it was a great experience.
good,"Never got tired of working here because you always have something different to do, although it had overall good enrolled it also had a couple very bad and disrespectful employees that's including the managers"
good,Working at Wendy's is a great place to work if you're a people person the environment is laid back and the put guest first.
good,"The work was good, it was enjoyable. There were some minor issues, but it was tolerable. I enjoyed working with some co-workers, and some others were disrespectful."
good,"I had already provided a review for wendys. its okay, 30 minute lunches. Kind people and okay atmosphere, just wish the coworkers were nicer."
good,"When I started there the management was great, but eventually changed and was in a very long period of flux which made it hard to get any consistency. I was called on my days off regularly to come in and fill in for someone, to the point where I would stop answering my phone."
good,loved the job and crew mostly.  Tho the upper management needs to learn how to treat with fairness.          I loved my customers and their families.
good,i either close or open the store so there are many different responsibilities. i run shifts and make sure procedures are followed. the hardest part of the job for me are the funny hours. i like my co workers.
good,"Wendy's was a great first job. Management could use work though, they hired kids as a manger real work does not get done. when they would get pact we cant have our manger flipping out. Working there was fun until my mangers break down and cry."
good,"Interacting with customers is enjoyable.  The environment is hot, and management is strict.  The hardest part of the job is trying to close the dining area while still providing excellent customer service as a cashier.  Most enjoyable part of job is the team work of co-workers."
good,"Taking customer orders and preparing them in a timely fashion. I learned customer service skills, cash handling, food prepping and how to clean the correct way . Managers and co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was producing service in a 3 minute time frame. The Most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team."
good,"Working with fast food isn't very pleasant, but I learned quite a few skills. I've learned how to deal with customers and provide great customer service, which I believe benefits me greatly. A typical day at Wendy's consists of operating registers, taking orders through drive-thru, making sandwiches, operating the fry station, and operating the grill- depending on which position you were able to run most efficiently. Some of my co-workers are easy to work with as they are good at their job, while some are just lazy and make the other staff work twice as hard. The management is most of the time good. Some managers aren't as thorough with making sure everyone's doing what they're supposed to. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, but I'm pretty good with dealing with them and making sure their orders are correct and whatnot. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers who are usually friendly and know what they're doing."
good,Good Company! Fun to work with my colleagues and very supportive management. I wanna thank them to all experience has given to me.
good,A typical day begins with me arriving on time and going to make sure the restrooms are clean before I clock in once I am on the clock I began working immediately.
good,"I've had both great and not-so great experiences with the company. Good company to work for, the pay could be better. Management used to be terrible, but as the company has taken some changes, its  getting better."
good,I felt uncomfortable around my co-workers at this workplace. I did enjoy working at the place due to making food was quite entertaining.
good,"I did not work here long enough to full understand how the store ran. My co-workers were nice, and the managers ran shifts really well."
good,"The management was seemingly poor, the job itself was fine. The store was very fast paced through-out the day. The crew members seemed to get along most times."
good,"Wendy's is a good company to work for if you only want to make part time money. The way you get promoted is if you been there the longest. Also, they tend to hire just anyone to run management, which can be good or bad. However, in my situation is was horrible my manager did not have a clue how to make a simple cheeseburger."
good,I have gained a lot of patience's and my customer service skills have been better since I worked here. Taking peoples order and doing the best I can do to satisfy the customers. Multitasking played a huge role as well.
good,Hardworking team players. Fun & family oriented. Not a lot of hours. Loccated in erie pa from december 2014 to march 2015
good,On some days frustrating when a customer does not know what they want to order on others very pleasant. I learned more about fast food that I didn't know when I was a manager at 16 yrs old at Short Stop. I enjoy my co-workers and my boss and being able to laugh through out the day to make it go faster. The hardest part is getting through it.
good,"it is a good and safe work place,i have learned to work in a fast paced work place.The co-workers are really helpful."
good,"good experience working at wendy's, learned to manage time effectively and basic health and safety procedures. adapted to various shift hours and job requirements"
good,Wendy's was my first job. It was a fast paced work environment that allowed me to meet new people and put forth my best work ethic. Wendy's allowed me to meet customers and do my best to make sure they got what they needed and had the best experience available. Wendy's also allowed me to meet new co-workers and help train them and do my best to help them put their best work ethic forward.
good,Work flow is constant and there are repeat customers that you can count on to make your day better.  Fast paced environment with amazing coworkers.
good,this place is about service speed and quality. it is hard work to keep up with both and the customers come inside and sometimes seem preemptively charged to lash out at the poor underpaid restaurant worker. there are opportunities to move up in this company. You will run into many colorful new recruits that drop of the radar quickly as they came in. it is very tiring work as you have to move fast and please the customers.
good,Fun place to work with lots of things to do. Requires you to be quick to learn and quick on your feet. Working with the staff and managers was always fun
good,ran grill area in fast pace facility with an array of people doing their jobs to insure quality service from this place of buisness.
good,Very up-beat job can get very difficult at times with customers and getting their food done and served in a timely manner.
good,"While it was a good crew and I loved working with a lot of the people, I wasn't given one day off each week so that I can help out with watching my boyfriends kids, whom I have grown a connection with. I refuse to go back if they can't respect the fact that I've got two little girls depending on me to watch the once a week and I'm unable to do that because of the schedule."
good,Worked here my senior year in high school. Very flexible hours that worked around school and sports. Great that worked with as well.
good,"Average work experience, nothing out of the ordinary. Clean, and comfortable work environment all the time. Everyone helped each other when needed."

good,"very nice and helpful co workers, customers were very enjoyable. very fast paced type of job, very busy. Good management and very helpful."
good,Great work environment with friendly coworkers. Busy work pace with decent hours. Management was negotiable about hours and days off.
good,Fun working place with supportive management also love keeping the store clean for customers and good customers skills keep them coming back
good,"Too overwhelming and busy for my taste, they need to give more training and have more patients with new staff that are still learning the ropes"
good,"Working at Wendys was a good experience. Although, the management wasn't so great, and it made me not want to work there anymore. The workers barely even wanted to work."
good,"Its a fun workplace but at times employees can be immature at times. Don't get paid that much, a basic minimum-wage.(7.25)"
good,"Most the management have bad attitudes towards employees, they're always rude, and they're never on the same page with each other. "
good,"I enjoy myself working for wendys until another coworker criticize my act of work, I enjoy working with different people from different country, but my coworker were racist and I don't accommodate with that sort of people."
good,"i was a crew member for wendy's. i prepared food, cleaned, lifted, heavy boxes, Customer Service,cashier, Ect. I have learned to interact with people on a professional level."
good,a typical day here was just running the drive thru taking and making orders. worst part of the day was clocking out. best part was the easy  flow of joy throughout the store.
good,Wendys is a great place to work. i got along with most co-workers. i was a cashier that worked nights. it was very productive.
good,"Fast paced."
good,"It was a good experience, showed me how fast food places work. I cleaned tables, trays, the bathroom, took out trash. I liked the people who work there they got their jobs done and didn't complain about who was doing what and its well organized."
good,I work as a regular closing and i am very happy to see that there is always a team work with my co-workers we even help each other if someone behind and we find out our work was very easy if there's a team work.
good,"It was fun and the coworkers they were all friendly. The hardest part were dealing with disrespectful customers, but I got used to it and I was able to work at my own pace sometimes."
good,"In need of serious check up on employees and whether or not they can do the job the are hired to do. I believe when you go to work, you clock in and work leave everything out at the door"
good,"I was a crew member at wendys. I would make food, take orders, do cashier, clean from time to time, and work the drive thru. I enjoyed working there for the time being."
good,"Typical Day: Busy at start. I've Learned: I already know everything. Management: Out of 4 Managers, I only get along with 2. Co-Workers: I'm cool with 75% of my Co-Workers. Hardest Part Of Job: Different personalities of what Certain Managers want done. Enjoyable Part Or Job: When they let me do what I already know to do without Managers fussing. The day is easier for everybody, because I get my job done & I'm able to help my Co-Workers with their jobs."
good,"It's a great place to work if you're in high school or college. Not the best if you're looking for a career. It's a friendly place, and most days are laid back. They don't give a lot of hours to crew member, but it's prefect for a part time job."
good,ok job ok staff not the best pay the end of the night cleaning up i dislike i hate the rude costumes . i wouldnt be look for a next job like it
good,I love eating Wendy's so much I had to work there and I did.....I worked a 3 different Wendy's francizes within the past 5 years.... the main one I loved working at is Erie Blvd. in 2009 I became shift leader and worked very hard because I loved the people and my co-wokers.
good,This was a part time job that I had and I really didn't care much for the management then to have me clean tables and keep up onthe salad bar they had way back.
good,"the company was okay. nothing major. great staff , great management. the hours were okay . the customers loved the food and the environment was nice."
good,"fast food job, fast paced so it keeps you busy and its easy to grasp tasks. very fun loving yet well maintained place of work."
good,It was a job at the moment and i needed more pay. Crew was really nice and so were the managers. Good job to start out with and you get to know the customers very well the ones that come in more often than others.
good,"wendys was a place to work. But as time went by, i felt that i can no longer maintain a positive work relationship .I was not being properly compensated for task at hand , thus causing me to seek further employment else where."
good,"good job, one of the better fast food places to work, some room for advancement, fair pay good benefits, family like evironment."
good,This was my first management position ever it was tough but I learned great training techniques. I also loved that it was a fast paced environment.
good,we were very productive & fast pace. this was a new location just opened & trying to get off the ground. somtimes the management would be a little to stern & not understanding. This job was all about fast pace production not enjoyable.
good,management needs work but they do their best to help you out when they can and let you know when you are doing something wrong.
good,"Working for this company requires one to be quick on their feet.  Friendly attitude is a must. It can be stressful at times, but that's with any job."
good,"I didn't mind working there, there was to much gossip and child's play and not enough working going on at times. As a Supervisor I would have to tell workers to go back to there stations and stop screwing around or sitting when they weren't suppose to be. Some managers/supervisors didn't take there job seriously."
good,"The management was very unorganized. Co-workers got away with alot of no-nos. I have 3 friends I worked with which was enjoyable. I loved working nights there. I hated being on dishes though. I left because one manager treated everyone poorly and just had an attitude with everyone. But other than that, I enjoyed working there."
good,Developed teamwork skills and customer service knowledge. Worked with various personalities and developed independent working skills.
good,"-Typical Day at work"
good,"Was a great place to work at first but as time went on, changes were made that made it so it wasn't as great anymore.  Used to be a family friendly place but as time went on, felt like management wasn't happy if family issues popped up, however rare that was."
good,"Everyday I make drive thru and front line sandwiches, help with keeping bottles filled and prep restocked, sometimes I clean the frosty machines."
good,"Wendy's is a fast food restraint. What they taught I learned to do. Cashier, drive threw order taker, sandwich maker, fry person. I worked there over two years ago."
good,"Coming to work clocking in, looking at the chart to see what station I was working at. It was normally at the sandwich making. I've learned to always keep your station stock so the night crew can get ready for there shift and get right in to work. Management wanted a lot of work from us they wanted us to make every sparkle, even stations we didn't even work at, like for instants the dining room being clean chairs being scrubbed and wiped out mind you, I'm a sandwich maker. I say this because they never gave you a raise. My co-workers were great, you had the lazy ones but that's normal. The most enjoyable part was everybody getting along, getting the job done."
good,When we first arrive at work we clock in and wash our hands and make sure where we are assigned to work is clean and we make sure we have everything we need and we communicate with each others while working and work in a team and show respect towards each others and the customers and we stay positive and smile and work hard and make sure we work together.
good,collecting cash keeping my dinning room clean I've learn how to deal with many different customers stock and make sure I have the products needed for the front line
good,Wendy's now is ghetto and not fast enough and don't care about their customers I Didn't like the facts that they hire friends and family that don't want to work and just want a paycheck
good,Tell us about a typical day at work what you learned management your coworker and the hardest part if the job and the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I worked here for quite some time. It was a great fun work environment, I made some long term friendship. Trained well, if I still was unaware of how to do a task I could ask anyone for help. A lot of team work since it was a fast paced environment."
good,"Wendy's was my first job when I turned sixteen years old, I worked for the company for five years. I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting the customers."

good,"Its a great place when you first start. But the management there is not that great and they dont run it like it should."
good,Wendy's is a very youthful place to work. Mostly highschool students. It was a very layed back job at some times and hard job at other times.  I hated how they made you pay for all your clothes and shoes at the beginning.
good,"a typical day at work would be clocking in and getting started on what needs to be done."
good,"take orders hand food out "
good,I didnt really enjoy this job I quit as soon as I found another job. Hardest part would be dealing with very angry customers. Typical work day I was always busy barely getting any breaks.

good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, checking all the daily and weekly task and organizing the utensils and equipment's priorities.I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized."
good,"This job is very easy. If you want some extra money, this is the job for you. "
good,"Drive Thru was fun . I learned a lot about dealing with customers at fast pace. Getting orders ready ,drinks ,food and doing everything with a smile. My team was pretty cool , supervisor was nice . Everyone worked together as a TEAM. The hardest times at the job was rush lunch and dinner. The most enjoyable times was the people that smiles on their faces just saying hello."
good,This job is a fast paced that can be stressful at times. Attention to detail is necessary in order to ensure the customer receives their order with excellent speed and quality.
good,"a typical day could be slow or busy always unexpected, management is very good, always orderly. co-workers are different but everyone gets the job done. the hardest part is not knowing what type of day your customers is having the most enjoyable part is being comfortable and being able to assist the community"
good,"Very fun and fast paced job, loved working with others such as management and co-workers, always had a good time at work never bored or frustrated with job."
good,"Fun, busy workplace, where you can learn a lot. Everyday was a learning experience. Co-workers, and management were very helpful. Rewards were given for good work."
good,I did not really like working here because I closed most nights out of the week and I was looking for other employment and when I did I qui.

good,IT is great to work at wendys meet new people and work side by side with great people.The great part about this job is working together with great people.
good,Had a good staff very easy going. very long and occasionally a little crazy but overall a good place to work. It is a great first job.
good,it was shut down and i never had a chance to really have the chance to get to know every body. but the manager that was there was very inspiring to us and gave very good advice
good,Not the greatest working environment. Usually customers resulted from being absolutely rude or unappreciated of their servers
good,"The job itself was not very enjoyable, but it did teach a lot. I mainly worked at dinner shifts so had to quickly pick up the skills of keeping calm and focusing. After the dinner rush was over, I learned to point my attention on the tasks that were neglected during the rush. Tasks such as cleaning stations and making sure every thing was running smoothly. Overall, I actually really appreciated the work."
good,The hardest part about the job is being really busy when there is not a good number of crew members there. Managers would often just sit in the office
good,I have worked for Wendy's since I was in High School. Great place to work! I work with a restaurant filled with great co-workers and managers that constantly work together to make the public happy. This job consist of lots of multitasking and team work. Everyone knows the public can be harsh and very hard to work with. But getting away from it is impossible so you have to make the best of it. Wendy's has worked great with my schedule while going to school and I have made life long friends with my fellow employees. Just looking for a more consistent and advanced career.
good,"got along with everyone. Including managers and staff, Clean place to work. always willing to teach you something or a way around a problem."
good,This a good job for those who want to gain some work experience. This teaches you how to deal with different people from all walks of life. Not for people who have bad attitudes!!
good,"Management is not good, otherwise good place to work and nice co-workers. sometimes every body is annoyed because of the in appropriate time schedule but with me its not the case I am happy with the workplace."
good,"It was always fun to work with older people that can teach you new things how to do a better job at your job."
good,"Responsibilities were as a cashier, but not limited to taking food orders directly from customers in the front lobby. Inputting orders while attending the drive- thru customers.

good,"The hardest part about this job was how busy we got. I learned how to make sandwiches and do everything the Wendy's way. A typical day at work was how busy we got. The co workers was nice, but some would get mad because we were so busy. Also some of them wouldn't work as a team. The management was good except if you asked for more hours then they would not give them to you."
good,"fast paced restaurant life, really have to be into it to be able to get used to it. management was alright , co-workers were great young kids. hardest part was 5 o'clock rush"
good,"To work at Wendy's in big rapids is a challenge. A typical day at work is to come threw the door drop you stuff off in designated area wash your hand and get online to your position. I normally an coordinating since I'm the shift manager but if I don't have to labor for one of my employees ill coordinate and run that position. So I would make sure product is hot and fresh to be served to our customers as well as take care of customer satisfaction. I have learned a lot being a employee at Wendy's I have learned how to manage product drops, labor control, sales, cash, inventory. and customer satisfaction. My co-workers are excellent to work with they keep me informed with how much product they have online so I know what I would need to have when the times come. The hardest part is labor control, because if you don't have the labor to keep someone you have to send them home and close out there position and do all of your work on top of there work, but I am able to do it in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is my employees they are a joy to work with and will help me out if I need them too with no hassle."
good,A typical day at work was interesting. I learned to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving the people.
good,"It was a good experience, Management was rather poor which made day to day functionality difficult.  I learned how to handle fast paced situations and how to make sure new team members knew what they had to do."
good,The fast pace of this job was a plus but working with negative and unmotivated people made this job suck. The boss could have been nicer to. If you can work regardless of employees attitude this is the place for you.
good,"I've been worked for 1 year and four months now . Within that period of time , I've learn how to communicate properly . I've met many kinds of customers.The most enjoyable part of the job is my colleague practically became my second family which make my working environment much fun .

good,working for wendys gave me the requirements I needed to work in the customer service department. I got to learn to value the clients and their business with the company.
good,A typical day at wendy's would be a busy non stop moving day lunch rush hours usually last about 3 hours starting at 12 pm. Working at wendys for 3 1/2 years i learned so much like patients and how to speak to others also the management wasnt bad they were very understanding and flexible with hours and pay. My old coworkers were nice it was a friendly team work environment the hardest part was dealing with rude customers but for the company name and brand at all times i handled every situation professionally .
good,The people who knew I worked really hard wanted me to be able to get my break in and worked with me when I needed to have time off
good,I learned customer service skills and cashier skills. I worked overnight food preparation and cleaning equipment used for cooking.
good,Typical day at work included collecting customers payment for their food and moving the cars quick through the drive thru. The hardest part of my job was when the system would crash or if the customer's order was entered wrong in the system. The most enjoyable part of y day was talking to customers as they waited to move forward to get their order and making them smile.

Ensured that each customer received outstanding service by providing a welcoming environment, which included greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintain exceptional standards, solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service"

good,"My co-workers were very helpful when there were situations that needed to be handled, but the mangers where pretty rude to the workers. They were good with the customers, but mean to workers. there was nothing really hard about this job t all."
good,You do all the work of the GM but get 1/3 off the pay. No time off and everything is your fault. You will work more than scheduled
good,Job was okey. Co workers friendly. The Managers are pretty nice. Everyone seems to be on the same page. Taking care of the customers and reaching sale goals.
good,"Just like any other job in fast food, hard work for not much pay. the employees there are cool though. Overall its not a bad place to work."
good,"Prepare the day with setting up my station with eating utensils, condiments, ice, cups, and other items that customers will need. Taking orders from customers. Collect cash, credit card, and debit card transactions for customer’s purchases."
good,The staff where friendly but later shifts would be under staff making work hard and unpleasant. I enjoyed my coworkers over all.
good,fast friendly service messed up food a lot not very sanitary dirty parking lots open dumpsters they dont wash hands would not go their
good,I was a proud teenager working hard through school trying to work hard to help my mom as much as I can. To help out around the house.
good,I enjoyed serving customers and working with my co-workers. However the job was okay for a teen at the time. A typical day would be very busy all day for the most part. Some management was okay.
good,"Not enough hours, underpaid, poor management and training. Mostly you learn as you go. Management is slow to advance. it was a okay place to work as a college student. from being a cashier was ok"
good,"was a productive place to work in. i learned how to work the register, i was cool with all staff members, learning the whole job itself was challenging but i got the hang of it and break time was the best part."
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work for. When I first started the manager that was there was the reason for it being a good place. He was a relaxed person and even when in a bad mood he didn't really seem like it. It was of course hard work and the most time it was, was lunch rush when I would have to take orders and get them out by myself when the other cashier would have all the help. Most of the people were friendly. The best thing about working there was the fact that most of the people were friendly and it made it an okay environment. And dealing with positive customers through the day help keep the negative things not that bad."
good,Usually you get upset customers because another employee didn't take their job serious. Managers were nice. Hardest part of the job was getting paid so little. The most enjoyable part was getting my 50% discount and free drinks.
good,"Typical top-level QSR employment....goals are no above the norm, but sometimes at the top end of realistic expectations."
good,"I like the employee discount. The hours aren't flexible enough. There's no raises or employee of the month. It could be better, but it's a job and it pays the bills."
good,"Wendy's was my first job that I started just after I turned 16. It was a good learning experience since it was the first job I ever had. I still remember the things I did at the store I worked at and how I enjoyed working there. "
good,muy buena por cierto es muy amigable trabajar en wendys no es tan lujoso
good,I noticed that the fast food industry is normally thought of as a place where a younger environment normally dominates. At this Wendy's there is a variety of employees. I have seen young to old as well as multi-cultured in this establishment. They truly demonstrate the phrase toward acceptance to everyone.
good,Did my job and went home. I was an opener and did prep work as well. It was an ok place to work. I don't really have anything else to say.
good,"The job was fun and energetic, however, the managers were not very friendly. A typical day consists of selling food products on the menu to customers. It also involved maintaining the cleanliness of the restaurant and stocking the restaurant products as  needed."
good,"fast paced quality food chain. provide supreme customer service with quality food at a fast pace.worked with friendly,helpful hard working crew members"
good,"The management team here is great. If you like a face paced environment where there is always something to do then this may be the job for you. There are a variety of positions available but most of them do require you to be able to multitask effectively."
good,"Typical Workdays:  Typical workdays were 5 hours a day (25-40 hrs per week).  "
good,"For someone starting out in the work force, this a great way to earn money for things like video games, paying for a phone bill or getting money for concert."
good,a typical day was overseeing staff and making sure they were on track with what they needed to accomplish. hardest part of the job was when a big rush came in and I didn't have the proper staff on shift. my coworkers were friendly and got along well.
good,Job was very stressful and customers were not patient. Job required a lot of cleaning and managers were sometime rude. Managers did not explain what you need to do clearly enough.
good,a typical day at wendy' s is insuring great customer satisfaction and service. makes clothes smell bad. good hours. occasional pay raises. great staff. nasty food and the way they make it.
good,In Wendy's a typical day at work is hectic. It's always busy and fast paced. I have learned how to communicate clearly and positively with coworkers and management. I have also built loyal clientele through friendly interactions and consistent appreciation. The most enjoyable part of the job are the interactions with the customers and being able to make their day.
good,the manager treated us like  if we weren't good enough. the new crew that went in with me all quit the job cause of the lack of friendliness that the boss had to us.
good,Good starting job while in highschool. Customer service is a must in the company. Management was overall good. Co-workers had some issues but most were okay. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. Enjoyable part was moving up in the company.
good,Every day I would get to work take out trash set up the workspace and start to clean the restaurant. Then I would go to the grill and start to make to burgers and food needed. I learned time management along with how to work with customers. The hardest part of the job was getting my school schedule to fit in around my work schedule.
good,"very fast environment, no benefits, bad management, standard chance to grow inside the company, poor hours and poor salary as well."
good,"I never knew what to expect walking into work. I have countless stories about the different situations I was put in. Although the job was stressful, I learned more than I have anywhere else."
good,It was a great experience but if you don't plan to move up within the company you shouldn't stay as a Crew Member. The co-workers and management is great and you could learn a lot if you pay attention.
good,"i learned how to properly communicate with other people."
good,Was my very 1st job. Advancement was quick. Staffing is the biggest challenge. The Area and District Managers were good.
good,Some of the managers treated the crew as if they were children and without respect for them. I also believed that the crew members could be compensate a little better.
good,"Wendy's was my first job, working at fast food taught me good customer service and taught me how to stand on my own feet. I learned how to prepare sandwiches, made salads. I was a cashier, and kept my work environment clean."
good,"trabajar en esta compañía fue algo grato ya que el ambiente que se manejaba no era el mejor para poder laborar no habían condiciones de acenso o motivación personal para seguir pero de todo de aprende queda como una experiencia laboral donde aprendí manejo de proveedores distribución, transporte etc... "
good,Opening a Wendy's is very easy. start day off with food preparation. as a manager i check sales and other numbers from day before and then i start my cash sheet for current day. the rest of my day consist of making sure me and my staff provide the best customer service.
good,"Wendy's is not a place for growth. "
good,"A typical work day was long, I learned how to train other workers. I was management for a very long time. My co-workers were ok, the hardest part of the job was realizing that everyone was not proficient in their job, and the most enjoyable part of the job was achieving customer satisfaction."
good,not a bad starter job but really not a job for everyone good for someone just starting out in the workforce but with someone that has kids and a family its sort of hard to make ends meet and still have any money for other things
good,"-A typical day at work involved being on the cash register everyday, talking to customers and getting everything they needed. "
good,I loved the face paced environment and learning how to do the necessary things to run a fast food restaurant. I learning customer service skills and a lot on how to deal with money.
good,"Staff consists mostly of high school students. fast paced work environment. Scheduling likely to change, hours are not steady."
good,"I would often open and close the store, I made sure to prep the food for the morning and clean and lock up properly at night. I learned to be responsible for the store's appearance, it's very important to keep a clean eating environment. Management was professional and helped if we needed it. My co workers were nice and worked as a team. I would have preferred more hours then I was receiving but I still enjoyed working with people in a fast paced environment."
good,"While working for this company I was able to be apart of a great crew cooking affordable, quality food in a fast-paced work environment. Although I was only making minimum wage I was able to live life to the fullest possible!"
good,"Typical morning, prepare chilli, setting up the kitchen, cleaning, filtering, and sanitizing everything. Stock food and utensils needed. making sure from my start time and four hours after everything is ready to make food or have enough food prepared for customers."
good,This job is really best for teens looking for something to do after school. Not a career.
good,I worked one day a week for three hours a night. I punched in and would take orders make sure all the condiments were stocked for those on the next day. I learned customer service working with co-workers and the customers on the days I worked. The management was interesting as well as the co-workers definitely a new experience. The hardest part of my day was when the dinner rush came in and having to take huge orders. Enjoyable part of my job was going home in all honesty.
good,"Just like any other fast food place you work hard for minimum wage, everyone wants to advance."
good,"handling money, taking customers orders, preparing food, answering customer’s questions regarding food and providing the best service possible."
good,Basically cleaned the whole store from stocking to mobbing. Organized it for the morning crew for the next day. Picking up heavy boxes to organize and stocks shelves
good,Great team to work with but not enough hours to make ends meet. I didn't work here for very long as I was young and needed to focus on school. Also it was a very long time ago. Also this needing to review thing is really annoying.
good,"I had a great time working there, but my co-workers didn't always work as hard as I did. Plus, there was a lot of stealing going on within the company that I didn't approve of."
good,Part-time job seekers or high-school students like any other fast food retail stores.
good,great people place just did not pay a lot of money.. not hard work also gives you chance to advance. good management team great location work with you on time ect..
good,franchise was great but certain members of management and upper management had lot to be desired.
good,you do not get paid enough for the amount of work that you are obligated to do every night and you will be replaced quick
good,"Wendy's fast food restaurant is looking for a Shift Supervisor to join its fast-paced, energetic team!"
good,time goes by real quick.... it's fast food so it's fast time!!!
good,I took costumers orders and cleaned the lobby and washed dishes and had some really cool co-workers
good,"Wendy's is a great place to eat at they can usually provide fresh food for every order when its ordered and can be friendly to customers."
good,"Worked cashier, floor, cooking, and handing out food as well as prep."
good,very busy work day from the time I walk in to the time I leave. My co workers were awesome and the most enjoyable part of my day was definitely the customers and I would have to say that I did not like being a manager all that well in fast food
good,Recieve and document incommiing suupplis and make available to crew.  Implement equipment maintenance procedures as schuduled.
good,I am looking for a FULL Time job with some benefits..and where my co-workers appreciate me for doing a good job..and I help out where I can and needed.
good,Just a job i had while in high school. Managers were nice. Just worked me to death.
good,Never had many employees so you were working a lot. Had a 7.99 package everyone wanted to purchase but expected you to sell their more expensive packages.Maybe that's why they went out of business.
good,"my experience at wendys overall was great, just a few things that i thought did not seem right. The general manager was always rude to the works, yelling for absolutly no reason, not listening to their reasons, just started to blame them even though it wasn't their fault."
good,"• Ensure appropriate food preparation activities"
good,From this job opportunity I gained more experience in customer service. I learned the pros and cons of being a register operator. I would say Im more alert about money managing.
good,After Cotti Foods took over Wendy's in southern california it has been nothing but a giant headache that I was glad to get out of finally.
good,"Wendy's is a very average job. While I'm personally not satisfied with it these days it's not the worst deal. If you just do as you're told and do it well then you will receive hours and pay. "
good,"Job requires speed. If you are not fast and don;t enjoy people yelling at you, this is a wrong place to wrok at"
good,High pace working environment. The food is very good. Teamwork is important in the fast food industry. I liked working at Wendy's Restaurant.
good,"I would assist my co-workers with prep cooking, deep frying, and cleaning the tables. Every one on the team crew would work together to assist each other with various chores and duties."
good,A typical day at work was ideal. I was always aware of the goals and tasks at hand. I worked with a great crew hardworking crew. fast paced job. I learned about food preparation and safety. Before my untimely and very unfortunate departure from the company I was in training to be apart of the management crew with a chance to receive retirement benefits and healthcare.
good,it was an ok company. i loved working there and i had fun. we got the job done.
good,"working in a fast food service company needs you to be working with agility and quick reflexes and response and most of all must have a teamwork. that's what i learned and value the most in the job that i had. Sure you can do work on your own but you can be more productive and be at your best if you have teamwork, for in a fast food, everybody has a role to play and each one must perform their duties to make the job done with fast, accurate and quality service."
good,"Managed store and balanced cash register"
good,"The co-workers are amazing and exciting to be around. The shift managers are perfect examples of someone to look up as far as coming up in the business. The hardest part about the job is our rush hour times when we're low staff. But, being the hard working team members that we are are...we manage to pull though any tough situations."
good,great first job. no room for growth. a job for high school students.
good,"nice place to work,great people,good managers, it was fast paced but as a high school student it was a great place to work"
good,"It can be really busy a lot of times, but the min. wage gets old and you have to move on. Also there's times where I felt under paid for the things I did."
good,"It was a good job but no benefits or full time positions,management was okay but not the best"
good,"Today we had a got a new manager that was the opposite of what i thought of them. I just new that a new manager meant new rules. I clicked with her soon as she started. We got treated all like  the adults we were, we all worked together to beat the rush, and we got things do together working together which build communication ethics that were never really did well there before."
good,This was a great management experience if you don't mind working with alot of young adults. It kept me in great shape.

good,"Food prep, cash register, temps, front counter and training new hires. I learned all sorts of different personalities. The co- workers were alright. I was promised 40 hours a week and was only getting 15. My favorite part of this job was waiting on the elderly folks that came in. so pleasant and always a pleasure to put a smile on their face."
good,good place to get experience handling money and learning toninteract with different types of people
good,Great place to work if you are a people person.Very fast pace but time flies because of the different people you meet.
good,I have a job environment where most co-workers believe in teamwork and the management team is very understanding.
good,"fun and energetic place to work"
good,Managed a shift cooking cleaning. Worked thru high school at this job and couple years after. The manger was fun but also hard core when had to be. Co-workers was great few came and gone.
good,"Cook, Cashier, Grill, Food preparations."
good,The hardest part of this job is the different work hours required
good,would clean and serve customers. I learn teamwork skills and how to work at a fast pace. management was kinda and hard working and reasonable. coworkers were nice. hardest part was keeping service time. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"At wendys I had a great crew and team of managers. a typical day starting at 7 a.m. opening the store with Counting the safe and putting out drawers. Counting inventory and securing product that we are low on before 10 a.m. Making sure all equipment worked correctly, handle any and all customer complaints with satsfactory results. positioning crew for the day and taking care of customers."
good,i loved working there i got to meet other pepole and learn new things.
good,The company home office has a good culture but it does not trickle down to the field.ther is too much politics and not enough guidance and direction
good,"This was my first job, so what I learned from working here was that the customer is always right and how to handle a difficult customer when something wrong has occurred. Every day that I had worked here, my co-workers taught me you have to be motivated and focused on what you're doing in this face paced environment."
good,I manager a group of five people I help keeping up with cashier
good,"A typical day at Chuck E Cheese, very noisy and fun at times. If you are someone who loves kids, then you definetly enjoy working at Chuck E Cheese."

good,I learned my first supervisory and managerial responsiblity
good,good part time work while in school. learnt a lot about the food industry.
good,"Overall I was a Crew member."
good,There was to much drama here and the supervisors played the favorites game.
good,"upon arriving at Wendys I immediately go to the grill and prepare burger , chicken and/or fries."
good,"Stressing but coworkers help the day go by.."
good,"This is a good first job for a teenager. I learned how to work while constantly on my feet, good teamwork skills, and customer service. A typical day for me included either food prep, organizing, or taking customers' orders. When I had no customers, I cleaned and sanitized my work area. My co-workers were friendly, like-minded people, and it was easy to work well with them. Some of my managers were more friendly and organized than others. I would say the hardest part was dealing with lunch and dinner rush. I had to rush around trying to cook multiple foods at once to make sure we had enough for all the customers. The most enjoyable part, however, was working with my co-workers. When they're nice and friendly, it makes getting through the day much easier."
good,"Working at Wendy's was a great experience for me. I met and worked with amazing people. Lunch and dinner was very fast paced. I learned multi-tasking, professional behavior, and managerial traits."
good,I hated working there I was always being talked about in Spanish them not know I spoke Spanish.. managers were rude to customers and made me feel bad..
good,"While joining Wendy's Team of coworkers.  I came to work prepared to cook during rush hour.  This was the hour/hours when customers attendance were heavy to purchase lunch, dine-in as well as drive through.  I learned how to understand needs for our customers to get what meal each customer ordered on time.  I managed my time wisely and became stable with my job as a cook by building rapport with both my coworkers, as well as my customers.  I don't feel its hard to keep a clean environment, and take care of my area to the best of my ability. I most enjoyed the smiling faces when meals are prepared on time, and fresh.  I enjoy positive attitude regardless of my position. Thank you!"
good,Job was not bad but needed a better environment to work in. I was there for almost a year and the staff was great but the job became too daunting.
good,Managers were fair and the only good part of the work. The work was boring and work environment was aweful
good,"Exactly what you expect from fast food. Part time hours were flexible enough and the labour wasn't difficult. My only complaint was that management was often contradictory and none of them liked each other. After a year, my attitude had changed from bright and cheerful to melancholy and drudging, so I decided that it would be in the best interest of both parties if I left."
good,I honestly did not have a good experience working for wendy's. I feel as if a new employee should be given time to adjust to the speed at any new job and I was not. My manager was very hard to work with and very negative.
good,"The staff at Wendy,s were very friendly and were real teamworkers."
good,"Wendy's is a national fast food restaurant chain. I am currently a crew member, and a typical shift for me includes taking customers orders at either front counter or drive thru. As well, I also run the food prep station, deliver customers orders in the lobby and at drive thru window. The best part of my job is the opportunity to meet and interact with customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is communicating with my co-workers due to the fact that they are high school students and have not developed a strong work ethic and they currently view their job as just another place to socialize and goof off."
good,I learned how to read money working as cashier. I also learned how to be a Team member just to get a job done. I made some life long friends while I was working for this company.
good,"I am a Fry/Chicken Nugget Station worker and have been there for nearly six months. At the beginning of my shift I stock my area, and stock when necessary and at the end of my shift. It is my job to ensure that the fries and chicken nuggets are hot and cooked thoroughly for consumption. I have decent knowledge on other stations such as; Grill station, Pull-Up Window Cashier, & Front End Cashier. The managers are for the most part friendly and will quickly assist in learning new stations or skills if needed. Lunch Shift co-workers are friendly and will help with your station and teaching you new skills when available. Dinner/Closing Shift co-workers are typically on the younger end of the workforce and as such can leave you with mixed feelings about them. Hardest part about the job is the uncertain hours. Even if the schedule says one thing your work week can change on a dime. If they call you in to work on a day your not scheduled, expect to lose a day you were. If you are on Fry/Chicken Nugget station expect to be sent home early or lose days easier than the others. If someone works more hours than they were suppose to, I was punished by losing my hours normally. Best part of the job is most definitely the co-workers. They can make you feel important and are there for you when on shift."
good,Nobobody likes to work in fast food but wendys treats there employees better
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work for experience but personally I do not want to be working at a fast food restaurant, I would much rather work at a store or anything other then fast food"
good,it was okay very clean very wonderful I would do my job and go home
good,"long shifts. learned many new skills such as; grilling, sandwich making, and running a shift."
good,"Very busy around lunch time and dinner time. "
good,"I learned patients while working here."
good,its what you expect from fast food. its different day by day I have no further comment
good,"Here I was able to work with many different people.  While the actual job skills were not hard to learn, learning about customer service was something that was very value to me."
good,People did what they needed too. I learned how to deal with customers and co-workers.
good,"Mood was very light and enjoyable. Had good food and nice people, if you needed a day off you could request it and get it."
good,Didn't care to much for the close then open shift. Was enjoyable.
good,"Management does not receive breaks."
good,Great way to become familiar and comfortable with customers and food service.
good,I was still in school when i started working for wendy's so some cash in my pocket was great to me. They properly trained to me to make sure i did my job well and i did. i was cross trained on everything so i was very helpful when someone didnt show
good,I worked at Wendys for a total of 4 years. Great job security but many of my co-workers were only there for a paycheck and didnt care about getting the job done.
good,"Work at Wendy's requires a lot of hard work and being quick on your feet. You don't need to be a brainy kind to work here but bring your common sense and a serious work ethic. As typical with food service, the hours can be long or short, depending on the seasonal demands but it is a solid job. Hardest part of the job is some manual labor in food prep and the maintenance aspect of being a crew member. Most enjoyable is where the customers give you kudos for being friendly and /or efficient in customer service."
good,"There was only manager here that I didn't enjoy working with here and that was because he was lazy.  I left, however, to work for Wendtroy because one of the other managers that I was working with was stealing cash from deposits but it couldn't be proven.  I didn't want to be put into a position of that happening to me."
good,"Having to learn different areas of fast food, like working with different cultures"
good,I enjoyed working there part time. Cashier was a simple and non difficult job to do.
good,"Good place to work as a first job or if you're young. It is one of the nicer, cleaner fast food chains. The work is not challenging at all, easy-going environment."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, routine, and exciting. I learned how to perform multiple tasks at one time. My coworkers and I worked as a team to give the customers an excellent experience. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoying part was to receive compliments from the customers."

good,Wendy's is a fun place to work at.  I learned a lot working for them.  Hardest part of this job was nothing was in concrete.  You would be told one thing one day and another the next.  The people I worked with and for are by far the best part of this work experience.
good,"I am usually put on the one of two registers alone. I must man the register while also cleaning everything, gathering trays, serving customers. I also have to leave my position frequently to do these cleaning assignments which leaves the register unattended when customers come in."

good,cool place to work u learn a lot fast paced management was ok crew was ok u learn a lot about food hardest part of the day was handling disgruntled customers
good,"Like any other fastfood, you are worked to death for very little pay! You have to deal with customer attitudes and staff attitudes. But all in all it was a job and was better then working at other fast food companies"
good,"Everyday was a very productive day here at Wendy's. Working at the drive-thru is very fast paced. I learned to multi-task extremely well. From taking orders, making drinks, organizing, and handling money transactions all at once. Definitely learned that with determination and organization, multi-tasking can be done effective. Due to the environment being very fast paced and productive, I learned to work in a stressed environment while keeping a positive and professional attitude."
good,"Fast food restaurant, easy work envoirement. Costumers service, cashing or ringing people."
good,everybody smiled . How to work drive-thru by myself .I Loved my manger he showed me so much. my co-workers was always there to help if needed. The hardest part was when the closed down.I enjoyed going to work everyday and seeing all my co-workers. and the customers that came in everyday

good,"* my job was close to home."
good,it was a good job just not enof pay for soo much work to do. the manager was great and co workers
good,"My day at work is the same every time I go in. I make sandwiches, help my team members and make sure the customer is getting quality service. I learned how to listen better and how to move faster. I love my managers they get us through the day. For the most part my co-workers are hard workers , we all put forward effort. The job is quite simple so there is no hard part really. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we get a rush because I love a fast challenge."
good,"Consistent work activities and work rushes."
good,the hardest part of the job is just accepting the fact that you do a lot of work for such little pay.
good,always something to be done from firing up the grill to prepping for the day. co workers made the day more fun. never a dull moment
good,"A typical day at Wendys consist of required front line work duties, preparing the dining room for customers, getting equipment ready for opening, counting cash drawers and opening the store for customers. I am learning about store procedures and food safety daily. Co-workers are friendly and effictive. The most enjoyable part of my day is preping the store. The most difficult part of my job is ensuring 100% accuracy on the cash register."
good,Wendy's was a great place that i worked at for 6 years since i was in high school . and i did not decide to quit until i finished college and its time to move on
good,"I clock in. work on front line. then id get thrown into an area I didn't know well, but I didn't complain I still did what I needed to get done. I learned how to work into a fast pace. and how to deal with people in frustration  situations. my managers didn't know how to train me, they wanted to do things for me which I do not like. I am a hands on learner. my co-workers I loved. I always seemed to get along with most of them. the hardest part of my job is having people judge me because I have worked in fast food, its hard, I am just another human being, just like everyone else I walk, sleep, breathe just like everyone else. the enjoyable part for me is when I can make the one persons day. I would like to make a difference in the world and if the means for me to take it one person at a time. at least I can say I am doing something."
good,"Wendy's is my first part-time job and I don't mind it at all. I've learned to multi-task and perform in a fast-paced environment and I've gained excellent customer service. My co-workers are nice and fun to work with and who know how to work as a team and management is not bad, but could be better. I enjoy employee discounts and dislike closing shifts."
good,"Make sure the people hired are reliable and don't call out all the time, leaving the store short. Also check up on your managers. I've worked with some of the most under qualified and lazy people ever, and their responsibilities fall onto the crew members."

good,"cook "
good,I learned every position there was to learn at Wendy's and I believe I was manager material especially from my previous experience as manager at Chubb's. Co-Workers for the most part were immature. The job was not hard for me. I enjoyed working with the evening shift manager.
good,"My first day at Wendys was a trainwreck. "
good,My work days were always fairly easy. I learned how to set up and break down for breakfast. The management was very precise with their product.  The co-workers were fun and friendly. The hardest part of the job was waking up  at 4 a.m. The enjoyable part would hve to be the people and payday.
good,"one week you may have 38 hours and the following 15. your schedule changes often. but you also learn customer service skills, money skills, and develop customer service trust"
good,didnt work there long but it was fun the people were friendly and didnt judge if you had a question
good,Working in a fast environment which you learn to be a team player. You have to learn how to handle other peoples attitudes and mood swings. The  hardest part is not letting a large crowd upset you or rude customers. I enjoy making all customers feel comfortable and  welcome to our store.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is pretty routine. Half of the day I would work one position, the other half I would work another. Management was great and well organized. The team of workers I worked with was great, everyone worked together. The job was easy, and very enjoyable. Its too bad they closed down or I would still be there."
good,"Good company, enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers with all their need."
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's can all depened on what time of day you're working. The rushes put on a lot of pressure sometimes and not a lot of people can handle that kind of pressure. I learned that one little mistake can make a huge difference... "
good,I started at this job as a teenager and quickly moved into management. The boss was very strict and harsh but i learned how to manage people from him. This job taught me what I was able to carry to my later jobs which helped me succeed in advancing to management in all.
good,Long hours. Low pay. Did learn a lot about food safety and cleanliness. Meet people from all walks of life.
good,I got along with everyone I worked with. I opened the store and got things ready for the day.
good,I learned a lot from working here. I trained crew members learn about customer service and much more.
good,As a team everyone listening to each other makes the day more productive. Communicating clearly with one another helps everyone do their job correctly.Making customers happy and knowing they left satisfied is very rewarding.
good,Typical fast food place. Nothing different than working at McDonald's or Burger King.
good,"Good place to learn to set up daily task lists, and communicate assignments and expectations for the day."
good,A typical day at work for me would be working whatever position for the day as well as helping everyone else with their duties.
good,It's fast food. Typical fast paced environment with no opportunity for advancement. Good quality food at a fast speed. Roll out the orders and keep the customer happy. I am very thankful that my location valued cleanliness over anything else.

good,The staff there were enjoyable to work with and over all made going into work less stressful!
good,I would clock in and get whichever station I would be working for the day sanitized and clean then I would start preparing the station with the items that it needed. The things I learned in this job was to make sure that everything is prepared and quickly execute the position you were located in without any mistakes. The management was friendly a good mentor cared about the workers and always wanted to let them know if they were doing a bad job or a good job. The co-workers were conversational and even though we worked at a fast pace everyone knew how to multi-task to keep the operation running as fast as possible. The hardest part of the job was when you had to drain the grease out of the deep fryer and filter it then clean the deep fryer pans at the bottom then refill the deep fryer. The mot enjoyable part of the job was making the sandwich because when I would make the sandwiches I would be timed to show if I was getting any faster at making them then I ended up being one of the best sandwich makers of the Wendy's branch.
good,"It was an Ok job, but I never really received the proper training I should've had."
good,wendys food is good. its all about team work. not everyone was a team player but I liked the staff
good,"bosses. great."
good,"A typical day at work for me was taking orders, handling cash, operating dishwasher, and maintaining the dining area. I learned how to give good customer and how to work a cash register. My coworkers were friendly, but focused on their job. The management team was nice and care-free to an extent. The hardest part of my job was handling the rude customers but the most enjoyable was being able to help others."
good,"It was a great experience."
good,"Motivational company, really fast pace plus great opportunities."
good,"Didn't care for the management there, could of been better."
good,it was very laid back making sure the store was clean and the customers happy
good,"We follow the leadership steps on our everyday shift and the most common thing to do at first is to do walkthrus..This means checking all the conditions of the restaurant from food items, to manpower, equipment. Food safety must also be observed at all times. Cash control must be taken care of.Huddle must be done before lunch peak starts to update the crew aprovide them the goal for that day. We are expected to deliver A level shift. Crews must checked on their productivity level and skills, they must be coached and provide feedback after each shift. The hardest part of this work is the shifting schedule.. Request schedules are not given sometimes, flexible schedule is not provided. Enjoyable part is the environment that has to be fun yet productive environment."
good,"Ok for a First time job, Good for high school or early 20 something to get experience. Fast Paced."
good,great place fun job great management had no coworkers I learned a lot
good,"My day at work at Wendy's as ran smoothly because I worked in drive-thru and I took orders and money, sometimes I worked in the grill area I also was a closer so had to to do the dishes as well. While I was there I learned different things like how to cook all the food in grill and prepare to food in a timely manner, also when closing how to do dishes in a short time but the correct way to get the clean and done faster. The management there was okay but had a great work relationship with my supervisor. My co-workers were good people too. The hardest part about my job was dealing with the angry customers when there food wasn't right and it seemed like every time a customer came in that was upset about their food I was called on by the co-workers instead of going start to the supervisor, I guess that was because I was good at dealing with people. I enjoyed my job because when I needed extra hours the managers always said yes to me."
good,Show me the ups and downs how to handle rush hour times this job was pretty fun.
good,I had a good experience working for Wendy's. I learned new skills and thought other co-workers new skills as well.

good,A very hard place to get along with anyone and no communication or anyone sure of what needed to be done
good,"Sandwich maker"
good,It is Wendy's People. they are like family when you are working with them.
good,"Different cities of course were different. North Pole Alaska was the best place to work. It was a friendly comfortable atmosphere. The superiors were always working with the crew to teach them new things and help them try to advance in the company. Porterville, California was the absolute worst place to work and eat. The superiors would talk down to you and not be willing to teach anything. They just throw you on a position and you deal with it."
good,"Duties included serving customers and meeting their needs, assisting in everyday cleaning tasks, preparing food, and contributing to the team while opening and closing the stores."
good,"dealing with customers face to face was a very good experience, i learned to cook food at a fast past , how to handle a register, my co workers were very fun to work with and i enjoyed working here ."
good,"I hated the customer's , most impolite , spoiled , trash mouthed violent, judgemental clientel and physically & emotionally demeaning I will never do it again. I don't act this way neither should others"
good,I would never have a set schedule because most of the crew members would flake out of doing there jobs. the management was strict put fair.
good,"Not much to say about a fast food restaurant except that they are pretty much all the same. You make great quality food, you give great costumer service and you keep the place clean."
good,"Very stressful days, but you learn some good basic skills. Management is fine until they get stressed. Co-workers are great. Hardest part is the rushes, enjoyable was having fun with co-workers."
good,"You work non stop, fast food is fun when you work with fun people, unlike this place my co-workers had other intention's of working there."
good,"As a cashier, I met a lot of interesting people. However, the job itself was usual fast food. My favorite part was meeting new people, and some of the relationships I built there with coworkers."
good,Many fast food employees do not get the credit they deserve. It can be challenging to constantly be moving the fastest you can while providing the best customer service you can. The biggest thing I learned from working for Wendy's was respect. Having respect for your customers as well as your coworkers. Maintaining a smile with disrespectful customers was the most challenging aspect of the job but working with the right crew could make any shift fun.
good,"A typical day at work would be me going in at 11:30 AM and leaving 5:00 PM. I went through both lunch and dinner rushes. All through the day I had to take orders, give people their change, coordinate the orders, stock condiment stand, stock underneath my register, clean tables and chairs, and clean trays."

good,clock in and wash my hands get right on the grill for 8 hours.. and closed the store most the time..
good,I used to start my work at 4 and work till 12.30 -1.00 at night. I learned how to prepare sandwiches accurately and proficiently My co workers were friendly and very supportive. The management was good. The hardest part of the job was to make the orders with alot of speed as it was very busy especially during lunch hours. The most enjoyable part was the discount on food and good friendships which I developed..
good,Wendys gives you a vantage point of healthy fast food. Perfect place to achieve management.
good,You are regard to do a lot of duties for small pay. You have to take verbal abuse from customers with a smile
good,"fast and nasty, learned what a job is, management sucked, coworker was okay,  hot, first job"
good,A typical day was doing what the Manager has told you to do but then the other manager telling you to do a whole other different thing on same subject but different way. So it was like which is the right way to do it?
good,"Did not stay here long. But I would prep food, keep the workplace clean, operate the register, and work the drive thru."
good,Opening the store and getting all the product reading for the opening.  Deligation work to the crew and checking up on there progess. Opening the store and taking and making the orders and serving the guest.
good,"I learned so much about the fast food industry, unitl Wendy's I had no idea how complex it could be. I appreciate the knowledge I've gained!"
good,"prep food as needed, keep store and appliances clean, help close store."
good,"either you cook, clean or customer service you learn all areas"
good,I believe Wendy's is a job for younger people. A job you can do while you're still in high school and after you graduate. It helps you build your customer service skills by meeting different people everyday. Its a fast paced restaurant.
good,too many hours as a manager for too little pay. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

good,Don't really remember that much bout that job but the people that ate there was some friendly ones.

good,"As a crew member, I was responsible for food prep and processing various forms of payment."

good,Very great learning experience with it being my first job. Pleasant people to be around
good,"what I like about wendys were the crew. they were young and had lots of energy to keep you going. if you wanted  a good laugh that's usually where I would laugh the most. I liked being in charge and being the leader. it felt like I had a lot of control in which I did. the hardest part of the job was when there were days that we weren't buisy and which made it such a long dragging day. when I worked there, I felt like everyone there was my family or my kids. I liked how everyone worked as a team and how  fast paced it was to work there."

good,working there my days was short not many hours not much money but i did like the co-workers tho and the management was almost always busy it was cool for what it is
good,"As an employee here, i learned a lot of life skills and work ethic. It prepared me for the corporate world but also taught me a lot about how team work makes a difference. It is a life changing experience and I truly appreciated the opportunity of working for the company and my store manager."
good,well working with wendys I learn how to use people skills I did not know I had also met new people got to know where they were from what were there plans in life the management was good the position I up took gm was a challeange but I coped with how to be gm I always went to work with a smile my co-workers were easy to work with best part about the job was making people happy hardest part about the job was being gm also when a order got messed up
good,"When I worked at Wendy's corporate office many years ago, it was a very conservative company both in its culture and HR practices."
good,"Good place work"
good,A typical day at work at Wendy's is usually a lot of fast paced and customer service work. We clean daily and keep up with health codes and standards. We may also be assigned to train new employees.

good,"I feel as if im over worked and under paid, so would recommend this as a starter job for teens who have minimal bills.The is very easy however the customers can be a pain sometimes. The pay is awful but that is expected in working at a fast food restaurant, especially when you working minimal hours."
good,"My workplace has decent crew members/coworkers but harsh managers, short work shifts, and is very fast paced. I don't get very many hours/ no raises. The hardest part of the job is the customer service and making sure all of the customers are satisfied while making sure to get their orders out in a reasonable amount of time."

Working the registers was nice because I got to meet new people, however there are always those select few people that are having a bad day and treat you like garbage.

good,Alright place to work at for a first job worst part was cleaning
good,"I would go into the store on the weekends and open it up and made sure everything was prepped and ready to go when we opened at 10:30.  Some of the skills and responsibilities it takes to be a manager after being an assistant manager for half a year.  Co-workers weren't bad, but some of them were just lazy.  Having the responsibility and all of the tasks to do to get ready to open the store.  Having the power to tell people what to do and to talk to customers."
good,"This was a part-time job while I was attending college. I worked along side teenagers and somewhat made it hard to stay motivated to work hard when other team members just didnt care. "

My management was very selfish and showed favoritism. My coworkers were nice, hardworking people. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the fast pace. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people daily."
good,I would come in and make sandwiches to order for the front line. then when we didn't have any customers I would clean the lobby and rest rooms.
good,It is fast food. Everyone gets paid the same amount. Crew members do not get paid enough to really truly care about their jobs.

good,I was crew at this job. I learnt a lot about this company even though I was only part time. I enjoyed this job. the people were nice and knows how to work together.
good,Co workers were kind. Hardest part is dealing with customers but it was a good experience
good,people hate each other and try to get others out of there. took a hire position to make something of myself just to end up having hire up favor a racist sexiest jerk who i left because he was belittling me and making a laughing joke of me.
good,Working at wendys tought me how to speak well to customers in person. I had a few different job titles working at wendys. It tought me how to multitask. I enjoyed working with the other employees the managment was very easy to get along with and made it very comfortable to work for it was very easy to get along with my managers and boss. The hardest thing about working at wendys was the money was not that great. But it was a very happy fun laid back inviorment to work in.
good,"Work was busy but co-workers weren't easy to work with. however, I still got the job done."
good,"Employees were extremely unwelcoming and childish, interfering with others job duties as well as slacking on their own responsibilitie. Accomplishing daily tasks became hard but getting to serve others with a smile knowing they would enjoy their day after being seen by me made it worth working for."
good,it was an okay job again it was just a cashier and pre-cook job so it wasn't the greatest job to have.
good,To get alot of money you have to work alot of hours. they may cut your day short at any time
good,"The day is busy so im always occupied i can move from position to the next, it is a good experience for me."
good,Wendy's is a god start off job to work at if your still in high school but just like every other fast food restaurant there comes a time were you just need to move onto better things but other than that you would have to be able to work a fast paced environment it may be hard at first but it gets easier pluss the skills you gain there can help latter on in other jobs if that  path is what you choose
good,I never really had a chance to work a typical day; my boss sent me home soon as I would come in saying they didn't need workers. My boss didn't even call before I came in. I learned I didn't want to work there. Management was not the best; although I did enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay there because the schedule was badly put together. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and free food.
good,"A typical day at work is taking orders and handing out orders, cleaning and stocking area, required paperwork, employee drops, and food prep. The management is set up in a system. I believe it is quite effective, but it does seem to lack unity and communication. The co-workers are all very helpful and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is remembering certain things I do not work with very often. The most enjoyable part of the job is the very nice customers I get to meet."
good,"Long hours, meet new people. Fast Paced, sometime overwork for the amount you get paid."
good,"Replacing orders    "
good,"Wendy's always have room for advancement, I have learned to manager a group of 20 team members. I love my co-workers, the hardest about the job is closing real late and less security."
good,Wendy's worked around my busy schedule and I enjoyed working with the customers. The job was not too hard but we were always really busy.
good,"Its fun but not enough money. good with schedules, they work around you."
good,"A typical day at work goes like this. We start at 8 am and prepare shop for the day until 10 30 am when it opens. After it's opened, we go into our routine. I learned how to think and do at the same time. Management is pretty good. Co-workers are supportive. The hardest part of the job is to be able to keep up with the volume. The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch."
good,"my very 1st job so it was new and exciting, kinda stressful as far as competing for steady hours, but since this was my 1st job I wasn't in any position to complain, I was just humble to have something positive and productive to do"
good,This was my first job and was a great teaching experance. they give you chances to move ahead and great people to work with. This job taught me a lot about work ethic.
good,The managers provided us with a good place to work in. The hardest part of the job is when we have a rush of customers at once.
good,if you want a fast paced environment to work in this is the best choice
good,I was a cashier. They worked well around my college schedule. Management was ok. Coworkers not very friendly but I don't let others influence my job performance. Hardest part was getting food out faster then I was taking orders. Most enjoyable was satisfying my customers and makeing them happy!
good,"I would make sandwitches, use a cash register,  and answer guest questions. The hardest part of this job is the hours. I would have to stay away form home until three o'clock in the morning. It was a conflict with school, because I wasn't getting enough sleep. The part that I enjoyed is the coworkers they made fast food fun."
good,"cleaning, satisifying the customer, making sure everything is in order. I learned that the management was a little poor, the co workers wasn't really social or happy. Hardest part of the day, was dealing with poor management. The most enjoyable time was making the customers happy."
good,it was cool working here everybody was real paitent with me. 
good,A typical day at work was fast paced depending on business. I've learned that if a customers order is wrong be very polite and apoligize and communicate effectively with management. 
good,"Very fast paced work enviornment all day every day. I learned how to multitask a lot better than what I thought I could do. Management was amazing and I loved working with the people who worked there at the time. The hardest part about the job was being able to take an order, ring it up, bag the food and make the drinks then get them out of the drive through in less than a minute. The best part about this job was working with great co-workers and interacting with customers face to face."
good,Set up daily food prep and customer service. I would also help with weekly inventory.
good,nice work environment to be in with friendly coworkers and friendly customers
good,"i always opened the store and got everything ready for the shift to start.i got everone into place and ready to start serving customers as they ordered there food.i learned alot of responibility and how to manage the crew i was working with.the manager relied on me to have everything running as smooth as possible.crew members did the best that they could and i knew how to put the guys where they did there best.the hardest part of the job was,well it wasnt that hard at all.the thing i enjoyed the most was seeing the customers happy at the service they received"
good,My experience at Wendy's was very good but in the I need a new challenge and need to grow on my own. Wendy's showed me many thing like how to work a cash register and mop also how to make sandwiches and work in a rush. I think what Wendy's taught me the most was that the world has many different people and how to deal with them in the best way possible. The best thing I got to do at Wendy's was make customers smile.
good,"The usual fast food stores activity and tasks, a lot of cleaning task, and very little break time and rest between each task "
good,"As my first job I was placed as a cook and got the fundamentals of work time commute , in relevance to school hours and motif behind the work ethic . Co workers and management were only contacted for scheduling a work pay questions."
good,"im a hard working person"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's for me includes taking orders from customers, taking their money, and providing them with their food. You can expect at least one rush during your work day and probably at some point in time a change of positions where I might move over to making sandwiches, or preparing things for the drive thru. Also a typical day includes being timed. You will be timed no matter what position you're in, so speedy work is an important part of the job. What i've learned through my time at wendys is that working together with the other crew members is an important part of your job. It can make things quicker which makes the customer much happier. I have a responsible management team and responsible co-workers where I can say we all are in this for the same purpose, to make the customer happier. The hardest part of my job is more internal. The hardest part of my job stems from me taking on too many tasks at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers."
good,"Clocking in was a breeze, friends were great even the mangers were all people you could get alone with. The work day had its different rushes of course, but I always managed to keep a professional work field.  "
good,"Working at Wendys you learn how to think on your feet. Problem solving, teamwork, as well as multitasking.The hardest part of this job is keeping cool,It is very easy to get out of character, You have to be a special kind of person to work in fast food."
good,i enjoyed everyone I worked with cause they were easy to get along with and my bosses were real nice as well
good,"ave been doing this for 10+ years in Customer Service and have delt with Cashier, Cash handling and also getting food prepaird for the daily sales. Open the store along with a few other people that were working in the same fields as I. "
good,I showed up at work and cooked lots of fries.  I learned how to use a fry cooker.  Management was fine for its purpose.  Co workers were just that.  I didn't know them.  Hardest part was the monotony.  Most enjoyable was the occasional free meal.
good,"Wendy's is an exceptional place to gain exposure to various types of people. I have learned to be patient with my co-workers, and listen carefully to the managers. The hardest part of our job is the rush hours, and the most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers. "
good,"Typical daily set up, ran through rush lunch hour. Cross trained to assist in all levels of the assembly line for rush hours."
good,Typical day was decent. Some co-workers were iffy. Hardest part was being busy and enjoyable would be learning new things.
good,"Typical day at work always arrive early for any shift, had daily routine come in talk to customers say hello to them ask them how their day is going get some input from the customer and then the crew followed by the management, see whats in store for the day crew wise and do a daily inventory to start my day."
good,"Very long days with infinite number of customers. My customer service skills enhanced, as well as my willingness to keep patience. My managers scarcely interacted with their subordinates, while co-workers oftentimes went out together to a club or movie after a long shift. the hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job, which would be the customers."
good,Greeting customers and taking orders for the most part of the day. I learned to patience and attentive. all my managers are nice respectful individuals. I get along with all my co-workers it is like family. the hardest part of the job is standing up all day.  
good,This company is my first job.So i would say that i have hard time in dealing with other people but later on i learned to deal with other .
good,"This job is a fast pace environment. I am experienced as a team player my Moto is to always be a team player."
good,"nice co workers fun, environment, enjoyed working the managers where friendly great staffing "
good,"Working here was fun, everyone got along and communication was great. Management was very reasonable with work schedules pertaining to school. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers but being able to keep calm helped improved customer relations. Overall good place to work."
good,enjoy everyday i work there because of the fast paste. the serve great tasting food and service. team leaders help out while getting overwhelm with customers.
good,I enjoyed working here. The best part was the way my schedule was set up. Most of my coworkers were real friendly. The hardest part of the job was working more than 2 positions because we were short handed. The most enjoyable part was when we had a rush. I really loved the challenge.
good,"had a lot of fun working with my coworkers while getting work done at the same time, though it was a fast paced job 75% of the time i enjoyed it very well"
good,"How to make burgers and i still follow white, red, green method to this day when i make burgers."
good,"going thru training soon, my co workers are hard working , my boss lets me know what im doing both wrong an right.  "
good,I didn't get to work there long considering they closed and their where to many of us to transfer to the other wendys. but I enjoyed it while I was there. 
good,N/A it was a fast food restaurant. my days where very short I worked probably three hours a day my mom was my manager always a plus 
good,"Wendy's was a nice job while I was in high school. While I was employed at Wendy's I learned, the costumer is always right, regardless if they were wrong. The management was ok, if you were a favorite. The hardest part of the job was the amount of people that we served and it was hot. Enjoyable part of the day, meals were half off. "
good,Regularly we would get everything stocked up before the costumers came so once rush hour came we would be ready. Everyone helped out each other if we weren't busy with our own costumers.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would include me serving customers, keeping everything behind the counter stocked, cleaning when needed, handling money exchanges, and helping my co-workers when needed. "
good,"A typical day of work would consists of preparing food for customers and delivering their orders in either the drive thru or the diner. I learned how to take a customers order, make salads, chilli, and frosties. Management is tough but fair. Co-workers are always helpful. Cleaning up the store and equipment would be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part would be the satisfaction that you would get for presenting a customer with their order."
good,"What I learned was to better multi-task. Co-workers were ok but some didn't want to do there jobs."
good,"I would go into work and get squared away. Restocking all of the cups, packets, soda machines, coffees and everything else was always a must. Must maintain a clean and organized work space at all times. One or two managers were completely unprofessional, but I managed to work around them. The hardest part was understanding people if I worked at drive thru because the speaker wasn't always working properly. Co-workers were filled with drama, but I was only there to work and get my job done. I loved assisting people, but had a few rude customers come in every once in a while, but that's typical everywhere you work. "
good,"Interacted with customers, tending money and responsible for cash 			register, and taking orders."
good,It was okay. A good job for teens. Very fast paced. Nice to meet new people. Good management.
good,"During my time at Wendy's I worked on the fryer and occasionally the register. I learn the phrase ""The customer is always right"". Management was not as professional as I would have liked them to be. My co-workers were nice individuals, the hardest part of this job would have to be cleaning the restrooms. the most enjoyable part was working the fryer. "
good,This is a very good job to have but sometimes can be very deficult. 
good,I worked here while in high school and at the time it was a great job because the co workers were all in high school too. The management inst great but hey it was my first job.
good,"worked drive-thru, made food on the line n friendly to customers"
good,"not very good hourly pay, alot of stress. Although I believe it is a good job to start out having at a young age, as it helps with experience; espeically in the management field."
good,An ok place to work...poor pay...employees were friendly....
good,working for wendy's was a good experience. i enjoyed working there for the 2 years i was employed. they provided a good work environment and were caring towards there employees as well their customers. 
good,"this job was okay, i didn't really get a chance to make new friends"
good,Work was fun and I learned how to flip burgers. My managers were nice people and so were my co-workers. There was no hardest part of the job and I enjoyed the job. 
good,It was very hard to separate work life and home life.  I worked too many night shifts while being 9 months pregnant.
good,Typical day depends if u open or close. I liked to open you did prep got registers set up made sure whole store was ready to go by 10 am
good,"i learned how to stay positive, and how wendys cook their food to give to the customers."
good,Often I was overwhelmed and no assitance from other workers and there was no team work
good,"Good customers , co workers are fun and easy to work with . management was at its best . I've learned to multitask, How to speak to people how to work in groups and / or independent."
good,Typical day would be fasted paced/ fast food there was always something to help out with. I've learned that when dealing with the public/differrent attitudes that you sometimes have to be patient/ a problem solver. Hardest part was the standing for many hours
good,It was just ok working here. I enjoyed the opportuity and it was a good experience
good,"provided the best services for the customers were the best parts of my job... I loved it, because I had a chance to work hard and met my customers expectations.."
good,I started as a fry cook. I learned many things at this place. i liked it
good,"Typical fast food job. Minimum wage, no benefits. Fast paced. No complaints."
good,Okay job. You get what you expect from working at a fast food restaurant.
good,At Wendy's we pride ourselves in the hard work that we do. But to me this is modern day slavery. They make you do so much for such a small amount of money that they expect you to live off on for 2 weeks.
good,Would stock counter and help with drive through if no one was in the dining room. Would take orders and serve people their food. Would also clean dining room area after lunch and dinner rush. I learned to work in a rushed environment where being thorough and fast were necessary. The hardest part of the job was being rushed during the lunch and dinner rushes. The most enjoyable part was the costumers. I would start to recognize regulars and was nice to get a friendly smile back.
good,A typical day would be to do opinion surveys on the phone. I am a fast learner and I really did not need managers watching my every move so that is what made this job enjoyable. The hardest part was to keep people on the phones for lengthy opinion surveys
good,"Greeted customers upon entrance, Handled cash, check, credit and automatic debit card transactions"
good,"Cleaning, serving custoers an stocking up."
good,"I like my job, but i am looking for something new. Work place was excellent."
good,The job was Okay! They have great crew members but not good Managers
good,"Took orders for drive thru and for front counter; cleaned lobby, batheroms, dining room, back room, and dishes."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining a steady work flow and fast pace, keeping up with all sanitary duties, and a constant positive attitude. I learned in depth the maintenance of keeping a steady and efficient running operation."
good,It was not a bad place to work it had its up and downs about the job but other than that it was okay.
good,i learned how to deal with customers how to use a cash register my co workers were amazing the most enjoyable part was being able to work in a friendly environment
good,"Sorted, counted, and wrapped currency and coins"
good,"The hardest part of the job is when your management team is not on the same page, overall I learned how to manage a shift, make schedules, and meet a lot of great people."
good,I learned a great deal about how to lead others in this environment
good,Wendy's was my first job I didn't work there that long but it was an exicting exeperience.
good,"The crew and the management are the best ,the management makes working for wendy's real fun."
good,"I came in the morning before opening. Helped with getting things ready for the day. I first learned to do the french fries, chicken, nuggets. When i got that down I learned the register. I had fun learning how to do things."
good,I didn't have any problems
good,Not much of a fun environment but co-workers were very helpful and patient.
good,It was not all that fun I just went to work stayed to myself and when it was time for me to go home I just clocked out anf went home
good,"Working at wendy's was a big break for me, because this was my first job to work with a lot of people and had the oppurtunity to learn many skills in customer service. I've learned how to be a team player and and more organized."
good,"The managers werent very strict, behind in work, not very busy days, lots of fillers"
good,my job title was the fryer my job was to cook all the french fries and the nuggets and restock the food in the freezer
good,My day at work was always interesting. I learned how to work fast food. My co-workers were good people. The hardest park of the job was leaving frends I had made.
good,"Typically you work ten hour shifts with no scheduled breaks. Talent cultivation is becoming a priority for company, however, lacks organization in this field. Internal promotions are common."
good,"I mean honestly, what can you say? There is grease, teenagers, money and food! It was an amazing first job"
good,"Most of the time I help open up the store, by prepping, assembling stations, and preparing product. What I learned most was better people skills, also on how to run a register, opening and closing the store, and also food preparing. Some co-workers can be better then others all depends, being in the type of work goes with a lot of turn-over. So co-workers always change. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, and sometimes co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a recurring customer be happy with the customer service I provide them."
good,A typical day at Wendy's was extremely interesting one minute you cooking the next your cleaning then your cashier for the rest of the day. I learned not to ever work a fast food job again. Management was poor to much favoritism going on my hours constantly shifted and I guess that is to be expected. The co-workers were lazy I did all the cooking and cleaning and trash take out and well really I ran the store pretty much under the management. Hardest part of the job not yelling at other co-workers to do there jobs. Sadly there are no enjoyable parts of this job.
good,the managers were awful to work for they dont care about employees they only cared about money
good,"Ok place for students, or seniors or someone that likes to work in a restaurant environment."
good,"This job was a very high paced place. We had our corprate managers through out the store weekly, which allowed operations to flow nicely."
good,"Fast past, people don't stay long, every time new management and new coworkers."
good,A typical day at work involves high pace performance and quality service
good,I enjopyed this job due to the vast amount of contact with people. I am a people person very out going and understan the customer is always right.
good,This was a job I took while I was in high school to make my car payment. It served the purposed that i needed it to serve. I was so busy with extra curricular activities that I couldnt work here and maintain my grades.
good,"Prepared store for opening, placed workers in positions for their shift. Verified amount in drawers before opening for the day. Balanced the drawers at shift change and end of the night. Made sure store was clean for the next day. Verified stock that came in to the store. Disciplined staff when needed."
good,I enjoy working here on certain days. Downside is they mainly hire teenagers and leave you short handed on the older people. Advancement you can forget about it unless the management is sane. They would rather advance people who cause more harm then good. Aside from that great fast paced. but more of a temporary job then something long term.
good,Nice outgoing friendly people clean envirornment.
good,I would mostly work the day shift during the lunch hours I learned how to work in a team co workers we're friendly I enjoyed working there and seeing all the friendly faces the hardest part of the job was when we didn't have enough employees for a lunch rush
good,"delt with society and cleaned , made sandwitches, tipically not to fond of the management at the time because he played favorites."
good,* 7 hour shift I got 1 half hour break
good,I worked with classmates so i loved it.! i wouldnt do it again though
good,I didn't enjoy the job too much. they didn't really challenge me at all and I didn't receive many benefits if any at all.
good,"A lot isgoing on at once, you have to be a great multitasker and stay busy while satisfying customers"
good,"My day would start off by me clocking in. I would make sure that everything is stocked up or if there would be customers, I would go ahead and take their orders. This job taught me how to handle difficult customers. The management showed favoritism and they would openly talk down to you if they did not like you. The co-workers did not like each other too much but I got along with everyone."
good,I learned how customer service can enrich your attitude to satisfy what people seek with your work.
good,"I learned to take it as it comes, there are rough days and slow days but it is all about working together as a team that gets you through the day."
good,"everyone was all over the place, it was a complete mess and it was hectic"
good,It was great working here if you are a student. The schedule varies and you only work when there is work.
good,I didn't really like the way the boss act around the employees.
good,"I was a crew member who eventually became a Shift Supervisor at age 18. They were not very considerate when it came to personal reasons. I never missed work in the 2 and a half years I was there except for two times because I had strep throat and they were very upset with me. I am also in college and they were not giving me the days I needed off to go to school, they knew I was attending college prior to making me a Shift Supervisor. Holidays are not paid, they transfer managers to different locations frequently, and they do not provide very positive feedback. It all depends in what store you go to. I loved my coworkers and employees and it was a fun job, but with the extra responsibility and upper management expecting me to do their job, it became very stressful. Again it depends in what store you work with, I had an excellent experience at the first store I worked at, when they transferred me, not so much."
good,"I enjoyed working here for a while. Sometimes they hire crazy managers who don't care about the crew, though. Your co-workers will change all the time, so if you have a problem with someone, it likely won't last."
good,Ejoyed working and making customers happy. also liked my coworkers
good,"When hired at Wendys you're assigned to one job. But days later your job was everything. Started at the grill, then the dish washer, then learned back window, then fron window, then front register. Getting off at late hours after 2"
good,"I would work a 10 hour shift 5 days a week,my daily task consist of verifying large sums of cash,count daily inventory,place truck orders for store 3 times a week.I had very nice and friendly co-workers and great crew members.I think the hardest part of my job was nothing at all I love my job.The most enjoyable part of the was making sure every customer was happy and leaving with a smile on there face."
good,I learned from working at Wendy's most things I've know today.
good,Worked as a cashier and at the grill station. opened the store and closed also
good,I think it was an ok work place but the management could have been more constructive and stable
good,"Typical day was making fries and sometimes making burger meat patties. I learned that people will say anything to get over on someone else, so watch what you say around other employees. Manager will sometime be easy going but they will not get fired for you. Hardest part of my job learning the sandwiches. Most enjoyable part of my job was going home for the night."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would include a high stress atmosphere with constant manager disproval regardless of the situation or corrective job. Co-workers tend to vary with attitudes day-to-day, which tends to depend on their work ethics. There is not a strong supportive base with management to improve employee stamina. The hardest part of this occupation was that an employee could come to work and not know what the future of the day would hold. They could be there for five minutes and already have a manager or another employee harassing them. The most enjoyable aspect of this occupation is the repetitive customers that always come back to see you."
good,"It can and usually get busy on a regular at lunch time hour. I learned the basis of the cash register and much better at math, more so with money. We get a knew manager every few months for training but they're all great and my co-workers are fantastic. There really isn't any hard part about the job if you know what you're doing. The most enjoyable part is working with great people and of course seeing the wonderful customers day to day."
good,"This was my first time being a manager. It took a little getting used to at first but once I got into the swing of things, it was fun. I really liked my shift, which was first, so I worked while my kids were at school. I enjoyed being there early and getting things like paper work for the day and prepping done."
good,"was a cook, worked at the window, took orders, and handed them out at the window. also unloaded the truck."
good,I loved working at wendys cause everybody form high school worked there.
good,"The work place is satisfiable,the food is great and nice environment."
good,Fast pace
good,"This job was great as I was going to school and working as a crew worker. My schedule was very flexible and the managers who made the schedule always gave me off on any day I requested. One negative about my time as a crew worker is that I did my work, as well as most of the other crew's, and it still took my 3 years to receive my first raise. Once I got out of college, I was promoted to a shift manager, and this is where I began to see how this job wasn't as great as I had thought. There is a constant shortage of workers, so I end up having to do the work of a crew worker, as well as my own work. The pay is extremely low for a management position. It is very hard to put a great amount of effort into this job when my roommate at the time has the same position at another fast-food restaurant, but makes $5 more per hour."

good,my experience with my boos was a helpful homely environment at work. I was also responsible for selling and stocking items.
good,hard work but quick work days. easy to get along with other crew members.
good,Typical day at work is great I learn how to fix sandwiches and operate machines management is good they have great personnel co- workers are fun and dependable the hardest part of the job is when there is a rush and you have to work in a very fast paste the best part of the day is when the day goes by good and employers have fun.
good,I have fun with the people but it is over all not a long term place you want to stay at. The franchise i work for doesn't offer raises at all other then when minimum wage goes up
good,I was a cashier and i cooked some of the time.This was a good company but they training was poor.
good,"Exactly what you would expect from a fast food job. Low pay, but work doesn't require very much brain power."
good,my work day is usually fast pace always moving we are a high volume store. product is always fresh and handed out as fast as we can
good,Did a multiple number of jobs besides serving the general public
good,Manager didn't run things correctly and was not a good work environment. learn how to run the pantry while i worked there.
good,Loved most of the people that worked for this company. Balance of hours was a little uncoordinated but overall an okay place to work.
good,I enjoy working in the healthcare setting or office settting to learn new things all the time. I enjoy my job when I have accomplish goals to be successful.
good,- Some of the management people are very disrespectful towards employee's.
good,A really good company to work for. I just was unsatisfied with how advancement was promised to me and it was not ever given.
good,very fassed passed. never know what problems you will have it's always something new.
good,"Repetitive Tasks, fun to talk to your coworkers during slow periods. when its busy time goes by very quickly. Must be good at adding and subtracting very quickly during busy periods so that nobody is waiting on chicken or meat."
good,A typical work day is to come do targets(counting every food item) and run a well organize shift while delivering excellent customer service. I learned how to manage in a timely manner. Management was ok as long as you do what is expected to be done. Other supervisor and managers are fine to work with an gets alone well. Crew member an their ability not to do what is expected to be done is the hardest part and having to deal with call offs. The most enjoyable part is the ability to challenge myself to deliver excellent customer service better than the last and meet service time goals.
good,Learned customer service experience
good,This was my first job. I loved it. The people they make you feel comfortable.
good,Working at Wendy's was a great experience for me. It is where I learned to deal with customers in an appropriate manner. I enjoyed working in the drive thru the most.
good,I loved my supervisors. The job was okay I guess. The store always ran smoothly
good,"Never always in the same place for too long, the pay is less that what you deserve, but it is fast food. Depending on where you work or who you are working with, the day can be either good or bad."
good,"Management have problems, some people bring the life problems to work."
good,. I ran cash register.
good,"My days working at Wendy's were very interesting, everyone at the company was easy going and great to get along with, Everyone had lots of input and great advice to give to you, the team workers always had smiles upon their faces and greeted customers like their was no tomorrow. They would always give the customers what they wanted and if mistake were to happen they'd handle it like nothing just happened. The wendy's I previously worked for are hard working, loyal, and honest people. It's a very nice company and they run it quite tight and smoothe."
good,"It was a nice place to work I enjoyed the fast pace, and customer enter actions."
good,The hardest part of the job for me would be the late nights.
good,"It wasn't a bad job, it was a fast paced job in which I like, I can deal with angry customers pretty easily."
good,This was my first job and I liked it for the most part. Majority of my co-workers were really nice and I became friends with most people there. I worked register most days and occasionally helped make the food.
good,"I enjoyed working at wendy's, it was a good environment to work in. Dealing with defferent customers gave me the opportunity to gain valuable customer servivce experience."
good,"Working at wendy's restaurant for 40 hours a week is fun, rotating shift is indeed. They treat foreign worker same as the canadians. We have a great management team, working with different cultures at first was hard to adjust but I get used to it especially on language barriers. I learned being professional as a supervisor giving fair judgement. Dealing with customer is a must, being polite at all times. Extending hours is a must with most of the time just standing and running because its a fast food restaurant."
good,"i was young so it was a job but they only made $2.00 at the time..really was no money but worked because i just wanted to and for the money, also was so crazy people couldnt get along not a freindly enviormentq"

good,no same day did so many positions.every position but manager and 1 opening shift.management did the work but wasnt always friendly about it.i enjoyed working with almost all of my co workers. hardest part morning maintenance. most enjoyable the grill.
good,"A clean and orderly work place, that's professional and fun. Based upon my customers I loved my job aside that my store could've had more professional managers."
good,Wendy's is a good place to work when you have good people working with you.
good,This job was a stressful environment and the work place was understaffed most of the people would quit so their would be many new untrained employees that did not understand or know their task shifts were often long and i had to train many new people just being their only there for a few weeks the best part of my day was going home.
good,"Open store,and set up my work station.Learn to mutli-task why under presure. Had a great management.Hardest part was making a mistake and cost the line to build up."
good,"A topical day at work includes product analysis so you can predict service needs. You also have to remain open to sudden changes or release of new products. I ve learned how to communicate with a diverse group of people and reach them as not only a leader, but also as a teacher. The best part of this job is being able to learn new skills myself as well as ways to teach others those aquired skills."
good,My typical work day was to make sure everyone was satisfied and be a team player to get everything done.
good,In a typical day i ran the register taking orders and sometime help prep the salads and potatoes. I learned how to be a team member ad working with people. The management was easy to work with as long as you stayed on there good side. The most enjoyable and stressful part of the job was dealiing with people they were not satified
good,Fast paced fun place alot of hard work and alot of cleaning hardest part is weekend rushes
good,"days there can be 50/50,there is a lot of things there that you need to learn and memorize, learn to listen to the customer and do what they want, nned to always make sure your area is always clean"
good,Cashier position at drive-thru window and front counter. Food prep.
good,A typical day at work consisted of me stocking the fries and hamburger patties. I learned how to cook chilli and how to operate the register for front counter as well as drive-thru. The most enjoyable part was greting customers wioth a smile. The hardest part was keeping up wduring rush hour when co-workers would call off.
good,"opens: prepration of salads, line set up, ice cream machine set up,till set up making chili"
good,"Awesome experience while going to school, they work around your schedule"
good,You can learn a lot but it can be difficult to work in fat food .
good,Very busy and stressful workplace. did not really have a good experience
good,"Typical day at work. Depending can be a stressful environment, can be a fun energetic environment, Ive learned everything I know and invoke in every day settings. I can say that I have learned alot, and gained so much opportunity and experience."
good,Fast paced environment that requires a lot of multi-tasking. One should have excellent customer service and comminicaton skills. Must be able to work with a team of many different personalities and backgrounds. patience is a must.
good,"Prepare all foods to standards quickly. Maintain cleanliness. Handle cash, credit cards in a proper"
good,Wendy's was a good company to work for good benefits and very good scheduling. A good amount of work and personal time. I learned a lot there to further my management career.
good,"this is a job that required you to multi task and it keeps you busy, the best and worst part about it , is the customers . it feels good to please them but some of them can be very difficult . everyone works togather adn the managements works as part of the crew."
good,Wendy's a place where everyone helped everyone do thier job and get it done in a fast and timely manner. From taking orders and interacting with people made this job for me enjoyable.Doing things in a fast and timely and accurate manner is what this job was all about
good,I have worked several different locations here in phoenix. There are different respect levels at each store. I have six years with this company. A lot of hard work for the managers especially the night managers like i had to be due to other Managers quitting due to favoritism among General Managers. This is a very good quality products and very well maintained facilities. Just wish Management could really be on the same team.I was left with very poor employees to close with so i had to re do all their job as well as my own. I didn't get any shift that didn't cause me to leave home by two pm and return before Four thirty am or five am. I was originally a day manager but switched to nights due to need. was only going to be temporary.I have four young children and did this schedule for nine months with them still not even trying to change me back to days.. Way over worked for the ten dollars an hour. I later picked up a telemarketing job paying the same with hardly any responsibly compared to what these guys expected.
good,"I worked as a Cashier, Dishwasher, and also did Drive thru."
good,"Normal duties were cashier, drive thru & keeping the restaurant clean."
good,The best part about this job was customer interaction. Was a large crew of people that worked there so you had all kinds of personalities to work with.
good,"Wendy's was my only restaurant affiliated job. I enjoyed getting to know other people and work with them on a daily basis to provide proficient customer satisfaction. I was able to work around in different sections of the job so, to me, that broadened my knowledge for that type of industry. I realy enjoyed myself. I gained valuable friends and information."
good,I met a lot of people in the community working there. Police officers to every day working man. I memorized orders and it kept me on my toes. I enjoyed working with others.
good,it was very fun to work there learing new things everyday was wonderful the most joyable IS MEETING NEW PEOPLE SEEING THEM SMILE THE HARDEST PART NOT PUTTING A SMILE ON PEOPLES FACES MY CO WORKES WA SO FUNNY AND FUN TO WORK WITH THE MANAGERS WAS GREAT AND HELPFUL
good,"I was responsible for taking orders, handling cash/credit cards, cleaning dishes, the dining room and the back kitchen. I obtained my food handlers permit for this place of employment. I enjoyed the people I worked with, as well as the many various types of customers that I came in contact with, which I considered the best perk from working in the fast food industry."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"Overall, its much like you'd expect of a fast food restaurant. it just wasn't my cup of tea. It paid the bills and did what I needed it to do. But I am a former cancer patient, so the excessive heat eventually caused a problem."
good,I enjoyed working here. Flexable schedule. Fair compensation.
good,"Typical work day including entering in the customers orders, making food and drinks, and counting down our drawer at the end of my shift. At Wendy's I learned that every member of the team is important no matter how small the task at hand may be. Management was great and so were my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was dealing with upset customers when orders were entered incorrectly. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a like feeling within our store."
good,It teaches you skills that helps you multi-task and appreciate the value of teamwork
good,an overall decent job. typical day is getting food out with quality
good,"Working at Wendy's is fast paced especially when there are alot of customers. I have to be quick on my feet and communicate with each customer. Some of managers at Wendy's are a little helpful and demanding, while other managers give positive feedback and assist training. My co-workers are very nice and friendly people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with impatient and rude customers."
good,Working with a team to keep flow of business accurate.Would Come in ready to work.
good,your can get almost any day off you need during the year. but you do have to work a lot of weekends and nights
good,Need a new career. I enjoy being in management but i don't like when i have to babysit adults. Wendy management team need better commucation and support from upper management.
good,management
good,learned alot was my first job a great starter to get in to the work force.
good,The company paid well but the entire Washington upper management team was let go so we all had to start over with the Oregon team. The fun part is I was sent to the worst store in the market and was able to clean it up and turn the store around in two months.
good,"i enjoyed working there, i enjoyed who i worked with. the managers where fun, hardest part of job was the rushes, most enjoyable part was the rushes as well."
good,"very poor management, worked a lot, enjoyed working with co-workers"
good,the hardest part of the job is to hear the order on the head set
good,A typical day at Wendy's would involve a significant amount of customer service as well as food preparation. I have learned how to prepare food as well as do cash recognition. Management was a bit unfair to the employees. If the employee made an error instead of helping them correct it they caused a scene and made the employee feel as if they could not continue. The hardest part of the job was to watch employees get treated unfairly. The most enjoyable job was stepping up and helping to explain to those employees what was done wrong and what they can do to improve as well as fix the problem.
good,"The work day was sometimes very busy to being very slow. The mangers and co-workers were pretty cool, I really dont have much to say about my experience here."
good,i like this job but sometimes it can get aggraveting
good,"good food, poor pay, hours and benfits."
good,"i work front counter and coordinate for drive-thru, i enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,Flexible hours so that it is great for students. You must have patience and a friendly attitude.
good,Wendy's was a good job but there were more cons than pros to working there. One good thing about working there was that I worked with people my age which made it easy to get along with the people i worked with. A disadvantage to working there would have to be working until 4am and the heat of the kitchen on hot days.
good,"it was nice working there, I wouldn't mind working there or for some other wendys again. I met some nice people while Iwas there"
good,working at wendy's was a great experience for me because I now know what it feels like to work with customers and that minimum wage do not help with any bills.
good,"I’m a very hard and dedicated worker. Majority of the time,I’m in a positive mood and very easily to get along with my coworkers. I’m always on time and don’t ever mind working on my off days."
good,Working at a restaurant taught me how to work under pressure and still have a positive attitude for the customers. I also met many different people daily which kept my job always interesting and a little different.
good,I enjoyed coming in to Wendy’s knowing it’s a fast pace and comfortable working space although there wasn’t much team chemistry due to the hiring of new people.
good,"I arrived to work at 9:45; After clocking in I would count my draw to make sure it was correct, then I would check to make sure all product was dropped and ready to be served, and store was ready for opening at 10. The workplace was friendly everybody got along. I can't really say what the hardest job was, however; I can say the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying the customer and making their experience the best that it can be."
good,It was okay in the beginning but after I got a new district manager I wasn't getting paid for a woodworking I wasn't even getting that a full check and I even lost my place because of the job cuz everytime I ask for help they keep on passing me around so that was my main reason quitting
good,"A typical opening day at Wendy's for a manager is first; of course greeting our crew members! I go in to the office and do whatever needs to be done for that day, as everyday is different. As soon as I am finished with computer and paperwork, I balance and count all drawers and the safe. After this, I grab my daily checklist and do a walk-through making sure all tasks for the crew members to do is completed with dates and times and is clean work. I then have a TTM or talk to me in with all crew for the day, giving them their positions for the day and have them give me a goal that they will accomplish for the day, I have seen great motivation and excitement from employees doing this regularly on a daily. We are then to a fast paced work for the rest of the day, and working hard to have our guests leave with a smile! Lastly, I have a last TTM with all crew when the shift is over, thanking them for the hard work and giving each crew member a task that could have been better so they have an idea for their new goal on a new shift."
good,Just a great fast food place to eat at food fresh hot in the morning and afternoon. Any employee willing to grow in fast food Wendy's is the place to having a great career in fast food.
good,I have experienced many things with this company in the two years I have been here. There has been ups and downs throughout my time. I believe that many of the managers try their best but the management is poor and they have no communication. The company overall can be a great company depending on the store.
good,"The people I worked with is what made my experience there worth it but the management wasn't that great. They weren't always fair and stressed me out a lot. They rose my position to crew leader, which obviously takes a lot of responsibility that I felt I wasn't ready for because of how little they taught me when it came to managing. They didn't prioritize my school and made me feel like I need to prioritize my work even though it was temporary for me. For example, they made it hard for me to call off work whenever I had a meeting at my school about my path to college."
good,Unsatisfying experiences throughout the years of my career at this company. Levels of advancement are prolonged regardless of work ethic and integrity towards the company brand.
good,Wendy’s is a good fast food restaurant but that job was kinda stressful. Dealing with a lot of hungry anger customers you’ll have to maintain a well peace mind and try you best to make them happy or eat better
good,"Great starter job eventually you grow out of it in no time! Management will hype you promotions and raises yet you don't see it until they try to keep you from leaving! Decent Managers and understanding but when it comes to moving up its a hold, Good luck!"
good,"Lack of responsibility and care from certain managers."
good,We was always busy in the mornings so we never got breaks. Nights was slow so they send people on break. They can never keep the new people they hire due to the manager. It was hard training the new people.
good,"Working at Wendys can be good or bad it just all depends on your energy and the way you carry yourself at work. Always being polite, helpful, and completing all task in time will be very helpful."
good,"Store was very busy from the time it opens 10am till 2am 7 days a week, Just doesn't get the pay you may deserve, only major problem with the store"
good,"The work itself is not complicated, but if you work full time for several days a week, then stress arises. Due to the fact that there are many buyers, and work ends late at night, loud sounds are heard throughout the whole working day. Also, during work you can’t sit on a chair, only during a 30-minute break, all work is performed while standing."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great starting job. As with any minimum wage job, it's not expected that you pay rent and bills, as it is for teenagers needing some extra money and experience. The managers are generally okay, some are amazing, and some are not. But I learned how to deal with ""meh"" managers, and how to keep them happy. Overall, Wendy's is great if you're looking for experience."
good,It was not so organized even tho it was very busy all the time it was always short on staff . Work where not so kind . Either than that I was sometime stressful.
good,"Commitment to providing excellent guest service skills "
good,When you go in for your shift your time starts on the clock as soon as you get behind the counter. Why because its a fast paced working environment and if you love helping others which is your job. Then you'll understand why i say that.
good,You must be quick on your feet and be able to stay organized as well be able to follow orders to a T. The management is incharged or making sure you have everything you need such as food and aprions etc.
good,"I liked working there in college. I would not go back though. After working with fast food for 9 months, the smells get to you. My co- workers were really nice to me. No one never gave me a hard time."
good,Working at Wendy's was a headache because the staff was very low and people were working multiple positions. I personally had to make sandwiches and grill meat.
good,This job was difficult but I liked it for the most part besides the old general manager was a total creep and I hated having to talk to him he always made himself look good in front of guests but in reality would not do much work and would say very gross and inappropriate things which is probably a reason he doesn't work there anymore
good,Working at wendy's was a good experience. You can learn a lot from Wendy's if you just coming in the fastfood business. The managers could be better than what they're.
good,"Although the hours can seem long, the managers usually were quite willing to work around your schedule weather it be for school or just having a life.  That’s most of the management, at my particular location my general manager was extremely lazy and caused many people to hate working there and quit. Which is what happened to me"
good,"My most typical day at Wendy's is most likely a really stressful day. Always on my feet from here to there every time, I work at the Manukau store and its a really busy store most times."
good,You are committed to working long hours. If you have children be prepared to miss out on a lot. Job can be demanding and rewarding. You get what you put in.
good,Overall my experimence at Wendy’s was both stressful and convent. I enjoyed talking to customers and providing service as needed.  I did not enjoy certain aspects such as dealing with customer and employee negative attitudes.
good,If you like working in the fast food industry Wendy’s is a good choice. They have competitive pay and decent benefits plus vacation time.  You have to want to work hard. You also need to be able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.
good,Working on a fryer or in the drive through. Boring for most of the shift but the management is relaxed and understanding. This is a fairly easy job...
good,The managers were very patient with me learning how to make all the food. My co-workers were my friend and I really liked working there because of the people. The customers weren't always the nicest people though...
good,"If your looking for a career dont work here. But if your looking for something temporary this will do. Its fast food so you should know what to expect, fast paced, collaborative type work environment. It will help your communication skills."
good,Very fast when it gets busy and can be hard to deal with. Stressful when management yells at you when u get something wrong. There good at working but bad at communicating.
good,"There messy they try to invole there self in everybody life they smile in your face and speak bad about you when you not around ..."
good,"opening the store, checking inventory, making sheets, assign employees to their positions ans their duties, helping crew members in busy time, maintain the cleanness"
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy’s. It was a great experience for me and a good learning opportunity.  We got lots of hours , the manager was understaffing if you needed to get time off. The pay could be a little better for the work we do but overall it is a good job."
good,"It's a great start for you first job but you wouldn't want to stay there forever, which is why I am currently looking for another job that is also closer to school."
good,"It’s so busy, and I hardly ever get a break and I usually work 9 hours days no break and I’m not even a manager yet. The pay is not good. Most of the managers are awesome and don’t try to throw their position title in your face and treat you as an equal"
good,"I have been with this company for almost a decade. I graduated high school with some food experience, and with my work ethic I have been able to grow and succeed. It has been a rough economy to develop in, but I made my way up through the ranks. Describing my average work day isn't a fair question to ask because each day is very different from the next. To be perfectly honest, that is one thing that I truly value and appreciate about this business environment. I enjoy having a job where I don't do the exact same thing, every single day, Monday through Friday 9 AM to 5 PM. That is incredibly mundane and unrewarding for me. I enjoy that every day is a new situation with a broad subject of tasks presented to me."
good,"When people arrived for their job(sober) you could expect a relatively smooth shift, while 1 person being gone would make the entire day stressful without exception. Late time night crew would often lounge in the lobby after 10 and watch movies, roll cigarettes/joints, drink"
good,Great place to work if you love meeting new people and making sandwiches. Co-workers make you feel at home and help you with anything you need. Fun environment to work in!!
good,"For the most part, my management team was excellent but it is very fast paced and high expectations are set. Can be draining and stressful. Get old really fast."
good,"depending on the day of the week it was, a typical day at wendys was kind of chilled , but at some point throughout the day it would get really busy. About sundays and Fridays."
good,"Needed a job close to home and hours that fit my schedule. I closed many nights and stayed until 1:00am. Pataskala is a small town, but busy. People are friendly."
good,They are pretty good at working around your schedule but the lack of people and the constant noncaring management really sucks up the good things here.
good,"It was an interesting experience working there, that was sometimes good and other times not so good. The store I worked for, seemed desperate for employees; the turn over rate was really high. "
good,When u work with the right people on ur shift it can be a fun shift to work. Most the employees are fun to hang out with in and out of the work place.
good,Wendy's is a good company to work for they do have good benefits it's just a very stressful and face paced job and the hours are a lot to deal with if spending any time with your family is important to you at all plus every store I've worked at in hickory area is extremely understaffed.
good,i got to experience every position available at wendy's everyday was something new. The store manager there is not really nice but overall working and getting along with everyone was no issue.
good,A good job to grow don't over work yourself though being there for customer is fulfilling and create educational experiences.  I enjoy meeting new people
good,I got fired while off the clock When A Worker Challenge To A Fight. Thanks A Ton. Petty Situations Couldn’t Bring Hardships Lost My Respect. Childish Managers.
good,"Job Was Okay Mot Bad Just Stressful Alot Of Days Good Managenent And Money Was Good"
good,"Wendy's was an alright place to work. It is decently chill working here and you basically have no worry of being reprimanded or fired as long as you show up most of the time and do your work. The people I meet here are really chill except for management who, for the most part, hardly pulled their weight around and basically got stressed about everything. Expect the rushes to be ultra stressful as it is always understaffed  and you'll be doing like 2 jobs at once. While I feel like the starting pay is alright, you never get raises even if you work there for a long time. So hopefully you like how much you start with, because it's not going up. O also there are hardly any benefits except for free meals under 5$ on breaks and 50% above that only while your working."
good,"it was a good job, the people were easy to get along with then manangement was okay.  never really had any fun activities planned for the employees. only had a Christmas party. very diverse atmospehere."
good,"Wendy's is a brand that truly cares about what is right. IF one is surrounded by great leaders and great subordinates then it can be a phenomenal place to work. Advancement opportunities are available for those that work hard, have integrity, and make it a point to do the right thing."
good,"I work as a cook person, where grilling burgers for sandwiches, and also attending Fries for the customers. I also did a dishwashing job, however, I quit Wendy's because they had poor schedule management."
good,I wasn’t quite fond of this place. They had a lot of gossip and mostly in Spanish. It wasn’t really welcoming and they made you do all the odd jobs they did let want to do.
good,"The work at Wendy's wasn't hard but it just got to be the same thing day after day which didn't make it very enjoyable for some worker's, which could lower their quality of performance."
good,"It was acceptable for a first job for a high schooler with no bills. The people were decent, and the managers were cool. The work could be very frustrating when it was busy."
good,"It’s great for a first job if you and to get your money up. But it can really get to you sometimes, especially when there’s a line wrapping around inside & outside on the drive-thru line."
good,"Wendy's is a fast paced environment with a variety of people. You need to have exceptional communication skills and be an attentive listener. You must also, know how to do well under pressure."
good,"You only qualify for healthcare and benefits through Wendy’s if you work full time with 40 hrs a week. "
good,"They hire the wrong people. Nobody has a good work ethic and management let them get away with a lot. Short staffed everyday. Horrible turnover rate. Poor management who cares more about himself than the business or his people. Constant complaining from everyone. No breaks and long hours. Pay isn't high enough. The company used to be good, but due to new management within the store and corporate level, things have gone downhill fast."
good,Very demanding job. Always short staffed and no balance between work and home life. Pretty good benefits though and always have an opportunity to advance.
good,Job is great job the the pay is very bad and they are under staff at all time witch puts more work on the people that do work which makes for bad place to work
good,"good job for up and coming management.  Skills and training are provided.  Promotions are based on mastering different levels - start as crew; become crew trainer; become shift manager 1, 2 and 3;  become AGM; possibly become GM"
good,"Although Wendys did give me the opportunity to work my way up, once i was shift supervisor there was no room for futher advancement. The crew i worked with did not communicate well and was not there to build each other up, they tried to tear each other down.. I am grateful for the experience but was not happy with that store not sure if i would go back to Wendy's to work just cause the experience at this store."
good,"Get your preferred hours, routine activities, cut and dry tasks. However the pay isnt necessarily good."
good,"Fast pace experience , customer service experience, food preparation experience, work orders experience, drive thru fast pace experience, extremely fast pace and friendly environment"
good,Working at Wendy's used to not be stressful until I became a manger and the environment changed completely.  I was doing it to get tuition reimbursement until I found out it was only $1500 a year.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wendy's but the management in my opinion could use some training on how to deal with there employees better and the stress of the job
good,it was ok it was a typical day at work I learned how to work together I really didn't enjoy working there but it was benfinacial  the most enjoying part I became good friends with a co worker and til this day we have a good relationship. I had some bad days some good days
good,"Overall the job was pretty easy, you just really have to know what your doing before socializing. I did a lot of different positions but I like the challenge,"
good,Not To Much Of A Restaurant Job Type Of Person. That Wendy’s Was Unprofessional Amongst The Works But Was Great To The Customers . They Made Sure The Place Was Clean
good,"While working at Wendy's as a part time crew member, I received a lot of flexible hours as a crew member and being a full-time student.  The atmosphere was somewhat inviting."
good,Manager was rude.  Scheduled me on days that I said I couldn't work.  Work environment was fun.  Employees were fun to work with.  Expects you to drop your life to go into work even when you book that day off.
good,"I had to do a lot of work. There were a couple weekends where I had worked 14 hours, from open to close without a break. I didn't get free lunches. The mangers were not nice, they didn't help much. Overall it's a bad experience."
good,"Great job if your looking for some quick an fast money, but you do the most for little pay. Very fast paced, your competing against a clock to get orders out, management sometimes get frustrated when you don’t meet the time requirement."
good,I learned to communicate more with the customers and the hardest part of the job is to make sure u get all the orders right and be in fast paced with the sandwiches
good,It was nice working there but I didnt like the way I was treated. They give me good hours but I feel like I should received hire pay for my hard work.
good,i been there a long time nothing changed till the new managers came than the whole store changed so i left everything as unorganized an the managers some of them were not good
good,not a bad job if needed while you're attending school. The pay would be hard to live on your own with but can be decent if your manager lets you work as many hours as you want.
good,"fast paced,hard work a lot going on..learned t"
good,I had recent issues that I was taking care of while I was working there. Other than that it seemed normal there and everyone there was great and there to make money and talk when business was slow.
good,It was a okay fun place to work but some days it was some tuff days but it was some cool workers I nevered had a problem with any of them they was chill also
good,"Recommend for people that really need money....."
good,It has its moments of being enjoyable yet can occur stressful from certain customers. Hardest part of the job is to not lose your anger over the customers pickiness. The enjoyable part of the work place you get to laugh or make friends in the workplace.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is about what you can expect, you come in see who you have for the night, and figure out who is going to do what. Serve customers, and make sure breaks are given out."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy’s for a year or so as my first job ever having. It was fun working around the people I knew from outside of the work place and it was fun prepping the food and bagging it for customers. I enjoyed working at Wendy’s.
good,"A typical work day is making sure I have everything ready form my team. It gets stressful most times but it's a great way to practice mindfulness. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you come into contact with, but take everything with a grain of salt because they are all not great co-workers"
good,If you like fast past supplying and delivering and dealing with customers wendys is for you. You will have job security if you do the job right and get along with the crew and managers.
good,"Managers were rude and annoying. Worked with all kids. Few adults apply to fast food, unless their on day shift. Don’t work their if you don’t half to."
good,The job was fun my managers were good but it got to the point I could do every position in he store and they would not make me a manager even after I asked to talk to the Area Manager three times about it
good,"My typical day started at 7am and ended at 5pm "
good,Fast paced but the day goes pretty fast if it's busy. Team members can be nice to work with as well as managers. Working in a hot environment with some sharp utensils. As long as you follow all procedures you're in good shape.
good,It’s a decent workplace for a entry level position but definitely no long term it’s a place where you try to find something better in the meantime it works
good,"It is okay to work here, but the management kept pressuring me to do stuff, that was stressful and putting my well-being in danger.  Didn't get no vacation time after being there for 21 months.  You can enjoy working there, but be aware of District Managers."
good,The Wendy's location I work for is a pleasant atmosphere. They treat their employee's in a fair manner. They don't ask more of you than you can handle based on your skills and given talent.  The work is normally fast paced an can be physically demanding.  The employees work well together and treat the customers well also.
good,"Not many high school kids but more drama and alot of nepitism, and the employees tend to take just as much food as they sell, and they play off their responsibility to the new person"
good,"Very tolwrant, with the right crew your shifts can go amazing or a train wreck. Depending on store managers. Really fast paced, have to deal with a lot of people sometimes multiple ones."
good,"good work environment "
good,I liked working a Wendy all though it could use some better communication skills sometime crew members we not paying full attention to there specific job task
good,Good for a first job. They don’t give you enough hours at first but if you work there long enough your hours increase. You have to be able to work fast and not be stressed. It gets hot in there with a lot of customers.
good,"My owner is amazing, has worked with me to coach me. We have a flexible work environment with a very diverse culture. Paid training hours. Learn while having a relaxed work day."
good,The typical work life scenario at Wendy's restaurants consists of the expected hard work and hurriedness of a normal fast food restaurant. Great staff and amazing co-workers.
good,"Perfect summer for after school job for students high school or college. "
good,"When the time when the business get really busy, the service is really slow because typically there is only one person doing the burgers. But it is very clean like the front of the store. We as a cashier position it is our duty to make it clean."
good,Working at Wendys you have to wear black uniform and they train people on different stages but you’ll move around to different areas every day you come to work
good,"I was the average fast food job "
good,"Food, people, culture are winners, consistency needs work, overall not a bad company to work for. If you are driven to succeed the pathway is there for you to grow with the company if they will listen to you."
good,A typical day is stressful and you need to work with others so it runs smooth. Management is amazing love them all. its not a hard job as long as you can work well with others.
good,"Decent pay for managers but a lot of hard work"
good,Wendy's is the type of job you should work if you're young and looking to make a good amount of money to have it in the bank. It's a good job to move up in but not amazing if you stay at the bottom (crew/part-time) for too long.
good,it was a good working experience although i did not as many shifts as i was willing to do. i learned a lot like how to work at a faster pace completing orders and satisfying customers.
good,Its an okay place if you just want to have extramoney but I would not recommend it for some one with angry problems. Its very stressful at times and the employees get on each others nerves a lot.
good,its alright but it gets very frustrating and tiring. i wouldn't recommend working there if you quit another fast food job unless its your first time working.
good,"Honestly, this job is difficult. Things would most often go from dead quiet to a near riot, and everyone is stressed during that time. But it is humbling, and the people working there are amazingly resilient. My main reason for leaving was because the work schedule was incredibly erratic."
good,"Maintain good customer service , stay stocked up . I would run the lobby . also keep it all cleaned up! sometimes I would bounce around to different positions but usually i’m assigned to acouple things"
good,It's very fast pace. Overall the day wasn't bad. The Manager I had couldn't control herself when things got hectic so she got hectic but if you can maintain a great attitude under a stressful event then it's not a bad environment .
good,It paid the bills but over time management became rude they don’t listen to the customers expect you to come on your off day if asked but the customers are very nice overall a doable job
good,"Whenever I came in for work, I mainly worked cashier in the window or sandwiches. So if I had to work window I would go get my draw and put my name under the draw so it’s all my responsibility to what happens in that draw. I made sure I had everything restock as fast as I could so I could just flow with my work."
good,Wendys is a fun work place...fast paced...easy to learn...very helpful...and a all around learning experience....management is great...a very clean and sanitized work place.
good,Very upbeat and high stress job. Customers are a joy to work with but others are really harsh. Team work is needed and cooperation with the leaders on shift. Could be a great job for some but terrible for others.
good,If you are young and just starting it would not be a bad job. But it will not pay the bills or make a living at it. standing over the grill all day is back breaking
good,Overall it was a fast-pasted work environment. It would've been much better if they gave raises. That would've made up for some of the stressful work days.
good,was a good place to work I miss it sometimes. I just couldn't work in a kitchen in the heat of the summer ever again. Id recommend this job to teenagers.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in on time, clocking in using my fingerprints, washing my hands and getting assigned to my position. I learned that fast food places aren't as easy as it seems, everything about it is fast paced, sometimes it feels like we're being overworked. Also some customers can be rude but we're taught how to handle it. Management was pretty good. The work setting was very diverse. The hardest part of the job would be drive through when there were a lot of customers and a lot of long orders that had to be taken and made. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we weren't busy."
good,It’s a great job to work at and meet new people learn new things show the managers that u had the skills n what it takes to work this position that u applied for
good,"working at wendys, it being my first job was not what i expected and do not expect of the work place. the immaturity and drama brought into the work place made it difficult to get certain tasks done within our time restraints."
good,Working at this Wendys in the beginning was a good experience then in the end it was okay could be better for my overall experience working here. The staff is somewhat nice and friendly but the management needs some better improvement. I asked to get a raise twice and they never gave me the raise so I Ieft and found a different job. If you are going to have employees work for you then you need to be paying them a good pay for their hard work.
good,We were often understaffed so the night crew (my crew) suffered a lot. Often times people would call out last minute and I would have to stay longer.i
good,My managers were very understanding. No hostile coworkers. Crew was treated fair at all times. Relaxed place to work with good pay and easy to get multiple raises.
good,I say the above statement because some there will yell at whoever is on a sandwich board if products run low or out even if that person was unaware due to just clocking in or even if they know have asked for it but it didn’t get put down. Then they yell even more when crew member tries to explain that they asked for product before break or right after clocking in to start the shift.
good,The work environment was unfair. I enjoyed doing my job and satisfying customers. I love wendys food. I liked interacting with customers keeping them happy. I like keeping my work environment clean and maintained time management and team work or getting the job  done on my own.
good,I learned to do things right the first time and made sure other employees and managers did the same.  Management team was right on it was fun to work here
good,"I had to be a cashier , keep the right money amount in draw at all times and keep lobby clean and also make sure restroom stay sanitize and stock with tissues and paper towel"
good,"It was relatively an okay job. With my extracurriculars, I had shifts that lasted the majority of the day. Fast food isn't really for me, I have learned that after this job, but it was good experience for the work environment."
good,"Wendy's was a great experience because while working I enjoyed my co workers and managers, although one of the busiest places we learned to keep positive attitudes and gave our customers great service."
good,This job field challenges you daily and helps improve skills in order to strengthen team members. This job has taught me many things and made me a strong reliable worker.
good,"The food was either so-so or good. The managers seem very stressed. I would not stick to this job for a long time. If you like having a base pay of 8.25, this job is right for you."
good,"I didn't like it too much, it just wasn't  for me. If you're into food service, by all means go for it. Pay is good, coworkers are usually friendly, customers can be iffy though."
good,Throughout the years Wendys invested a lot of time into my training and in the end I was groomed into a strong manager BUT unfortunately the majority of people you will have working for you as crew members will test your mental strength on a daily basis. The company demands a lot out of its top managers.
good,Working here is fun at times but is also very stressful due to rushes . Rushes are when people pile up all at once to order and it gets very overwhelming.
good,"Wendy’s was an overall great place for work. The job was very competitive. While being competitive, everything wasn’t always fast pace. You got a chance to learn the things you needed to know for the job."
good,"Wendy’s was my first job, and it’s okay for a starter job. Fast paced and you have to be okay dealing with rude customers on the daily. Management was really flexible with my schedule. No benefits besides half off 1 meal per shift."
good,"I only did evening shifts, which started at 6pm and could last anywhere from 2-3am. I learned how to work under high pressure and how to be a useful team member. The managers were all very nice and understanding. The workplace culture was relaxed when there wasn't a rush, and the hardest part of the job was washing dishes, only because it was gross. Most enjoyable part was working with multiple friends during my tenure."
good,"Began working here when I was 15 years old, the job was enjoyable at the start. It is a good place to have a first job, after every shift you accomplish many things and have a team to support you."
good,i really put my time and energy to this job because it really helped me pay my bills and made accomplish other stuff. the salary was nit what i expected but it did help me
good,Management can do better with managing their employees and customers . Management needs to be trained to have a better understanding with its employees and customers
good,"Faced paced, good crew to work with. Very flexible with hours and schedule. There was always opportunities to move up in the company, always pushing you to do better."
good,It was a very laid back job & very fun. Customer service was excellent . We had very friendly workers that’s what made it more relaxing . Everyone got along well !
good,My experience at Wendy’s was very good. I like what I learned from working there how to properly take people’s order. How to Stock up my station where I finsihsed up at the night. How to make and put food away.
good,It’s alot of fast moving but once your learn how to pace yourself you got it. It’s kind of stressful sometimes we don’t have enough crew members to help when it’s really busy. But overall it’s fast pace learning
good,"Working at Wendy's Taught me how to be more independent & to have patience with customers. Make fresh food & nothing less. Communicate with customers , let them know to be patient. Clean after all the customers & to make sure the store is clean at all time."
good,"The Wendy's store I worked for had an excellent fair manager. However, I was not satisfied in working for minimum wage. I also want a position that has benefits"
good,"I loved the shift manager, she made everything fun and the way she explained daily activities made my work a lot easier. I was a sandwich builder and during my time there I made my way to become the best at it."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wendy's and definitely still miss it at times.  The days go fast and you're always doing many different things.  It can at times be difficult to get more hours though, you need to know many positions for additional hours really, the more you know, the more secure you are in position.  I'd heavily suggest expressing repeated interest in learning positions that interest you."
good,"When I first started Wendy's it was great , great employees,and great managers and then the original mangers left the store started to go down hill, people stated showing up for work less and less and the new manager does not really keep with with the store or employees but we have our good and bad days."
good,"It's not a hard job, it's fast paced and easy to pick up! Flexible hours! It provided chances to climb up the ladder as well, I did not pursue those chances though since I was going to college."
good,The job was laid back to me. I was being giving hours. It was an easy job to me being that it was my second fast food job. The only thing was finding transportation home getting off early morning.
good,It was always a good day because of the people I learned to move fast and stay dedicated at ever thing u do the management was ok but could have been better and the environment was tight spaced and the hardest part was not having anything to do and the most enjoyed part was cooking on the grill.
good,"For 7.25, you’re basically doing the managers job minus the paper work. Coworkers consistently depend on you to do everything when they feel they have too much to handle."
good,I learned a lot while working at Wendy's. It was very fast paced environment. I was trained as a manager and was able to use the skills I learned in other areas of my life.
good,overall the job is easy a typical work day was a six hour shift most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with other team members in a friendly work environment and a flexible work schedule
good,"Everyone had to work as a team, might not work the same position everyday and a person do not just work one area, the mangers was friendly and try to help the workers, and working late night every weekend."
good,it was nice working at Wendy's. Employees were nice and very helpful. The job is not very stressful but its a place where you have to work fast and effectively.
good,"Cleaning the restaurant, cooking food, working with co-workers, taking out trash to the compactor, cleaning dishes, helping and assisting customers with what they need."
good,Learnt a lot of new skills that i could take onto the future with me. Great environment and excellent safety necessaries. Had a lot of fun and got to experience things id never expect to.
good,"After a while there, I did everything there. I made the sandwiches, took the money, cleaned, also laid meat to get cooked. I had got used to everything."
good,"I was the go-to-guy when something needed to get done. No one else would share the load, and I was stuck with multiple positions. We had trouble with people showing up, and we were usually short-staffed."
good,I liked working in the fast food area. It gave me a chance to interact w/ different people & deal w/ different  scenarios. It helped me to improve some of the skills I needed to work on. And put me in an environment to work all kinds of different people
good,I just want to say that company provide good opportunity for job but their is less job security which means that when the season is low you will not get more work their.
good,The management isn't the best. I think hard workers should be able to get a raise soon. I am a salad opener so I work from 7-3 typically but most days I stay ;longer. I prepare salads for that day pan and tray bacon and clean kitchen. When we open at 10 I work the front register and assist on other things throughout work day.
good,It was very fast and hectic. Had to do a lot of work due to lack of work on previous shift. Definitely don’t get paid enough for the amount of work I do.
good,"It was a fun workplace, I enjoyed working with my co-worker. Such a friendly workplace where I am able to work nicely with my co-workers and to my costumer. I’ve learned how to multitask which is a great skill to possess. The management has been so good to me so far, they just gave me the right hours that I needed."
good,Shift leader/trainer training new employees on all food stations and customer relation issues.  I enjoyed training everyone the hardest part of the job was not always having the necessary equipment to train with.
good,very stressful place to work. No one wants to work together and stay on topic .It is ok as a crew member but as manager it is really rough because no one listens. The employees don't want to work and do there job.
good,When I first started it was just opening back up as corporate. The management was great to work for.  They will helpful and understanding. They also took a lot of pride job
good,"It was a great first job to have, I actually got to learn a few things while working in a fast food restaurant. Once the manager changed and we got a new one, I never learned anything other than cooking the fries or working the front cashier. I didn't work a whole lot because of school and sports but some days I would only work 2-4 hours a day and I didn't have my license when I started this job and they used to send me home because there would be too many people already working and they told me just to go home. I never worked all my hours in week."
good,I enjoyed working there. The people that came through the drive thru or cashier that I was working at were always super friendly to me. The workers and management there were fair and reasonable and I got along with most of them.
good,It's just a nice and relaxed place to get you started in the work force. This place will teach you skills that you can apply to other jobs in your future. It will make it so you have better social skills so your not so shy around strangers.
good,The job was easy I'm a people person so talking to customers wasn't hard nor was serving them.  I only left because I had to move from Spartanburg to Greenville.
good,"I did not get paid a fair wage.  Many customers treat you like the dirt on their shoes.  It is a very demanding job.  I did not like working there because I had to put more time into work than school just to make a livable wage, and even then I was living paycheck to paycheck."
good,"Great Place for Career Advancement in Management. There were many long hours. Employee turnover was very high, we were always training someone. Poor Management. The management did not seem to care and that caused a trickle down effect to the employees. Hard to keep good help when management does not care about the business."
good,"It was really fast paced, I didn't like making sandwhichs at all but it was okay. My assistant manager was a rude person which is why I quit nothing about the company itself."
good,Wendys was a pretty good job the people were nice and respectable and I usually go along with everyone the managers were very understandable if you needed help they would help
good,Being an opening manager at Wendy's was a good experience for me. It showed me what I was capable of and what I can get done in a timely manner. I think the managers should get paid more then they do because of the amount of work they do.
good,"works  place  was  okay  ,  pay  is  not  the  best  to live  off  of  . Pretty  good management .  Not  enough  work  hours .     Environment   was overall positive ."
good,I personally enjoyed my time at Wendy's. Although stressful at times it was a very friendly work environment and everyone got along very well. There were some minor problems working here but overall i enjoyed the average work day.
good,good first job for someone just starting off getting a job. a lot of food taking orders was the hardest for me . management was decent . you deal with all type of people
good,"Wendy's is a very relaxed and fast paced work environment. Security at the Wendy's I worked at had no security cameras, so I didnt feel safe at all times. The one thing I loved most about the job were the co-workers that I had worked with."
good,"My manager was decent, my coworkers were fun, and the culture focused on getting the job done while still having a good day, but the rush periods and the constantness of them, the lack of challenge with the actual work involved, etc just soured what was otherwise a decent job for me. I'd recommend a job like this if you're a teenager or just someone looking for a filler job, but it's just play"
good,Its very calm but crowded uncomfortable area to be in small work space. Fast surroundings and a lot of customers. Very well organized and put together
good,"Wendy's, being a fast food restaurant, means it is a fast paced environment and can cause stress. I learned how to hone my multitasking skills and the hardest part of the job really depends on the kind of person you are."
good,It is easy to progress through the Wendy's company if enough effort and care is put in. They are willing to work with you and help you excel towards your goals.
good,I liked working at Wendy's. I moved upstate so I had to quit but personally I think it was a decent place to work especially for high school students.
good,The work place had a fast pase atmosphere. Crew members often work together as an unit coming as one to accomplish daily goals. General management was continually disrespectful while governing the other supervisors and team members.
good,"To gain you basic job mentalilty, I would reccomend this job. Not the best working conditions at times, but build the right charecteristics to procced in the carrer field."
good,"Temporary job, paid $10/hour. Easy fast paced work environment. Typical fast food job. Enjoyable coworkers friendly/family environment. Provides opportunity for career advancement and new learning opportunities."
good,"Wendy's Manukau store is one of the busiest in South Auckland, so that environment gave me a lot of practice in managing stressful situations at work. Also. it made me more proficient at multi tasking, and following strict procedures/guidelines. I enjoyed working in a team environment, where collaboration is required. It was fun, and the team was just like one big family."
good,"Co workers were great to get along with, workday was busy some days, slow others.  Customer base was friendly. Location was in a college city, security and parking was good."
good,"Even as a high-school student, this job definitely did not pay enough for the amount of stress and problems that arise. At the time, it was too difficult to handle being a high school student and working a full-time job."
good,busy work place really fast paced at times and relaxed some of the time I would recommend to others to work there o wouldn't mind going back to work there myself
good,I liked how the co workers loved to help out and make sure that the job was done correctly. And the work environment was fun and the management was okay.
good,good job but the manager unprofessional and rude at times can be a bit over bearing. very fun and energetic place of business at times as long as the manager (GM) is happy
good,I started when I was 16 and everything was alright until I realized I was being under payed ! Minimum wage was $7.75 at the time and I started at $7.25.
good,"This company understands that their employees are people, and treats them with respect.  If not for the late hours, and lowered salary caps, I would not have left."
good,"Wendy's was a amazing place to work at. I loved working there, the management was amazing, great workers. overall was a great place to work at. There were some days when it was hard to work, once a couple of people didn't show up without telling the managers so we had to do 2 jobs at once."
good,Overall it was fun to work. It was not said to be a job where I am looking for a future in. It was my first part time job in Canada. The management was really poor but they made sure we are comfortable to work with
good,"This job is great for kids in high school or people in management positions. From my experience management walks all over you. Pay was lousy and there were no raises, not even after two years of employment. I eventually left because I was sexually harassed and no disciplinary action was taken"
good,Wendy's was my first job. I didn't know I was going to stay there for 5 and a half years. It did teach me a lot about management and business but I did not like the hours. Wendy's closes at 1am and that took a toll on me.
good,This environment you always learned how to maintain a quick speed but manage to hold together the upkeep of the store and deliver great customer service.
good,It was a learning experience on fast food and customer service. I went from cook cashier crew trainer crew leader . So it was good as it get when managing a fast pace environment.
good,While working here there was no good teamwork at all. I did have a problem with their cooperate office . I wasn't payed for 3 pay periods when I first started so that stopped me from having money and basically working for free. My I received my first check from them on my card was $994.
good,"It a great work place. Payrate is low. You different material.  How to make sandwich, cooking food, running grill and prepping food for morning shift."
good,Well management was rude and disrespectful to workers and employees. Management would sell things that were past there date and remove dates from other products.
good,Working at Wendy's I was just getting into going to work . I did not live close to Wendy's witch made it harder to get to work this is why I didn't stay long as I did not have a licence.
good,"Very fast paced work environment, sometimes very stressful.  Company really after attaining the store manager position has not much room for advancement."
good,Wendys is a fast paced work environment that relies heavily on teamwork and efficiency. There are a variety of positions you can work which ensures that your days don't have to be the same everyday
good,How can they fire someone after 15year's of service based upon someone saying you cursed at them but found out all if it was not true we were better as a corporate store once the franchise people took over they only thing they care about is money
good,"always stay busy "
good,I learned about closing grill open grilling making sandwiches working cashier. Doing drive thru window. I learned bout the fundraising about Wendy. And why they call its Wendy
good,"rushes during lunch time, rushes at dinner including when there were sports events or festivals but with teamwork and communication they are no problem at all.  the worst parts of the day were the lulls in between those sparks."
good,"I think working before Wendys was okay. I likes my coworkers a lot more than the job itself. It wasn't a bad environment, overall it was relaxed and fast paced."
good,"Started off working for Miami Management in 1999.  Was a very good company with great benefits and flexible hours.  Company was sold to muy hamburgers May 01, 2017."
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's would be getting a headset then heading straight to the drive-thru to stock the area. It would usually go by fast as long as it was a consistent line of customers coming through the drive-thru. I learned how to correctly greet a customer on time and provide excellent customer service. The head of management, I only seen twice while working there. The workplace culture was very friendly and open-minded. The hardest part of the job was when we had sport teams come in, but it still wasn't that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers. They were rarely in a sour or bad mood, which also made the day go by smoother."
good,"Be prepared to work quickly. It's a great place to work if you're looking for the bare minimum pay. You will become close with everyone that you work with during the heated rushes, so this is nice. They often encourage you to be good at all cook stations. The people are always great except the customers, that's just how it is with this line of work."
good,Wendy's was a fun place to work at and everyone got along well and pushed service time frequently but sometimes the schedules would screw someone over or never worked with them
good,A typical day at Wendy's Might Stars off a little busy with the morning Rush but is manageable I learned how to make sandwiches something but I didn't know how to make before
good,"Always have a positive attitude "
good,Good work place and managers. The hardest part is being fast paced. There was always something to do and got stressful at times but overall the people are nice and workload is balanced
good,"A typical day at work would start with me signing in and then being assigned a position like dishes, or front register, or bagging, or fries, or sandwiches."
good,"It was a good temporary job but I needed a job with more hours and a different work environment. "
good,it is a great place to have your first job learn how to work with people and grain work experience your always on your feet and you only get a ten minutes break after four hours of work
good,I started working for wendys when I was 16 years of age I started as a sandwish maker and worked my way to cahsier once my mother got sick in 2012 I stop working as much
good,"Great work environment "
good,I was a manager at Wendy's Fallout 4 5 or 6 years I really did like it and travel I had benefits it was pretty good pay vacation my people that went under me was good I like wasn't a Wendy but the test was hard
good,A typical work day at Wendy's was fast paced and hectic.  I learned to deal with unruly and impatient patrons.  The management handled employee hours unfairly.  The work environment was pleasant.  The hardest part of the job was wondering if my paycheck would be correct.
good,"Wendy's is a good work place for someone looking for a first job. Wendy's strive for fast service and great customer service. If you do a good job there great at giving you a raise, but expect to be on your feet at all times and the only time you are not moving around fast is on you break."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is all bout smiling and making the customer feel welcomed into the establishment. It is sometimes a busy day which causes stress all over the place. What I learned from working at Wendy's is giving the best customer service you possibly can.
good,"the workers are great, we all have fun working we all get the job and we also meet some great customers., the hours okay but pay could be better because its not money for all the work we do there."
good,"I enjoyed my time there training young people it was fun there also enjoyed regular customers, started working there when I was 17  advanced pretty quickly it is very fast pace environment"
good,"It's an okay experience, the hours are very flexible and the managers are relatively nice. We run out of a lot of things and people tend to call off work at the last minute."
good,Keeping up with the pace of the customers flocking into the store lunch rush party bus and sports teams. Those are all great influx of customers I really appreciate having a lot of tasks because not everything needs to be more than an action.
good,"There were Many slackers and many in need of getting laid off, but overall, the company was okay. There were the people who always worked, and thereally were the people who never worked, but we all get paid the same."
good,"I worked there for over a year, and the upper management wasn't that nice to the shift manages and the benefits of becoming a manager was not worth it."
good,"Not a Bad Job for Extra Cash. Not Enough for a Living."
good,"As an employee at wendy's the responsibility was to assist customer, communicating with  customers making sure the food is well cooked and that the customers feels comfortable."
good,"Wendy's is a fun and good place too work at but sometimes crew members dont work as a team like there sapost to. Everyone just sits around and do there own thing there very disrespectful,very nasty attitude just all of above."
good,"My day working at Wendy's consists of Opening the store ,  counting the safe setting up the registers , counting inventory . I set up the employees into position. The hardest part of my job is associating with customers and some employees as well . The most enjoyable part of my job is managing different areas ."
good,"for a first job, for someone with no experience about what the meaning of having a job is then wendy's is your best obtion. but remenber this is a multytasked job, so your don't have an specific duty. you will have to do everything at wendy's"
good,It was fine in the beginning I just needed to Branch out and do something else. Not enough hours and too demanding for  min wage. You burn yourself out quick .
good,"A typical day at work would be constantly moving around. From time in to time out, there is never a slow moment. You will always be working. Being a manager makes you strive for higher advancement within the company. The hardest part about working for Wendy's is being short handed. The best part is getting to know your customers and regulars."
good,"The fast-food industry is the very fast pace work and a test of ur patients because you are constantly dealing with customers. Working at Wendy's really tested my abilities and learn a lot of great skills that use in my other jobs. However, it is difficult job for someone in school but it can be rewarding experience"
good,"While working at the airport Wendy's I learned how to handle my first real paying job. Some of the managers were rude but overall the people and the coworkers are the best part. You really become a family when your together for so long, you lean on each other and help when it is needed."
good,"A typical day consists of assisting customers with their purchases."
good,"Loved working there, the food was great and the crew was amazing. You learn alot of stuff working there, like how to work as a team and How to execute tasks properly and efficiently."
good,"Wendy's has a very friendly and positive working environment."
good,Slowish late afternoon but very busy at mealtimes always trying to have something to do. I would constantly have to be running all over the place frying and cooking all the meats and making sure there was stock. I learned to be productive. And eating the food was most enjoyable and closing in the middle of the night.
good,"My experience working at my 1st job i realized, they were very hardworking and worked hard together for being such a diverse group. i met many Great role models of leadership."
good,I had to take orders pack the food and get it out in a certain amount of time. I also was put on making sandwiches and dropping fries and nuggets also.I had to stay and close on weekends and they worked with me while im in school.
good,The quality of food served at Wendy's is great. The food is all fresh and prepared with caution. The store is clean and well maintained. The training is very organized and informative.
good,This is a typical fast food job with poor management. It is an ok job for a high school student. The work hours provided are inconsistent and the work experience is poor.
good,"Hard work and long hours, learned how to multitask great, keep up with money and books, help me learned to manage time, space, and money. Gave me a great first job opportunity."
good,"Some of my coworkers were irresponsible, so it became pretty normal to pick up slack. On the other side of the coin, I had some fantastic coworkers who were more than willing to help me out when I was left with a  lot of extra work from somebody whose shift preceded mine. Most of the managers are really great, if not a little rude. Given that, I've experienced far worse in the past and Wendy's has been the most comfortable work place that I've had thus far. There's nothing about this job that stood out, but closing the dining room may have been the most difficult part due to the time and procedures required to do it well. Overall, I did enjoy this experience and I met a lot of cool people. I love working with people, and I had some fun regulars."
good,"I couldve stayed but they cut my hours to 20 an less. The best part about the job was communicating wit guest ,meeting new people also helping when there is a problem. An seeing the guest smile wit the help of me"
good,"Wendy's is a great place to choose to sit down and eat with friends or family. Wendy's always serves with a smile and always makes sure the meal is great. There is no problem with Wendy's, I just did not agree with the way I was treated. I had to work an entire month before a friend and I were payed. I was only 16 and was being overworked on school nights when I told I'd be let off earlier than the time I actually did get off."
good,"My time working at wendys wasnt too bad overall , but when it came to certain things far as advancement or pay raises is that i barely saw those which was a little frustrating after my first year there."
good,I learned good communication skills while working here. It is a very fast paced environment and you have to be on top of things at all times. I didn't want to work here anymore because they don give raises and they don't have benefits.
good,"A typical work day would be fast-paced, crowded at times, and busy. I would clock in, get my job for the day, if i worked the register for the day i would count the money for it."
good,"Work was what you'd expect, taking orders, making drinks, cleaning up when the dining room got dirty. I learned how to cook the food there, and proper food safety. It was alright, nice place to work."
good,"This workplace had some serious management problems. Some of the managers were so incredibly authoritarian that it made work unpleasant and caused a lot of employees to lose respect for the job and the company, while other managers did very little which lead to some serious motivation problems. Despite all this, I still enjoyed working there because it allowed me to interact with customers and coworkers."
good,There can be different things you have to  do that your not used to doing and it can be really difficult and different people that you have to communicate differently with
good,It was very busy and I would work really long. considering I was going to high school and to the college it was just to much for me. Considering the time I started it was very busy. I got along with all the crew members.
good,"a typical day at work busy, even though it's more enjoyable coz we now we get the highest sales , i learned a lot in this company how to handle a store and to improved more my self-confidence, to mingle to other people. the hardest part of my job in winter time doing the inventory inside the coller and also order taking in drive-thrue,"
good,"Wendy's use to be amazing. I devoted myself to them for years. However the new company they sold to has no idea what they were doing and tried to cut managers pay and hours, that doesn't work well with people so I left."
good,What I learned from this job was too never give up no mater how hard or busy the job may be. What I liked most about the job that we were very busy so there wasn't no reason for you to be siting around not doing nothing .
good,"Customer service fail to increase positively due to work environment. I do believe if the company supported the workers, including managers, they business would prosper endlessly. It is very hard and much pressure working in poor conditions or having to make things ""work""."
good,"When it comes the having the best fast food around, Wendy's is the place to be. Because of that exact reason, customers will go to Wendy's more often than a few."
good,"During my time at Wendy's, I have to say that it was a fairly acceptable work place to work at. The employees got along with each other the managers did there job, and the customers that we have were reoccurring."
good,tbh i dont want to tell people about my experience because it wasn't all that good but i haven't worked there in a year so things may have changed....
good,"My typical day at work is spent inside one of our restaurants developing and training the managers that we have. Our environment is challenging, fun  and Guest focused. My role in leadership is to continually inspire and challenge General managers to run better restaurants. Keeping environments light hearted and fun with the intention of treating every guest like your best friend. While not always easy, watching people grow from the crew ranks into management has been a great source of pride for myself. While leading these 6 restaurants, I have learned from others just as much as I have taught. The Hardest part about something new would be leaving behind all of the great relationships I have forged."
good,I liked all my employees but management was very unorganized when it came to working on my shift some were very disrespectful cleaniess was an issue no breaks
good,"It took three jobs in the food industry for me to realize that maybe food-server just isn't the line of work I need to be in...and, as the say in ""America's pastime"": three strikes and you're out."
good,A nice work place with team effort a well kept place ...about tips they give u tips but the question is can u keep them when hey offer it to u but other then that its easy at times except sundays get packed but u will manage
good,"As a manager I have always been on the front line, other managers believe that they should sit in the office, I did not agree with this strategy"
good,"Doesnt pay well enough to support anyone but a minor in school. These kinds of jobs could be made to better suit a reliable working adult. In the absence of hours and pay, they run through employees like water."
good,lade back work environment everyone worked together which made it easier to accomplish the goal when we did get busy. always well maintained and had pretty much everything we needed
good,I use to work with some nice and fun people. nut all of sudden the management team wasn't doing their job like they were when I first started. I knew it was time for me to move on and find better options.
good,I despise environments where the average worker is treated as a robot.  I did not like Wendy's due to the customer-worker relationship as well as the lifestyle and culture.  Management was decent but overall just not a place to grow.
good,By it being so busy  all the time it keeps you on your toes and moving constantly that ull never be bored or be without anything to do while you are there. It makes time go by fast too.
good,If you ever worked fast food it is not for everyone but someone is got to do it. Pay is low and moving up to shift supervisor pay was an increase of one dollar.
good,"This job is pretty easy and it's not quite hard to move up in the ranks. Not many benefits to working besides food though. I learned most of the products and important hold times within my first week. Management is lenient and understanding. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the monotony, the menu isn't as glamorous as McDonald's so the excitement of it gets old fast."
good,"It's a job. it can be a lot of work, but it can also be fun if you get placed at the right store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, but you get some really nice ones too."
good,It was a good learning experience but never again! The manager made me sweep leaves in the parking lot with a broom while there was a line o customers outside.
good,"Overall, it was pleasant working for Wendy's. I would be on the grill for the most part, but interacting with customers was my favorite. I was constantly occupied and all of my coworkers were the kindest. The most challenging part of the job was having to sometimes do others' work."
good,A typical day at work would consist of being told what position I would be covering after clocking in. Then jumping on that position and covering the position's responsibilities.
good,"Very tough keeping restaurant staffed, a typical day was trying to run a good lunch shift and try to get everything required to do before end of day. I've learned multi tasking, working at a fast speed. The most enjoyable part of the job is my employees, they're like my family."
good,Overall good company. Learn great recipes and new skills. Entertaining and great set of customers & employees. Great employee appreciation as well. Great company
good,"Working for Wendy's was an ok job for making a little extra money to take care of some other important things. I wouldn't recomend it as a career job, but it is a good starter."
good,This location i worked at was one of the best wendys stores ive been too. All the employees were all hard workers and all had great customer service to our guests.
good,"Fast pace and family oriented and giving great satisfaction to the consumer and great training for staff."
good,the crew is fun and very welcoming. We have good work environment. Fast pace job. Push you to be your best. We communicate well and enjoy the time we spend together.
good,"Great company, great food, the shifts are not brutal and opportunities always at hand . Wendy's has great values and strives to be one of the greatest fast food restaurants there is ."
good,"I worked many hours at a very fast pace, which was understandable being that I was one of the opening employees at my location. I often got overtime. They push you a lot to be fast and precise in this job. I had a decent relationship with management, but not everyone had that same experience. Schedules and breaks were some common issues. You can't be afraid to get a little dirty sometimes in this job. And no food isn't free, but you get half off for lunch breaks."
good,Wendy's is a workplace where sometimes one can get annoyed of doing the same things over and over. Working in the kitchen is the hardest thing to do and least paying too.
good,Fast and on point work place very challenging and a multitasking job. Must me good on working under pressure and on ur feet.
good,Wendy's is a good place for people that like to help customers and handle food. They teach young adults how to hold a job and work effectively as a team. It has allowed me to build great relationships with other people to whom I am still close to.
good,It's an okay job to learn about responsibility but really great to experience customer services and how to control your opinions when dealing with customers. Not so great on management skills though.
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and the management is amazing, but the advancements only seem to be for managers, and getting a raise or even more hours is harder than they make it seem"
good,Is great place. The owner is really nice and caring boss. The customers are great. The crew becomes like a second family.
good,"On a typical at work, we would do our jobs correctly and have fun while doing it. While i was working there, i learned that you have to pay attention to the every need of the customer and you must do the job correctly.the management was nice and proper. However,  just has anyone in any business, they made their fair share of mistakes. my co-workers were probably the biggest group of people i had ever had the biggest pleasure of working with. the hardest part of my job was taking out the garbage at night, especially if it was storming. the most enjoyable part of my job was closing time and when i first went on my shift."
good,I believe of you stay with the company you can advance quite fair. I believe they need to update their training and have a more consistent program for training employees.
good,"A typical day at work was a very busy service with a lot of customers. Some days I would have to work back window which includes cutting bacon, baking the bacon and the potatoes, taking orders sometimes, and also taking cash and doing the dishes. Most of the time I would be in front drive-thru making the customers drinks and taking their orders and sometimes taking cash as well. I would coordinate the food a lot, too."
good,"my typical day at work was me helping and greeting customers , making sure everything was clean and safe for customers to come in and enjoy a meal after either a long day of work or just lunch ."
good,"The job itself isn't really hard its just the management was pretty bad when i worked there. I learned how to communicate well with others and how to work while rushed. My co-workers were fun to work with and made it more fun. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, but it was worth it in the long run. The part i loved the most was the discount on food."
good,"There will always be a rude customer complaining about a problem that probably never existed just for a free meal. So if you don't have patience, just call a manager."
good,"A typical day at work would be busy, I open 5 days a week and prep food, after we open up at 10am around lunch we would get busy everyday, it would be our lunch rush. I've learned how to prep food, make salads, cut and prep bacon onto pans, the management is great would help me out whenever I would get stuck on something, they are polite. All of my co workers are nice and always have something to tell me everyday, either its about school or what happened at home, they are nice. The hardest part of the job is having patience with the customers, even more working nights, because we are open until one in the morning. I love waking up everyday to prep food I enjoy it, I love how much I've learned about it ."
good,over all it was a pretty inadequate job. I felt like working there was not the best move for me.. I wanted to make more money than they were willing to give me.
good,I did not think that it was a place to stay for to long.I stayed to long and should not have.There was not a lot of chances to move up past GM.
good,"Very time demanding, how to attain time goalsTo work with others as a team. The management was pretty fair,The hardest part of the job was the time goals.The best part of the job was meeting new people and making my customers Happy!"
good,Work with food at a fast paste. Typical day is when we are always busy and move to different positions during the day. I learned how to manage time and work under pressure. Management helps when we were busy and tell you what you need to do. Co-workers have to work as a team. The hardest part about this job is working different positions at the same time in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part of this job are meeting new people and customers.
good,Unattainable expectations. Life work balance not good.  Subordinate managers don't get paid enough to care.  No regular sleep pattern due to hours and phone calls at all hours.
good,"Working for the company was fine, it was some of the in-store management that you have to watch out for. Most of the management is great and will work with you on almost anything you need help with. There is definitely a lack of professionalism with a few individuals, but if you can deal with that, this is a pretty cool place to work."
good,"I liked my co-workers and the management except they expected me to do way more than what I got paid to do. I would close and the manager, and the other two employees would just leave me there and there would be a lot of customers. But I'm happy it was one of my first jobs because it taught me how to be a hard worker."
good,"As you could expect from a fast food company the work wasn't glorious, the pay wasn't great and sometimes the hours were long. But as the title says the real satisfaction was the people I met and the friendships I made. Not just co-workers and management, but regular customers who would come in and I would know them by name and order and we would have discussions about the on-goings of our lives. This was made even more apparent when I finally decided to quit and hearing how sad everyone (management, co-workers and customers) was when they heard about it. All in all was glad that I worked there"
good,"While the staff was exceptional, the management was not efficient nor considered the needs of employees. The pay was minimum and the hours were long."
good,"-flip burgers "
good,"wendys is a nice flexible place to work at with friendly managers , but also stressful to a fault. a great experience working there."
good,"It was a fast food restauraunt i worked at. busy during lunch and supper rush, but quiet for the rest of the day. i learned that they live up to their word when they say the meat is fresh never frozen"
good,"taking customers order and give orders out. Love to meet new people each day. Cleaning dinner room and restroom during shift,"
good,"A normal work day will be pretty busy.Things learned include: working on a team, basic cleaning, what being flexible means, etc. Many of my coworkers spoke Spanish, so knowing Spanish would be a boon. The hardest part would probably be dealing with many customers at a time. The job was most enjoyable when it was just cleaning tables, dishes, etc."
good,"A typical day as a shift leader was to either open or close the store. Customers were the number one priority and to go above and beyond to satisfy their needs. I learned to be a strong leader and a young independent adult, I thank this place for the work ethic I have learned. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with the rude customers, for me it wasn't a very hard obstacle to overcome you just have to learn to turn the situation around which usually turns out in your favor. Just because they made be mad and upset you need to take that into consideration and do your best to fix the problem. 9/10 you will in the end have a happy customer! The most enjoyable part of my job was running the show, I am very independent but also a good team member with those two traits combined I effectively ran good shifts and knowing your capable of doing your job is always a great thing."
good,"A typical day at work would usually be very busy for me, taking plenty of orders and making sure the dining area was clean. This job mostly taught me about how to deal with different people. The customers, as a whole, were easy to handle. However, my co-workers ranged from being just as nice and hard-working as me to not caring at all about their job and coming across as rude. Honestly, dealing with the latter was the hardest part of my job. Still, it was enjoyable whenever a manager or customer gave me a compliment. This was especially true for the last month of my employment where customers were saying that the store wouldn't be able to last without me."
good,I enjoy working at Wendys. I am the opener and I also unload truck.I am only seeking other employment for better pay. This place has really worked with me considering I have four sons. I work from 7am-3pm.
good,"A typical day at work for me was me coming into my shift having to clean up whatever mess was made from my replacement, then get straight to work, then take my 30 min break, then finish up my shift. I learned how to work the cash register, and use the frosty machine. My managers were ok but sometimes their attitudes were a bit much to handle and the same can be said about my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was having to stay after even after my shift was over due to people not showing up or never having a replacement. The most enjoyable part of my job was the discounts."
good,"A day at the Edgewood town centre Wendy's is normally a fast paced with all the business going on around the Edgewood area. I learned that good communication and precision is required in a fast pace environment. Management is pretty good for the most part. Co-workers exceed above and beyond with team work, relationship and communication. The hardest part of the job is staying focused with all of the guest traffic coming at you doing lunch time. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people; co workers, managers, guest, etc."
good,Younger employees so lots of gossip and management does;t do anything to curb it. wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
good,I worked the sandwich line or fried foods on any given day. At the end of my shift I would clean up and re-stock items. I learned how to manage my time better and how to work in a fast pace but still make the product acceptable. Management was good at Wendy's it was a caring environment. Co-workers came and go but also were good people and I enjoyed my experience with each one. There was no difficult or hard part to the job.I enjoyed making thew sandwiches.
good,I normally work in the window handling cash and passing out food. I prepare the drinks and sometimes the orders. I have learned to be very fast paced when it comes to money. I've also learned how to deal with a crowd of customers and rude customers. The management team is alright some are more professional than others.
good,"It's okay, its fast food so not the greatest job, it was good when i started but then we started to get new management and it was going down hill from their."
good,"good work environment friendly employees I liked the warm atmosphere and also loved the great food, excellent great awesome"
good,Wendy is a secure job as long as you want it to be. Easy but very fast pace as most restaurants are. Not much benefits and the management could be more professional.
good,"When I started at Wendy's I was trained to cook burgers, fries, chicken nuggets and fried chicken. always wash hands before and after handling raw meat, especially beef. make sure the work station is kept clean and sanitary. take out the trash when it fills up and restock the burgers before running out so you wouldn't fall behind. be polite and courteous to the customers at all times and handle a situation professionally and calmly."
good,Learn how to multi-task and do multiple things at once. Learning how to adapt to the different speeds of the work load. Have fun working with such enjoyable coworkers.
good,"Good employees are hard to come by. The ones that come and go are always the ones with sour attitudes, bad work ethics, and no team work."
good,"Paperwork, cooking preparing, making sure everything was ready to take care of customers needs."
good,working at Wendy's  taught me great customer service skills how to work in a fast pace environment it was filled with friendly employees management team was also great
good,"You get to meet some pretty interesting people in the workplace, but you will come across some customers that could be quite the hassle."
good,"I was able to grow in this company through many learning and experiences. This company has a lot of potential for people searching for a good company to work at. The people here are easy and fun to be with, they make your work enjoyable even though in reality, it is hard."
good,"A typical fast food place. It had its ups and its downs. Management was hit and miss, same with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was handling the stress.The most enjoyable part was the setscedul"
good,"assisting customers making sure they're satisfied at all times, making conversation with others, and had good friendships with co-workers and customers."
good,tenia buenos compañeros que me auxiliaban cuando era necesario me orientaban a pesar de ser un trabajo con mucha carga
good,one of the most enjoyable but unorganized at times place on earth. you can go from wiping down counters and chatting to constant work for four hrs
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of taking orders, making transactions, maintaining a clean and safe environment, promoting teamwork by helping others during down time/rush hours, and showing respect to my customers. My coworkers, management team, and I all worked well together."
good,I can see me working in a different and better location then the one i was working at before. I just wished it was a better environment for me. It wasnt to my liking.
good,"Work started off with me being thrown into thick of orders and customer complaints. For the most part I did not enjoy the craziness that followed when a line of customers came and then the stifling boredom that followed once there were no customers. It also sucked that while my co-workers were nice, I couldn't relate to the majority of them and just found their conversations boring. The only part I enjoyed was washing the dishes. That was it."
good,"a day at work was very busy some days "
good,"-Usually a fast paced environment."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working here. Of course there were some stressful times but it was a relatively easy job. Management were understanding as long and they knew you were doing your job to the fullest. If you showed initiative, moving up in the company was relatively easy. Co-workers were young. I learned a lot about management through my store manager and district managers. There's definitely a learning curve but well worth it in the long run. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the crew and other management rely on my for answers."
good,"The guest are very nice, you can visit them, and talk, it's a warm environment."
good,"Management is adequate, though their ""people skills"" could use a bit of sharpening. Work is always fast paced. Training could be better managed by scheduling adequate labor to allow for learning. Everything is not dreary though, as the workers tend to be good people who care about others genuinely."
good,"It is crazy. The coworkers are awesome and make the job fun. Especially when you close the restaurant at night. The management has improved immensely. There is a lot of improvement both managerial and cosmetic. However, it still has a long way to go."
good,"The Wendy's I worked at wasn't very organized. Our district manager was good but the crew members did not seem to respect him. The hours were unpredictable, and it was over all a stressful atmosphere."
good,hardest part of the job were room for growth. Co-workers and I made sure that the requirements of the job were set to be made. I enjoyed this job because it paid the bills when needed.
good,"I learned how to deal with money and customers here. The management here was awesome, they respected us as employees and they were laid back and fun. The hardest part of this job was dealing with customer complaints. The most enjoyable part of this job was who I worked with and the customers."
good,"At wendys uniform shop I was the stock runner, I only worked during the summer when I was off school or college. The other members of staff would serve and I would retrieve the stock from the various stockrooms unless it got busy then I would serve. Deliveries were every other day some which where personally ordered and the rest was replen for the stock."
good,Each and everyday I go to work I make my day very productive and worth while. I am a very happy smiley person. I love to learn new things everyday. I can easily catch on to things.
good,Working at Wendy was a great experience. It is a busy store and was managed relatively well. Learning how to adapt to the different customer volume levels and working with crowds has been incredibility useful. Working at Wendy's one will learn how to deal with various customer personality types and work in a high volume store. One will get many hours working at Wendy's if they so desire or if they want shorter hours that can easily be arranged. The managers are competent and excellent to work with.
good,while employed here a typical day was calm and smooth like maintaining our position doing out various tasks whether it was cleaning or stocking up and our managers were very good at handling their crew or team
good,"There is room for advancement but only because everybody quits within a couple of months. The pay is minimum wage at every position and the raises are terrible company-wide. There aren't that many benefits besides paid vacation after a couple of months. Like with any company, you are in control of shaping your career."
good,The managements are both great. Give awards and bonuses to their worker. It might be a place where you can see all people are in hurry but we still got time to be cool around customers and you will some skill from working here. The place is always neat and the service is good
good,"I was a crew member for Wendy's my job duties included cleaning cooking equipment, running the cash register and making food. My co-workers were alright lot of them like to call in. My manager was great! The hardest part about the job was being around the friers. The most enjoyable part was the contact with the customers."
good,"a typical day for me, i come to work open the store, set up all the resisters and then i start the opening process. first i begin  with prepping my lettuce for salads and sandwiches then i begin to make my 7 different salads. after that i set up my sandwich line for ready to serve . food"
good,"In a typical day, I come into work, I walk through the store and observe. I make sure that all tasks needed to be done have been completed. I will ask people to help get things caught up if anything needs to be fixed. I greet customers with a smile, and make sure they leave with satisfaction. We have a pretty good management team. Sometimes its hard to try to get our employees to cooperate, which is one of the hardest parts of being a manager. At those points I usually try to send them home and take on more responsibility for myself. I have learned to multi task and work at a fast pace. I also have learned how to work on a team. I've learned that making sure that the customer is happy is one of the number one priority. I've learned that while working and people get angry with you, you can not loose your composure, and do whatever it takes to make them feel better."
good,it was an interesting job i did everything fro the grill to the front desk to the drive through and also the fryer and stocking.
good,"Everyday was about the same, it started off slow but quickly became crowded and stressful. The hardest part of the job for me at least was cleaning the lobby area multiple times a day. The most enjoyable was clocking out and buying a nice hot fresh meal."
good,"-there's never time to rest, if you're standing still too long you'll get sent home because there's always that next rush to prepare for and you can never be ready enough"
good,Loved the employees I worked with. The management was alright. It was just stressful for me at the time. I wasn't ready for the responsibility that came for the job at the time.
good,A great environment to work at. Demonstrates the need for teamwork and helping of others in order to complete a task. Most enjoyable part of the job is providing customer service to the guest. Hardest part of the job is it's demanding hours as a manager.
good,"While it's not the most glamorous jobs, you'll make a check. Plenty of hours, decent people. Management was well oiled and smooth running."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and i learnt a lot. It was my first job and it was a good first job, i worked here for three years. You learn a lot about the service industry as well. We made good quality food and worked quickly. It was important to deliver good quality food to customers quickly. I also got better at preparing foods and doing odd janitorial duties around the restaurant."
good,"This company was fun to work for. I had learned a lot about food prep, opening and closing the store. Most of the people were great to work with. Also most of the managers were great to work for."
good,most part of the day took customers food orders. I also cleaned bathrooms and washed dishes...mopped floors...counted down money put in safe
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with. The extended hours were the only negative, loved the customers that came in was very proud of what I waas able to accomplish there."
good,"You have the opportunity to learn several different postilions which makes for good work ethics and experience."
good,General Manager makes the work environment hard to bear. There hasn't been any change to the way this store runs in 20 years. All the systems are very old.
good,"Everyone in the food line worked together very well. If we weren't busy up front we would help the other works in drive-thru and on the food line. I learned to work better with other team members and how to run a register, count the money in the register before and after my shift. The management was well worked out. If we did not have enough workers out front the managers who were working would come up front and help out. My co-workers and i worked very well together. If we had a disagreement then we left it at the door and continued on with work day as if we had no problems. I never let my personal life interfere with my business life. The hardest part of the job was if I were busy up front taking orders they would also want me in the back helping prepare food. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that later in the week everything I had done would be worth it considering all of the effort I put into doing my best."
good,good place you can move up quickly but the pay isn't there for what you have to do benefits are okay but you don't get them unless you are there for at lease 3 years
good,Wendys is a good place to work for first time job seekers and also people with different back grounds. A regular day at work would be fun and fast paced. Also stressful and slow depending on the day. I enjoy working with a few coworkers and managers because of how fast we can get things done. The most enjoyable part of my job is always making sure the customers gets everything they ordered accurate and hot.
good,It was no joke working these fast food fast night place on the 3rd shift we had to deal with many different type of people . Especially on the weekend but you also had your loyal customers that would come put a smile on your face.
good,Working well with others was the most important part of this job. When everyone worked together things ran very smooth. Also provided a great opportuinty to interact with customers.
good,Has its ups and downs but met a lot of good people. Someday's work loads were crazy but had fun with the people around me it made the day go by fast.
good,I was in charge of 5 to 15 employees at one time. I was in charge of running the shift and ensuring customer satisfaction. I was in charge of safe cash. I also did daily inventory counts and was in charge of ordering food needs for next week.
good,"Working at wendys was an amazing experience, getting me ready to get into the work world. I made amazing friends, and learned a lot of things about wendys and the work environment"
good,"A typical day at work; punch in, get my headset on, and get my drawer counted. Depending on the time of day I would either go up front or in the drive through. If I am in the drive through I would take the orders and money, when our lunch/night rush would come in I would be only taking money. When I am not at the drive through I get to wash all the dirty dishes and put them away when they are dry. After the rush I would either stay put and do the drive through or go up front. While I was in school I was mostly at the front counter. The front counter has money jobs that most would not think we do. My job is to take all the orders, gather up their food, help out in the drive through if needed. After that I make sure everything is stocked up in the front including the contents stand where the napkins and straws and all those goodies are. I also have to clean up after all the customers. To sanitary clean up on a tray I would have a white towel for all the tables and a blue towel for the seats. With a bottle of sanitary surface cleaner. My job is to also make sure all the glass doors and bathrooms are clean and stocked. At the end of the night my job is too clean the bathroom and vacuum the dinning room. "
good,"Fair day at work,learned a lot on Wendy's procedures, Management team has a lot of working to do they need to be more off a team player . crew will be more motivated if the management team will . Hardest part of the job is trying to get management team to work together not against each other. most enjoyable is working with my crew to achieve our goals for the day."
good,"Wendys was a great first job. It was a great experience getting to meet new people, and working with others.The hardest part of the job was when we would get a rush trying to stay on top of things for examples getting the meals to the customer in a timely manner to keep them satisfied.The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy by providing them with an enjoyable meal."
good,i would go in and walk in straight to the drive though  then proceed to put on a headset to take orders while making drinks. After a couple hours when the rush is over i would get a break. I then would continue to do the same things before the break until i leave
good,"working at Wendy was very fun, i learn some skills like communication skill and also how to welcome customers. my manager was a good and caring manager. i had the chance to work with some good coworkers."
good,"A typical day is stressful. I am a worker who cleans and works without supervision and when the majority of my crew does not help, so it gets tiring. The majority of the management is passive. The hardest part of the job is working on other coworker's responsibilities because we are also judged as a team for how we perform. With a crew that doesn't care about how the job is done, as long as it is done, the ones who do care, suffer from picking up slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is that once in a while, I have a crew that is excellent and we perform excellent with customer service and timing."
good,"i would just mostly deal with customers from a day to day basis "
good,"Flexible schedule, good support staff, great salary and benefits"
good,On a typical day it is slow there. Over the weekends however gets pretty busy and that is usually the time where people need to learn how to properly work in a fast paced environment. This place focuses highly on quality customer service and requires a lot of handling with customer complaints.
good,great learning experience in food handling received my SafeServ certificate while I was employed with the company. worked with a lot of great people there.
good,"typical day at wendys is easy going a less you get those one customers who are rude."
good,"Typical Day: Get to work, change into appropriate uniform, clock in, do whatever the management asks of me including cashier duties, grilling, sandwich making, mopping & cleaning up. "
good,"I was in high school when i had this job, so for that age it was a great job, never been much of a fast food person but i was fine with this job."
good,buen trabajo auque es un poco cansado ya que se trabaja extremadamente y no hay mucho tiempo de descanso por ser comida rapida bueno compañeros aunque casi ninguno no  nos llevábamos muy  bien con la gerente del turno de la mañana
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with and for.  Made it easier to accept the lower than standard wages.
good,Very fun at first getting hours and paying my debts off from the move to Visalia and bills. GM Hired too many people and now everyone's hours are cut hard! had 3 GM's within 3 months since June.
good,"prepping hot and cold food items, counting and dispensing cash\change, cleaning store and property, very fast paced!"
good,Fun to work but can only work so fast because how we had to do product freshly.
good,"-Really cool and fun managers."
good,great job for a teenager in high school they really worked with my school schedule and gave me a chance to become more responsibel.
good,typical day at work is slow until you get a mini rush round lunch time
good,"Everything was very fast paced so you had to make sure that you knew just what you were doing. I learned how to better get tasks finished in a timely fashion and keep it fluent as well. The management here could have been a little bit better but they did everything that they could to keep everything running smoothly at all times. Most of my co-workers here were hard workers but there were also many people that didn't really care to try and improve their skills. The hardest part about my job would have to be dealing with customers that would become angry, each angry customer needed to be calmed down in different ways so over time you learn better skills to solve it. The most enjoyable part was the customers that would come in on a regular basis because it was nice building new relationships with them and talking to them as well."
good,"It was easy work, short hours, plenty of staff. Maintained the surroundings of the restaurant, prepared food. Took orders from customers, handled money."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to get all my crew members ready for the busy rush that we always receive between the times 11am-2pm and 4pm-10pm. As a manager, I have a lot of responsibilities which include, talking to the guests, making sure they are happy and had a great experience at our store. Making the customers get that ""wow"" experience is our main focus. The hardest part of the job is to really discipline the workers. Sometimes they want to play around when its time to buckle down and get ready for the rush. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is to solve the customer issues. Say for instance, someone is upset because their whole order was made wrong. I love talking to them, sincerely apologizing to them, and making them happy by simple going out of my way to make sure it'll never happen again and replace what they ordered and more."
good,"Overall, as an Assistant Manager at Wendy's, my day was either really nice and easy and productive, or it was a hair-pulling out, stressful, horrible day.  There was no real in between.  My schedule was different every week, being as i had open availability.  It usually included one ""close-open"" which was where i would work a Monday from 3pm to 1 am Tuesday, followed by an 8 am Tuesday to 4 pm Tuesday.  At Wendy's, i developed my customer service prowess, as i was responsible for complete customer satisfaction, usually as the only manager on shift.  The management above me were generally alright.  That being said, some of the ways that they chose to handle certain situations really boggled my mind.  Overall it was hit or miss with them.  The managers that i worked with that were at the same level as me were great.  We worked as a team very well without the General Manager.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make all of the employees happy with the General Manager and with themselves.  I often found myself in a mediator type of role.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the pride on my team's faces after a really rough lunch shift that was run very efficiently and with focus.  I enjoyed motivating them to feel pride for their work."
good,my typical day was to come in and do what ever the manager told me to do. That could mean cleaning or that could mean making others sandwiches/ helping customers. I learned what a job meant and what it was like to follow a schedule. The managers were all very nice and were willing to teach anything if you wanted to learn. The co workers are still my friends to this day and are very nice people. The hardest part about this job was really nothing. Everything was very simple. The most enjoyable part of this job was the freedom i had and the fun that all of us had while working together.
good,"Great Place to work as a first job for young teens, not much more promise afterwards."
good,"Every morning except Sunday, there's a big lunch rush. I learned how to pick up my pace, be very patient and calm with people. The management was always ready and prepared which made the crew ready and prepared. The co-workers were very big on helping-hands. The hardest part was multitasking (3 things at once). The most enjoyable was having helpful co-workers."
good,"A typical day for me often times consisted of cooking food. I've learned about how teamwork contributes to the general overall progress of the workplace. I've had a wide variety of the types of coworkers I've encountered working here. You'll run across people who trying to just pay their bills, to people who really couldn't do much with life so they're stuck there, to young adults who are trying to become independent. Hardest part of the job sometimes was showing up and knowing what was to be expected. Most enjoyable part was....leaving honestly"
good,"On a typical day at work, things would flow pretty smooth. I have learned a lot from working at Wendy's; such as: preparing salads, working the register, learning to how adapt to different kinds of people, pretty much everything that covers the work life of a cashier.  The hardest part of the job is the people. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning more each day & my coworkers."
good,"Wake up extra early and started the day with co-workers that mainly kept to themselves. I learned many new things in cooking and preparing foods as well as working at a faster pace during the lunch hours of the day. The best part of the day was getting to eat my lunch and prepare it myself, while the hardest part was avoiding to getting burned."
good,"• Greet Customer"
good,"Great job, but management not always helpful. Short breaks, and not really a structured faculty."
good,"Making sure customers have everything they need."
good,as a cashier come in count down the register learn to do prep taking customers order. manager training available
good,"clock-in, look at what position you are at, if you are opening you must prepare product and product stations, preform daily objectives based on your position, management is very good at their job and not afriad to help with daily operations, co workers bring alot of drama, hardest part of the job is working with some one new, most enjoyable is the hours and fee food"
good,I would get to work about 11am. Then it will get busy around 12pm until 2. We will usually get about 2 maybe even 3 full serves. Then after 3pm its usually slow and we don't have to worry about to many full serves. I learned a lot at my job that customer always comes first and to be on work on time and take your job very serious. The coworkers were okay they did there job. Management was good. The hardest part of the job is when we don't have enough workers and we have a lot of full serves. The most enjoyable part is getting paid
good,"What I liked the most about the job is the friendly relationship between everyone at work. We can work seriously and also have fun when it is not busy. We often share funny stories and also our problems. We all willing to help each other and lend a hand during work. (Last time, before I went back to China, some of them asked me bring back badges with Chairman Mao’s portraits for them.) We are just like a big family. "
good,i been working at wendy's for about 4 years  now and i feel as though i need something i can look forward to waking up to dont get me wrong the hours are great but my bills need to get paid and i am not making as much as i'd like to hourly. i feel as though i need a job that can help me move on forward and not have to worry about the income.
good,It's a nice job but I need something better.  The pay is not substantial enough.
good,It can be sometimes busy. I make the sandwiches for the customers and bag their food up as well. I sometimes take customers food orders and handle cash transactions
good,Always fast paced with something new to learn everyday. I learned a lot about people and myself.
good,"A typical day at work is mostly relaxed, but fast paced. The mangers keep everyone on task to make sure everything gets done on time."
good,Don't have much to say as I only worked 1 day.  So far it seems like it will be a good place to work
good,"Wendy's is a fast paced work environment that requires much mental patience to stay calm in. it can be loud and multitasking is a must so focus is a key part of a day at work. though things can become stressful and the workplace is crowded and stuffy, it is generally a place that anyone can benefit from working at due to the skills you pick up while working as a team and harnessing your focus."
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Wendys, the employees were cool and the managers were professional and hard working so we all worked well as a team."
good,"i worked mainly in the drive thru as lead cashier, learned how to and improved  on multi-tasking.on busy days it keeps you on your toes. managers and coworkers  are good."
good,this is a job that could be a career if you have the patience to stay for a long while. this is a great starter job for anyone. this will show you the basic of how to maintain a good job and how to interact with lots of different people.
good,"Prepare customers food"
good,"A typical day at work was really hard. had to take care of customers. if i made a mistake i had to fix the problem by myself. i learn how to work hard, and that you need to be a really fast worker. i learned how to work. management was alright. my co-workers were really fun to be around but when we had to work we took it seriously. the hardest part of the job will be the customers. the reason why i say the customers is because if we mess up the order we must fix it before the customer starts a conflict with you. the most enjoyable day of the job was leaving and going home to your family."
good,"Work is okay, the usual rush to make food. Learned to communicate. Management is not too professional. The co-workers are friendly. The job isnt hard. There is not much too much to enjoy except networking."
good,The management was not understanding about schedule flexibility especially when it concerned school.
good,This was a place to start when I relocated to this area. Wendy's did not offer full time work for Crew Members and I needed a full time job. It was a fun environment and I got along well will my co-workers.
good,"I was hired as a cashier although employees gain experience in every facet of the business. My responsibilities included: providing excellent customer service, assembling food orders, and maintaining a sanitary work environment."
good,"Lots of cleaning, dealing with customers. You learn a lot on cash handling and team work great first starter job"
good,"•	Assist customers as front counter hosts"
good,A typical day was the same routine. i learned different was to work with different people. my co workers were ok. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the difficult customers. the best part was working with food
good,"My Co Workers Were Okay. We Got Along While Together For That Short Day. Some Slacked But Others Worked Exellent. My Managers Were understanding, Kind and Hard Workers. They Cared Than Most Do. The hardest part of the job was having to let the customers get their own way when they were at falt. Having to give away free food for their mistakes and wating time that could be healping out others. or having to deal with rude Customers who are just outrageous twars the workers. The part Of my job that i liked most would be clocking out and being able to go home to see my children. I also liked making customers and employees laugh when their not doing so well. A typical day at work for me would be taking oreders from people, remaking messed up ordes, cleaning bathrooms when able to. Stocking the foods that we went out in. At the end of the day having to count Registers and then recounting them."
good,all i did was flip burgers and make sure fries came up when they needed to some time u was busy others you had nothing to do
good,Management needs to get a clue.  Overworked and underpayed.  Long day and nights.
good,"I come in at 5 Monday-Friday I work as the cook dropping chicken, cooking chili, cooking meat patties, cleaning the stove the grill and closing down all required stations."
good,I very much enjoyed working there. But had to quit do to family medical problems
good,I'm a cashier at Home Depot and I have learn to control myself with customers that are not nice I have to be nice respectful and help customer with everything I can.
good,"Working with Wendy's is a very fast paced  environment, I worked in a very high volume Wendy's. I learned how to basically do everything there is to do from taking orders from customers drive thru and inside, to cashier, and putting orders together, bagging, promoting items, managing labor, giving breaks, working with dunbar, opening restaurant and closing, supervising 7+ employees, filling out paperwork, disciplining employees, reading the reports."
good,"Busy during the lunch rush, very easy job to perform. Management is fair, benefit is good once you put in a year or so."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's. My co-workers were more of my age and plus my best friend and I worked together.
good,"A typical day at Wendys starts off with taking orders from customers in the drive through. While no one is ordering through the drive through I am responsible for panning bacon, doing dishes, stocking the condiments, and cleaning projects. I learned that every customer matters and a smile is always important, along with a positive attitude. My co-workers are very nice and never fail to help out. The hardest part of working at wendys is the pure pressure. The most enjoyable part is getting the paycheck, visiting with co-workers, and making the customer happy."
good,I worked for this company because it worked around my schdule
good,Typical day at work included cooking and cleaning. I learned to work harder to earn more. the management was alright. They were too pushy. My co workers were great and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was not burning the burgers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers.
good,"I did not enjoy working for Wendy's. Although, I did learn how to communicate better with customers and my co-workers. The things I did not like about this job was the fact that there were always substitute managers. I was looking for a place with a steady manager and this was not it. I feel they did not follow rules very well either. The hardest part of this job for me was not being able to get trained on a lot of the stations due to no permanent manager being on the job. What I enjoyed for the most part was getting to know my co-workers and feeling accomplished when we were in a rush."
good,I have been here for awhile and there isn't much advancement in hourly wages.  Very flexible schedule!
good,"Food Prep, good work flow, easy to get along with co-workers and customers"
good,"My days usually varied between two choices: Either I was left standing around with nothing to do, or I was all over the place because we were packed. Either way, the days were mostly enjoyable. I was happier when we were busier. Most managers and co-workers were a blast to be around, but the entirety of the store was unorganized when concerning scheduling."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 8AM with the maintenance of equipment for store opening at 10:30AM. After which, I work as at the grill or at the fries (sometimes both), and at the end of my shift, I do a one-hour cleanup, which they call the post-rush. I also used to make the chili for the day and for the next day."
good,"family owned business long hours with everyday working"
good,"Well what can I say it was work. The managers was there for you when needed so you learn something new everyday, the hardest part of the job was to have to tell other who was about your same age to do something that they don't like doing and older people who think that they know everything, so what can I say I was a supervisor with a lot of things that had to be done in a time frame."
good,"come in count safe, then go through make sure i have inventory for my shift. go on line and serve the customers. after 10 hours, i would count safe again and count all inventory. in between i might have a meeting or have to place prtoduct orders. i really learned how to handle customers"
good,"As a manager your perspective is different.Working with teenagers can be stressful, but the pay and benefits are good."
good,i learned a lot of thing at my work my co workers are good they teach me and help me
good,"busy to modrate flow,better cashier skills,managment needs more training to run shift better, okak for the age, (16 yrs,_20yrs) not a great company for older emplyors, dealing with rudeness of managers an crew, the part when dealing with customer that i see often (:"
good,"A typical night at Wendy's is stressful. Through the three years that I have worked there, I have learned how to manage my time well in order to get all tasks necessary completed correctly. Ive also learned that the customer is always right, even if theyre not, they are in order to ensure 100% customer satisfaction at all times. Its incredibly difficult at times to act in a respectable manor to customers when they are speaking to you in an elevated tone, but through my experiences, it is always your job to be courteous, polite, apologetic, and offer any assistance possible to make even the difficult customers come back. The management team there for the most part is great, but even the greatest of managers have flaws. The District Manager over this store is never actually in our store anymore, and the expectations put on not only the crew members, but the assistant/general managers is insane. The service times that are expected with only allowing a few people to be on the clock working is nearly impossible at times, but we always seem to manage with what we are given to the best of our ability. The hardest part of my job is biting my tongue. Its hard to sit there and get yelled at by customers when you have done nothing wrong, especially when they are insisting that you did whatever it was that upset them on purpose. Its also difficult for me to bite my tongue when crew members are slacking because they know that when the clock strikes whatever time the schedule says theyre supposed to leave,  theyre going home, knowing that Im going to be the person left to pick up their slack."
good,enjoyed being promoted and recognize for my hard work and efforts put into my job
good,"a new experience for me that I enjoyed"
good,"Working at Wendy's is not as horrible as many may think, because it is fast food. Fast food service is kind of hard, because everyone does things at a different pace, where fast food we must all move at the same pace. For the past five years Wendy's has been great to me, the managers and the co-workers I have met along the way are very genuine and makes me love my job even more. The hardest thing about working in customer service is dealing with all kinds of personalities. Experiencing others personalities help myself gain tolerance, respect, and self-control, which I love to thank Wendy's for. A typical day at work for me is helping the managers and other employees with their work. I enjoy this job a lot, but it is time for a change and new experience, which I am hoping for. "
good,"As a wendy's employee my shift consisted of me shifting positions every couple of hours. I learned to work a cash register, grill and all other equipment. Management consisted of a group of hard working people whom I admired. My co-workers and I cooperated as a unit and had lots of chemistry. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say would be drive-thru position. The easiest part of the job was the cashier  position."
good,This was not a fun place to work did not enjoy the crew/team at all i did leave Wendys due to my fathers health
good,A typical job but no room to grow. However a great company to work for.
good,"The very first year or so I had thought I could work there forever. That was until I got to know everyone better and how they thing and feel. Everybody worked hard and well, chemistry between most the employees was good. Very little drama. I was hoping for a promotion until a girl my age started making problems for me and then all my person life on top that. I guess you could say I was a little naive and put a little to much trust in the wrong people. I was young and I had learned. But over all I had liked it there until what could have been a career turned into jr high."
good,"Have good team players,good management team.May work long hours,training staff on all positions"
good,A typical day at work would be preparing everything that would need for the day. What I learned was that you meet and work with different type of people and you treat everybody the same way. The co-workers was alright but had been there for a while and was not willing to change.
good,"Simple tasks, easy job, fast paced, decent management. Clean environment. Can be very fun environment as well. Although too many things management demands from its employees, such as splitting certain could be done more to help the job and production."
good,location would be better place to work if management was better examples I saw were;
good,"It is a good experience working with Wendy's. The entire team is very helpful, considerate, patient and friendly."
good,i have a great time learning new things learning how to wor at a faster pace then regular fast food restaurant would using do but it was a good learning jobs for me.
good,Wendy's a great starter job if your a student. A great way to advance an move up in your position.
good,"I would go usually work in the mornings when i first started out with only a couple of hours, but then they moved me up to night shift with more hours. I learned how to work a cash register, make sandwiches, and also work drive through. My co-workers were somewhat nice, with the exception of them being stressed at times and getting irritated with each other. The hardest part of the job was closing down for the night and restocking everything for the next day, but the most enjoyable part was being able to interact with some of the customers and helping them get their best experience at Wendy's while i worked there."
good,I like the fast paced environment and the cooperation from co-workers
good,"Prep,stock,Clean,cook is the main priority. How to cook to the number of people that come in every so often. To listen to my surrounding in the work place to try to stay one step ahead of everyone.Good at what they do. Its all in how you run it. Good, people who are in there is about there job and getting good responds. The hardest part is debating on how much meat to cook with wasting so much.the friends I made in the process. ."
good,"a typical day at work will start off with customers. Sometimes the manager(s) aren't always around when help is needed around my area, i'd have to make the customer wait or i'd have to handle is myself. My co-workers are the best part of the job, we use team-work most of the times, and the other times we turn against each other when it gets to overwhelmed. The hardest part of the the job is the manager(s) and especially the customers expecting, us employees to be perfect all the time with no mistakes, I try my hardest and i get it right most of the times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fairness between managers and employees they dont downgrade neither or."
good,"Overseeing the daily business of the employees, customer service, food service and sanitation of a fast food restaurant. I learned the proper management of the Wendy's brand. The management was very eager to teach the proper way of running each sift and very strict about the exact way each thing is to be done. My co-workers were the best and the worst part of the job. The team leads were at each others throats competing for a management position, yet the hourly associates were for the most part eager to learn and happy to have a job. I stress team work and was able to build a wonderful repore with my team and that make every one able to get the daily work done in a more timely manner and achieve more in the long run."
good,Wendys is a resturant has a lot to offer and a career that get u were u want to be/ team work some times /crew need some improvementon certain siklls i've learnd to be responsable for my actions i've learned to be a team player /work hard/my hardest part of the job is managers not looking at the hard work i do/ im always on time /never call out /help were it's needed/ i take my job serious i would like to persue on something other than being a crew chief /my most joyable at the job is to keep the customers happy my typical day at work is i have to stand at the bus stop for an hour in order for me to catch the 55 bus stop in horsham when i live in philly
good,I liked I had a flexable schedule. Did not have to work alot of nights.I was nice just was not alot of pay.
good,The people that worked there were nice and taught me alot. They also gave me decent hours and were very understanding when i had to take a little time off for the birth of my daughter.
good,"At this job I would prep food, run the register, assist customers and train new crew members. I learned that customer service is the number one priority. My co-workers were all very nice. The hardest part of this job was working with grease all the time and getting messy and smelly. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and joking with crew and managers."
good,Working at Wendys was a great opportunity. I had learned new things everyday and I have learned to deal with the different customers and their different personalities.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and learning how to multi task.
good,This is the grat job for a high school student trying to make some money. It could be had for a parent trying to support a big family though.
good,"A typical day at work for me being a shift supervisor consists of counting and exchanging cash amongst interal employees and customers, staffing and managing the shift by using a positional chart. Giving great customer service and ensuring that quality food is being served to our customers. Since being apart of the Wendy's team, I have learned that teamwork is important to be successful. You can not expect to work only one position, you must be willing to help out wherever help is needed and to do so willingly. Management is ok for the most part. they tend to be understanding, however higher management tend to be unfair in scheduling and do not follow all of the rules required for scheduling thus putting lower level management in tough situations. Co-workers are generally people who have no work experience, high school age kids and people who just need a job. Most do not take the job seriously and tend to slack off or give a half-hearted effort to complete tasks. The hardest part of the job is balancing it between outside things. Schedule flexibilty is very poor and if something changes in your life outside of work, very seldom are they willing to make changes for you. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere. It is fast paced and generally busy so the work day doesn't drag on all the time."
good,"I would open get everything ready for the day,that's its better to be a team.i would take care of shop at all times,hardest part would be be there by your self when u got busy or the truck came,the best thing I would say was being manger and doing cakes!!!!!"
good,This company is a fast paced low paying starter job for individuals looking for a start within an established company.
good,"I learned how to multi-task (food prep, cleaning, opening, closing, cash register) and how to interact with any and all kinds of customers. The only issue I had was that I was the main person on the drive thru window, closing 5-6 days a week. Not getting home until 12:30 or 1 in the morning. But other than that it's a good starting job and the co-workers were all great."
good,"The management was terrible. The schedule was posted the day before it was supposed to go into effect and had to be changed due to error without notice. Few of the managers were willing to loan a helping hand when the restaurant became busy. Frequently ran out of food. Most of the co-workers made the job fun. Although there were some that consistently had nasty attitudes and lazy. Some shift managers did not address employee issues. The tasks were not strenuous. Most of duties were quite simple. Workers were not allowed the free drinks as said in training video and had to pay for empty cups. Including water, although it was free to customers."
good,"The team was welcoming. The restocking was up to date, and the manger kept in order."
good,long hours learned the same things i did at mcdonalds everyone was nice and helpful a good team and the hardest thing was when i quit
good,"Every place you go, they do have high prices becausse of the drought. Maybe later this year they will come down."
good,The day varied from slow to busy. I learned a lot about food prep. My manager there was the best manager I ever had. He went above and beyond his job. He was a stern boss but yet I felt like I could seek advice from him and tell him anything. I had a lot of co-workers and I worked with different people almost every day. And like my recent job the worst part of the day was an unhappy customer. Best part was lunch and getting that 50 percent off any wendy's meal.
good,all I can say about wendy is slavery a lot off work and not i non paid. but we had a rule all ways the client has to leave happy. the hardest part off are job was to clean all the grease and have everything in other for the next day.
good,"First job that I seen how things were from a management point of view.The only bad thing was working with teenagers,some forgot we was there to work not have fun."
good,"Delighting the customer by giving the full service they want with the food they are ordering making it fresh,clean and value for their money. Maintaining the restaurant clean. working in fun environment with the co-workers. The hardest part is we don't have benefits like the other company have and i enjoyed making sandwiches fast to deliver it to the customers fast as well and make them happy and satisfied."
good,"Was a good place to work. This new store needed a better general manager that would listen more, and couldve been more successfull"
good,"Wendys does not recognize or support performers...If you meet budget/ bonus guidelines...they will change the program so you do not get bonus from hard work that you do..Job overall...toooo many demands! If your restaurant is producing...meeting and beating budget...LEVAE THE STORE MANAGER ALONE!!!! Evidently. the wheel isnt broke so dont try to squeeze blood from something that is ""producing"" only to change and take away the Bonus that manager has earned...Very bitter towards being screwed out of bonus twice!!!"
good,"A typical day at wendy's includes cleaning the front end as soon as I came in, restocking, running the cash register ( sometimes drive thru, fries, or the grill), cleaning my work area, keeping the front end cleaned and stocked, and then closing. During closing time, I would clean the bathrooms, my work area, and vacuum and clean the front end. I would also shut down my register and count the money I accumulated for that day. Management and co-workers werent always the best because I always dealt with people's attitudes, mainly due to stress. The hardest part of the job keeping my stamina going because I was on my feet for a long time. The most enjoyable part was befriending a couple co-workers. Overall, I learned about time management, how to properly communicate with customers, and how the fast food industry is ran."
good,i staout a a cashier and worked myself up to mgmt. in 6 months.I learned out from my boss.
good,not a great paying job but after 14 years there is some security in terms of taking time off but financially thankless job at times
good,managers are great.
good,"I was working drive-thru, i liked it at the time. i was working two jobs. I got along with all my co-works. The hardest part was dealing with some of the custmers but i never lost it that was the good thing. I most enjoyed was getting to see how many different people there really are."
good,Flexible hours to go with a full time college students schedule.
good,great place to start out at you can learn a lot working there not only from working there in general but from the people there as well. its a little greesy but thats fast food for you
good,Minors aren't aloud to get as many hours because of school. And because I'm a senior they were lenient on the weekends and let me close but on early days I barely got to workI still
good,"I liked the job, it was ok, but at the same time I didn’t like getting yelled at by customers. I worked very hard everyday and I also help people who needed it."
good,"Some days the stove wouldnt work to make the bacon, mice problems. "
good,It was a good job just needed a job closer to home.they worked with my schedule when I was in school and everything. I worked on the cashier and I was in the window whenever I worked.
good,I'm looking to make good money I worked at a Walmart distribution center that I enjoyed a lot I was paid a lot as well Wendy's in my opinion is for beginners and the pay isn't the best but for the work you do you get paid fair I'm just looking for something more I don't belong at Wendy's
good,"Wendys is a great place to learn the basics about customer service. The staff was great and it was a true team environment. As a assistant manager I was in charge of the staff, the run of the store and the quality of the food going out the store."
good,The only reason to stay are the friends you make while working together. The pay is a little over minimum wage with very little raises given out. There was a lot of manager turnover which was aggravating to deal with.
good,The pay is good.They keep a happy and clean environment.Its a great first job.they also give food discounts to worker's.Everyone keeps positive energy.
good,"I was a cashier/ sandwich maker at Wendy's. I got burned from some bacon grease by a member of management. I was sent to one of the company's doctors and I was given treatment and a drug test. The other employee, however, was NEVER sent to the doctor for a drug test."
good,Good company / job needs a little help in some areas overall a good job !i recommend the job to the ones who are looking for a simple job. Not a hard job just do what you have to do and asked to do.
good,"This job is fast paced, can be stressful, but overall fun. If you are looking for a fun first job I recommend applying. The people are firendly and are always willing to help you learn and grow at your job, and you are not always on the same station (once you complete your training)."
good,This job was okay. I was here for a while this was my very first job. I feel like they became my family until other people got involved . It was filled with drama and so much hostility. I wouldn’t want to go back here
good,Can be extra at times due to customers. Employees were pretty cool for the most part. Manager didn't give breaks often however. I would only recommend this job to high school kids.
good,I don't really have nothing to say about this job. It was easy and fun just at the time i was struggling with my own life and couldn't focus on what i need to do. Otherwise i enjoyed this job
good,"Each Shift you'll get placed in a work area where you had a job to do."
good,"Working at any fast food restaurant is nowhere near easy, but with the right team and management, it can be an enjoyable work place. The hardest part of the job is the customers. Being able to provide excellent customer service is a skill but honed in, becomes a great skill. All in all i would consider my time at Wendy's a great experience. I have obtained several workplace and people skills. It is definitely a time in my life I will remember."
good,The job is fun at times but it is times where you have to be be serious. Like making sure you get the orders correct in a timely manor. It’s Good people that work there.
good,"Good place to work when working with the right people. Very fast paced, if you do not like being on your feet all the time then this is not the place for you."
good,"I made a served food including chili, salads, and grill. People were nice.  The management also seemed nice. I liked working there.  High volume times were very hectic.  But most of the time was good to work there."
good,Work with some good people.  Learn alot about working at a fast restaurant.  Didn't like doing drive thur to much. Learn how to make sandwiches do drive thur cooking cleaning a fast food restaurant.
good,"Easy job to keep, you won't get rich working here but you get paid fairly considering it's a job with no skills required. Great management that actually called me the day that I relocated out of state, to offer me a job at one of their other locations."
good,"Learned to multi-task, learned to work with a team, work well under pressure and improved customer service skills. Working at Wendy's taught me the importance of a job."
good,Decent place to work at with easy tasks to do and flexible hours but the management is pretty weird at times and are really bad at running the place which makes the place bad to work at.
good,Get work done participate in the activities such as Holidays dress up and themes the general manager has planned. Management was good there when I worked there we all had a great connection and worked with a system that worked for every manager on there shift
good,"The hours are long and stressful, but it's a good starter job to make some money and learn what the real world can be like. I got a lot of oil burns from it, so it definitely toughens you up."
good,Everyone helps eachother. Managers communicate well. The turn over rate in any fast food can become stressful. Procedures are very easy to comprehend.
good,"It is really fast pace, they are flexible with hours. It can be a little stressful at times. Barely train, you kind of learn things as you go sometimes. You are able to taste all seasonal foods ."
good,"Not too bad, it's a good starter job, for someone who is looking to get experience with working in general. They don't pay well, which is why it's better for a teenager rather than an adult to work at."
good,"As my first job, I started off bad then I quickly picked up the paste and got to know the whole restaurant. Things were going good for a couple months then new people started getting hired and current workers started getting fired quickly."
good,"I have learned a bit about what it is to work with a team and how each separate role is crucial to achieve speed of service and customer satisfaction. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with. The hardest part is when you are short staffed and your boss/bosses expects stellar speed of service times, and no complaints. The amount they offer is not enough for the work that is required."
good,"At the start of my career with Wendy's I absolutely Loved working for the company. I was trained very well, advancement oppurtunties were there for me and I took advantage of them, great benefits, unfortunately over the last month of me working for Wendy's I had no quality of life , it was just me and my General Manager he was opening 7 days and I was closing 7 days. I didn't want to leave but I was burnt out. I am a Hard worker with outstanding work ethics and very reliable, being with the company for over 12 years I didn't call in sick 1 time. I bring allot to the table as far as knowledge, working under pressure,reliability, and would be a great asset for any company I work for."
good,It was a good place to work for me and easy to learn I love the customers most of them I learned all there names because they were regulars and they love the fact that you remember them and value there money an them as a customer
good,"Many advancement opportunities, but not great pay at all, and limited benefits in all areas. Upper management does try to take care of its people, and the facilities are in very good shape."
good,I did not receive any benefits. I worked for 7.35 which is not enough and just 10 cents above minimum wage. It is fast-paced and could be overwhelming to some people. You do get a discount on food. You also get a shirt apron and hat to wear everyday.
good,Wendys was a fun place to work the only thing that took me away was they are not willing to pay their management what they are worth and they expect you there 24 /7
good,"I don't believe company policy allows for an ideal workplace environment as many of its policies make it difficult to work in. Although there is a lot of customers and money to be earned, employment was difficult to come by as the work was difficult and if the other employees did not need to be there, they wouldn't work there. The management was mostly good but I felt suffocated by some of the managers with micromanagement and unsustainable standards."
good,"In Wendy's was a really great place to work all the crews and managers are really kind they helped each others, it's enjoyable sometimes it's busy sometimes it's not busy"
good,"The people were great, but the management was horrible. The discounts on the food were a plus. The place was great but the managers really ruined the situation."
good,Its a good place to work at. It gets stressfull sometimes but its good there. The employes are also helpful in ways and the manager is nice and will help you the best way possible.
good,"Fun work place, fast working, I only stopped working there because they stopped giving me hours to work. The work environment was amazing while I worked there though."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people that I did. Opportunities for advancement. Always putting the customer first, and taking care of any problems that arise."
good,The food was nasty and the customers were rude at times but that’s what they do so. I got along with everyone. My coworkers were very nice and some of them were messy
good,I enjoyed working for the company and the people i worked with. I liked customer service because i like people. If i were to have to work at this establishment again; i would.
good,"probably one of the best jobs I had in my short career in the fast food industry"
good,It's ok I love working it's a place I would like to go bk to or I would not mind going bk to and manager I love I just love working there the crew I love them
good,"Management shows favoritism when it comes to enforcing the rules. Management is also very rude. The overall atmosphere within the crew was bad. When it comes down to it they will, for the most part, deliver good service. My favorite part of the job had to be the discounts."
good,"great place for first time job seekers. typical day for early mornings would be food prep. taking care of any trash, cleaning tables and cashing out orders on drive through or the front. fast paced but very easy to work and teaches discipline."
good,Wendy’s was my first job so I think it’s a good job to get your foot in the door you learn how to handle money and learn to operate point of service systems. Also you learn etiquette of customer service.
good,Hectic environment during lunch and dinner hours but slow in between. Employees were nice and manager was very demanding but accommodating with hours/schedule.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers they were all kind, hardworking and understanding. The hardest part was the work space they were unorganized, and management was condescending and at times treated employees inhumanely. I learned that not everyone is going to be understanding of small mistakes and hard work pays off."
good,"Working as a part-time student during the summer it had good hours, it was a quick way to catch on but some customers can be rude at times. But It was pretty basic and fun."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great experience that I would never regret. I loved my time there, and always wanted to be there. Yes, it got stressful when 30 orders would appear on one screen at a time, but it taught me to be patient."
good,Its very fast pace. I don't like that I was thrown in other parts (like to drive threw) with out being properly trained. Then getting yelled at for messing up instead of talked to.
good,A lot of drama and buffoonery. The Older mangers were either lazy or rude some times both and the younger one treat people like they aren't really all that smart.
good,"Depends on your management is how you will succeed. You work with other managers during your day. You day will include counting drawers, setting up shift plans and running the store. you will be in a position most of the time. If you like days where your on your feet for many hours, then this is for you."
good,I mostly did cashier prepared the food did salads clean dishes. And most of the time I’ve been giving to guess her food to the table. And helping what they need For they could be happy and come again in our food place.
good,It's a wonderful place to work m goid people good service and good hours . Its very well cleaned.  Its a temporary job for me to make.  Enough money to provide myself
good,"Although Wendy's is more of a starter job, it was an enjoyable one. I met a lot of wonderful people who are still my friends to this day. They do work around your schedule and if you want to pick up hours, nine times out of ten you definitely could. The job is easy, management takes the time to get to know you and treat you as a person who has feelings and situations outside of work. The only thing I can say is a downside is the fact that because they do get to know you so well, they do not usually take your leaving very well. They also don't give many benefits or anything really besides half off your lunch, but it's okay."
good,"Working at Wendy,s was cool..I like the people that worked there but majority of my co-workers were lazy so that fell back on me, because they asked me to do everything and I didn't make enough money to do my job and yours too.."
good,"I liked working in different environments with different people, it was fun and had an always learning edge to it as well as routine. If I didn't get an injury which prevents me on working long amounts of time standing I would probably still be there."
good,Shifts were alright with nice and fun coworkers but the managers and rude customers were not fun. The food is half off and you will be able to develop friendships very quickly because of how easy the workers are to get along with. Most of the managers were not easy to work with.
good,"I worked here when i was in high school, it was a part time job and it wasnt bad. Earning minimum wage for a high school student wasnt too bad. Get free frostys' every now and then and food too. That was a nice perk"
good,Wendy’s is a good place to work in just some employees don’t take there job serious . Some manager were not fair.  The hours were good and at points when you need it off the manager wouldn’t give them or take hours off
good,Working at Wendy's was very easy but tends to get very slow an boring at times. The one thing i could say i enjoyed at Wendy was being able to get discounts on my food orders and being able to communicate with customers.
good,"My typical day working at Wendy’s was usually good. I like talking to the regulars that always come in. I learned how to do use a cash register. Management was good almost everyday. I don’t think there was anything hard about working there aside from how toxic it was with drama, even when I was never involved. I would have to say the best part about working there was meeting some new, good people."
good,"A typical day at work started working on drive through, stocking, or cleaning. This job is great for a first job or a teenager level job. It requires working with customers and coworkers, which is good to learn. However, it is just an entry level job where you're in fast food. The hardest part of the job was cleaning everything for the audits, cleaning the grease of fryers, cleaning the ceiling, etc. Requires good physical health"
good,I've learned a lot from this place but overall I wasn't happy working here because the management was dysfunctional and there drama leaked  onto everyone else and they're also cheapskates and the raises are insulting
good,This was my first job and I began as a crew person. Upon my 18th birthday I was promoted to shift manager for being a decent and competent employee. I could easily have been a regional manager within a decade or running my own store had I chosen to stay with that company.
good,"Wendys is a very fast paced environment at times, you could work your butt off and get little pay out of it. This job is good for a high school student or starter job but not if you have bills to pay."
good,"It was a fast food job, I had to deal with customers everyday. If you like customer service, than this is an ok job. Management is flexible with you and not hard on you. The workers are nice and hard working. The hardest part of the job is doing the drive thru. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount you get."
good,It was a nice job but very hard work in fast paste in u got to learn quick. I had to learn how to make sandwiches in 20 to 30 seconds in learn how to learn how to handle food correctly.
good,"Closed dining room: involves cleaning bathrooms, sweeping floors, vacuuming, cleaning tables and chairs, taking out the trash, and running register operator."
good,"Good company for young people starting out. However, every employee is replaceable. Stress and workload is not worth the pay. Good first job opportunity"
good,Wendy’s is a fun but serious workplace and I enjoyed my time there. Some of the people there is awesome and others are just dumb. But I loved all of the mangers at Wendy’s.
good,"The hardest part of the job is when you ring up the order correctly and customers still show anger towards you I had one guy throw a sandwich at me on the counter like I was a dog. It was very hard to keep my composure. The most enjoyable part is when you make the customers happy and everyone is working together to please them. I learned how to be more patient. A typical day at work consists of not getting a break due to everyone being busy; however, for me, I've gotten so used to it. I try not to get breaks though because I need the money."
good,"- The manager was never there always on vacation"
good,You have to have patience to work there or they will run over you. The job it’s self is ok. I don’t recommend you if you can not count they always looking for cashier
good,"I believe Wendys is a good starter job. It is great for someone kind of still getting to know the work world. It is perfect for young teens. My manager was great, he deserved a better employee than me"
good,Cool company but very low pay . Over employed and to many requirements for little to no benefits . I loved my manager she was a nice lady always tried and helped me out.
good,"Si eres un estudiante Wendy's puede ser una buena opcion ya que tiene un horario bastante flexible y te puede ayudar para aportar a tu familia o crear un resumen laboral."
good,"it was wonderful "
good,It's not the best job but its pretty easy once you get a position down. some stores are really slow some are really busy. you never know in the food industry
good,Wendys is not that bad of a job if your use to the hard labor. I didn't truly enjoy my stay at Wendys I was sort of just their to work and nothing more. The culture is cool depending on who the employees are and how well you can communicate with others. The only thing I enjoyed was making sandwiches and cleaning. The hard part was working with others who don't desire to work or those who are new because they could slow the pace.
good,You have to be patient and quick when working here. It is not located in the best part of town so many of the customers are rude. The managers are great to work with and most of the crew is too.
good,"people go in and order food, since its a fast food restaurant we have to give them their food fast. When we have a line in the front the best thing to do is have one person take order the whole time then have some run for them (do the orders for them). This is how a person can get their food fast."
good,I miss the consistency and organization of the company i worked for. The pay was better than the job I have now I don't have much to say about wendys because I had a great experience there
good,I loved working at my job. It was very quick and at a steady paste. It get stressful at times but I caught on to it very fast. I’m a hardworking student.
good,"Good people"
good,"I enjoyed it, the money was good for my very first job. I recommend it to people who are just getting started. Easy to move up if you work hard daily."
good,"they have some communication issues but other wise a great place to work, they treat you like family. management can be a little stiff sometimes but its a good steping stone job."
good,My job at Wendy's was good at times and hard at times.  the managers could of had a little bit of more patience with new learners. Only thing Wendy's need to work on in my opinion is the benefits
good,work environment is a bit stressful because of the team and manager attitudes. enjoyed the fast phased lifestyle but they sometimes cut my shift hours
good,They hired a new manager while I was working there and she never did her job but wanted us to wait after hours for her would rush us and curse us. Then expect us to be calm waiting for her for an hour in a half because she wanted to be Facebooking and instagraming all night instead of doing her job.
good,Great place to work with youth and good customer relations. The job is very fast pace. The management is strong. This is a good place to work and begin a management career.
good,"It gets really hot in the uniforms when it is warm outside, with all the cooking going on not a good placement if you can not stand for long periods of time."
good,"enjoyed working. most people pretty nice.treated fairly except for one manager,.It was a fairly easily job and very enjoyable.I met a lot of nice customers and the managers were really nice.i cleaned bathrooms, took out trash, and mopped floors and occasionally worked behind counter.the most enjoyable part was working behind the counter."
good,This job is great for people with the right management and team. It is very physically demanding during the summer months although it means a better pay security because you will gain more hours.
good,When I worked at Wendy's I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and handle multiple responsibilities at once. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with irate customers who had no desire to work out a solution for the problem at home.
good,I worked there for year. I did drive through mostly but would also run speaker as Well. but I was mainly an opener so I was run the whole kitchen in the morning
good,"The typical work day would be 8 am prep of the lettuce and other food products for the day and then taking orders and washing dishes from 10:30 on to the end of my shift."
good,"As a first job, it taught me a lot about responsibility. Typically a day at work would be cleaning the bathrooms and the dining room and taking orders. Sometimes you have to help out and take over other stations. With good managers, work is a fun, friendly environment. Truly felt like a second family. The hardest part of the job were the hours that I chose however I sucked it up and did my job effectively. I enjoyed my customers who sometimes would tell me stories about their kids who started out in Wendy's and went of to do great things."
good,"My first job was being a crew member on Wendy's. The job was pretty simple and easy to learn. I started on fries, then grill, then back cash, and then on the line, making burgers. It is an easy job and it is a good first job."
good,my experience at Wendy's was very fast paced but easy and most of my co-workers were willing to effectively keep the store running at a consistent rate so it was pleasurable to be accompanied by certain team members.
good,"At first it was a fun work environment then it just became so stressful every shift was something else going wrong. I loved the people I worked with, the managing part itself become overwhelming."
good,you have to be quick with the orders do not hold people in line to long it was important to get customers in and out without hesitation and maintain good sanitary work area
good,The food industry is very stressful. I was a manager over 30 employees. My general manager did not strive for greatness. He did not care about goals or food cost. Also would not fire people that were insubordinate or called off or had bad production. I personally feel that I did like being a manager at Wendy's but the in order for a company to run smoothly your other managers need to have the same goals and strive to be the best.
good,"Overall Wendy's was a great place to work at. The only issues was that sometimes it lacked proper management, and sometimes they require you to take on more tasks that you were not employed to do, making the pay seem unfair."
good,"Being a student and having a part time job is stressful at times, management at my current job, the rules are super strict and they sometimes do not have good business ethics. I always received long hours on school nights and coming home late and when asking for certain days off they were most of the time denied."
good,"Wendy's is an ok place to work. I can't say that it was a wonderful experience, but that is what every fast food job is like. I will definitely miss this job. If you work hard and listen to management, you won't lose your job. Fast food does bring great job security."
good,"The work itself is extremely fast paced and can be a bit stressful at times. On the bright side, the coworkers are always pretty outgoing and can make a hard day a little bit easier."
good,Things i do at wendys is i grill meats an do sandwiches also cashiers take orders an always have a smile to my customers i also do inventory wash dishies mop the floors
good,Worked as a GM Trainee for 6 weeks. Learned a lot of information in a short time which was fine. But the amount of money I was being paid and the amount of work required to complete was insane to be a GM. I will be grateful for the opportunity and would go back if they compensated me fairly. Had I been a male employee I would have been paid more
good,"A typical work day: taking orders and making some food. I learned how to use a register and make simple foods. There wasn't really a hard part of the job. Enjoyable part of the was taking a break, paydays."
good,"I learned much about my work ethic and focus, and I became strong and independent working here. Unfortunately, that was due to poor crew morale, terrible management, and by the end, a lack of crew. I worked night shift for most of my time at Wendy's due to my college class schedule. During a normal night, I would work 1-2 stations while supervising the shift as well. I would help my skeleton crew close the store properly, count the safe, input inventory and tills into the system, and lock up. I dealt with churlish customers who screamed obscenities at me, threw fries at the drive through window, and tried to bait my crew with taunts of fighting in the parking lot. Despite this, I continued to be the best closing manager at my store, and gained many friends throughout my time working there."
good,wendy's was my first job while in high school it was fun and cool because it gave me something to do while having early release my senior year overall fast paced.
good,"This is a fast pace work environment to start all prep, line set up and daily ops plans will need to be complete in the morning before doors open. When open all employees must be in place aces' in there places for most productive day/service. The role of the manager is to guide and help staff members with completing task to provide best customer service experience."
good,Working with new people and team was a great opportunity. It was my first job so I really enjoyed it . But unfortunately I was not able to continue that job because it was really far from my new residence.
good,not a good idea did not enjoy it at all i was  only working park time they did not treat us like employees just like kids instead and also pay was not good
good,"It's a stable job but in the end that's all it is. It's just a job, not a career. Whether you like the culture or managers really depends on where you are and who you have to work with. Many employees are only part time so the employees change often. It did have very flexible hours so I guess that's good."
good,i enjoyed workimg at wendy and would love to work there again...the staff were amazing and i enjoyed the face paced environment. Everyday was a great day to go to work.
good,"Working here was not bad at all, they seemed to hire the best and friendliest people they could. though most were from out of country and their English wasn't the best, they almost always had a better temperament towards colleagues as well as customers. "
good,"Wendy's was an okay job, it was fun working with the people, but the hours they would always make me stay late and that was annoying. Pay was trash and management was garbage."
good,"A typical day at work includes a fast-paced environment with team-friendly co-workers and managers. The average rush lasts about 3 hours for both lunch and dinner. The food was great quality, and I'd happily still eat there."
good,"My experience was well rounded and filled with many opportunities. Initially i started as an assembler, the progressed to the grill. after getting a great handle of this and having the ability to do both jobs simultaneously. The best part about the job was the slow paced environment and the great crew i worked with and management that would really jump in and help. I learned all of the process of the back of the house that they cross trained me for the front and window position. This was over the course of several months. i evidently left because I couldn't surpass 28 hours a week, so it was easy to leave to other opportunities."
good,You have some good days you have some bad days. At the Wendy's I worked at its in a shopping center so it's stays busy you have to be ready at all times no time for giving up!
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy’s. Fast paced, with lots of customer interaction. The managers and crew were always cheerful and quick to assist where needed. Everyone tried to put quality and care into what they did."
good,As a cashier I had to take orders and give people there food. Inbetween customers I have to wash the lobby and make sure I wash the trays. Once the night ends I had to close the lobby
good,"Wendy's had its ups and downs. Been there for almost a year and a half before I had left. There was a lot of unfair pay for the hours that I had worked during the week. Never once got a raise after being there for a year. "
good,"This job will keep you on your toes. Each wendys is different based on the environment. I worked in a city wendys, always busy always a line wrapped around the building inside or drive thru. Everyone was flexible with positions so we could help at all times. Interestin co-workers made the days fun."
good,"Young staff relates to always going to be some issue ... every day.  What challenge will the day bring?  Meet it, defeat it, and move on!  Fast food, oh what a life."
good,Overall it was an OK job it helps to get you started good for school students and college students its a good job if you like to stay on your toes at all times
good,"Taking customer orders, stocking fridge, make sandwiches, clean windows and floors.  Management not very friendly at times and that was the toughest part."
good,good side job but nothing i would do forever need something more as a career to much repetition and you are not treated nice by customers as an employ
good,"I worked there back when min. pay was 7.25 at the time was very good, very good place to work when your first starting to work. the manager was amazing very kind ad listen. was quick pace but it was fast food."
good,"Wendy's was a nice place to work while in school. Helps with responsibilities such as cleaning, lileaning, and being quick.there was lack of management and consideration of what you have going on but the hours was good other than that"
good,Not a career for someone outside of higher education. The job itself isn't bad you have good days and bad days lik any other job. It pays well but not great.
good,If hired I won't let you down I need all the hours I can get I'm willing to work on off days as well need a 10$ paying job to be able to provide for the household
good,Decent management depending on location. options for moving up the ladder with lots of time and investment. payment is not great. good for high school workers.
good,"human resource function. interview, hire, train, and orient new employees into workforce. handle disputes between managers and employees and managers and managers."
good,"Unless you're not able to keep up with something that's extremely fast-paced and stressful, you probably would be fine here. My managers were really nice and the crew is very helpful*. "
good,If you never had a job or want fast food experience or in school I do recommend because they train you and do have flexible schedules. It gets busy and overwhelming and I did enjoy that because the hours went by fast but for all the work you do the wage is not right!
good,"nice place to work however, there is little room for advancement and the pay and benefits were not that great. The managers were nice and my coworkers were easy to get along with."
good,"The people that worked at Wendys were very friendly, and as a manager there I think I did pretty well. I am very easy to get along with and I learned how to be in an authoritative position which was very new for me.The work was either very fast and stressful or we were very slow. It was hit or miss."
good,I was a store manager it wasnt too bad but it just really sucked when your understaff at a busy location. sucks they dont pay over time at all but other then that not a bad place to work
good,Its a fun work environment but the managers show favoritism. Overall it's a great job because they can work with your schedule. Its easy to balance your work life and social life
good,The general manager I worked for is no longer employed there. I have eaten there a few times in the last five years since leaving and I've noticed how much it has changed as far as service goes. Twice in the last three weeks there was a mistake with my order. This was never a problem with the crew and management I worked with and for.
good,it was okay i learned alot from wendys being a shift supervisor in my first 9 months so they have quick career advancement. But in the 4 years of working there we had 6 new gms.
good,"its busy at night"
good,"Wendys in Kansas City is nothing but drama! I will never work there, order from them, or even go close tp working there. I experienced bad things at the same ome working there and eating there."
good,"I've been at Wendy's for almost three years now and it's a great first job, it pays the bills and I have some extra cash to treat myself or to buy my friends and family's birthday/Christmas gifts"
good,"Opening and closing restaurant. Creating registers as well as counting down registers.  Running crew meeting to start off the shift and conducting a daily plan to carryout a successful shift. Cleaning, organizing, and carrying out proper sanitation practices. The most enjoyable part of the shift was being able to interact with customers and seeing the pleasure that they received when eating food prepared by myself and my staff.  Assistant manager over me was excellent. However, the worst part of the job was having a general manager who belittled and undermined their managers in front of the employees.  Employees were excellent when trained proper procedures. Working as a team was very important, and the job pushes the employees to work together and provide the best customer service experience possible."
good,This was my second job and I learned a lot the management was cool in the crew some of them and I'm easy to get along with everyone in a hard worker a quick learner
good,A lot of people underestimate the hard work that goes into being a Wendy's employee. It helped keep me in shape and I enjoyed working with most of the people who worked there. I have learned that the fast food industry is not really for me. It's a great job for first timers.
good,"I enjoyed working there, great team .. Hours was not so good cause I lived far away and public transportation stopped at a certain Time.. Other then that it was a great job with great people and customers"
good,"The environment was friendly. The management wasn't the best, and they were not very understanding with sports and school. I did not appreciate the people that were hired because they didn't care enough about what they were doing, they slacked off as i want to work in an environment where everyone cares."
good,"They dont use frozen beef, which is what they stand for. I do not speak for all wendys but the one I worked for was indeed about Quality and love its customers. Yes we can! Other Wendys I've been too are all either average or really bad compared to what I am used to in terms of service and quality of food."
good,I would work at Wendys again but not the one I worked at. It's always busy. You learn how to do different things. The mangers never wanted to help us.
good,Was a great place to work for me. Fit my schedule perfectly. Was fast paced which is what i liked. Enjoyed the one on one interaction. Was a great opportunity for me
good,"It's the fast food business, not much to say. Discounted/free meals for employees. Guaranteed breaks for any shift of five or more hours. Flexible hours."
good,As management I did not feel it was a good suite. Very hard to get help with things and not very much training. Kinda have to figure it out yourself. When there's an issue it's hard to have anyone take care of it.
good,"Wendy's seems like they know what they're doing. As long as you work for a CORPORATE STORE, you'll be fine. The corporation will ensure that your store can keep up with the monthly demands that customers can bring. But if you are at FRANCHISE STORE, beware. Franchise stores are a hit or miss. The restaurant I worked for was soled to a franchise and has since then, lost half of its workers."
good,I worked here for my first job. Great first job because it teaches you good work ethic. Also you learn how to do things quickly. Great job to pick up speed as well
good,yes wendys is a nice place an pretty laid back to work. i loved the fact you would get free meal the day you work. the managers were nice an fair.over all i would of stayed if i hadnt moved.
good,"Steady work, team effort, friendly, great environment to work in.. great job experience,get to meet great new people, one on one training, one on one customers contact. I am a General Manager for the past 15 years and I started out as a crew member in June 1991."
good,"Working here is very routine, it can be fun and it can get rough, but as long as you're motivated and a hard worker, you'll enjoy your time being with Wendy's"
good,"Wendy's is like any fast food place, late nights and/or early morning, not a job to stay at forever but can help get things paid. If you are willing to work then you wo\ill get the hours you want,"
good,do not get paid equivalent to amount of work you are responsible for on the daily basis overall not worth it and wouldn't recommend job good for teens
good,I love being there and Co worlet's are nice. Timw there is hard work but I enjoy it . Management is very nice and understanding of people's lives and there work schedule.
good,"Wendy's was my first job , It was okay when I first started then the managers started to get really rude with the workers. I like the environment but everyone had good and bad days."
good,"It is best to work in the morning, not a lot of customers but a lot of preparations. Workers are very friendly and fully cooperate when it gets busy. The hardest part of the job is when you are on a grill and have to go to a cold storage room to restock your meat/fries. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it gets busy because you lose track of time which makes time somehow goes by fast."
good,I learned new things in Wendys. I learned how to use the machines like fries machine . I learned the process of how to clean the ice cream machine. My tipical day at work was very good.
good,It's a good job if you're in high school or college. Don't try to make a career out of it unless you plan to become a general manager. Standard minimum wage job.
good,Friendly and fast paced work environment. Learned good customer service skills. Very diverse environment. Normally very busy and sometimes very slow paced place to work.
good,"Typically the busiest part of the day is from 11am-3pm. During this time everyone is busy. Breaks weren't really allowed which made the job tiresome. My co-workers made the job enjoyable, and my store manager often created a productive environment where everyone put in the same amount of work including herself. I appreciated that."
good,"Good pay , good place to work other employees make you feel comfortable, management not so good ,assistant  manager had bad communication skills with other employees."
good,"Must be able to work with customers on a daily basis. Customer satisfaction is your overall goal. Must be able to focus when under pressure, due to customers demand. Overall a pretty good place to work for."
good,"Working for Wendy's restaurant wasn't my first choice in mind. But as I got use to the menu and employees, I grown to like the fast pace of things.Best fast food experience ever."
good,"Our franchise and the company as a whole care greatly for customer service and making every customer happy while providing speed, accuracy, and quality taste. We take the job seriously day in and day out and although we are serious we find the time to have a good day every day and act like a tight-knit family."
good,"This job was good , and worked with my school schedule. The only problem I had was the managers need to be a little more understanding. Also the coworkers were very well trained."
good,i liked working here I never thought nid work fast food but greatful for experience. the team was great and helpful at all times. I would recommend their food and service
good,"I had liked working for Wendy's and learned the ins and outs of working in a fast food restaurant, but I needed to find better opportunities, because I went to school for hospitality management and I wanted to find something bigger for me to use my degree. I liked working with everyone there and even though i wasn't get paid enough, I was able to learn the job culture. I did learn the different positions from cashier to coordinator."
good,Great dynamic of people both working and customer. Time goes fast when you're busy. They're great to work with your busy schedule if you have another job.
good,Working at Wendy's wasn't too bad only thing getting paid bi weekly doesn't cut it. The hours are also okay. You have to be use to the fast movement they have.
good,A great place to excel. sodexo is a pretty  well put together company. it also has great benefits. the teamwork as well gives you a sense of ease. a job you would love.
good,Wendy's is a very comfortable work place. The crew and the management make it enjoyable. Everyone there goes out of the way to ensure that the work place is not stressful and that the customers are satisfied as well.
good,"Clock In go to your station start working.I learned more cashier experience,Hardest part of the job getting there.Everything about the job I liked.It was a great work place."
good,i'm ok working there but in my situation i need to find more convenient job for me i need to look for near company to apply my skills and experience as worker
good,"Working at Wendy's is a repetitive thing day after day of the same thing. This is good in a sense because if you know what you have to do tomorrow you can prepare for it today. It taught me how to take initiative and plan ahead, in a place where you need to get your product out quickly you have to be ready and waiting in order to be at full speed. Having to work at high paces for hours on end is definetly tiring and in my opinion is the hardest part of the job. Though having a good staff and a good work environment make the day go by smoothly and quickly."
good,Productive work. Bring the opportunity to growth. Excellent benefits for managers and great culture. Ability to work with other people and supervisor. Quick work.
good,Had fun when I worked at Wendys. Was surrounded by good people and good managers. Learned many different skills. Very much like the management style used at the company.
good,i enjoyed working at Wendy's however you wont be able to afford the standards of living while working there. Wendy's is mostly consisted of first time high school workers looking to get there foot in the door.
good,"The work day is fun but at times stressful, the management works to help each employee better themselves through out each day. The hardest part of the job is understanding what some people want."
good,It's a pretty decent starting job for someone with not a lot of experience. It stays very busy and you will not be bored. The management could be better as not all of the problems are always addressed correctly. There are a lot of different cultures working at this location so it makes for a fun work experience.
good,"Wendy's is great for anybody looking for your first job, or even your last job. It's a great learning experience and a fun place to work. I would recommend it to anybody."
good,"My job duties as a crew member at Wendy's was being a good  team worker, cooking, and serving customers in a timely manner. Also operating the cash register, stocking shelves and cleaning throughout the day and also and at the end of the night."
good,"Though management could be hard to work with at times and the job could be hectic, Wendy's was the place where I could put into practice the things I learned with Civil Air Patrol."
good,hard job and customers are rude and pay is low. but if you need a fast job take it and i was happy with it since the managers were nice and pay weekly
good,Wendy's was my first job.It was a great first job i did not enjoy the pay rate but overall the job was ok. I left wendy's so that start worlinf in fields that has something to do with my future career.
good,"This job was an interesting opportunity for me, I was to relocate to Florida with my old family soon. I was informed that the Wendy's I was working at was going to be shutdown soon. ETA 3 months to be exact, I was already a shift manager there so they offered me the position of store manager since I was already doing the truck orders for the store and had management experience. They compensated me like an store manager and it was a great learning experience. Unfortunately there's a reason they were shutting it down, complications with the building and no desire to train a new staff considering they told me and this was the first time I've witnessed a company not fight unemployment from their employees. They wanted to wash their hands completely of that place. I was just the captain of their sinking ship."
good,"Overall good experience. The customers, though very demanding, were friendly and so were my coworkers. Opportunities to move up are plentiful just make sure that you work hard."
good,I liked Wendy's an the people we probably had a bad manager here and there but they were prettybok I worked pilot side as well .I enjoyed working there I would go back as a second job.
good,when i first started there it was a great job and i enjoyed working there . My hours was amazing with my family life 7 until 2 and i got to spend time with my kids and family
good,"From day one, Wendy's was a terrible work environment for me and many coworkers because of the two managers who were originally there at the time I had started (as well as before). Things became lighter as those managers were phased out. The job itself became easy to learn in any given position and was easy to manage as long as I was on top of it. Although, it was one of the fastest paced environments I've worked in because of the amount of customers we would receive. Overall I had a good relationship with the coworkers and the managers who did come along were considered family for a while but they became less consistent as managers over time it seemed like."
good,I loved pitting Wendy up on roof. I learned the 4 corner press. Management was real good as well as the food they served. Power washing the sidewalks and scrubbing them had to be the hardest part of the job.
good,"typical day at work is a busy one. No work and life balance. management are friendly, coworkers are all hardworking people and treats you like a family inside the restaurant"
good,Constantly interacting with people so being friendly is a must. Must be able to multitask and stand on your feet all day. Does get busy but work environment can be enjoyable.
good,"Stressful, customers are rude and disrespectful, managers are professional, but overall I like my job you have to be a peoples person for this type of job"
good,U need to be fast.suffenit and work hard.The crew is very nice and always helpful.I t is the best job for someone that is just beginning work.
good,"My experience with Wendy's was fun and exciting. At first the work was very frustrating but after a few days you pick up on everything quickly and you gain friends fast. You learn new things from people as well, they are also willing to help you in your time of need no matter how long you have been there for or how little. It's like a big family I realized."
good,"A job's a job, so as a teenagers job at a fast food joint goes I guess it's not that bad. There were some days when I wanted to stick my head in the fryer, but there were some days where the time passed fast and I worked the whole time. The pay was what I'd expect, min. wage, and the people were just as nice as I'd expect too. The managers were hot and cold. Some of them were nice all the time and some had bad tempers most of the time, but we're nice one late night under a blue moon."
good,"it was busy and not fun but  great people and costumers, I hated the job and all I  did was sweep and run the cashiers.the job was not enjoyable"
good,I love coming to work and interacting with different people daily. I got the hang of the fast paced environment and enjoy it quite much.
good,Learning the work that is required at Wendy's is not difficult most employees pick up the job within two or three days. What makes doing that work hard or easy depends completely on the store where you work. I have worked at stores where the management is completely incompetent or overworked which leads to a stressful and hostile work environment. on the other hand if management at the store is good then you can expect a relatively easy time and and healthy work environment. co-workers can also vary greatly from the extremely proficient to the completely lazy layabout.
good,I learned a couple of new management skills along with some team building skills and other factors. The experience of working at Wendy's is a good one the coworkers were great and helped me out when I was starting.
good,"Busy restaurant with lots of public interacting . I learned social skills, management and coworkers were good to work and get along with."
good,I would start my day by making sure my area was clean and well stocked for my shift. I would chat with my co-workers to see if there was any problems for the day that i needed to be aware of.  I learned to take orders and follow them to the customers satisfaction. I worked close with the management because thats what I wanted to become a manager at some point.  The hardest part was when the customers complained when i know the order was correct.
good,"A typical day at work includes dealing  with customers and working around messy unprofessional people. Throughout the day you'd learn how to tolerate the different attitudes around you, what to say and when to say it, and how best to assist the nastiest of customers. The managers there weren't so bad. Some days you would have to deal with the disrespect but that was about it. Co-workers? In that case you have to know the difference between dealing with someone on job level and on friendship level. They were some of the cruelest people you'd ever come across. The hardest part of the job would be having to do your job as well as everyone else's. The mos enjoyable part of the job was the customers. The ones that made your face shine bright like the sun."
good,Productive workplace always kept busy and tried not to get distracted by the little things. Always came to work early to get things done. And also was one of the top Wendy's stores.
good,"The work environment is usually busy and stressful, however, the employees and culture are uplifting and supportive. Most of the high stress part of customer service, such as, people in a hurry, mistakes people are angry about, etc."
good,"good hours, good coworkers, good environment, clean and respectful, enjoyed the customers, talking with others, making customers feel comfortable."
good,The people you work with is not like most people try to judge people. They are friendly .  Its an OK place to work I just had a lot of family problems going on an didn't work there long.
good,"I've seen so many come and go and quit because they say it's stressful and yeah I'm not going to lie, there are points where i just want to quit but it's just cause i might be having a bad day. The reason why most quit is because they don't know their job properly and what to do and then they get lost and overwhelmed and their only exit is to quit. I personally think this is a great job starting out of school to get you thru college and ready for the real world."
good,"the co-workers are friendly,hard workers,the atmosphere is peaceful,the customers are friendly.the managers are there to help you"
good,I cant really provide a review for this establishment because i wasn't there that long but while working there i was able to meet new people the crew members where nice and helpful we got a disscount for lunch but overall the working conditions where good
good,"great place, great people, long work days but overall it great."
good,I learned how to deal with customers. A typical day is pretty stressful because of the management. I enjoy making customers happy! I have good and bad co workers but it does not really matter to me at the end of the day my job WILL get done
good,"A day at Wendy's would be busy, fun filled and full of lots of love . my job as a cashier was a great opportunity to make other's happy and satisfied with their order's also I would maintain a clean dining room and keep all materials stocked so customer's if they chose to sit and eat they will have a nice meal, no better way to enjoy a meal with a clean , healthy, sociable and comfortable restaurant."
good,"I dealt with different types of customers "
good,"Upon entering the Wendy's establishment I was always greeted with a friendly welcome. I learned that more can be accomplished simply with kindness and understanding than with dictatorship and micro management. Wendy's was a perfect example of how collectively as a group men and women could be placed in a fast paced and at times stressful environment and yet still achieve superior goals when the crew and the lower management was lead with clear expectations, organization and gratitude for a job well done. The most challenging aspect of working as a manager often times was finding an effective way to blend the unique personalities of each employee while allowing them to do the jobs that they where best at....""Aces in their Places"". By doing so effectively as a team we were able to meet service times, projected sales, friendly work environment and superior customer service. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's as a manager by far was having an opportunity to spend my days with intelligent, capable and overall incredible people who made work feel like a second home and the staff feel like extended family."
good,"This job and what Wendy's stands for helped me learn and be responsible. The hardest part of the job was was working on things challenging, but with much effort I achieved and over came obstacles. The best part of the job was pleasing customers and helping my coworkers and working as a team."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is very busy. The location is right by the mall so it can get very busy at times. When there are good workers it flows very smoothly.
good,"Wendy's was big on quality of food served and food safety and I believe they lead the industry in these areas."
good,"A typical day at wendy's would be; maintaining a clean work environment, serving customers with a smile and fast customer service. You learn how to deal with frustrating customers respectively. Managers and co-workers are very easy going."
good,you gotta be a fast worker be able to handle presser in this fast pace work place and be a people person love kids ect most of all you gotta love to work
good,"There is a lot of friendly co workers, The company was busy during certain times of the day. The best part of the day was when I got to sit and talk to my co workers, learn new things about the company, and about my co workers."
good,"customer service, Its a decent part time job that i have worked for about a year and half now. Really looking for something better. More permanent."
good,There was nothing typical everyday seemed different. However it was fun and the staff was awesome. It was my first job. Nothing was too difficult.
good,"This job was great to do alongside school as it was a simple job that I could bring down to only 5-10 hours a week if need be. The environment was great as most of the people that worked there were younger kids with tons of energy, some of which I have made friends with."
good,"I started as a sandwich maker with no hopes of even being a cashier let alone one of the head cashiers. I had fun working for the company, things change and so did their guidelines for employees. I've always hit overtime, my hours were amazing."
good,A typical day at work was interesting day by day. I learned how to be a fryer and a cashier. The management was okay depending on the manager. My co-workers were amazing and awesome. The hardest part of my job was multitasking. The most enjoyable part was serving different customers every day.
good,"everyone showed team effort, great people to work with there was never a dull day, was very excited to get the day going and putting a smile on someone face."
good,I enjoyed working for Wendys are certain days. The management was on the fence with good days and bad days. Problems were not left at the door which led to confrontation and stress in the work place. My co workers were great.
good,"Definitely requires fast paced workers who can handle a lot of work, may work an extra hour or two. The hardest part is getting a lot done in just a few hours. The people are nice to work with but don't help you much; everyone does their own thing; they mostly help with food but not with cleaning. Half-hazard cleaning by other members. They're on their phones a lot. The managers and myself were the only truly hard on-task workers. The managers care about physical well-being of employees over anything else."
good,"Working as a team member for Wendy’s fast food I have to help pre-heat buns, prepare bacon, wash dishes, maintain cleanliness, take orders, take cash, and have good customer service. I must be able to lift up to 25lbs, maintain a fast pace work place, stand for long periods of time, be polite to customers, and be able to count money and give correct change. Working at Wendy’s I observe how the meat should be cooked, how fries should be dropped frequently to keep hot fries, and how to wrap food up to give to the customer."
good,"With all my experience, I was shocked to find how unusual the culture was within the DavCo organization.  After successfully completing my training and fast track GM plans, I was given the most troubled unit in our district as the new General Manager.  I worked hard to establish boundaries and held people accountable, sometimes terminating 2 people a week.  With that initiative and attaining positive results, I was given the General Manager role at the Flagship unit in Ocean City, MD.  The crew continually tested me, though I was fair, worked very hard and increased sales that summer roughly 12%.  It was after the summer, when a problem employee, who I documented several times, formed an alliance with a few of the other more challenging staff members and concocted a story of me sexually harassing them.  Even going so far as to say that while she was entering the security door to the kitchen and entering the combination, I came up from behind and rubbed my private parts on her. Fully clothed, but she could feel it.  This young lady had an extreme attendance problem and had over a dozen notations on her incident log from me.  Even though, having been with the company a year and never having any similar allegations made or rumored, I was demoted to Co-Manager and had 10% docked from my salary.  I was removed from that location and the little Thug quartet resumed control there. Similar incidents had happened to other managers, as the Employees regularly call the 800 # to try to throw management under the bus, when they are being help for negative actions.  It makes for a very uncomfortable"
good,"Wendy`s was a good job, they knew how to have fun but be serious when it came to the customers. I`ve learned that making sure everything around you is in order will help you get the customers what they want and need as they visit the company. Management was good, they treated their employs as they were family and if something was misunderstood they would explain again, they also worked with their employs and help them work and understand their job and work pass more. The co-workers were the best part of the company, they worked together as if they were family, they were understanding if you couldn't lift something or reach something. They also kept the time going by having fun and being serious at the same time. The hardest part of the job was, the work space, everyone was running back and forth, everyone was hot and trying to get the customers their meal right away so they would come back. The most enjoyable part of the job, was meeting new people and having everyone be friendly."
good,"flipping burgers and cooking fries, cleaning pipes lifting boxes."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced.  Everyone there is really nice.  Almost everyone is easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is angry customers.  The most enjoyable part is the people you work with and the regular customers.
good,"In the morning start 7pm to 9;45 I prep salads, cook bacon, wash all the dishes. 9:45 to 10:15 my break . 10:15 to 2:00pm I am on the drive thru taking order, giving out food and passing out drink to the customer.2:00pm  I go cut salads lettuce for that night and make it for the next morning.  management is unconsisted . Co- worker are enjoyable make the day go by.  I get to leave at 3pm"
good,"The GM is wonderful to work for. She is fair and honest, and wants her employees to succeed. They do offer vacation and 401k to full time employees. It is high energy and you have to be a quick learner."
good,My typical day at work consists on me tending to customers. Satisfying customers. I love my coworkers their cool. what I really do like about my job is that I get to meet and interact with people.
good,"This was my first actual job thanks to a job fair they were having. I started off working as a nugget/fries person, then moved to being the dining room closer, and then having my final position at Wendy's as the drive-thru closer. With closing, it would typically start out as usual business taking orders and cleaning dishes in between customers. Once it got closer to closing, which for my store was midnight, we would start to break certain things down and were pretty much set to cook to order, to ensure freshness since the amount of customers we would get after 10 was totally random. Sometimes we were busy, other times we maybe had 1 person. This job is another case for me where the best part was the people I worked with. I made several friends here and I loved my shift managers as well as my store manager. The hardest part for me was the customers. Drive-thru became very frustrating since half the time people are not paying attention when they order or they drive by having no idea what they want. We were expected to get really good drive-thru times pretty often so that made it really annoying. Overall, I would say this is another good place to start off your working career, since the pay is nowhere near great. Then again, that is just how fast food is. It is not really a hard job at all to actually do to be honest. The group I would probably recommend it most to would be teenagers in high school looking to start accruing some work experience."
good,it was busy everyday and of course one of my coworkers always came to help and i loved that it was a good experience working there made a good relationship some of my co-workers there.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I loved working with both the crew, managers, and guests. As an assistant manager, I kept track of food cost, sales, labor, etc. I did some of the truck orders. I managed the crew well. I also worked at all 5 stores in Billings, MT, Cody,WY, and  Dickinson, ND. I worked for Wendy's for a little over 8 years. I left because I felt it was time for a change, and wanted to change occupations but still work with customers. Besides that's what I'm great at, is helping customers."
good,I liked this job but the organization was all out of order . The management was terrible but i loved my customers the most.
good,"alright employment, no benefits, decent hours, decent cleanliness, decent amount of training, horrible managers, horrible ownership"
good,"A typical day at work would include customer service as well as coaching team members, making sure everyone stayed on task, dealing with cash, counting out registers. Management wasn't very good, a lot of animosity and gossip went on. The hardest part of the job would have to be running the restaurant optimally while having limited staffing. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the free meals."
good,When I first started at Wendy's I liked it alot but the job itself became to demanding for a minimum wage job.
good,"Working for Wendy's is truly quite a lot of responsibility. I enjoyed my job, would of liked more team work. The opportunity to advance at Wendy's is quite great."
good,Very fun experience when everyone is working together. Co-workers kept laughs for days. Hardest part of working here was the new management. They were to serious for fast food. They came In and made everything frustrating.
good,"During a typical day at work I help customers, take orders, and collect payment.  I am with customer contact all day long.  This job is pretty good because my co-workers and managers are all nice.  The hardest part of this job is standing all day long although I am used to it.  The most enjoyable part is working with other people who are good team members.  I learned all the positions, although I usually work drive-thru."
good,"My Typical Day At Work Is Me Doing What I Need To Do To Get My Tasks Done And To Get Things Done On Time. From My First Job I Learned That No Matter What I Put my Mind To I Can Do It And Make Things Happen For Myself Its All About Patience & Guidance. Time Management Skills Will Have To Be Me Preparing My Day Before It Even Starts So Then That Way Every Thing Is Organized. My co-workers were nice and very understanding to me, just some of the managers. The Hardest Part Of My Job Was To Hold My Tongue From Being Out Of My Character . The Most Enjoyable Part Is When We Would Come In With Great Attitudes And Have A Fantastic Night.!"
good,it was normal I alrady had skills the co-workers were okay it was not hard I really didn't like it at all
good,"To begin with Wendy's Deli was one of the best work experiences i ever had at this place i was part of a team that felt more like a family and our goal all together was to serve the customers and make them have a enjoyable meal. At this place i used to serve customers their food, take their orders, arrange their tables, and help them out with any questions or concerns. i learned how to work in a team to achieve a certain goal everyday and how to put a smile on customers face by treating them right and having  positive attitude and a smile in your face. The Hardest part of my job was not been able to receive a customer in because the place was already full, the most enjoyable part was cleaning at night when the place closed."
good,the hardest part of my job was having to stand over the hot grill every day.
good,"most days i stayed on the grill for the duration of my shift. There is very little break in the customer flow. I learned how to prep and use a flat top grill. Management knew how to have fun while still being productive. They did a good job of keeping the morale of the workers high. The co-workers were all good people and were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job would be the fast pace and the hot temperatures, but you get used to it quick enough."
good,i loved working with management they was great people to work with.
good,Gave me good experience for a first job. Learned a lot of different skills and how to multitask in a medium to fast paced environment.
good,"I used cash handling skills to operate the cash register for the front counter and the drive-thru. I learned how to work well under pressure, and I learned how to utilize a small amount of time to handle a large deal of duties. The management team worked with the crew members as a team. All of the managers made great examples of how teamwork is the most effective strategy when things need to be done accordingly. The co-workers worked well together, but some days they seem to just do their part and go home. The hardest part of the job only came about when the team members did not put forth the proper amount of team effort. The most enjoyable part of the job was the adrenaline I was able to encounter during the busy lunch rush of the day."
good,A normal day at work would be arriving at 11 am and working until 4 or later. I learned patients and great customer service skills. My management was horrible they are the main reason I left Wendy's. My co-workers were pretty nice people and I enjoyed working with them because it made the job seem easier. The hardest part of my job had to be costumers throwing drinks or food in your face if it was made incorrectly. I loved everything about my job because I was always help costumers and supplying them with the things they wanted and needed.
good,always moving no quick breaks to breath always have something to do and have to move fast and catch on to multi-tasking well.
good,"Working in a high volume restaurant.  Introducing new products and procedures as needed.  Shift walk thru's and essential part"
good,"Coming in you jump right into your position. The best part was being able to work various positions from drive through, to the front counter, to food prep. I enjoyed working for Wendy's. My team all worked together to get the job done."
good,"buen ambiente, buenos compeñeros, aperndi a dar buena atencion al cliente a tener mucha responsabilidad"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of handling the cash register, preparing food and then cleaning. What i have learned from Wendy's is the Customer is ALWAYS right. Management could be approved on. Co workers were pretty much good to work with. The hardest part of the job was the miss communication between manangement and the crew..that really needs to be worked on."
good,working for Wendys was really good I learned how to work a lot of stations in the work place as meeting others .
good,"Wendy's Aruba is a great place to work , fast and fun . i had nothing against anyone working there because they we all so nice and helped out who ever needed help . BUT i worked there for almost 2 months and i liked it , but thanks to the air vent where the smoke from the fries station needed to sirculate didn't work properly and i had to worked 6 hours straight at that station , i inhaled too much . black smoke and when i tried to tell the manager , she would just look at me and walk away . i ended up going home , and the day after that i was admitted to the hospital because i couldn't breathe and my chest was in so much pain . I stayed in the hospital for a week at the most for treatment and after about 2 weeks , if i had asthma before that , no one knew cause i never had any problems , but thanks to wendy's , i got asthma at the age of 20, i went back to work and worked the whole day , just when i was about to go home , the store manager told me '' you're a great worker and a fast learner , you follow procedures and work well with the team , but i'm sorry to say that you will no longer be working for us due the fact that you called in sick before your 2 month period and we don't know if you will call in sick again in the near future '' . a year has already passed since then and everywhere i apply for a job , i don't get accepted because of that incident ."
good,"a typical workday would include getting to work and start taking orders, i have learned how to work quickly with other people. management is ok they help out when we need some extra help, co-workers are helpful sometimes when they choose to be. the hardest part of the job was during a rush and being short handed. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting good feedback about my performance."
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo el cual para mi fue una escuela ya que fue mucho lo que aprendí que hoy puedo poner en practica diariamente. Compañeros de trabajo excelentes, lo que mas me gusto fue aprender algo nuevo cada día y poder tratar diariamente con el publico y ayudarles."
good,"Overnight shift was a blast. Great people made the work not seem like work. everyone worked together and got along. Management worked well with crew members. I would work for them again if I could. The only negative is that though the manager would have hired me back, due to company policy she could not. I had to leave due to a family member needed temporary constant care due to heart surgery. I wish they would have been more understanding to employee situations."
good,The job was one of my first so it really taught me how to balance work and school and life in general. The hardest part was learning how to cook at the certain foods and to make sure the order was done right.
good,"You may not get much money for how hard you work but it does teach you many things such as being a hard worker. "
good,working here was really fun and exciting. it has great opportunity for advancement and self development.
good,"A typical day at work would start off with coming to the job site, Going to the back to the store to was hands and get ready for the day. Next I would go to the cash and count and double count the cash then write down how much is there. Then I would either start my shift either on the grill or at the front or drive through cashier."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It would be busy at times where hard work was expected. I usually was on front cash because I am very personable however I was well trained on every position. On less busy times I would get the chance to engage with co-workers who I liked all of them. I learned how to deal with people, customers, how to solve problems. My managers would rely on me because I am very hard working and will put what has to be done before anything. They would call me when they needed an extra person to come in and I was always willing to. The hardest part was when customers would get upset over things (wrong order usually) however I would make the customer smile again. Everyday I loved going to work, I have been here for almost 5 years and I still loved going to work because the people I worked with were so friendly."
good,"I worked various areas in the kitchen, learned various skills such as better cash handle, and delegation.  Seen a lot of managers and co worker go though.  Working at a fast food place was the hardest part.  But working with people was great"
good,Management at Wendy's was disrespectful to employees and also they never did any work. The hardest part was closing every night so I had to make sure the whole store was spotless before I left.
good,"Taking orders, making sure the customer receives everything hot and fresh and they leave happy and satisfied. Crew are always pleasant and willing to learn."
good,it sucked I got under paid over worked 16 hour shifts never saw my family
good,"Working in fast food you have your good days and bad days, but a majority of them were good."
good,"Wendy's has its problems just like any other place. Overall the people or crew are all great and enjoyable. I learned very quick on all the positions and I assume would be considered one of the stronger workers there. Management can be unfair and favorable at times. I like to be appreciated and awarded or acknowledged for doing a good job. That is something that is lacking in this company. The most enjoyable part was the people. We all had a good time and got along, but at the same time know when to get serious. The work is not very difficult and the hours are very flexible. Overall I am glad this is one of my first jobs because of all the people I met and skills I learned."
good,Not a bad company but great to get experience if your 16. I wouldn't stay there after turning 18 though.
good,"It's definitely work, but when everyone is doing what they're supposed to, the operation runs very smoothly. Even in the face of a Sunday morning church rush, It can be a pretty low stress environment. However, when people slack off and the manager doesn't correct that right away, it can be difficult to get and order out quickly. Having to wait longer for food usually upsets hungry people. Besides that it's a good place to work if you're going to school or just getting out of high school."
good,"Working in the fast food industry isn't always easy. Some days are easier than others, or just go by faster than others. A typical day at Wendy's is satisfying hungry customers, while keeping a stocked and clean work environment. It isn't a terrible job, but in my eyes, you must be people friendly, and be able to work under pressure and under stress. Also when something comes up wrong, you should solve the problem and fix the situation right away, instead of arguing or blaming another."
good,"The only thing i enjoyed was the staff on board, a typical day at work is having your Samoan boss yell at you all the time. I learnt allot of things but not the right way the first time. There management train staff the wrong way then the big bosses from Auckland come down and tell you you did it all wrong, my co-workers are amazing. The hardest part was getting yelled at all the time. The most enjoyable part were the co-workers."
good,enjoy working for wendy'sI learned all about P&L running shifts..overall I could have maked more money for all the hard work i done running with GM at the age of 22.. I have 20 some yrs. myself exper.
good,"this job is well with first jobs, fast passed and learn the basics of restaurant businesses "
good,"I enjoyed learning this type of work over the years, i learned to grow with this company.  Have alot of experience, crew member and management.  miss my co-workers, very friendly to the public."
good,Wendy's was a good company to work for just didn't like the pay and the store was going thought a lots of new change with the store and management team.
good,Good at first until business slowed down hours got cut then but when business was good we got busy must sweep parking lot degreaser and brush then rense afterwards take out trash 
good,Wendy's is a great company to work for. The customers are not friendly always but you get use to it. I really like the fact that they worked around my school schedule.
good,working driv thru as cashier. getting food put the window fast and right.
good,"Good job, but a very heavy work load for grillmen. Definitely a fast paced environment."
good,Another opportunity to learn customer service skills first hand. I liked the closeness of the staff and management here. We were always a team and working together to accomplish our tasks. I was able to work mymanagerial duties and always be available to the staff when they needed me.
good,Very Busy and fast paced at peek times of the day. Lots of opportunity for growth.
good,"You can learn about the food service industry from a young age, and be taught responsibility. But the wage is hardly enough to live on unless your management."
good,-Muy divertido trabajo
good,fun place to work good because it is very busy. management was very friendly but be prepared for different shifts
good,The crew and customers were a highlight to working there. The motivation behind the GM was inspirational. Felt like my skills and abilities were appreciated when working there
good,fast paced friendly envirioment
good,"communication,exciting workconditions,it difficult to persuade customer to purchase your product it requires persuasion."
good,I did everything at Wendy's from cashier operation to food preparation to cleaning.
good,very good training/ good benefit focus on all aspect of restaurant example food cost/labor/service/cleanliness.
good,Its a okay place but i need more money i need to support my daughter.
good,This job was my second job after i worked at KFC for over a year. The environment was good just the pay was not at all. Gave my 2 weeks notice and went to find a different job.
good,A typical day at Wendys was either opening or closing the store with other employees. Delegating is the key with this particular job and speedy service.
good,I worked for wendys for about four years when i was in high school. It was a very fast paced job. I recieved employee of the Month while working there. I also recieved two raises. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest Part of the Job was working late at night and going to school the next morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers and building great friendships. Another enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Wendy's is very different from most fast food restaurants. They actually care about their customers and want to make sure they receive the proper attention. However, beware of unbelievably rude customers. No matter what, you must always have a smile on your face."
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed by experience working with Wendy's. I learned valuable customer service skills that I can use in future jobs, and worked with a great bunch of people. My only issues with the management in the restaurant that I worked in is that they were very unorganized, made working with the top managers overly stressful, and they did not provide me with proper information when I moved for school and wanted to come back for the holidays. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers and working with head management. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet nice customers and talking to the older people who came in regularly."
good,"My typical day at work was that I either prepared food, cleaned, was a cashier, got all my food safety in. I learned a lot about food, and hygiene cause that's a lot of what the fast food was about. my management was okay, I mean they had there falls but it wasn't the best, my GM I loved though. she tried to make everyone happy and did the best she could. my co-workers were okay, there half the reason why I quit. so that wasn't the best. the hardest part on that job was when you worked hard everyday you work, and some people just stood around and didn't help or anything. my most enjoyable part was the learning experience, I believe I learned a lot being there for two years."
good,I think this job is best suited for someone that is in the process of getting their life on track or someone that isnt looking for something long term. I have put my time in at this job and now I think it is time for me to move on and start my career.
good,Was everything I expected to be when starting my first job. Enjoy my co-workers and it put me in a diverse work atmosphere.
good,Typical work day was working on fries or sandwiches. Management picked favors and was not consistent. Co-workers were very fun and friendly. Hardest part of the job was lunch and dinner rushes.
good,"i have liked working for the company but there is no room for advancement . i need to make more a hour and being there for so long i dont do that ,"
good,Great training ground and people development. The co workers are great.
good,"Work is sometimes busy which helped me learn how to keep up a fast pace, management is sometimes good the employees are the same. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the personalities but i get past that, the enjoyable part of the job is making a customer happy especially the children."
good,"handle the register, customer's service, food handling, dining room cleanliness, stocking. Hardest part is being able to stand and help for a really long time"
good,Real busy days were the best it made the time go by and you had fun working with some great peoples.
good,Fast pace . I have learn to work in fast pace . magnament was friendly .Co worker were messy
good,I enjoyed my time at Wendy's where I built friendships and the ability to thrive in a fast paced and noisey atmosphere.
good,i usually like to work with this company because there is so much fun.Second thing is that i learned how work with other culture of people.
good,"I have worked in fast food for 3 years after moving to this area. Although my background is in computers and software, I took a job as a crew member and quickly moved up to General Manager & Training Store Manager. I have learned a great deal in this field. It is very fast paced and people oriented. We deal with a lot of cash flow, and also the management of crew members and managers. Since we are a certified training store, I am able to train managers and then when that is completed, we send them to their ""home store"". Every Monday morning I do what we call the ""end of month"", which includes inventory, cash, sales, and labor evaluations. The hardest part of this job is the physical demand. I work a minimum of 50 hours a week. 90% of that is spent on my feet. This has been taking a tole on me over the last year. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people. I love the interaction with both customers and staff."
good,Wendys is a great place to work when your looking for part-time. It is nothing to build a future on.
good,Worked during and after H.S. then went back and went to get my CDL while there.
good,"it's an ok company,but lacks the quality of life for it's managers."
good,"If you like to work in a fast paced environment or need some xtra money, than this is a o.k. job."
good,"My Opinion, I dislike working at Wendy's. The people there give me the hardest time and I can't take it no longer! It just has to stop, the employees are always talking about stuff that has nothing to do with working. The General Manager is so loud that people who sit in to eat always come up to us and ask us to tell her to be more quiet, she is just rude and wont."
good,"My overall review was great, i was first working on southwest wendy's and then i was later on transferred to the new store. 1800 First Security way, it went great for a couple months, we always kept busy, never a time where we we're not doing work. The workplace was a good environment."
good,The company is full of diversity and many of the employees working in human resources always interact and encourage new hire employees that they can progess and advance quickly within the company and grow and excel depending if that's something they might consider.
good,"Working hours were flexible, easy to pick up tasks you have to do. Busy but easy to get through. Hardest part of working there was drive through when it's busy and you're alone to take orders and collect cash"
good,Constantly on the move because it is a high volume restaurant chain. Heavily depended on team work and communication. Super stressful environment but they're pretty flexible on scheduling.
good,good group to work with when going to school- they have had many managers come thru there since i have been there- alot of high school kids work there and need more direct supervision than having a 17 year old in charge
good,its was an ok job to work for i did cashier i also worked the drive thru. I washed dishes and i also cleaned the dining room. It was a very laid back atmosphere but fast paced
good,Honestly working here was the worst decision i was constantly feeling left out and the management wasn’t good at all they never really cared for their employees only themselves
good,"Overall it was an okay experience up until I realized that I had no life outside school and Wendy’s, they made it impossible for me to do anything. Took up my whole weekend and my days off were always in the middle of the week so while in school I never got a day to myself."
good,"It was cool working there especially with all the new people I might. However the pay wasn't satisfying, but what can you expect from a fast food place."
good,I enjoyed working there. I could actually work long shifts. Most of my coworkers were horrible to me due to my autism and other mental illnesses which I approached management about but not much was done to help me feel safe at work again.
good,Wendy's taught me a lot about time management and improved my communication skills. My patience also increased by interacting with customers and making sure they had a satisfactory visit at Wendy's. The overall environment at Wendy's is very welcoming.
good,"Wendy's is a fast food restaurant. Rushes all times of the day. The best way. to get you through the day, is learn, learn, learn your position and all tasks that entail that position. Serving time is crucial, and though there are multiple rushes you have to remember your kindness and attentiveness to the customer. Listening to their requests. Find your routine that works best for you that's in a timely manner and efficient. Ask questions and don't be afraid to ask for new opportunities of learning all the parts and positions of the kitchen. They come in handy when your teammates don't show or call in."
good,Of course the restaurant business prepares you for long hours and 6 and sometimes 7 days a week. I laugh at the population that works 40hrs and off every weekend and holidays. I have worked and average of 90hrs on site and then phone calls after work.
good,Overall used to be a great place to work but now has gone to grass. They won’t allow us the staff that we need to run smoothly. Our manager is great just owner isn’t great.
good,"my experience has been very nice so far, the coworkers are nice and the whole operation runs smoothly the majority of the time. not a bad job to have as a first job or to make money part time"
good,I just don’t want to work at Wendy’s anymore they don’t give me a lot of hrs they don’t like to work as a team. I am the only one that cares about Wendy’s!
good,"Provided services to customers and employee’s and alway made sure customers are satisfied ."
good,The Wendys Company has gone through its fair share of growing pains. Once a family owned and operated company that has at times painfully transformed into a publicly help company.
good,Fantastic establishment to begin your working career. The work associates are extremely friendly and helpful. Wendy’s has always been one of my favorite restaurants.
good,"fun experience for someone beginning in the work field of food service. Management was fair and helpful although growth in the company is there, the rate of pay was not. $8/hour to supervise people making more than you was not worth it."
good,"Wendy's was the first job that I ever had, I was hired right when I turned 16. The manager hired me right on the spot during my interview and I was able to start orientation that same day. Working at Wendy's requires someone to be a hard worker and someone who is responsible. You always needed to find coverage whenever you called out. I was actually suspended for a week at one point because I called out sick and could not find coverage. I had to quit because I needed to focus on school, and management was more than understanding."
good,"Usually fast paced, we were often understaffed so I found myself working multiple positions with little issue. Building rapport with customers was never a problem no matter how irate they can possibly be."
good,This job was always busy and stressful at the same time. There would always be 1 or 2 co workers that just never wanted to do stuff which made things more stressful in the end.
good,"I think it was a good job all in all. The general manager was great, the other managers not so much. They were very childish and rude to there employees. They wouldn’t work with my school schedule because I’m still in high school. They would make me stay til 11:30pm almost every school night. The pay was decent. The drama was just not worth it."
good,"Chemistry produced among various employees ensures good teamwork and work flow throughout the rush period. If everyone is on the same page mentally, then all will fall into place and all will be in sync."
good,"In all, my time at Wendy's has been how you would expect a first job. Your learning everything at once and trying to catch up with your fellow coworkers. The hardest part of the job was having to do the drive through. Most of the time its you taking orders, getting the money, and bagging the orders, so its a lot."
good,ive learnt alot over there even made a new friend wendys is a great job to work and the staff there is great the most part about working there is making new friends and getting to know them more and more everyday
good,The store manager and higher management treat there employees awful. They are always hiring because they lose employees due to the way they are treated.
good,"A typical work day was like busy but yet calming. I've learned patience, work ethics, cleanliness. My hardest part of my job was patience. My most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of the customers."
good,This job made me excellent in fast paced environments such as preparing food for customers in a timely manner and great customer service leading the customer to be well satisfied with their experience here.
good,Wendy was close to home an I also had advantage to replaced someone if didn’t show up for work . I always wash my hands before starting work counted my drawer down made sure I had enough stocks in front of restaurants. When I had no customer I always went clean tables an use another cloth rag to clean chairs . Go check on restroom . If I was low on stock out front I would refill cups & etc . Also stock behind counter . Once done if I had no customer I would help out at drive Thur or go wash dishes or sweep. But alway kept eye on front . Always wash hands before taking orders or touching handling food .
good,"Working at Wendy's was a very interesting experience. As a fast-food restaurant everything was required to be completed in a very timely manner. Unfortunately, the store I work for was very understaffed, especially on the weekends when I work. Usually it was me and a manager and one other co-worker. All the managers work incredibly hard there and also very long hours. However, the atmosphere was still light most of the time and we were still able to serve our customers efficiently."
good,I loved this company. There are great people that work in the Denver market. It’s unfortunate that changes that have been made under the new leadership is not employee friendly and guest satisfaction is driven by intimidation rather than support.
good,"typical day was working drive-thru window, washing dishes."
good,"Working there for work was good, though the managment team and the team itself, are not so professional. I did learn to work faster and communicate better. Hardest part of the job would be the rush, there is a rush at 12 and at 5pm, especially when you are new it is a bit harder but it is managable! It takes time to get better with the rush. It is a very good first place."
good,"At the Wendy's I was a GM at, it was a fun workplace and couching was done to improve leadership skills. There was always a daily challenge to improve yourself."
good,my day at Wendy's working on the grill and making what else meats that are needed.i learned how to grill chicken and beef the right way. the workplace culture is diverse. the hardest part of the job is maintaining all the meats that is needed. most enjoyable went it time to take out the trash.
good,Wendys is a great first job. Can be a great place to meet new people and challenge yourself.  All things go well when the store is staffed with hard workers who cummunicate well with eachother and having a fun but stern supervisor on your shift.
good,"Wendy's was a fast paced environment. Co-workers were great, management was ok. Company as a whole had some things to work on. Always meeting new people and updating new things"
good,"As my first job working at Wendy's, it was fun until everything went left . New mangers coming in &lots of minors . I was recently a cashier/stock host , I was always on time , I even came in on most of my off days but people do feel that can take advantage if you in the wrong ways"
good,I personally found it stressful and fast-paced because I have health problems and I would get light-headed and feel like I was gonna pass out. I was also usually the sandwich maker 99% of the time.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers but aside from that it was fast-paced and very confusing. I never had training I was basically thrown into the lunch rush on my first day. I wasn't paid much and was never given any hours so it was like pocket money every two weeks. Management was okay. You just have to be ready to do anything, so observe and basically learn on your own."
good,I have had a great time working there and wish I could get another chance to work there. My co-workers were amazing and also had great jokes. They all have sarcasm and talk to the costumers the same way that they talk to you even better!!!
good,good job to work at. treated like a family member. Crew and manager go out the way to help with school and family schedule. Willing to work with problems that arise at work or home.
good,"Wendy's is a overall great place to work for, from students, to older adults. This company has many positions to move up, we all strive to give all our customers friendly fast service.. That W.O.W service to bring them back."
good,The general manager will push you to your fullest. Sometimes people dont take it the right way so there is a lot of people that quit. But the managers will make sure you have a solid foundation for your future career. i loved my job there. I learned so much from the small things.
good,Although my employment was brief at Wendy's I did enjoy my time there. I work as a cook and drive-thru operator and worked frequently throughout the weekday and weekend
good,"Wendy's is a good job.  The work days where nice.  I lurnd teem work,and how to talk to people. The mist enjoyable part of the job was the crew members. Wendy's provided a positive work environment."
good,The pay is not good u don't get good  Benefits I work for Wendy's since 2012 it was all good we had good benefits until the sold some stores to Haza foods then all the benefits stop
good,it is a fast-paced working place learn how to do interviews management was very helpful is a friendly atmosphere the hardest part of the job is dealing with the different personalities the most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer happy
good,I worked there with my cousin but i got offered another job so i took it even though i didnt make as much there. I was young and stupid but it was a lesson in it's self
good,"The two Wendy's that I have gone to did very well at training me and easing me into the workforce. By the end of my time there the only things I didn't have much training on was building the burgers and managing the store. It is a very fast job with a high likelihood that customers will get on my nerves more than the management will. With that said, there is little often done to relieve such stresses. I often continued the same position, as I was the only person who could run the front end."
good,wendys was a good job it was slow and steady I learned the skills and became the best but I had to quit it was to far and I had no car at the time....
good,"wendys was a great company, had okay management. very cultural and fun. a typical day at work was super busy i managed cash registers made food and took care of customers. there wasnt anything hard about working there, very fast paced at times,"
good,Wendy's didn't pay me enough for the labor I put in & I didn't get many hours. I worked hard & got the experience so I'm not mad but I think they should raise there pay to at least $9.00/hour.
good,I needed money so i put up with a lot they called me in a lot it really depends on who you worked with if the shift was gonna be fun or not but overall it isn't a bad place but not a great place to work
good,"Good management of their team members and they take good care of their customers as well as their employees. Everything ran smoothly day by day, it’s light work."
good,Good overall environment. Teaches you how to work as a team and to trust others. Allows you to go to school and balance working. Allows you to have the days off you have requested.
good,They pay good . As a restaurant they are so clean and nice  the manager are so good and friendly . they help all employer as their child . they train them as they  get train .
good,"At Wendys we were always being productive, no matter what. As a manager at 18 years old, I never sat down to take a break. I always would be watching the crew, helping the crew, and making sure things would run smoothly. At Wendys times could be stressful but it feels like family there; although, were all very different."
good,My experience at Wendy's fluctuated depending on the attitudes of management. I had high days and I've had very low days. There was days I would come and pick up slack from the next worker which I didn't mind but I did not receive any acknowledgment or appreciation. Management lacks charisma.
good,"Working for Wendy's it can be stressful depending on the position you are employed as. Customers can be rather difficult to handle. Keeping the place up to clean standards keeps it quick-paced alot of the time. Management in general are there making sure their employees are working hard. The hardest part of the job is to make sure orders come out the exact way ordered, keeping the restaurants up to cleaning standards, and making sure all customers stay satisfied."
good,Lots of demands daily.must be able to multitask. Most shifts are ran short people requiring you to work multiple positions. Some people are held to different standards.
good,Working a wendys was ok I didnt have a problem with management I had issues with the people in which they hired. Management was easy going and very good at training you to do the job also was nice and considerate
good,"Great experience for my first general manager position, a lot of training and of coarse many hours. The stores makes the most of each employee, productivity is monitored closely and food safety standards upheld!"
good,"Oportunidad de crecimiento super buena, gran ambiente laboral, sin embargo el salario podria mejorar en relacion a las responsabilidades y requerimientos."
good,I Just Started School And it Was Hard For Me To Arrange My Schedule to do everything I had to do but now that I got it together I think I got it . Wendys Would Be A Great Job For People Who Like Fast Paces
good,"A typical day is go, go, go! Wendy's is known for their quick service inside and in the drive thru.  You will need good hand-eye coordination and patience to work fast food."
good,"The most enjoyed part of the job was the customers.My key responsibilities include greeting customers, submitting orders, and operating the cash register. In some cases, I will make food preparation and also drive-thru duties."
good,management was pretty cool and laid back . I leaded how to take order fast. Wendy have been in business for a very long time. hardest part about the job was making the food because you have to really have patience. the most i enjoyed on the job was my crew i loved them and the customers.
good,Wendy's was my first job ever. I learned a lot there. They taught me to work in a quick pace but doing things properly and not shoving things. It was a good experience working there
good,"A typical day would go by fast but not always easy. Management was helpful most of the time, and the most enjoyable part about the job was prepping the food. It was overall a good workplace."
good,"It was a nice job for the moment. The people I worked with were great, and the management at Wendy's was fantastic. The reason why I am looking for new work is low benefits and pay."
good,It's was better when it wasn't a franchise but it's good to work here they focus on customer service alot and quality. One of the best fast food places to be
good,It was a good place t work at. I liked it a lot when I first started working there but then they started to hirer more people and they cut my hours from 20 to 30 hours a week to 6 a week
good,"Wendy's was an okay place for a start.  The company will allow individuals to move up and grow if you are willing to work.  I like that the most about the company.  Unfortunately, some of the supervisors are not understanding when it comes to family/personal crisis.  I had to leave the company because I became homeless which created a hardship for me."
good,"A typical day at work would be opening up, mopping the floors, and cleaning up the restaurants. fast pace and fun to work at. The most enjoyable parts would be greeting the customers"
good,While working at wendys I learned all the positions and they found i was best at drive thru. The main problem i had was with some of the managers that i worked with not helping when i was busy or they chose to stock before helping anyone. A typical day at wendys consisted of myself and another employee working together to get orders out as fast as we could even though she was on sandwiches and i was in the actual drive thru position. The work environment was fun and happy until it was really busy and no one came to help us employees. The most enjoyable was working with a good team and seeing our guest leave with a smile.
good,"It was fast paced. Sometimes it was stressful, but it depends if you can deal with alot. If you can deal with tough situations, you are good. It is a great experience."
good,"I really enjoyed working at wendys, the employees are very friends and they pushed team work a lot which I enjoyed. I would recommend working for wendys because it's a great starter Job, and it helps to build off of."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working various positions as needed.I cooked hot meals for the customers, washed the dishes, empty the trash cans and made salads."
good,"Store manager always took personal opinions and life outside of work into consideration. She was very thoughtful and kind. The paying salary could use a bit of improvement, but all in all I enjoyed working here"
good,"A day at Wendy's was basically easy wasn't too stressful , one thing i learned from working at that company was the food thats made was pretty fresh. Management was good she was fair and a really nice, work culture was good everyone got along for the most part. There wasn't a hard part on the job for me, most enjoyable part were he coworkers i was with."
good,"I always enjoyed the task of putting smiles on peoples faces, but here I could barely enjoy it. I had to teach myself just about everything and if I wanted to advance in a certain area I had to ask."
good,"Come in check crew schedule,check product to insure you have enough,while working there I learned how to calculate my daily usage to ensure I had enough,had a good management staff,the hardest part of the job was customers who try to get over,my most enjoyable part was trying to top the hourly sales from other managers"
good,I was there for 5 years and the group that was there when i was were a good group of people the manager was awesome i liked the people i worked with they were a good group
good,"Wendys is a repetitive job that can get boring. Although the people there can be fun to work with, the salary is not very good. Raises are very rare. And the hours are quite long."
good,"This was a good job, all in all, but honestly, the culture and overall work ethic here was terrible. People always complained, and there were arguments and disrespect abounding, even towards the manager. It seemed specific to this location, but it was still no fun."
good,"Very fun and fast pace moving job, managers and supervisors made sure we were on our A game. Sometimes while customers, had problems with cutomers they would be rude. Overall that was the only problem."
good,It was A good start for me to learn the workforce and adapt to the customer service. Management was good all though it could have been more organized.
good,Working at Wendy's was a great experience. You learn how to cooperate with different personalities and how to manage time. It's an easy job for the most part you just have to keep up with everyone around you. The hard part comes when you get busy. The more customers you have the faster you have to work.
good,"Wendy's is a fun place to work at and the time does fly while on the clock, it's hard work when closing but its rewarding for the body. as far as teamwork goes its all luck of the draw some days everyone's ready to go guns blazing, some days you have the bad apples who don't care or just don't want to be there. Management is another luck of the draw, in my case a few managers were far to nice and allowed things to happen but kept them under wraps as to not lose their personal standing in advancement and some managers were role models and phenomenal leaders."
good,great environment to work in as a first job.Very helpful management.its a very first paced job especial during lunch hours. you can definitively learn alot of different position here though.
good,"pretty decent, my managers were nice and the job was not too hard i felt my work was appreciated and everyone had respect for me. i somewhat had a good time at work depending on the day which isn't true with most companies"
good,A typical work day at Wendys was just working the drive-thru window. I didnt work much because i was also in school but i would definitely recommed this job
good,They're very clean. The mangers spread rumors sum of themoney not all of them. I loved customers. They also keep they're  food update and it doesn't be cold.
good,"If you want a job where you can move up within the company quick THIS IS IT!!!!! One minute you are a crew member, the next you an Assistant Manager. Go for it."
good,"I learned a lot about food preparation and storing food properly, but I did not like the hours of work nor did I like the work enviorment. I do not wish to work for wendys again"
good,"Cooking is another passion that I have in my life; however, if I had my way of cooking, seasoning would be at an all-time high.  Every burger that I would put on that grill would have a good dash of salt and pepper on it for excellent flavor.  I enjoyed working the grill though.  It made me feel good that I served a member of my community or my country with delicious food everyday."
good,"It wasn't a bad experience. The day starts off by preparing food for the day and making sure the building is clean. The lunch hours are stressful, but the employees motivate each other and provide help when needed."
good,I was a cook n cashier at Wendy's and I had fun experience working there it's great for a student in high school or college to work at you job security is high there base on how much you take the job serious.
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's. Although, like anywhere else there are things that could be improved. The pay is decent, I rate it in the middle range compared to other fast good places. You don't receive any benefits unless you have worked there for a year and full time. Which basically means not many of the employees get benefits. We have gone through 4 General managers in 3 months which has been chaotic. Certain crew members are treated differently than others, because management doesn't want to deal with parents of underage workers so a lot of employees get away with slacking (at least at my location.) Which is terrible for over 18 employees because we pick up all of the slack. And management claims that they are paid less than almost any other fast good management.  Other than that I enjoy the environment. I work cashier and drive through third shift."
good,enjoy my job its fast paced but easy to learn customers are friendly offer to help with a problem when I can they appreciate the fast service and the cleanliness of the restaurant
good,"While having a little bit of fun but always sticking to the job. At times it would be slow so we could visit and be friendly, but at other times we would really push out orders in a timely manner."
good,"Coming into work was different each day depending on the day of the week. Sometimes slow with only a few with customers in the drive through. On the weekends, were our busier days which would have a flood of people in the restaurant and the drive thru. Whether hectic or peaceful, I made sure to do my work at the same quick speed required for the fast food business. I enjoyed working every day for Wendys and I liked the fast pace environment."
good,"I enjoyed it, for my first job.  I would have preferred not to have to do it while I was in high school still, but it was an ideal first job.  Great people to work for."
good,Its a nice job that pays but i get no benifits and i dont like the working conditions. I learned to work fast. I enjoy being sociable with the customers.
good,"good job flexible with schedule, made some amazing friends while working there. its not the best job but it puts money in your pocket and its worth while."
good,Working for the company has thought me a large group of skills. From multi tasking small business understanding and profit goals. Family oriented for the coostumers and they strive to provide their guest the best service they can.
good,"Working in Wendy's was fun at first,but then  a lot of people really just start talking about other people behide their backs even some of the bosses."
good,Working there has its days meaning its not always fun but working for the people seeing them happy with their service makes my job all the more worth it
good,"Es una empresa en donde adquieres mucha experiencia y aprendes muchas cosas, a diario convives con muchas personas diferentes."
good,I would go in at 10 o'clock and stock up whatever night crew didn't stock up and start flipping burgers. Learned to be fast paced and manage my time while working there. Managers were OK.The workplace was fast paced so everybody had to be quick on their feet. Hardest part of the job was how fast paced it was while the most enjoyable part was that we got to have free drinks.
good,"I love they work with my schedule and co-workers/ mangement are great I have learned how to take,make and serve orders as well as clean the kitchen."
good,"No two days were the same always."
good,I was a Co-Manager for my store. Typical day for me was running all aspects of the business and office work. The people i worked with is what made my job so enjoyable. I will always appreciate the knowledge I obtained at Wendy's it helped me succeed in whats came after.
good,"It a typical fast food place. Very much like high school.The coworkers can either be great or terrible. The customers also very. Most of them seem to to feel entitled and demand stuff, mostly the older generation."
good,"Day at work great"
good,"Wendys was my first and one of the funnies , fast paced environments. A typical day at work I would either work in drive thru or at front end serving customers who chose to dine in. At Wendys I learned to work fast paced and multi-task. The hardest part of the job was closing (if you closed). The best part is always the experience ."
good,"Most of the co-workers can be friendly, but others tend to gossip about other workers. very fast paced during rush hours other times it's just really slow, the schedule was really flexible with our daily lives I enjoyed meeting familiar faces and becoming friends with some of my co-workers.Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with line time of getting orders out. drive thru is my weakest spot. Typical day was working, joking around, and cleaning, but getting paid at the end of it all is the best feeling ever."
good,The restaurant is good with learning what you need to know to make a sandwich. And the training is good. The people tend to act like a family even though they don't always get along. The food is pretty good their is always a deal.Or a new meal being advertised.
good,"Wendys were a good job it was just the hours they give 20 hours a week "
good,Co workers are great it is a great place to work but only when the mamagement is on the same page. the hardest part of the job is that the customer is always right no matter what.
good,"Wendy is great, I like to work there. The manager are understanding about a lot of things. I work Tuesday thru Friday, Saturday and Sunday I am off,  the hard part is that sometime YU have to do more than one thing at once."
good,Get place to work if you like fast paced work.  It can sometimes be stressful when you don't have enough employees to cover the volume business
good,The night before your shift you plan out where you want each employee to ensure best service to each customer that was always good pre planning. When you get that right the shift will run well.
good,"the typical day i would count inventory, order upon the needs of business, managed up to 6-8 crew members at a time, and address any problem or concerns customers would had regarding food items. Processed up to 1500 dollars in safe money a night. Maintained hourly cash drops per policy."
good,"A typical day at work would be busy. I would be in charge of stocking product, preparing orders, probing product ,stocking condiments, cleaning/dishes and prep work. I learned how to make the orders. The management was always helpful as were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being rushed when I started and didn't know how to make the product. The most enjoyable was helping others out when I could , always kept me busy and the discount."
good,Great place to work. Management is very helpful. Team work is a must. I learned all position in a few months. The more you learn. The more valuable of an employee you are.
good,"Working here was easy once you get the hang of it. It gets extremely busy during rush hour, and you're often handling it alone unless a manager sees you struggling."
good,great job with a great church environment.our church customers were  great and understanding.would recommend this job to anyone wanting alil extra money
good,working at Wendy's was a great opportunity for me. It helped me get over my shyness and constant fear of being excepted in the world. i learned how to do whatever it took in order for me to get my job done and how to take my time with my objectives to achieve my goals in the workplace
good,"I like working at Wendy's , my main probable was I was supposed to be working full time but only working part time.  I don't like the fact that I have to call out orders because sometime the other employees can hear me but maybe it was too loud..."
good,"i like to work and pick up the skills to do that job . i usually like to be at work early , because if something happen on my way to work i have time to call the right people . i can get along with anyone . if i get my stuff done , i hate standing there and waiting to be told what else to do . if my high mangement dont have anything else,  i  pick up a broom or help a co-worker"
good,Most days at Wendy's if located at a busy location it's busy with customers. Depending on the position your working from your experience will vary. I worked most positions with the exception of management. As a cook and observer within this position I experienced what was necessary to maintain  the standard of health-board regulations. As a cashier for both drive-thru and front counter I experienced what is to interact directly with supply and demand. For my overall experience I felt that during certain management periods changed the flow of energy. But I love Wendy's!
good,"Not a hard job to get the hang of, it is an easy job to do that can easily be worked around your schedule. It is easy to work here as a student, or someone who has other priorities. I personally found that management were not properly trained to deal with certain situations."
good,"the environment was very fast paste you had to be on the ball at all times, ensure your dinning room was clean and organized, re-stock condiment, and operate cash register and handle money"
good,This was my first job-So I'm thankful I could learn so much for being part time. Customers are the core value of everything so if they are happy-So are you.
good,"Republican politics around management became a consequence to the hardworking individuals as such. For my employees under the clock on my management time , all became well work and appropriated time lapse of a normal day at work. I learned mostly to be a manager and take the day of work production under my own wing with my own employees. In an absence of calling in ill , which was never , the management besides a few did not come through on policies pronounced on training at the Wendy's orientation. Co workers were of great assistance to the work day and respectful at that but under the bridge the general manager cared only for my misfortune making work a day to day basis instead of a committing work day. The hardest part of the job was closing and doing all the utilities for everyone day to day , and not getting paid what was actually to par. The most enjoyable part of the job was to reference with new people and understand empathy and sympathy in the customer correlation where the customer is always right. My two weeks noted under the general manager after a sick instance , one of my only ones , brought faulty upon request , the manager declined in a non subtle way. Leaving me to my sickness and eager for a new opportunity else where ."
good,"This is a good first job. You learn customer service, cash handling, and food handling. You get recognized for things and get an annual raise. It's a good starting point."
good,"Typical day at work, not that busy like portillo's. It was my first job, so I learned how to handle cash, do drops, and do all the cleaning that has to be done to close the restaurant. The managment was great, all the managers seem to handle situations fine. My co-workers were a lot older than me, very friendly. The hardest part of the job was working there evening to close, all the work that has to be done for such little pay an hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things ."
good,"washed off tables when not busy, prepared food for customer orders.  co-workers were helpful and friendly.  management helpful when needed."
good,When I first started with the  company I felt it was a great company to learn and grow with. I started as a crew member and worked my way up. Like any company Wendy's has its pros and cons. I believe Wendy's would be a great  place for any crew member to get their career started.
good,"cash control, labor control, order truck, put truck away, crew schedule, ensure customer satisfaction. handle customer complaints. coach employees on position"
good,It was fun everyday to work there but I agree that there could have been more discipline involved in the work place. The management was okay and there was room for advancement. I enjoyed cooking and making sandwiches the most because for some reason it took my mind off reality. The hardest part was having customers come back to back through the drive-thru and inside during rush hour. My co-workers were mainly teens and young adults so we all got along pretty good.
good,"A typical shift at Wendy's included top notch show pride with clean and organized uniforms ; if one wasn't wearing a belt or hat they weren't allowed to clock on for their shift. It also revolved around team work with many new hires and qualified crew trainers; we were all expected to welcome and introduce ourselves to fresh trainees to better the work environment and prosperity of the business we were supporting. Quality control was highly implemented by my supervisors for complete customer satisfaction; we didn't serve cold fries nor undercooked meat and our grill men prepped the meat prior to serving them on the grill machine. In a nutshell, the usual work day at Wendy's revolved around the Wendy's slogan ""Quality is our recipe"". I enjoyed the strict rules over every operation inside the restaurant because it promoted a strong work ethic and a positive atmosphere for customers and crew members. "
good,"While working for Wendy's, I've come to learn a lot about the fast food restaurant lifestyle and work experience. Some good quality management. I learned a lot, and its not as easy as people may think to step inside their shoes but as you continue it does get easier. I enjoyed working with my colleagues, and being a part of the Wendy's family."
good,"A typical day at work included, greeting and making customers happy with their experience at Wendy's. Working at Wendy's I learned that being fast isn't always the most important thing. To make sure customers are happy with their order is the biggest concern. One customer at a time gets the job done the right way."
good,We have gone through managers at the store I work with like crazy.  Find it more and more frequent where the district manager is helping run the store when they should be there once a week or less.
good,honest it was a great job to be at some days it could be very slow but that's just a small problem my work would still be done on time also great people helping around you witch made work go a little faster/easier learning how to work in a group feeling part of the team was a great experience my hardest part of work was working as cashier at first it took me some time to understand the phrases but thanks to good management and co-worker i have gained the knowledge i needed to keep up my good work ethics.
good,"Get to work a little early and plan the day."
good,"If you are looking for a great paying job as your first job, Wendy's is a great choice. They offer shift hours from 8-12 hours a day, on a minimum wage salary with many advancement opportunities. Although the managers do tend to be a bit much, it is still a great workplace for a fast food restaurant."
good,"Completed all cleaning, stocking and organizing tasks in assigned area."
good,"I enjoyed my time at this job although some managers could have been more stern to employees. I am a strong believer of where there is will there is power but if you don't enforce it , it will not be abided by."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very easy, I count my register to make sure the amount is correct. I collect an envelope from the managers desk, the envelope holds my receipts, customer surveys, money drop's throughout the day, and customer coupons. I clock in then unlock the doors. Once customers begin to come in, I take their order, collect the cash or credit cards. Before the workday is over, I stock everything from cups, chilli cups, and trays, My managers logs the cash drawer out of my name. I count my drawer back to the default number ($150.00) all of the other cash is the money I collect from customers all day. Once I drop the money in the dunbar safe , it prints out a receipt that I sign stating that the amount of money I dropped matches the money I collected throughout the day. I fill out the Cash Control Envelope then clock out. "
good,At this job I was to run  the registers and keep the place clean. I learned that I loved helping people. This job was not a hard place to work at. I enjoyed getting to meet people every day.
good,"A typical day at work is helping out customers with whatever they may need, and taking their orders as they say it. From working at Wendy's I've learned that it's always better to put on a smile and just let things go when things bug me. The managers at Wendy's prefer to use constructive criticism to improve inexperience. My coworkers are very helpful in a team and are always willing to do things if you ask. The hardest part of the job is constantly having to be running around and always doing something. For example: Taking orders, Pleasing customers, Stocking merchandise, and helping my coworkers if they need it. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk with people all day and being a part of a friendly team."
good,People at my location were amazing but the pay is minimal. If you are looking for basic employment then I would recommend this position.
good,The managers were helpful but they gave me horrible hours it wasn't fun working there. Plus the  only good thing about the job was gaining experience to put on my resume .
good,"This Wendy's has an excellent execution of professionalism, food safety and sanitation. "
good,My work day at Wendy's always went by fast because I kept myself busy. Our management team was always understanding. The hardest part at work was dealing with the heat everyday.
good,my typical work day ranges from 8:00 a.m to about 4:00 p.m. with daily rushes. I work with great people that i know very well and enjoy being around.
good,"Taking orders from customers and making sure they left satisfied and willing to return while perfecting my multitasking skills in a fast pace environment.  On the other hand, my coworkers were all helpful and very professional and polite at all times. Finally, My favorite part of the day at Wendy's was interacting with all customers and leaving home feeling accomplished."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's really depends on the day. Some days it can run smooth and easy, while most other days it is fast and stressful. There is always so much going on and usually pressure is on you to make it run smoothly. Working at Wendy's I learned how to be patient, and how to be better at multitasking and working in very fast environment. As a co-worker you have to really work as a team and listen and communicate to one another very well in order to have an efficient work day. The hardest part about working at Wendy's would probably be when a big rush happens and the communication with co-workers is very poor, it then becomes very difficult. The most enjoyable part about this job is working with people and seeing diverse people from all over the city and the rewarding feeling of making them satisfied."
good,"Basically the Goal everyday was to get the job done, the customers should leave every time with a smile and exactly what they ordered"
good,"Easy work once you get the hang of it. The food preparation is easy. Closing can be fun depending on your environment. It is easy to learn things as you go. The co-workers are very enjoyable. The management staff, however, is not always easy to work with, polite or discrete."
good,"Always busy, rarely did I get a chance to have a break. The managers always had a positive energy."
good,"Team playing company, co workers are great, managers good, enjoyable part of the job, cash ,numbers, team player and dealing with customers"
good,"Mostly fast past had to be on top of things."
good,"On a typical day of work I opened the floor and made sure everything was stocked. After that, I would greet customers and take their order then serve them their food. I was usually on front register because it was easy for me to talk to people and take care of any questions without complaints. Closing, I would sweep and mop the floor area and vaccum carpet, clean tables/bathrooms. Clean trays, restock after every shift and then go home. It was okay working there when I was younger but I am looking to get out of the fast-food workplace and find something more advanced - restaurant, pharmacy, receptionist, hospital, or airlines."
good,"The work was good, all the workers got along and we had a good time. "
good,"Managed orders, coordination, and money."
good,I had some good experience working at Wendy's cause I had made some friends and I like to work really hard and staying focus
good,"I worked a pretty solid work scheduled from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm five days a week most weeks.  Normally I was a cashier but I also was a coordinator, worked the drive-threw and made sandwiches.  Sometime I would have to stay after we were located by the highway so could get really busy.  I got along really well with my co-workers and was friends with some other them out side the work place as well.  The best part about the job is working with other people that you get along with and are friends with"
good,"A typical day at work.. "
good,"My typical day at work is taking orders or helping make orders, or just taking cash. I've to how to multitask a little better and to be a little organized. The management was okay but not the greatest and my co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part is working with somebody who doesn't want to work with you. The most enjoyable job is washing dishes."
good,"i have learned how to deal with conflicts, to organize and prepare inventory. Deal with different type of personalities"
good,"a lot involved w cooking preparing foods, clean up details all the time, friendly people,"
good,"It was an ok job!"
good,very up beat place to work. learned a lot. I liked the benefits that they supplied. I received all management skills from this company. This was a great job opportunity.
good,"My typical day at work consist of clocking in and then going to get a headset for work. As soon as the headset goes on my head, orders come flying in. I quickly run over to the sandwich station and complete orders before the customer gets to the window. During this job, I learned plenty of leadership skills and also communication skills. My co workers and I must communicate to tell each other who will do what while orders are coming in. But the hardest part of my job is taking in the yelling and harsh words from my mangers. If an order is not complete in a certain amount of time, they get furious. The most enjoyable part of my job is being with the people that I know and having fun doing what we do. Another problem with this is that some jobs are limited to others. With the small amount of months that I was working at my university job, I gained more experience quicker."
good,There is always room to move up in the Wendy's ladder.  Need to be able to multi-task and work under pressure.  Be able to learn from mistakes and be open to criticism.
good,"a typical day at work included writing shift plans, communicating daily and weekly goals to staff, inventory control and solving any problems that arose."
good,Enjoyed management but the benefits were minimal and the opportunity for advancement is minimal as well.
good,"taking orders,cooking and handling money on a regular bases."
good,"It's a very fast paced environment. Slow at times. Management is excellent. Great people. Some good co-workers, some bad co-workers. Bad service times on night crew. Slow work pace at night. But I'm sure management is addressing these issues. Lunch break is good for long shifts but i prefer not to take one if not needed. Usual 9 hour day without lunch is okay for me. I am forced to go to lunch if labor is blown though. I don't like it because I lose hours. I understand managements p.o.v. on this subject but if you have to give me a break then don't ask me if i want a break during the beginning of my shift. I'm only going to tell you no."
good,"nice people nice customers i wish the job paid more and hired full time employees , overall it was a fun job but i cant take care of my family with just only working there. good job for teens"
good,It was a ok job until my hours were cut down causing me  to struggle   forcing me to work late after I told her in my interview I could only work days
good,"This was my first job and I learned to use the cash register greet customers, work the grill, prepare sandwhiches and maintain facility clean. The managers were tough when things got busy but for the most part they were easy and fun to work with. Most of my co-workers were hardworking but in almost any store you have at least one person who complains and doesn't do their job well. The hardest part for me was taking orders in drive thru, but the best part of the job was delivering the order of the customer and seeing them leave happy."
good,"Decent faced paced job, management and co-workers. Hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job was the face pace and the demand that it places on you."
good,When I went to work the managers kept things in line and allowed for a fun and SAFE working enviorment
good,"Great employees to work with,just sometimes when customers order their orders in a specific way most employees always have something to say about it. Just do your job, not like their paying for the customers meal. Customers just want what I enjoy doing, give them a great experience the Wendy way. The way it should be. but they expect you to work and work hard for that money. Overall its a great job for 1st timers."
good,"I worked here for over a year, mostly doing front line and closing the dining room. Front line would entail taking and then ringing up customer orders with their computer cash register. Every time you would get a $50 bill or higher you would mark it with a marker to see if it were a counterfeit and then drop it in what we called the ""dropbox"" in case of a robbery. Front Line workers are responsible for making every drink ordered from inside as the soda fountains are behind the counter and besides their Coca Cola product sodas, Wendy's offers many different specializes of drinks including Frosty's, Frosty shakes, Frosty soda floats, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and different teas such as their sweet and unsweetened teas which is also used to make their popular Berry tea which can come sweetened or unsweetened. These all would come in a big range of different cup sizes. The front line person is also responsible for gathering orders of fries and chicken nuggets (spicy or regular) and putting them on the customer's tray along with whatever sauce the customer chooses. We would also have to make sure we were dropping and frying bags of nuggets of fries when needed. Front line also has to make sure all the sauces, condiments, cups, lids, and the fry and nugget cartons in their area are stocked at all times while going out to maintain the cleanliness of the dining room when given an opportunity, in order to make it less of a hassle when closing. When closing the dining room we would have to lock the doors, sweep the whole dining room, make sure all tables and seats were clean, vacuum"
good,It was just an after school job. Pretty self-explanatory. Worked as a cashier mostly. Dealt with people. Found out some people can be mean-spirited individuals. Found out that other people can be the most kind and understanding people in the world. Job is very easy. Would definitely recommend it if you are in high school or college.
good,I like it a lot but I have to drive a long way to get to wendy. Because at the time I need a job bad so I had to for some month until I find something closes to home.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be counting the safe. Then followed by counting product, and ensuring that the crew is keeping an clean environment and atmosphere for the happiness of the customers and meeting health code regulations. Management team stands well behind one another. The hardest part in this job would have to be the stress level to meet all criteria desired by the company. Meeting the goals to achieve the best drive thur time's, best customer feed back, product waste, and over all achievement's in the district. "
good,work in a fast and dynamic enviroment. good for getting experience in management and customer service but nothing more.
good,"Une journée de travaille chez Wendy's passe vite. Puisque c'est la restauration, il y a toujours beaucoup de monde. Si on travaille bien, il est possible d'avoir des augmentations salariales au 6mois. Nous avons 50% de rabais sur nos repas ce qui est agréable. Mais l'aspect le plus difficile je dirai, c'est de faire des fermetures puisque l'on fini tard. Il est agréable de travaille au Wendy's puisque les gérants sont très amical et aidants."
good,"Get to work, position yourself, prepare for rush and bump and slide and make sure the customer leaves smiling."
good,handling daily responsibilities on a fast food restaurant
good,I had a great time but encounter certain managers that did things immoral and not by the books so I felt that I needed to remove myself from this position.
good,My job at Wendys was a good experience but i couldn't see myself just serving hamburgers all my life i did enjoy my time there i become manager in less than a year.
good,its a friendly environment and have well qualified managers to help you learn good basic food preparations etc. great for a first job and put your foot through the door in the fooding business and customer service
good,everyday was different and always was a happy place. management was great
good,I love to work i go to work feeling good some days i have my bad days but i don`t show them at work. Every job i had i loved the crew and the managers i never had a problem i keep to myself i work fast i make sure my work area is clean for the next crew..
good,"Come in to work clock in, wash hands, and the days starts off. I go on sandwiches, which means pep food station, I am there through out the day. And through out the the day I am cleaning things."
good,work was great go in early had a great working environment and had a great crew
good,I alwas was a people person when it came down to being a Cashier or a Cook. Job was Fun and Easy.
good,"Learned alot about management, fun and enjoyable. Always something to learn which prepares you for the real world. Teaches you how to ccok from scratch and how to treat others without stepping out of place. Fast paced and fun environment."
good,Been there a while and it is a great place the work isnt too hard but you have to be there to work and want to work. Typical day is to report to the manager in charge and ask which position you are working on. For being a manager you check the notes left from the night before and check sales before punching in.
good,"It was fast food, pretty generic. Overall it was a good first job."
good,"Enjoyed the working enviroment and the regular customers. The pay wasn't terrible, but could have had better benefits."
good,"it was an enjoyable,friendly place to work, most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with their needs. coworkers were great."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in and making sure my work station was sanitazed make sure there was fresh chicken,chicken nuggets, & fries was ready fot consumtion by ther consumer. I had to cook burgers full during closin clean and sanitaze work station sweep,mop, & stock newly required products. My co-workers was friendly and easy to work with. It really wasn't a hard part to the job, but the most enjoyable part was seeing a happy customer upon recieving they order."
good,The environment was very nice. The Manger and the co workers was very helpful during the days i have been working their.
good,Taught how to use a frier
good,this job was pretty laid back. i performed all my duties accordingly. i enjoyed each of my co-workers. in a typical days work i would begin at 5 pm and end at 11 pm
good,I work the graveyard shift so I rearly see the Genersl Manager of the resturant. never got a raise in tge 2 years that I have worked there.
good,"The only reason I left this job was because I literally could not afford to stay there. And because didn't like dealing with rude customers all day, but that is not the fault of Wendy's, you get there everywhere you go! The management however was fantastic. My boss did everything in his power to take care of his employees and customers alike, even going out of his way for them. If you're not looking to get rich, but you're looking for a good work environment, Wendy's is a good place (or at least mine was!)."
good,"It was a pretty fun job, something to earn a little extra cash while in school."
good,"When applying at Wendy’s it is good for you to know that it is a fast food company and you have to move fast pace, while making sure everything is still stocked in your area."
good,As long as you can balance pace and accuracy this is the job for you always put accuracy first then work on pace and speed . It all builds up from there
good,people are nice and like to team up in everything. and also the have a good costumer sevices. One thing about wendys is that they always give the oportunity to study
good,"Low pay. Low advancements. No benefits. Since I worked part-time, I had a low chance of advancement. The customers would get mad at me for mistakes the cook made, and even after being very professional about the situation I was never given a raise or opportunity at more hours"
good,"+"
good,It is a very fast-paced environment. You have to be able to work under pressure. The hardest part was trying to do multiple things at once and talk to customers at the same time. The managers and co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,Wendy's is a good place to work for if your looking for something flexible to fit with your schedule. Also offers many opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,makanan yang serba cepat & higenis.. pelayananya juga ramah & santun
good,Working at Wendy's was an experience to say the least. Lots of different things to deal with whether it be customers or your cleaning duties there was always something to do
good,When i worked at Wendys it was an outstanding experience because they welcomed me into there team. Training was good the way they tought me was incredable with hands on and some videos aswell. They never get mad at a new person they stay with you an insure you that your doing fine and you got this. They make you feel like your family and thats what i liked best about working there at wendys. Plus all the respect they have for one  other that is incredable to me. They always be joking around and smiling and enjoying there job because everybody makes it fun to work there.
good,"You take customers orders, make orders, do dishes, clean your area, clean and stock lobby, provide best customer service. The year I was there; i learned customer service skills, how to work fast pace, management skills, and how to work in a team environment better."
good,I liked working at Wendy's cause it was laid back and something i feel i can run as a manger it's a good starter job and nice place to be it's a good  place to eat.
good,its not rocket science but also allows you to be who you are and gives you security of guaranteed payment and you can get some discounted food which is always good who doesn't like cheaper food
good,working hard and serving people nice hot quaitly food. becoming friends throughout the store growing with alll of the custmores and other workers. the boos was alsome and wouldnt mind working again for wendys
good,This company was a good and bad experience for me. During the time there was not a good manager but my coworkers were very easy and enjoyable to work with.
good,I am a hard worker and I get the job done. I don’t not complain and I get along with people easily. I am a people person and I’ll make customers happy!
good,"It was a good first job, staff was a little different for me do to that fact that I was at least 15 years younger than me. Good place to star though. Was enjoyed"
good,"Very comfortable, fast paced job with room for advancement. Benefits and pto available. Upper management, not involving GM but higher is not good at all. Very greedy with money and cares more about labor and food cost than quailty, customers and employees."
good,My first day of job everyone was helpful the manager and supervisor both were very kind. I learned how to work in fast paced environment. It was a good experience as it was my first job in Canada.
good,Its an alright job I don’t expect this to be a career at all I prefer to have a warehouse career with useful skill to acquire along with my own knowledge of warehouse
good,"Sucked working here. Having to do the same position everyday. It was a fun job at first when I was hired the first couple months and still in school, but now I need a long term job and Wendy’s is not it."
good,Start from home and work though list of stores that had issues. Since it was a restaurant you can't be inside the store or cause issues during peak hours yet keep store equipment up and working properly.
good,I worked for them for 10 years although it was a pleasant start we got bought out and the new company was just not the same the family oriented workplace soon became Every man for themselves type environment became unorganized and my family needed me so I had to go to my family but that’s over now
good,"very busy and slow days. learning new stuff, cleaning, meeting with customers. having training lesson, 30 min breaks, commuincation between customers and staff"
good,"As it is a fast food restaurant, being able to multitask and work at a fast pace is necessary. Provide lots of hours, and were very flexible with schedule requests."
good,Never had enough people on the clock always had a long line because we were always unstaffed and there was no overtime available if you passed 40 hours you were asked to clock out
good,You have lots of room for advancement. If you apply yourself you have the support of certain staff that will help you along the way. This company will give you support. get the job done.
good,Can be stressful but a person just has to know how to be a team player. Everyone is on the same team. Knowing how to talk with people is key and making eye contact.
good,"It was fun and very flexible, i developed my working pace and communications skills. the managers were very understanding and cooperative. although there were days that costumers did complain and it was very stressful; i did enjoy working there."
good,"For the most part the only time it was stressful was during busy hours and holidays, other than those times it was usually pretty chill. Then we got a new manager and no one really like him and there was a huge incident that made me leave because after it I couldn't take the unprofessional-ism anymore."
good,"It was a great job , was pregnant and it was a good place for me to work at . I catches on quick the paces was good speed there was some good teamwork"
good,"Would recommend to other but will tell pros and cons. it was typically fast paced, the managers was sometimes a little bit unorganized. maybe it was just the store i worked at."
good,It is a good place to work if you have enough experience to become shift lead or manager. Otherwise you will need another full time job in order to pay the bills
good,"Nice place to work at. There are slow days and busy days. And when there is busy days you must be diligent, accurate, and kind with no room for error. and if you make a error you must figure it out to recompense and not tarnish your company."
good,Raises don't come often. shift managers are not even at $10 and we do the exact same job as assistant managers. Always short staff. under paid and over worked!!!
good,"The morning shift begins with entering a store.  And tripping an alarm.  If the key holder has the security code then it can be disabled.  Following that the employees may punch in and begin morning preparation.  Usually some type of mess or careless act of responsibility is left obvious by the closing shift.  Utensils are missing, hidden or broken,etc.  Typically you will have a maintenance repairman, truck driver, window washer or exterminator check in to do his job in your area.  It is a restaurant so work space is confined.  It is normal for you to not be able to do your job if a repairman is needed.  Which can affect availability of the products being offered on the menu.  Usually a customer doesn't place an order till after 10 am.  Cause the store is not open, but occasionally you have that new customer that doesn't know the store hours.  And who wants a double stack at eight am.  The openers get there at six.  In order to get the store up and running the employees hustle through their morning routines to prepare for lunch.  So their is usually a hour to make sure everything is in place for rush.  That is the point everybody is coming to each other for assistance to the customer.  The most important part is knowing how to do your job.  And making an effort to assist your fellow workers as much as possible.  Usually by twenty to two pm central standard things die off.  And some of the employees can be cut from their shift.  The store remains in steady operation for another hour or so.  As other employees come and go.  Sometimes even for just a sandwich, but not to work."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great place to work at if the management was a lot better. All the co-worker are very kind and all very hard working which they deserved to be treated better. Management are great sometime but other time it just makes me want to quit. They need to be more nicer other than rush us and tell us that we are doing that wrong when we are all trying our best. Also the salary is not very good. Specially if they tell you that you mean so much and how they are very happy to have you because you are such a great worker for them, even after 3 years they don't give you a rise."
good,It was a  fun place to work friendly very diverse got to meet various types of people unfortunatly the mannagement was poor and the team was amazing to work with
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work.  I was able to advance to Shift Manager.  After gaining seniority, I was able to choose a shift that worked for me as a single mother."
good,Overall the experience I had while working here was very well and I appreciated the experience I got. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and was sad to have to relocate.
good,pretty easy fast paced job. the management was pretty good with employees and customers etc. I enjoyed most was the learning all the different job areas I could work at. s=Such as the grill drive thru etc
good,Wendy's was my very frist job. They taught me a lot of responsibility. Also made me have a sense of urgency. I Loved working there. The management was very friendly and polite made me feel like I was part of the family. Wendy's is a great place.
good,It’s was fast-paced but of course cause it’s an fast food restaurant but overall it a very nice place to work and my fellow crew members always helped out.
good,"The typical work day was quick paces, I learned to multi-task and greet angry customers with an smile. The managment was very poor, I basically trained myself. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the orders while trying to fix them at the same time, but the most enjoyable part of the job was I learned to become independent."
good,Great place to work at. Very time management. Very clean place. The most enjoyable part of the job was to make sure i did everything on time and correct.
good,"Mangement: force male employees to fetch items, open jars, lift objects for MGRs and female employees. (Discriminatory Practices)! Hiring female employees for just register and sandwiches. Male employees must run grill or fries unless there is not a female to run register. "
good,I like it. Just not enough hours. The management are great to work for. Easy job. Easy to train. Would stay if I made more money. Very flexible with letting you off if needed
good,Good place to work for your first time job. It's very fast paste meaning that it can get very hectic during lunch time and rush hour. Managers try their best to help but there at times where the store has a shortage of staff.
good,management was easy to work with. pay could always be better. hardest part of job was doing the unpacking of the truck. most enjoyable was seeing my friends everyday
good,wendy's work experience was great starting off the people were great but I felt like the mangers wasn't really training the new people right I was one it was terrible but the work experience was great THE workers were nice some mangers treated as if you was family I learned how to manage customers and great customer service and people skills  discounts free food but also the hardest part learning  new stuff kind of the most enjoyable part meeting new people and  becoming a  crew member and getting to take charge.
good,I had a very interesting group of people I worked for and with. overall it was great to work there and I got as many hours as I desired. my pay was fair and benefits were okay
good,El dia se va rapido ya que siempre ay algo que hacer.
good,Very bad place to work especially if it is your first job. They expect you to do everything and know everything about a fast food restaurant. Some of the managers just don't care about their employees and their health and safety.
good,"It is a fast pace working enviroment with friendly people. A typical day at work would be ringing up customers orders and cashing them out, or preparing the food in the morning and while they order"
good,"Throughout my years at Wendy's , it had been a great work experience with a very caring and helpful environment. I hope to leave behind great memories and knowledge knowing i helped out in every possible."
good,"I grew so much while working at Wendy's. I stated character building, because the job really made me improve on a lot of areas. However, it is a stressful  job."
good,I had a good time here learning about the working world in a safe controlled and monitored environment. The best part was the help from my peers and management to succeed for them and they in turn would move me up in the company
good,Learn a lot while working for this company. Their training program is thorough and well done. Leadership team is hands on and willing to lead by example.
good,"It was a fast-paced workplace. I had the opportunity to interact with our customers on a daily basis. As a Supervisor, I had a great learning experience that helped me develop my skills and grow in the company."
good,it is a great job for someone who may be starting out. unfortunately the chances to advanced in the company are likely but seem almost impossible to achieve. i had switched job positions due to  managment not always honest and having favoritism to other emplees
good,"During the winter seasons it is not bad working there, but when it comes to the summer time it is deadly. Pretty decent job, really a lot of hard work."
good,"Everyone says fast food is a good starter job, and it is, except for a few things. They are very flexible in scheduling which makes it easy for a student to work. All the managers are very encouraging and very positive to keep you around. I worked here for around 9 months and only left because of how busy it was. We were always understaffed and the customers just kept coming. I remember doing a lot of overtime as well because of that reason and don't remember being compensated for it. The plus side is the people. You meet so many new and interesting faces that are great to get to know."
good,"Very busy all day, with many different positions to work. My store had the best general manager in my entire experience. He always kept you productive and always wanted to see you become a better employee. My experience at this job was excellent as a intro to the work environment."
good,wendys was my first job so i had learn alot about a job in it was hard at 15 becoming 16 trying work had to get wat you wented in life in you didnt pit in the hours you wasnt getting nothing...
good,"It was very fast paced, and all over the place but it ws fun at the same time. During my time thier I was a grill operator but also learned all four stations, such as drive-thru, dine-in and sabdwich maker."
good,"I personally went through 8 GMs in the 3 year time span I spent working there and that was at one store, I also went through 4 or 5 DMs during that same time, at the same store. It was a constant thing in every store in my district and they are horrible at communication even between managers unless that's how they wanted it when they were switching out the bosses like hotcakes. I wouldn't even know anything until I was walking in at 7am to a new boss I eventually got used to it but still the fact they didn't have the decency to give us any type of warning or anything all 8 times is crazy to me."
good,"its a good place to work, but too much drama and everyone is in everyone business. keep your business to yourself. you can easly get put in a bad mood there."
good,I hated rotated shift it was. A nice place to work some people rued soma nice but overt all great to be there it'd had chances too do it again i just might
good,"I loved working for this place. I was trained on the cash register, grill , prep,sandwich maker and shift supervisor. I was responsible for the cleanliness of the restaurant"
good,Working at Wendy's is a bittersweet experience. It it bitter simply because there is no room for advancement. It is sweet because the managers are great. The 1/2 off in meals are also nice. Sometimes you may find that you can't get off on time because the next shift wont come in. It can be a real pain especially if you have plans. But the management team is extremely easy to work with and they are the greatest.
good,"At Wendy's, I learned how to prepare salads, sandwiches, and drinks. My typical day involved doing most of that, during my shift. I had very good management. The workplace culture, was good, but could have been better. The hardest part of my job, was not being able to achieve my goal. The most enjoyable part of my job, was being able to help others."
good,Wasn't good management. People would sell cold fries. And sometimes they would sell hard chicken. But it was alright to work there. Some of the employees was nice and friendly.
good,"I worked here about 6 months upon graduating high school. it was a great place to work, lots  of friendly staff, good hours, and the managers were amazing. though after turning 18 i decided i needed something more. id say its definitely a good company to work for, short term of course."
good,It was a good working experience. Works around your schedule really good. Gave you good benefits as well. They take you very seriously. Wendy's works around your schedule.
good,Good entry level job to start off with while in high school. Pays decent enough for minimum wage and has opportunities to advance in. Management is a hit-and-miss sometimes and it's not always an easy shift. Flexible schedules and requested time off is good. Good training and a very supportive team environment.
good,It was always great to be able to work at wendy's and a typical day was full of work. I learned how to cook and what its like to experience great team work. The management was always top notch and professional. My co-workers made the environment a happy one and always helped. The hardest part of my job was working drive through but that didn't last long. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was making money and making people happy.
good,Hard place to work but easy to understand. It stresses you out a lot because you have to work with a timer. You have to put the order together in 1 minute.
good,"It was good to work there, it was long hours and always get alone with everyone. I'm a people person. It was even better when football season cause u meet a lot of the players"
good,"A typical day at work is busy, the guest are very polite, the dining room music is so fantastic . We maintain cleanings and make sure every one is happy and pleased."
good,"My day at work had it's ups and downs. I learned how to cook and do different tasks daily. Management was always teaching good work ethics that could help me advance. Co-workers were friendly and fun to work with on a daily basis. No hard work, and I enjoyed my job."
good,"its a nice fast paced working environment, I like it been here for a while, job searching because next month my Wendy's will become a franchise."
good,"My typical day at work was just preparing food or cleaning the dining area. I didn't really learn anything, The management was good, they were understanding sometimes. My co-workers were friendly and nice to work with. The hardest part about the job was having to balance out school and work. Work was interfering with school and they weren't that understanding that I had to leave."
good,The hardest part of this job is having overtime because of the schedule. The most enjoyable part is my co workers are fun to work with and i enjoy my time with them.
good,Being an assistant manager at Wendy's was enjoyable yet challenging everyday! Customer service was the most important part of my job and making sure my employees did their job made my job easier. I learned that working with so many different people can be hard but at the same time it was great cause I did get to know lots of people. The hardest part of my job was angry customers cause you had to find a way to make sure they came back! You would have to go above and beyond to make your customers happy and make their experience enjoyable. My favorite part of this job was my regular customers who came in daily I knew what they wanted and it was easy to make them happy! Happy customers lead to happy environment!
good,many different franchises.  The company needs to work on getting on same page. Every customer should matter not just drive thru. Low paid employees.  They mean well but need to spend more time on who they allow to operate their stores.
good,"A typical day at work would be fun because there all kinds of people you meet. The managers are good ones, but the environment working there wasn't the best. There's so much bad language, and when your around it every day its not the best feeling to know where your going everyday. I could say that the hardest part of the job was dealing with all the negativity that my coworkers put out, in the way they acted and spoke. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and revisiting with current customers that would come in every single day. The customers that would always come in over and over again were amazing and I adore them. Some old, some young."
good,"Lots of room for advancement, fast paced, great learning opportunities. Management is ok but has a hard time directing employees without yelling."
good,At this job being clean was a big word. Employees had to deal with the preparation of customers food. I love the work environment and the people.
good,A typical day at Wendy's would be a great experience I've learned a lot about the food products I didn't know before I started working at Wendy's. For the most part the management staff could have been a little better than what it was. I could also say that I got along with most of my co-workers except for a few. The hardest part about the job was the lunch and dinner rush but I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable moments of the job was to see the smiles on the customers faces.
good,"Working at Wendy's was easy for me since I am good with working in a timely manner. I also learn quickly, and thrive in working in stressful situations. I also developed good relations with co-workers because I am a outgoing person."
good,"It was an alright place to work if you are a teen that's just trying to make a couple bucks. Other than that, it's not fit for an adult who has bills to pay."
good,"working at Wendy's was by far one of the best jobs I've ever had! Great job, great pay, awesome benefits, good people to work with. I would go back in a heartbeat if given the chance."
good,"It was a great learning experience, working at very fast paced environments with many people helped my work ethic and social skills."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing many types of food, while, following many rules concerning health and safety. I learned valuable experience as a result of working at a fast paced location(located near a highway). I had to ensure that my products were carefully prepared in a small time period. This allowed me to improve on my skill to stay calm while under stress. I also improved my teamwork and communication skills. The management played an important role in ensuring that our employees work their desired hours, working certain positions, and ensuring safety throughout the location which I greatly appreciated. I worked with students approximately the same age as me. This strengthened our teamwork skills which improved productivity. Working as kitchen crew, I did not experience any difficult areas, while working at Wendy's. But being able to interact with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job. Overall, a great experience."
good,"Started working for this co.a store manager,received the national wend's award in my restaurant two years in a row. {this is a single award given by wendy's corp. to the single best store in the country, this award had never been won by either: the same company nor the same single store unit two years in a row} was then moved into a supervisors job over a total of 15 stores, working with the managment  and sometimes training  with the crew. The hardest part of this job was being 35 years old and being a new dad, and not having the time to spend with my family. The best part of this job was the people that I worked with each day, and the great success that we all enjoyed together."
good,"With a great staff of co-workers we managed orders and sales in the most efficient way. We each worked in different positions, each with a list of tasks necessary to finish by the end of our shift. Management here had great structure."
good,"A typical day consisted of cleaning the store, making sure customers got food and correct change with their orders. I learned how to take orders from our customers fast and accurately. I think management was horrible. I think some of my co-workers were awesome. There was no hard part to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the guests."
good,"I am a night shift worker. Most of my co-workers are under 20. Some days it can be fun to close with the fun people but we get things done. Working a full shift there is hard,you only get half hour break."
good,"I opened regularly. I would work cash and order taking, also sandwich board and bacon grill. It was great to have my first job experience with friendly motivated people."
good,"I would clock in and maintain the grill. I would close the grill area for the next shift. I learned how to communicate with customers and create the food. The management was great to work with, and my co-workers were team oriented. The hardest part of this job was having to leave. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work everyday being able to gain overtime."
good,"my day at work was always a good day to me. I always came in happy. my customers always made me happy from when I walk in into I walk out. I always learned something new in working in fast food. I went to different stores with my management because I was always was a hard worker, had good leadership.my co-workers was always happy in friendly to one another. we always help each other out. there was no hardest part of my job. my job was easy in outgoing. the most enjoyable part of working in fast food was working together. always had a set goal. the customer was the most important."
good,"my job everyday was to clean store before opening. stock all new food. and put things on display. When store hours open  my job could be working on cash register, or on the cook. Working at a fast restaurant  is always continues learning environment. i learned how to properly store food , improved my customer service skills ,work on cash register,efficient in fast pace environment. for the most the management normal just do your job and handle all the job requirements and you'll fine. just strictly a business relationship which i have no problem with. working with my co workers was fun because the main thing that was implicated was teamwork which made everything easier.  what made my job a little difficult was if someone called off or didn't show up especially on the real busy days. everyone will be moving extreme fun to get the job done in a timely fashion."
good,"You always had to be one step ahead of the costumers. You have to be prepare and make sure that you have enough food down. Whether i was working on fries, grill, cashier, or sandwiches you always had to make sure that you enough product. I learned all those stations as stated above. Management was great but not a great as i would expect. I don't agree that husband and wife should be managers or working together because sometimes it causes conflict. The hardest part of my job would have been making sandwiches because i wasn't fast at that as i was with all the other stations. Sometime i enjoyed would have to be working with the staff that I had the chance to work with and making costumers day. I love talking to people and every chance I got to talk to them made my day."
good,When I worked at wendy's I always provided the best service I could with all customers. A typical day at work would be getting there and doing exactly what I need to do. Always on task and always happy to do my job.
good,Started Wendy's as Part time reception and grew to become an Operations Administrative Assistant supporting Senior directors within Wendy's Canada
good,"I opened or closed the store, I counted money, managed people and food, trained employees and managers, I also knew every position in the store."
good,Good job not so well co workers and not so good on hours either. Mangers will do their best to help you out.
good,"My typical day started at 7:30 pm and ended at 5:30 am. I learned how to run a Wendy's Restaurant. They have videos that cover every aspect of running a fast food restaurant. As soon as I left, they had just hired a very good General Manager. Regarding my Co-workers, most of them were nice and always willing to assist. The hardest part of my job was to work the graveyard shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything I learned. It was an interesting experience."
good,A typical day at wendys consists of all aspects of running the business.  Making sure all procedures are followed.  I have learned alot working there for almost three years.  I have learned alot about how best to manage individuals. Each person is unique and so are their motivations.  I have learned more about how to be an independent thinker and problem solver.  I have learned how to train employees.  I have learned alot of skills that will allow me to flourish in a management position elsewhere.  I have great co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is working until 3am.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships you build with your customers.
good,I enjoyed working at wendy's and the GM was very understanding and helpful. I was pregnant when I had this job and she had to let the other managers know what I wasn't able to do and she eventually had me go on maternity leave because I always got really sick.
good,The culture and employees at this occupation make working enjoyable and fun! The high level of social skills and continued dedication to work make work cease to feel like work. It can be improved by providing employees with opportunities to showcase their skills and potentially obtain a raise or promotion.
good,"I was a cashier, and when we weren't busy I would stock up, clean tables, and clean the washrooms. I learned how to stand up for myself, and how to truly understand customers. The management we great they were always there to help when you needed it. I got on along with my co-workers, and we would help each other. the hardest part of the job was working late, and wake up early for school the next day."
good,"•	Answered telephones and gave information to callers, took messages, or transferred calls to appropriate individuals"
good,"Wendys taught my how to handle customers that were irate, and how to maintain being a professional at all times. I think that every person should work at a fast food place at some point in their life, it really teaches you a lot about customer service and how to treat people on both ends of the spectrum!"
good,"I was hired for back window/ register operator. In this position I prepared bacon pans, washed dishes, took customer orders over the headset, collected money and kept the break room clean. It was always very fast paced however, there was always an extra manager on standby in case of emergency."
good,"I would come in and type my number in the computer for work wash my hands and prepare cooking if I was cooking. If not I would just work the cash register. I learned how to cook burgers and make wraps. my management team was great had good times and had bad times, but we pulled it together to get the job done. I would say that their were any hard parts of the job it was pretty set up on its own. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a satisfied customer walk away after a sale."
good,its okay very stressful fast pace environment could be over whelming for some Hardest part Keeping Customers Constantly happy they always wanted more
good,"At the start of a day, in any industry,it is important that you review what needs to be done. I worked in Wendy's as a cashier. I learned how to use everything really quick. I'm the type of person that if you show me how to do something once, I get it right away. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting people and helping them with their order if they don't know what to chose."
good,Job is amazingly easy for young ones who want to start working.
good,Worked 40 hours a week during high school and first two years of college and was promoted every six months after I started in management. 
good,"you clock in, do your job, make sandwhiches, take orders, hand out orders, keep your area clean, when it's time to go you make sure the next person at your station has everything they need, I learned how to work with others, how to work hard, my co workers were great people, worked hard, showed me how to act in a work place, there wasn't a hardest part of the job, it was all pretty basic stufff, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers"

good,8 hour shift
good,I am good at my job. i over look all sales and customers. i control inventory and count cash. i am second from the top in charge.
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work. The crew members were a great team to work with, I enjoyed myself wih them."
good,Entering immediately into the job you had to help co-workers make orders for customers which made you work in a fast pace.I have learned to work in a face pace as well as work around a high volume of stress.The management helped daily and made sure the orders were put out at a decent amount of time the co-workers were team players.The hardest part of the job was making sure your area was cleaned as well as you making the food and having it prepared on time for the customer.Ienjoyed working with the co-workers ecause we made each other smile on a day to day basis.
good,"Responsible for front line and drive through registers, and cash handling to insure that each customer get the current change."
good,"The work wasn't bad, I had the misfortune of being laid off, and there wasnt much to be done about it. Third manager in a store that needed two."
good,A typical work day is cleaning and handling customer needs.
good,A typical work day would ensure total customer satisfaction and the daily duties of running a shift at Wendy's. I learned in order to be the standard you have to set the standard. I was a shift manager while was there. I loved working with employees and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the poor upper leadership from the general manager. The most enjoyable part was working for the public.
good,"My experience was great, have learned a lot. That was my first job working as sale teams and prepared salads and more the most important When I needed to leave my manager won’t letting me go made me feel special that’s have done great job."
good,"Working fast food was a great start for me but, now that I have a beautiful baby girl to look after, I need to have a better paying job with benefits. "
good,"Working at Wendy’s was my first job, it was fast pace was always something to do, shifts were good also since I worked here during the summer, managers were nice some of the team members were nice as well and some weren’t."
good,I think this job is better for teens who are in school or just looking for a first job. Great benefits and opportunities to learn and give great customer service and handling food.
good,"It really wasn't for me but it was a great stepping stone in finding other jobs. It helps build character when you're under pressure, stressed out, and deal with difficult costumers."
good,Working at wendys would be a good experience job for upcoming works. I wouldn’t tell someone to make wendys a career job. Wendys also has great management
good,As a crew it’s great flexibility with the schedule fun crew and management good training for most. As a manager it’s hard lack of training in the crew long hours with no breaks most days have many ppl missing so your very short staffed. It can be fun it’s always busy time goes fast
good,"Good hours and fast work, always something to do.."
good,"It was a good working environment, kept me busy and liked to give customer service. The pay was not enough to live off of and eventually closed down. Only reason I had to find a new job"
good,Everything was good and all but the manager always & constantly asked me for nudes then played it off as a drunk text the next morning. It got out of hand when he asked me on a date then I ended up leaving the place since he made me uncomfortable.
good,It was a pleasure to be able to hire young people and teach them work ethics and working with others in a learning environment. Helping to open other stores was great
good,"Uniform must always be in check, managers are very nice. Easy learning, other workers very helpful. Customers are great. It’s always fun and a good day."
good,It was very relaxed workplace. Very nice people who help you out when you need it. They were also very understanding and teach you very well until you are comfortable with it.
good,"A typical day at work was like chores that needed to to be done. I’ve learned that cross contamination is very serious when it comes to fast food restaurants. Management was was okay, they weren’t the best nor the worst. The workplace was kind of an adjustment to me because I wasn’t very familiar with the location. The hardest part of the job is when it was 4 of us by ourselves running the restaurant on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 30min breaks."
good,"Some days are always going to better than others, but it's easy to bond with the people there. Everyday is different, but as long as you're crew is good, so are you. It's all about the overall experience with the people you're around that make it worth it."
good,I love my working community the people around made you wanna come to work very kinda family like I definitely would go back and work gains for the Wendy’s I worked for .
good,"dedicated 1 1/2 to wendy's, great training store, easy people to work with, delight to learn and gain experience for further jobs, best part of the job was always being busy."
good,It was a cool place to work but poor management. They barley gave hours and never full action to do anything. Manager just walked around and sucked...
good,Wendy’s has a good managing team and will mostly guarantee time off if told in advanced. The crew you work with are either there for the same reason you are or built their career life there. They will welcome any employee with a smile on their face.
good,Think this will make it easier for new people like my self that has not done a application in over 13 years. So I am happy someone came up with something to make it easier.
good,While working in Wendy’s I’ve experienced a lot. I’ve met a lot of people that became my friends and also while working it’s very stressful when there’s short staff. But I always remained humble and happy and kept a smile on my face.
good,Had a great time working as a team to get things done stayed busy most of the time and learnt how to run a register and I love to work with the public you gotta be willing to learn and you can't be shy bc alot of people ate at wendys
good,"I currently work for Wendy's and to say that it's fun to work here would be a lie. Don't get me wrong, the job is nice and all but if you're just starting out as a first job I wouldn't recommend it. It's very stressful and fast paced, with the added addition of some co-workers who are either rude or don't offer their assistance when you need it the most even if they are not doing anything at the moment. So lack of teamwork at times, it's an ok job at times but most of the time you'll be struggling to pull your hair out from how stressful and fast paced it is."
good,"The customers were really nice,and working there was fun. It was set up nicely and the videos were easy to understand,on how things worked. Friendly staff,and some of the management was nice!"
good,"Clean washroom if street people sick and make mass ,and some time people use washroom for socide. And all is okay thx.and I like to carpet cleaning and serve food there thier own table ."
good,"I love the job. Manager loved me every time there is a busy rush at the store she always calls me I always get the job done. I am never lacking at my work always on time never been late to work, always clean my area after I leave for work."
good,Team  and satisfying the customers it was fast pace and doing your work I worked there a long time almost 18 years with no other to find something better
good,"It was a cool place to work in as your first job, but them knowing it's your first job they should push you more to be more responsible and a leader. The managers are there but not really there. My interview was very simple and I got the job on the spot."
good,"its fast paced, have to remember how to make everything. manager was cool. i didnt like when left smelt like fryer grease. Got discounts thought so made up for it."
good,"A fast pace company with opportunity to gain management and customer service skill you will need to be a success. To manage, maintain excellent customer service,and solve problem at a fast pace"
good,"Was a well experienced job and taught me things about the working industry, supportive team members, and an echo friendly environment to be surrounded in"
good,I worked there barely over a year as a manager. We recently got a new General Manager and she really doesn't know how to coach or lead a team. And me myself as an assistant manager had to coach and help her do her gm tasks
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning tables, counters, chairs, and walls. I took orders and put the food together. Everyone I worked with put in a good effort. The hardest part of my job was I never had any help and I was new."
good,had A GREAT time working here but I had to attend schooling the next few moths so this job was more of a part-time gig if anything but I really enjoyed my time here.
good,Management is great but CEO of the store is money hungry and likes to do anything to make money even if that's cutting hours by 20 hours each person  .. other then the CEO it is a fun and busy job with great people to work with .. Management is the best there
good,I liked the job but the store was to much drama and not enough work hours and pay the management was horrible and and so was the employees but they always keep fresh and fast food for their customers
good,"took orders and i  cleaned the dining room and the bathroom ,i was drive thru window operator ,i worked different Wendy's a time or two they were short handed"
good,It's a very fast pace store. The team works together to get thing done. Cashier's are very polite and respectful. The managers are excellent with handling the crew and guest in the store.
good,I liked the job and all but after a while you'll see that people don't mess with there food. If you're not accurate then get ready to take a blame and fix it. I just want to work but just not with food.
good,"The managers was great. Give you enough time to learn position. Positive vibes as a work place. I have work here for a Year and a half. This was my first job and they thought me awareness, communication, and responsibility."
good,"It has good food, very clean, costumer is always get their order right friendly co workers you are treated fair very nice people helpful when u need it"
good,I cleaned the store while taking orders made sure the store stayed spotless. I scrubbed the floors did the dishes and preped food for the day. I opened and sometimes closed the store.
good,"Fast paced environment with delicious food.  This was my first job "
good,i actually enjoy my time at this job because majority of every body is like family and we all treat eachother like family . and hands down i have the best managaers except for ine in the entire world !
good,I enjoyed Wendy's a lot and if I could go back I would . Wendy's is one of the bed jobs I had . The managers were well mannered and helped when it was needed .
good,"Perfect for those in school and working, because they work really well with scheduling."
good,"Must be bale to deal with stressful situations in a proffesional manner, also while being able to maintain production rate. Would recommend as a first job."
good,"Overall, I would say Wendy's is a loving place with a variety of foods that are on the tasty side of things. The customer service there is great and dining in is quite enjoyable."
good,They are a bit demanding and upper management can me quite rude with dealing with scheduling. Overall I enjoyed working there they had pay raise every six months
good,I would work front cash and the grill. I lerarned how to deal with customers and my customer service skills has increased. I learned how to move at a high pace and meet some really nice people in the process.
good,My job at Wendy's was to maintain store product and also require tonwork as a team and also communicate and resolve their issue if they are any issue going on
good,I personally had problems with people in the work place but overall it was a good place to work for someone who can cope and manage with fast pace environments
good,"I have worked for wendy's for a total of 4 years, some days were horrible and some days are great. However, good management is key and that tends to be the down fall in place like wendy's."
good,Great with working with my schedule but is not the career i want to be in. Management is not the best. They will work with you if needed to. This is a job for now till I find a better paying job or just find a better job with good management.
good,"If you are looking for a job if you are under the age of 18, apply to Wendys. They pay decent. Raises are frequent if you are a hard worker. A starting out, part time job is what this place is."
good,first job I had so I had to get use to the working world I learned for the first time how to use a cash register and how to work with customers as well as other people
good,"I like the pwople at wendy's they have good management , but at timw it is hard but every job is hard , but you gotta work either way . our company is very good we are very hard workers"
good,Wendys was my first job and I leaned how to work with speed.  I learned how to multitask better than I did before. The crew and managers are all hardworking. If your a good consistent worker then you will have a consistent schedule.
good,It was a great experience but I did in fact reach my limit for professional growth develop.I have really learn a lot about young people and to control cost.
good,Wendys always has a great vibe.  With it being my first job the mangers helped a lot and explained things to make it more enjoyable and how to manage my time.
good,You have to make sure your on a good fast pastes. And you have good customer service. And always try to make sure that the customers are happy no matter what.
good,work here for about a year and the job wasn't bad at all. it's okay job to start off. I recommend it to high school scholars looking for work experience.
good,At the Wendy's I worked for was a great work place ! Crew and mangers were great and was overall a good job . They worked with my schedule and never gave me issue
good,Personally it was a high school job for me and I enjoyed the 2 years that I have worked there. All and all there is opportunity to grow inside the company if you are willing to put in the extra work.
good,It's a physically demanding job with a lot of fun staff and flexible hours. Training is simple and it's easy to grow within the company.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I started as a cashier and I work myself up to a shift manager. Only thing i have to say about this company is they over work the great workers and allow the other coworkers slack.
good,it was a goo place to work had great managers i would usually work the grill but they had me clean a lot as well and the coworkers wold help me with anything i needed help with
good,I enjoyed working for wendy's. love being a cashiers there. the customers are great the staff is great but the hours is crazy. but over all I enjoyed it
good,"It can start hectic and end calmly, with a constant barrage of orders and simple workplace humor to keep things light and fun, from both co workers and management."
good,"Despite what our culture has come to believe; the fast food operator is quite the stressful job. With everyday being a battle to controll ones self against the raging hordes that are hungry customers, as well as provide a meaninful experience. The greatest chalange is that of the angry customer; for only the most proficcent can not only calm the disgruntled consumer, but bring the tilt of a smile to his/her cheeks!"
good,A typical day at work is always a busy and fun day. you get to work with your fun co-workers and meet new people through out the day. no matter how long you have worked you will always learn something new and its really exciting. trying to get their food out in under a minute is kind of hard but a rush at the same time.
good,a typical day at work is always the same clock in clean take orders and cook if y r trained. i learned a little not a whole lot just basically how to run cashier. my co workers was a happily team i learned how to manage the team how to do write ups and also how to supervise while supervisor was gone.
good,"A good store is hard to find, and even when you think you have it bad, you don't. You don't realize how good your store actually was until you go to another one that is just as bad, if not worse. The crew honestly depends on the management. Bad management = bad crew. If you don't have a cohesive management team, the entire store is in shambles, whether it be due to cleanliness, customer service, product quality, or the overall attitude and atmosphere of the store. If you find a store that is completely cohesive and there's no drama; good for you! You're a lucky one."
good,Come in begininng setting up for the big lunch rushes.Learned new ways to help irritated and impatient customers. Hardest part of my job is being ignored by co-workers who have been there longer when I need some assistance.
good,good customer service and a good place to work with excellent managers. and always having something to do and never bored
good,Highly competitive environment. Loved being in direct contact with the people. Loved being able to train my own staff and the efficiancy they worked with. Perfect type job for my personality.

The most enjoyable part of my job was giving direction and ensuring business flow, as someone who worked in customer service for 6 years i have experience and it was time i took a step up and showed my skills for a management member, a typical day at work was like a typical get together, we all knew our jobs and we knew how to get things done on time and properly"
good,when I first started working here I loved it I would call on my days off to see if I could go in it was at a truck stop so we would get supper busy but my co workers at the time were awesome so we would get the job done
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes busy and sometimes slow. at this job i learned how to cook on the grill,took orders in the store/drive thru,and fulfill the customer needs and wants promptly. my management team was hardworking and cooperative. my co-workers was reliable and trustworthy.the hardest part of the job was restocking and trying to take orders at the same time. the most enjoyable part of the job was when get the tasks done as a team."

good,"A typical day at work is fun, but stressful on a daily basis. I have learned to multitask, to always be one step ahead of everything, to be able to think about the what if's and what can and might happen. The management team is pretty good, they are dependable at times. My co-workers are who keep me coming back to work each day. Hardest part of the job is having to cover multiple positions if people do not show up. The most enjoyable is when everyone is able to work, but still have fun with each other."
good,"I would prep vegetables and salads, re stock the areas that needed to be stocked(condiments,drinking cups,cutlery,sauces,salads,hamburger patties ect..) i would help manager open up restaurant.

The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and working with others"
good,work hard work toghether hardset part closing resturant most enjoyable was working at fast pace getting customers in and out with accuracy
good,"Fast paced, Overseeing opening of the restaurant, follow-up on paperwork from previous day. Training new crew members."
good,"Take the guests orders, making sure their needs are met 100% and they are satisfied. I learned what customer service was, and how to handle many different situations. I also learned more communication skills and how to talk to guests. The managers are really fun to be around and demanding when need be. The co-workers were really fun and good people. My job was never really considered hard. But I've had better days than others of course. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I made someone's order the right way and that they were completely satisfied."
good,"Great culture, ability to make your own schedule, and plenty of opportunity to move up. It'll teach you the basics of having a job, but be careful not to get too comfortable. If you wind up at a good store you'll find no reason to leave with the ability to work whenever you want."

good,"To keep it short and simple, people at wendys are awesome and it was a very nice job to work at. I met a lot of nice people and everyone there was always willing to help."
good,"up beat, fast paced work environment, running a drive thru register and customer service skills"
good,I did not face any problem.I enjoy working in a team and my all managers was really good .overall i enjoyed my work
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is working with a team at a fast pace. I learned how to manage the employee's, and make sure customers are always satisfied with our service. My co-workers always have a fun time on my shift, at the same time are dedicated to their given tasks. The hardest part of the job is the peek time of the day, which is lunch time. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with different type of people each day."
good,"Management was bad. The crew members had too much control with managerment. Mess around with your schedule too much, easy to learn nessessary skills for the job. Met tons of diferent people everyday. Overall you need self control with the customers and a nice friendly attitude."
good,A typical day at work i came in and i would get my assignment which would ether be on the grill or on deep fryer or on cleanup .I've never had any problems with any of my co-workers or mengement.The hardest part of my job was working on the line fixing the diffrant sandwitches. But other then that my job was very injoyable.
good,This was a great first job! Everyone was so laid back and the manager was a ton of fun.
good,"I was a manager for Wendy's and I learned so much from that experience. I learned what I can expect from employees when you treat them with respect and honesty. My co-workers were really knowledgeable and helpful managers and the crew alothough sometimes a little wild, was a great crew to deal with. The crew knew when it was time to work and time to relax. The hardest part about the job was being the closing manager every night but it was ok. The most enjoyable part was being the youngest manager there and still being able to have great numbers like my superior managers."
good,very nice people to work with.
good,"Pay sucks of course. But if you're a high school student, or just need a second job wendy's is pretty cool."
good,"This was my very first job."
good,"Typical day of works was getting the restaurant set up for lunch and dinner rushes. On the side I would train managers, hire new employees, order inventory, and making sure my customers left happy.,"
good,Working for Wendy’s I learned how to do different task n deal with customers and learned new skills to help me become a great employee. The bad things was some poor management
good,"Honestly, this place is great to work at. You meet a lot of new people and build great bonds. It's not a very difficult job, although it can get a little stressful on Sundays when people are returning from church. My particular store was great."
good,Chill workers bad management makes sandwiches wrong very little teamwork rude workers make orders wrong write up for little things bad work effort slack
good,my experience with working at wendys was good other than how some of the staff treated me. they were mean and condesending which made me feel stupid 11
good,"Fue mi primera experiencia laboral y recibí una capacitación muy buena para entrar preparado en temas éticos y de seguridad. Fue un trabajo muy duro y una experiencia bastante fuerte al ser comida rápida. Sin embargo, me llevé experiencia y aprendí en cuanto a mi formación laboral."
good,"It’s a fast food place, work with lots of different people, fast past. Good food learn food quality. Provide amazing customer service. Have to work as a team."
good,"Great experiences in food handling, customer service, scheduling, and inventory. Must work 45 hours a week, with long days. Great place to work at if you have good management teams."
good,"Your willingness to work long hours and can stand long period of time. You will encounter different nationality nice and rude customer. Be friend with staffs."
good,"Flexible work schedule.  Not the greatest pay for the work.  Experience depends on  store environment and manager staff."
good,"Fast paced  and easy to get the bang of in some ways"
good,"Wendy's is a very fast work paced because you have so many customers coming in back to back. Sometimes you may have a lot of rude customers, and you have to know how to deal with them in a professional manner."
good,"Coworkers were to lazy to do there jobs and customers rushing you for they food, because they see you and not your coworkers. Loved the fact the managers coup with my school schedule."
good,Wendy's was a fun job to have as an teenager. The life balance is great because the hours aren't always a lot. the shifts consist of 4 hours. Very relaxed environment.
good,There are no room for advancement and management is awful. They over work you with little pay. This job is good for a teenager but not for adults. I don’t like it.
good,I liked working at Wendy's. The atmosphere was great and all but they kept cutting my hours and I got paid $10.40 per hour. I wasn't satisfied with the amount I was making since I'm a student so I left. But I'm glad with whatever they provided while I was working there.
good,"This environment was amazing and very welcoming at the beginning, They were always open to new employees and showed positive attitudes when engaging with costumers."
good,its not the best job but if you need to build up your experience then its a great start. they also have end of the year reviews which determines your raises
good,Loved working there was fast paced and challenging everyday. The people were awesome and super friendly. I loved working with customers who became regulars and friends.
good,"Welcome the customers as they step into the restaurant Deal with clients in the most polite manner possible Take record of orders made by customers both at the drive-through and counter, depending on where he/she is stationed"
good,"I worked for Wendy for a little over 5 years I worked my way to the top just to become more stressed out than usual. Corporate are amazing people, they make sure you're happy as best they can. The job just becomes overwhelming when you don't have the staff you need to succeed."
good,it was always fast paced but we were always understaffed. On most nights a manager had close 2 or more positions which got super stressful. The reason I stayed so long though because of the super fun work environment.
good,Things could be better with some of the management and they could help out a little more than what they do I was an assistant manager working hard assisting customers and making sure their order's was taken right making sure I greet and smile when my customers come in for a bite to eat
good,"I was a very good worker always worked late n over time & did what i was supposed to do, then they blammed something on me that was not my fault & let me go.."
good,very good management very good attitudes from everyone that worked there customers were always leaving happy very clean always on task always made food fresh good place to spend money
good,"You always stay busy thru the day. Working in a fast food place is stressful but, you get thru it. The management is nice. It has a nice culture to the business. Making sandwiches. Being around good people."
good,I enjoy working there and already know most of the same customers and what they want. Also greet them with the most heart warming smile. Thanks you...
good,Wendy's was an great experience. The crew members were like family and everyone cared for each other. If the pay rate was better I would currently be working there.
good,"A typical day would entail food prep, being assigned to a station to serve from: front register, sandwiches, grill, runner, drive thru window register, lots of cleaning afterwards."
good,"Workplace was chaotic. Management was decent, but wasn't the greatest. You learned something new everyday, whether it was dealing with new sandwiches, or new routines on how to prep stuff. There wasn't much of a hard part of the job, unless you were by yourself. Greatest part was the customer service."
good,Good place to work but they dont compesante to employees you work hard but your pay doesnt show it.  Managers felt like they were higher then employees and didnt have to work
good,"Well, usually at work i would just either wash dishes in the back or cook on the grill or be on the fry station. From time to time we would get busy but that never stopped me from performing my best in the workplace."
good,"Nice management, great customer service, decent full time hours, friendly work environment, good location, nice work space, good employee discount,  great food"
good,"This is a fun place to work, except management team is very unprofessional and chooses favorites in associates. Very unorganized and unfriendly staff."
good,a typical day at work will consist of me and a couple co workers just feeling good  about our drive thru time and  time under a good number working at a good pace .
good,Wendys over all isn't that bad of a company to work for.  Free food and drinks and discounts.  The management could have a little better communication but over all isn't that bad.
good,"very busy upbeat atmosphere,took customers orders and prepared them,made schedules,money control,managed food control along with waste control,also did all orders for deliveries"
good,A typical day for me when I was working at wendy was my after school thing most so it was my young days. Got along good with everyone there. The hardest part was actually working along with school and sport; while trying to keep up with friends also.
good,My typical day at work was spent trying to not get frustrated. I handled rushes fairly easily. I learned how to stand up for myself. The hardest part of the job was being in North Texas. The most enjoyable part of the job was secretly feeling like the guy from Good Will Hunting.
good,"I enjoyed my Job at Wendy's. My typical day at work consisted of taking orders, getting to know lots of people, preparing food, always smiling, and working hard.I learned how to work with people and great customer service skills. I enjoyed meeting new people, working with great workmates, and learning new things everyday."
good,"There isn't really much to say here besides I just worked and went home. I liked the people I worked with, and they made it really comfortable while I was there. It got fast paced, but they never pressured you to do the i,possible, just expected the best."
good,"put in a lot of hard work was always their when they needed me to come in always on time helped others when they need my help,front cashier"
good,"A typical work day for me as a shift supervisor consisted of coaching up to 10 people into, through, and out of positions. I had to make sure that all food safety procedures were being followed at all times. Making sure that all procedures were being followed ensured that all customers were satisfied. All of my crew members really enjoyed working with me I set the tone for my employees with my positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job for me had to be helping employees learn and perfect all procedures."
good,The job is very demanding; fast paced; and detail - oriented. Great customer service is a Must!!! The company is very diverse and offers great opportunities of advancement. There is honestly nothing hard about this job. The absolute most enjoyable and important part of my job is keeping the customers satisfied and make it my personal job to make sure their experience at Wendys was a happy and positive experience. Be sure you make them want to come back.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was laid back in the morning preparing for the lunch shift. The lunch shift was always busy and very face-paced. i loved it because it made time go by faster. I learned that u have to learn fast and make sure the guests is happy. Management team was great and patient. My co-workers were nice and helpful. Nothing was hard about working at Wendy's. The most enjoyable was working with a great team and learning about healthy food,"
good,typical day there is jus to take care of customers...customers are always right
good,"i worked for wendy's for about a year and 3 months, i do a great job as in gettin my work done correctly. i am kind to customers and treat them with respect. i rarely make any errors in doin my job i find it as a easy thing to do"
good,Hard worker management in a fast place. Co-workers are good trainers and graceful for their help. Learn vary position within a fast food environment. It was a good start for a first job held.
good,"It was an overall great job, just need more money. The people there made me feel welcomed and we had a lot of fun together. I love to work, but the hardest part was when people was unhappy."
good,I loved working at Wendy's would do it again. Love how everyone gets a schedule letting everyone take turns at different stations. An I love there grilled maple beacon sandwiches
good,I been working for Wendy’s for a very long time. Wendys is definitely a company you can grow with.. I started as a crew was promoted into management.i enjoy being a manager.
good,"Normally when we start with the early morning rush it can get hectic, but dies down quickly when we all work together. This showed us the importance of teamwork and time management"
good,"I liked the job because of some of the people I worked with. I can honestly say, the manager I had made sure everything was clean and sanitized as it should be. I learned to respect people in that environment because its pretty intense during rush hour."
good,Great company. I really enjoyed working there for the little time that I did. The people were kind and informative with helping and training me. I would definitely recommend someone to work at Wendy’s.
good,Great workplace and environmemt. Great coworkers and management. The work is not hard at all and is very simple and easy to do. All in all it was great working experience.
good,"The management was great. I learned how to clean, cook and prepare food, count money and run the cash register. The most enjoyable job is working with crew members that love there job."
good,Wendy's is a great first job experience . There was a huge amount of workload and it was always busy. The environment was nice with cooperative management.
good,not a company i would recommend if you have self respect. they care very little about their workers. they give you little training and expect you to do it all yourself
good,It is a positive workspace although sometimes it can get hectic when there are so many customers but not enough employees. Other than that it was good. I'm just looking for a cooler environment it was quite hot in there with all the grease and smoke in the air.
good,"Wendy's is a great company and I learned well customer service ,good management from there. I am working in Wendy's very friendly  environment."
good,Wendy’s didn’t really have nothing fun to do it was always slow but they did give out toys for the kids. I like working at places that gets busy a lot no standing around.
good,It was a great starter job loved the team and the opportunity to advance quickly in the career.The people where great but very fast paced. This job is not for anyone who is looking to get insurance.
good,"At my time at Wendy's I had enjoyed it because the work environment was pleasant. Everybody was friendly, and tries to make the best of everything. All the workers really wanted the best for everybody."
good,"Management needs to improve , other than that it was a great place to experience working at a fast food restaurant. Its fast paced , you meet a lot of cool employees, tasks are easy and simple"
good,Working for Technicolor gave me the experience to work in a plant at a fast but staedy work pace. It taught me how to work with others to get a job done.
good,"Typical day at work will always be a fast paced and fun place.  I learned great customer service skills and how to work in a fast paced production.  The enjoyable part is the people, everyone is friendly and great to work with."
good,"Bad benefits, good work hours and management and experience. good for survival job. Lots of skills get polished. But because of too many managers, it becomes difficult to carry out orders from 3 people since many a times they clash with each other. They don't want to spend on employees but from a survival  point of view its ok if you don't get anything else"
good,Go in check to make sure I have all my positions covered. hardest thing Is to make sure I find coverage. the most enjoyable is that the employees are great to work with. What I learned was I was able to meet labor on a daily basis.
good,"The work environment is quick, it keeps you on your toes, I learned how to balance numerous items meaning multitasking is one of my many qualities, also the managers and coworkers are nice, friendly, motivating, and push you always to do your best no matter what task you are assigned."
good,Good job good people clean place to eat working there you got to work as a team to provide coustmers 100% happiness
good,This was my first job so I enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like staying there til 3 in the AM.
good,in an everyday basics i work with more than 9 co-workers we all manage to work together and help eachother out i always try my best to make the costumer happy no matter how busy i am. i make sure the costumer leaves with a smile and try to do my best to make them come back.
good,"I worked here for a short period of time, during the summer.  Just worked to help out my grandmother who was the boss at the time.  People would drop off there clothes, we would wash, dry and fold the clothes for them.  Neatly pack them away and the customers would come and pick them up.  We also had tanning beds, which customers used regularly, had to clean those and make sure they were presentable for the next customer."
good,"I started my shifts out by doing a walk thru, I would go around the building, pick up any trash, then work my way inside and made sure my customers were happy a satisfied with what they ordered, then I would work my way behind the line and greet all my crew members, then I would make sure I was set up for my shift."
good,"amazing time Wendy's uses fresh, never frozen beef on every hamburger, every day. But wait, there's more... from chicken wraps and 4 for 4 meal deals to chili, salads, and frostys, we've got you. See the menu and find a location near you. Can't come to us? Download the DoorDash app to get Wendy's delivered."
good,"busy days "
good,a typical day at Wendys was prepping the food before the stores opens & keeping the restaurant clean. I learned all fast food restaurants are hectic and you must have lots pf patience. my managers were very strict & always kept us on our feet. the hardest part of my job was cleaning with no dishwasher. the  most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers.
good,"When I started working at Wendy's, I learned how to work in a fast pace and count money faster. While working I made new friends and could talk about anything with them."
good,"Wendy's was my first job so I was pretty excited to work there. it was fun and the people there were like a family to me. I can say though, it isn't a job I would make a career out of."
good,"Wendys was a learning experience for me, i learned how to better communicate with not only the guests but my management and team as well. It was over all decent."
good,"This place was really good. Helpful and friendly work environment."
good,great hour great money fun friend outgoing people outgoing co works fun management great first time jobs easy money very busy place
good,we do everything there we stock the areas clean them I ran the register fries sandwich grill and anything thing else there was to do
good,"I Set up my station and then I clock in, and begin to make the customers order. At Wendy's I learned how to work quick and efficiently. My co-workers are kind, and very helpful. The hardest part of the job when you first start and need to be quick paced. I enjoy cleaning my station and making the sandwiches for the customers."
good,started out as a team member;moved up to shift lead;really enjoyed the crew and management team
good,"when you come to work you see that needs too be done and what to do too be done if the person has left their shift stocked it up before you get a customer. everyone help each other out when needed it makes it easy on everyone and everyone will have a good day"
good,"A typical day at work would be going into work, setting the headset up, clocking in and getting my station together. I would dumb fries, nuggets, chicken and such in the fryer when needed. Or I would stand side grill and put meet down. I would make shakes, salads and much more. I learned how to do Drive-thru. Management honestly is not the best thing there. They let people get away with a lot of things that they shouldn't. Most of my co-workers were alright. The hardest part of that job was trying to satisfy those managers. They are so picky, they don't even care if you are short on your drawer. So it was hard to do right, when they expected wrong. The most enjoyable part of this job, was chatting with customers and one of the managers."
good,i loved working for wendys
good,"One day at work it wasn't really busy I cleaned up all my area's. Then I just start making jokes having fun making my co-workers laugh and smile."" I learned how to work with others fitting in with the organization of the company to help the growth. The management were great and kind of hard to have someone tell you what to do could get rough in aggravated.The hardest part about the job is cleaning up while its busy. I enjoy working with others helping the organization growth making many sales."
good,"The most enjoyable was the travel and the income. I was trained for several weeks and then I was able to take over my own shifts, I opened and I closed. I made deposits. I worked on schedules."
good,I love wendys. It was very fun. At times it could have been better but i enjoyed it. Good food and gkod employees and managers. Thet could have payed more but its ok.
good,"They know hoe to satisfy their customers and employees as well, it was just a temporary job for me. I wouldn’t recommend them for a long term job but for temporary they are great."
good,If your want to start somewhere where they will work with your hours wendys is the place to go . It will help you work up in life and as a teen it's good pay
good,It's a nice clean environment... the people are very respectful and well put together. Food always hot and fast and it's never a long wait.everyone always has a smile on their faces
good,"this was my first real job after summer youth and i loved it. it was in the Bronx on Westchester, ave and i received many hours and was paid very well."
good,Focus on there job duties and customers. My most enjoyable part was making are customers happy and employees. Help in every position on the job to make a difference.
good,"I worked in Wendy's about 5 years of my college life , what this jobs I got my first car . I finish the college working in this place . This was my first jobs since I was in college ."
good,Working a Little Caesars give me the opportunity of of my mind and expand my horizons very committed dedicated in a hard hard worker I learned a lot working through and he's always always go back if they would let me
good,this is a job for children I was there for a while finishing high school working 5-1am or 2am it was a stress free jib for me would i go back yes if i had to
good,Work very hard and I think the hardest part f the Job is drive thru and clean at the same time I love meeting new co workers  love passing the taking customers orders love washing dishes and making drinks
good,Its a busy reasturant I learn teamwork management are hard workers my co-workers were wonderful made me proud to be part of the wendys team cleaning the ovens was hard but got done
good,this was my first job and it helped me to gain good work ethics and customer service skills
good,A typical day working at Wendy’s is very difficult. I’ve learned a lot working at Wendy’s. I learned how to handle cash registers and cash. I learned how to cook and prepare food for customers.
good,"Staff was great , helped WHOLE TEAM when needed without asking ! Everyone pitched in with great customer service when it came to handling customers. Loved coworkers"
good,Was ok when I was in high school with less responsibilities . You have to have a good attitude at all times to deal with customers. Must learn all positions.
good,"Greeted customers entering establishment. Received payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issued receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Counted money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change. Cleaned work areas, equipment, utensils. Stored food in designated containers and storage areas to prevent spoilage. Prepared a variety of foods according to customers' orders or supervisors 				instructions, followed approved procedures."
good,"This was my very first job. It enlightened me about the job experience but it wasn't very pleasant. The store manager was mean,  but the shift managers was pretty nice. Good food. It was okay."
good,"fun , never was a boring day it was always something new to learn and do . i didn't go in everyday just to sit at the desk and answer the phone i was doing multiple things"
good,The wendys that I'd in 2008 the whole store was very disfunctional  I really do not have anything good to say about my wendy's experience.
good,By far the worst job ever. i will never work in fast food ever again .
good,what i learned at Wendy's is to work in a fast paced environment. my management was less than fair. i loved my co workers they are all team helpers. The hardest part of the job is the lunch hour. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers they give out a great energy in stressful times
good,Wendys was a normal fast food place. A typical day included taking care of costomers in drive thru. Making sure the food was hot when served. Learned alot about cooking and preparing food. Management was poor. Co-workers were nasty and rude. The hardest about my job was dealing with smell of grease. The most enjoyable part was my costomers. They always put a smile on my face.
good,I've worked for Wendy's for 6 years. For the first 3 years everything ran smoothly and overall I had no complaints. After the 3 year mark the district manager continually promised me managership but failed to pull through with said promises. Additionally others who were working for the company for less time then I had and were underqualified were made managers before me. One of these managers screamed at her entire crew and had a melt down in the manager office and was allowed to continue working as a manager with no repercussions.
good,"I am a closer....in my store usually it is me and one manager closing the store after 10 .  He has to do paperwork  so all the real work is left up to me .... I've been there a year...no raise....no  promised pay increase for working night shift alone......   "
good,My experince working at wendys was ok it gave me something to do it gave me more experince with working with customers.I was on the cashier window in the line of drive thru so it gave me alot of energy and i love the customers.
good,The job was fun and relaxing. I enjoyed my coworkers. Sometimes the hours would be a bit to much but none the less it was a good job. The management at that time was poor however.
good,"As cashier i just took orders and collected payment . It was my first job so i learned to be apart of a crew and good customer service. Hardest part was lunch rush ,most enjoyable part was customer interactions."
good,"Its a job where you can make money, The chances of promotion are slim to non even if you work hours on end and go over an above, Management is a joke 95% of the time not knowing how to cover crew jobs for breaks or how to handle situations, You will always be asked to do way more then your paid for."
good,"Fast paced. Okay management and the hardest part was the constant shift of hours and days that I had to work. A typical day at work was getting everything stocked before the lunch rush, working said lunch rush till about 5 pm."
good,I enjoyed working at wendys but i just want something where i can grow and with them they never trust young people i tend to blame us for everything when it really the mangers who don't do the work.
good,the managers were great ppl I liked the enviroment and the customers but no room for advancement
good,Wendys was a nice place to work with a decent paycheck as long as the manager liked you. They do not care about customer service at all and will give you old nasty food.
good,"The hardest part of the job was being forced to literally give up my personal life for the work life. Missed out on so much with family & friends for the job. When my father passed away December 2018, I was given no bereavement pay from the job and had to struggle financially after wards."
good,General management was terrible. Food safety was never followed.                          The balance between life and work was uneven and I worked more than I was home due to no labor.
good,"working at Wendys was okay.co- workers were friendly, but management was no good. i was scheduled for an entire week off. after talking to my manager it wasn't fixed."
good,I like Wendy's it was the managers I couldn't deal with at all. Was accused of stealing $40 from my cash register when it was the managers whom didn't replace the money after taking it out from my drawer to give to another employee cause they draw needed change
good,I really like working at my current job at Wendy's. The hours and the pay really has me literally living paycheck to paycheck. Some weeks are better then others as far as the hours go so i never know what to expect. After 7 weeks i received 2 raises and was asked to become a manager. I wanted to take the job but with so much to carry on and the pay was not much more then what i am currently receiving and no benefits i could not take it.
good,it was a great place good customers great co workers love the food I learned a lot about salad mKING CLEANING THE FRYERS MONEY HANDLING.  THE RAINGNG TOO 6 WEEKS
good,Good for a fist job/ part time job while in school.Good training and support. not very much room for advancement. skills learned can help with future employment.
good,"It was alright experience, but the lack of actual devotion from the owners was almost nonexistent. They provide no motivation or incentive for their employees."
good,"A typical day at work was very hectic, stressful, and hard work. The management sucked and we could hardly keep a manager that actually would help you instead of staying in the back room. We weren't even allowed to eat the mess-ups which I think was unnecessary and ignorant."
good,After working on this job for several years I trained incoming management with no compensation or even a thank you. I was an assistant manager for 11 years and I never received a pay raise or bonus. So after giving Wendy's years of my life I decided to move on.
good,"First job I had, while I was still in Highschool. It taught me responsibility and how to manage my time between school and work. It also taught me the importance of money management."
good,I would work 10 hour shifts wirh only one 30 minute break. We always ran out of supplies because the manager wouldnt order them. People who don't deserve to get promoted did and she would let certain people slack off but if someone else did they'd get yelled at.
good,"For a minimum wage position, and my first job, I believe that it was overall a great work experience. However, I did struggle with management and my pay"
good,I enjoy working here. I work different hours and have a different crew working with me daily. Management is alright.
good,condescending tone toward everyone from the manager. she is just there cause she is friends with the owner. knows nothing about a restaurant.
good,"For extremely low-pay you have a varied amount of responsibilities which is not really the problem. I enjoyed working with the customers, doing the dishes, staying busy, helping the team, and working hard. I did not however like how the assistant manager was allowed to treat myself and numerous employees poorly. It made it extremely difficult to be able to do a satisfactory job and provide the best customer service possible. Plus, $7.25 an hour, to not only have left shifts on numerous occasions crying as a result of treatment, told by my upper manager to just blow her off. Well I could not, finally enough came to be enough, and I quit."
good,"Had to cashier, prep food, take orders, be friendly. Fun co-workers, management was nice, caring, respectful."
good,I thought that it was a very messy job as far as gossip goes. Nobody really respected each other and the managers had their picks a chooses when it came down to the workers. The workers acted as if they didn't want to be there so people seen a lot of attitude.
good,"Your learn fast past working."
good,Wendy's was a great job I got paid every two weeks which was wonderful. Also learned that you keep track of how much you are suppose to make a night. The co-workers were very nice to be around but the hardest thing about the job was cleaning the dinning room. The wonderful thing about this job was making the customers happy.
good,"I was mainly a opener, so I would get everything ready for opening hours with two more ex-coworkers. Our two managers would just be in the office all day and only would come out when they where needed. Which was very unfair for when we had to go to break and our GM would hurry us up.Working there was stressful because of management,but every one I work with where nice and cared there own weight to it would be organized and steady. I learn patience and team work overall."
good,"Extremely stressful. Although you can make a lot of friends here, people talk a lot of smack behind your back, also with management you dont get hardly any feedback from anyone and no praise even if you worked there for a long time."
good,There were supposed to be 3 people in the store at all times. I was left alone a lot while my coworkers disappeared whether it be to go to the store or just hand out in the parking lot. 7.50 dollars an hour for 40-50 hours a week wasn't enough to live off of when I'm running the store alone for so long. I wanted a team environment where people took their jobs seriosuly.
good,"People were okay, management was horrible. They pay minimum wage which was okay at 16, but not something I could survive on. It was very fast paced and stressful."
good,Everyone I worked with were very kind and they were willing to work with you on your schedule. Typical day was filling orders for people who came in to eat. And keep store clean.
good,It’s a very hectic place to work for because you work so hard for little money and no benefits. You are always having to do someone else work putting you behind of finishing your work which leave you getting off late.
good,A typical work day at Wendys is beyond stressful there are more managers then there is crew and they often fight over what is right and what is wrong a lot of corporate rules are broken the cleanliness and safety rules are not enforced as well as they should be many food safety rules are broken.
good,Some Managers act like children. They wasn't doing the job that they were suppose to be doing. The job was more stressful then enjoyable. I did a lot of work but did not get the pins and things that was supposed to be rewarded to you when doing so.
good,I liked the place and liked coming to work. They were very good with helping you learn and deal with stressful situations during work. But they play favorites.
good,"Long days, Stressful environment. I knew pretty much every position and still wasn't a manager and had to beg for a raise. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to leave at the end of the day."
good,"Working at Wendy's for a year, you see and learn a lot of different things; but also with working there a year, it should be expected of the employer to promote from the inside before hiring a random manager from a completely different work experience. It has been a good time there, but I need a better paying job with better options available for me."
good,all fast food restaurants are the same. the only reason this one would be different is the quality of their food. other than that the management wasn't the sharpest and lazy.
good,its like any other fast food job. Hard work for little pay. Expect way more out of you then what they pay you for
good,"this was a ok company to work for. its just really fast paced, me and my friends worked there together in high school"
good,There are not a lot of promotions in the store. The managers were treating the crew like slaves and did more eating then trying to meet goals. There was not a lot of cleanliness. The hardest part of the job was keeping to yourself because everyone always thought it was social hour and on their phones. The enjoyable part of the job was the regulars that came in everyday.
good,i learned how to work in a good to mange my time and cooperate with other keep memeber of the group
good,i work very well i love communicating with my peers i greet customer and make sure they happy i learn working for Wendy's was a good experience and a good environment i was a cashier and a sandwich maker managers was accurate and helpful they help motivate us employee i co-workers was nice respectful and very helpful i have no rough times or regrets of the job but i had good times the most and best thing happen to me working a Wendy's was when i got hired and made a big change in the store services got faster customers wasn't complaining they was happy they joy on customers face made me settle good complaints made me happy we was rated the best Wendy's and the highest when i was there that was the most enjoyable part of that job.
good,"Working at Wendy's is a good first job. You learn good communicate skills and how to deal with difficult costumers. You learn how to work with others and be a team player. It can be frustrating and the store I work at there can be some improvement in management but it's not always bad. A typical day at Wendy's is tiring and you are on your feet for your entire shift but if you make friends they will make the day better. The hardest part of the job I'd say is staying on your feet and pushing through pain and fugitive, getting along with everyone can be hard and sometimes coworkers can be rude and frustrating but you can't let that get in the way"
good,I like to work there but when it come at the point when you have to survive with only wendy wage then forget about it. You have to find an another source of income to survive.
good,"Ive personally have had a bad time working at the location that I do. Lots of close with people who even managers can be rude, both to employees and customers at times."
good,"The managers at Wendy’s did not care about anything you did and the employees were never tidy or active with their work. Since the managers didn’t care, the team members didn’t care. Me being a great worker with work ethic, I had to quit because of the way the workplace was taken care of."
good,When i was first hired the manager was great but when she relocated to a new store things went downhill. schedules were always posted late in the week
good,"It was an okay place to work for a starter job, but otherwise unless you're willing to break your back you won't get far. The hours vary between reasonable and unreasonable, sometimes just wasn't enough."
good,The night manager at that wendys was amazing. But over all management was terrible. We all struggled really bad bc the general manager wouldnt hire anyone else to work at night so then we would always get introuble for not getting out of the work place fast enough.
good,"Overall, to be honest my job at Wendy's was not the best because I worked at a terrible location but I still had somewhat fun because of my customers were friendly to me and I was friendly back. The job was pretty simple once I got used to it and I was ready to do long hours but unfortunately I got fired because I was not going to some of the days they schedule me because it was outside of my availability. I learned that when working and your customers see you in uniform they look at you as the face of the company, the cashier is their first impression, only in the fast food industry that is. I learned that is why the cashier is so important not only for taking orders but being the first or last smile the customer sees."
good,"Although the pay is sufficient, and the the hours are plentiful, the workplace itself is highly chaotic."
good,"From what I have seen, Wendy's is more on the stricter side of fast food restaurants. It is very fast pace and requires you to have multiple responsibilities. It was a fun place to work at. The managers are very helpful and the crew is friendly."
good,"it susha ss toi n wro ther e the pay is not good the mangers act more like friends then bosses ifellm un appreciated and i want to expecjhe ,a beter work place"
good,I relocated and change jobs for a more advanced field in the work study area. I moved my occupation into the medical field. The job at wendys was a good job and i worked with great people. Management was good and the pay was okay for a first time job
good,"While working at Wendy’s I had many different responsibilities, but the most enjoyable time at work was when I closed the front, I could really focus."
good,It’s not a job to live off of but it’s a job. Doesn’t provide good benefits you work crazy hours for little pay very inconsistent managers can be selfish.
good,"Management made the job stressful. They do not care about their employees. They are rude to employees to their face and very rude to customers behind their back. Many employees have left due to the management being rude. The managers will talk badly about the employees to their face and to other employees. It was a stressful job. I did enjoy working with my fellow employees. And sometimes the management wasn't bad, but I just couldn't get along with them."
good,Great Customers It was very quick pact . Loved my customers . But I can say working there helped me to learn patience & Love meeting new people my customers would tell me so much about a lot I didn’t even think . it’s Good working there sometimes
good,Wendy’s is a fast pace yet fun place to work. Meeting new people and being able to engage with different people. Getting discounted prices for lunch is great as well.
good,". low pay"
good,"Came in did food prep, cleaned did drive thru and counter cashier. I learned that those aren't forever jobs. Management was ok what you would expect. Hardest part of the job was mean customers. The most enjoyable was it was easy"
good,"I would go in and If there was somebody that I needed to train first I would introduce myself. Secondly I would show them around, if they are working on a screen I will show them around the screen. Then I would show them where we keep all the things that needs stocking ( sauces, cups, lids, spoons, etc)  at. After that I will show them our clean procedures, if they are closing front counter I will also show them how to mop etc. Lastly I will let them take a order, bag a order, I might ask them to stock something we are running low on. Me doing that lets me know what they will have to work on and what they have taken over the course of me showing them everything. If they are doing good then I step back and slowly but surely let them take over by themselves. If they are running behind I step in, get them caught up, and I ask what happened. If they do not do good at all, I treat them special. No I don't baby them , But I do break thing down better and slower. Whenever they go home I begin stocking and going over everything they did. Just to make sure things was done right."
good,I was pregnant when I worked for this company and the manager would make me bend over the dish sink even though I was not supposed to be doing that type of work with as far along as I was.
good,"A typical day at work would include me either in the drive thru window or on the sandwich station making and bagging food for front and back personnel. I learned how to work in a quick paced, high-speed environment and how to work with customers. The hardest part of the job was at the end of the shift when everyone didn't want to pull their weight they were just ready to go ; on the other hand the most enjoyable part was working with people in my peers and pleasing the customers with no questions asked."
good,"It can be busy at times, but that comes with the job just do with smile on your face and work at a fast pace its no problem. I learned how to be a leader there thats how I become a manager. I also learned what the word team really means.The best part of the day was helping other"
good,"Wendys was a very friendly environment, the team was welcoming and the general manager was amazing.. Things are real easy to pick up if i follow all the rulez"
good,Overall Wendy's is a good place to dine but by far working their is horrible there isn't any employee discount is not even room for you to growing the company their pay rate is lower than minimum wage
good,Very fast paced and stressful conditions but was given hours an A lot of work that I handled well and the employees were all working together. I would go back again.
good,"A typical work day was coming into work clocking in and getting straight to work. At the store i worked stayed busy, the consumers were rude and friendly but the employees made it hard to have a peaceful day but other than that it wasnt so bad."
good,I started at Wendy my senior year it was great at first then management changed it got bad I got pregnant had to leave I came back after though. Its a good first job
good,"The job is very fast, hard to handle stress wise with little employees and pays very little for all that is asked. Good work environment but overall hard for a young person while in school."
good,the job was a high school job and I think that where it will stay unless your management. Some of the team members were cool and other were just a pain to get along with.
good,You don't get breaks and managent doesnt train well. They dont listen to opinions from employees and don't let you request days off. They change your schedule all the time sometimes without notification.
good,A typical day was clothing into work washing my hands and starting to take customers orders at the front of the restaurant. I would help to serve the food to the customers when it was ready to be sent out. I would help by refilling their drinks and also ringing up each customers order according to what they wanted. I learned how to communicate with customers and how to work on multiple tasks. I learned how to work as a team in tasks around me with others. The culture was for everyone. The hardest part was working a lot of difficult hours sometimes. The most enjoyable was being able to help customers with their needs.
good,This was my first job.  I worked here on and off for 6 years of my life.  I worked here during my breaks in college and in the summer time.  I started working there when i was 16 years old. I met my first fiance there and still have some great friends that came from Wendy's.
good,"Mon-Wed work days are slow and Thursday-Sunday work day are fairly busy due to the weekend. Working at Wendy's I've learned that sanitation is really everything, everyone is not the same and the customer is always right. Management wasn't the best at the store I'm employed at. My co-workers were very nice, we all understood each other we look at one another more like family. The hardest part about my job is multitasking and making sure the service time is under 150. The most enjoyable part of my job is when its not busy and my co-workers and I can discuss what we could've done to make our next rush go smoothly."
good,"I seem to do well in a fast paced environment. I learned many communication and people skills while working here. The management could be better, and the 11 hour work days with only one 30 min break should not be allowed."
good,"The Wendy's in Cadiz, KY is awful when it comes to scheduling their teenagers. We would always get the hours no one else wanted, AND would close past our allowed time to be working. The managers were always friendly, but would start drama and pick favorites. Other than the people and hours, I loved it."
good,"I don't mind working at Wendy's, the only thing I dislike is the poor management. The management creates a poor environment for employees and even customers."
good,it was a typical fast food place with rude people. but I didn't let that keep me down or let it make me call out.  I kept my head up and work hard.
good,"fast paced, learned organization and effieciency, management overworked and stressed out. "
good,not sure what to say because I was great full for the job but was very unhappy with the store and mangment its self
good,I learned a lot here it taught me how to be serious when doing a job and to focus on every task.
good,"A typical day at work is stocking everything and making sure everything is in order and none of the food has gone bad. i have learned so much about customers service and what we can do and what we can not do regarding to customers being upset or simply just greeting them. I am absolutlly happy with all my co-workers, having everyone as your friend is a great way to stive in your job. one of the hardest parts of my job is pleasing the general managers when rush hour is going on and everything gets kind of hectic."
good,On a typical day I would come in stock everything that needed to be stocked. I would take customer's orders throughtout the day. I make sure the dining stays clean. I walk in dining talking to customers to make sure they are enjoying their food and drinks.
good,"As a former employee at wendy's it was a great expierience especially for a newcomer in the working field. Competitions became mandatory and it paid off it taught me to work fast movie tickets, and gift cards were the rewards for winners but everyone worked as a team."
good,"At this job i have learn how to multitask. I have to take orders from the speaker, take money at the window. prepare drink and help bagging an/or grave food when didn't have a coordinator. And all this because there was only one drive tru window. I want a better opportunity by looking to work somewhere else."
good,"It was very long nights and hard work. Didnt really have a social life during this time due to the fact i had to be in at four pm and we didnt leave until one am. I learned a lot working at wendy""s."
good,They dont give raises like they should. Work to hardfor what they pay. No good befits if you are hourly.
good,"Sometimes, you simply need experience before you can even be accepted into the job you dream of."
good,Rude staff management hardly every helped cussed out/yelled at never  appreciated not good hours bad pay all around not a good experience if looking for long term job
good,it a tough job takes lot of concentration physical and mental  but people are all great and up beat never a duel moment in Wendy great management and customers its away good to be there.
good,The customers and employees are the worst part of the job. You can not trust the people your working with or for. The customers a very disrespectful. They over work you with no brakes allowed. They do not pay enough for the amount of work done.
good,My experience at Wendy’s was mediocre but it is a great restaurant. I learned how to be a cashier and some of the ins and outs of the fast food industry.
good,I love working there at Wendys. everyone is friendly and work as a team. but there will be time thing wouldn't be fair to other.  because you would have that one manager like that one employee then others.
good,"Supervisors were constantly undermined by our GM, and procedures were often not followed. Store employees frequently got penalized for not following procedures because GM would have employees go out of procedure ""to make it easier"". GM was replaced, but many employees stopped showing up for scheduled shifts or quitting, citing the new GM as ""mean"" (held employees responsible). Both the store owner and Company liaison punished new GM for employees not coming to work."
good,I had a really good experience working at wendys. I think you would have a better experience if u did drugs or smoked though. My location was full of staff doing both those things and it seemed more important at the time for them to get out for there smoke breaks then anything else. I as a non smoker would go whole shifts without a break which isn't acceptable. The manager was great she was trying her best she just didn't have the best staff.
good,I had people whom I worked with that made working there a little easier to work there. Management wasn’t the best but you’ll have that some times. All in all it was a good first job.
good,First fast passed environment I have ever worked in. It’s very well organized and very well trained mangers. The company runs very smoothly. And handles customers very well
good,"Management was very loose, some managers would sit on their phones in the office. Other than that, the other workers were very nice and accepting of everyone."
good,"didnt really enjoy working at wendys airport, but i make the most out of an situation. typical days were really fast paced but the rude customers and horrible staff at times made it hard. most enjoyable part was clocking out."
good,Pays the bills not really amazing job I think they can do a lot better by their employees because there will be no Wendy's without them that best their will not have to struggle
good,"If you love fast paced workplaces and do well under stress, it's the job for you. You will never be bored working at Wendy's. There's always something to clean or stock!"
good,I was there to pay my bills . It was cool but then it was vey high schoolish . The management showed a lot of favoritism and they were lazy . Management became disrespectful  and that’s when they cut ours and play with peoples livelihoods.
good,I dont remember my time there i remember mostly because i was in love with there chicken nuggets so what better way to eat all the nuggets then to get a job there and plus even til this day wendys nuggets are the best but please bring back the spicy ones
good,Is a stressful job that you constantly deal with disrespectful workers and clients.  The hours vary and you have to memorize everything such as prices what comes in a meal and how to make a burger
good,If you like working in a fast paced environment you should work at Wendy’s.  I had fun there only because my coworkers made it fun when we had no customers.
good,"I hated working here but then, this was my first job. The team at my location was very bad and did not work well together. They also used to make us get in line during our lunch to order our food even if it was busy which would then cut into our eating time. They did give 50% off though."
good,It was managed okay. It was more of certain managers that worked there that had a problem with everyone and didn’t want to manage the store correctly. Other than that great place
good,"I worked there for 3 years . It was an ok job , but  no raises and poor management . I worked hard daily but the manager lied about giving raises.  I only received 1 raise the whole 3 years I was working there"
good,Serves very helpful when needed dining room's clean bathrooms are clean good environment to be in well great food products management employees are all kind considerate
good,working at kmart as a cashier/ clothing department. always different stuff to do every time. working on holiday is crazy but you get paid on holidays and discount.
good,it was a good environment mostly but i was working almost 100 hours every two weeks as a part time employee and was offered management but never got it so i left there and went to another company.
good,My coworkers were great. They were friendly and supportive but certain managers made the environment sullen and unenthusiastic.When that manager was scheduled the work atmosphere was tension and hard to work under.
good,Do not expect to get paid fairly. Job requirements exceed pay rate. Professionalism can be at bare minimum. May receive harassment and retaliation.  High turn over.
good,"it's fast food. how good can the job really be? for a first job, it's not bad. but i would definitely not reccommend staying there for a long time. the job stays the same, you just do more of it every day."
good,"It is very fast paced and the management is very good, but the pay isn't very good and hours are jot well if you have children.  They are very clean and make sure all the food is fresh and hot."
good,It is a nice stepping stone to something else. I learned many skills to aid in furthering my career. I also enjoyed the amount of interaction you can have with customers.
good,"Great place to work! Pay sucks! Hate that it closes later than an other Wendy's. For the most part management is alright depends on who you are working with, but other than that Wendy's is an ok place."
good,Work was not difficult and tasks were self explanatory. Management did not seem to have much control over certain shifts of employees. Hours are inconsistant.
good,"It's not a terrible place to work, but I strongly recommend a higher paying job if you are taking on bills. This is a job for younger people who don't really have big responsibilities because the pay is minimum wage."
good,"I would come in and start making orders and i run drive thru"
good,working at wendys was a good experience. I enjoy working there when the manager are fair and not power tripping and understand that you cant talk to people how ever u want to cuz your the boss. I already have to do what you tell me. its a most I have to.
good,I enjoy working at wendys when we have all of our crew there. The only complaint that I have is with the management. I feel as though the managers are rude and disrespectful to the employees. It is a very fast paced working environment which I tend to enjoy.
good,Everything was good there unless you were a Female manager and then you did not get the same pay as the Male managers for the job performed. They have new owners now and I hope they treat their Female managers better.
good,My manager wasn't a good one so the work experience wasn't good but i learned a lot to put forth on more jobs so i thank wendys  and the people who dobted me there
good,"Worked here as a first job and it was a good environment in the beginning. Management has some communication issues and this results in them being understaffed often. Also, you're relying on 16 yo kids to show up for and do work and it can be stressful working with unmotivated individuals. It is a stressful job even though it's only fast food service."
good,"A typical day at work is to cook all items on the menu and present them to the prep workers to hand to consumers. I learned how to operate fryers, grills and to make chili and other various items. The management is always there. The hardest part was keeping up with orders at peak intervals. The most enjoyable was the employee discount."
good,"They are always very busy all of the time! The employees are very stressed out, all day, every day. Maybe they deserve a nice vacation every once in awhile."
good,"Sign in, receive direction from management. Work at front cash or drive thru window. Clean dishes between serving customers."
good,"Crazy lunch and dinner rush"
good,It was a good job until he started hiring more people and it begin to turn into a disaster cause people was very disrespectful and very lazy and working at a fast food people need to work together and all get along.
good,"I loved my job at Wendy's but the management wasn't the best, most of my co-workers were nice. There was never a hard part of my job at Wendy's. I love the busyness!"
good,Good job but looking for full time work. I just graduated and I want something that gives me insurance and benefits.  I want to work full time and make more money
good,"In a typical day, I would start out in the morning chopping lettuce for the days salads, making the salads and washing dishes.  Once we were open, I was generally the sandwich maker, although I was able to move around to any job as needed.  There is a lot of turnover at the restaurant and many of the employees are just not happy to be there.  Managers turn over as well.  Some are very good, others are not."
good,"The Wendy's did not offer proper training. On top of that I would work non-stop, no break. I learned how to use the equipment properly only after being transferred ."
good,"Workingm at Wendys was not challlenging, but tedious. Some tasks and steps required were changed daily making it difficult to set a managed time for the day. Management was some what cooperative and helpful. Some were too stressed by some procedures and that spillled onto the crew."
good,"The Wendy's I work for has it's ups and downs. A typical day consists of anywhere from 50-350 customers a day, taking orders, filling orders, cleaning the dining room and stocking the necessary items. I've learned to work under pressure of a time limit (drive through time) and to fill orders efficiently. Coworkers are friendly, but management can be inconsistent ."
good,"This workplace is good for a teenager to start out. You develop communication skills, work ethic, customer service skills, etc. All these skills are transferable when seeking jobs in others criteria"
good,some days you have good days you have bad management sucks I get a long with most of my co-workers. the most enjoyable part of the job is going on break and almost going home. The hardest part is dealing with this one manager.
good,overall wendys was very flexable and a very great learning experience. The only thing i dislike about the location that I was at was the simple fact that they are inconsiderate at times other than that it was okay for me. However I do believe it is time for me to move on and explore.
good,hated this job it was a horrible place to work. the pay was low it was part time and it wasn't never enough money for me to provide for my kids
good,"A typical day consisted of food preparation, register operation and cleaning and the end of shift. I learned a lot about customer service and satisfaction here because I was employed here for so long. Though I had a few favorite managers, they were several managers I felt very negatively about because of poor behavior and no managerial skills. The job was fairly easy. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my customers and ensuring they always had a positive experience with me."
good,Worked as a cashier. Made sandwiches. Stocked and cleaned the store. I helped open and close the store.
good,It was a pretty good job for my first real job in high school but I'm glad I have moved forward in my job experience.
good,My co-workers was enjoyable and working together to make sure that customer food order where together.
good,"The job is a great job, the company as a whole is not the greatest. Very Big Corporation"
good,"open the store, set up and prep food for the day, counted cash registers, counted the safe, processed weekly food and utility orders, set personal schedules for the day as per who was scheduled to come in. Store managers were great and understanding, the assistant managers were always late and leaving the leads to pick up the slack. hardest part of the job was the assistant manager issue and never getting to leave on time. It happened more than it should have. The best part of the job was having control of the store and its operations knowing I was trusted in my job and could assure it was done correctly."
good,"I worked 3-13 hour shifts"
good,Busy from start to finish. Management was very hard on employees. My co-workers made the job fun and interesting
good,"The workplace overall was a decent place to work, but there was no room to advance and what the supervisors expected sometimes was not in reason."
good,Long busy days. sometimes with not much help sometimes would be left alone with many customers forced to learn on your own.
good,"taking orders, providing hot and ready food for customers, providing great customer service, solving customer complaints,"
good,Its a fast food place that the customers are always right even when their wrong
good,"I liked the job. It kept my head above the water at the time and for that I will forever be greatful for that. A typical work day consist of, for me, leading the team to a service goal and doing our best to satisfy every customer that walked through those doors."
good,I worked the grill. I would make oreders cook and clean the work areas. Would also have to handle the trash. I cleaned the bathrooms which I had to use chemicals.
good,worked there through high school. good for a first job. hrs are pretty good. pay is low. customers are difficult but they always are.
good,Working at Wendys where I stay is boring yet messy I didn't like it at all.
good,It was a fun place to work as long as you had the right people there.that knew what they were doing
good,"The job was a job, Nothing more nothing less. Wendy is great way to use communication skills and interact with all walks of life. A great job to learn team work and mangement."
good,"A typical day at work for me, is somewhat interesting and fun. Some days are better than others. My co-workers are very interesting to work with. My management could be VERY MUCH BETTER than what it is. The most hardest thing to do at my job is to get as much done as possible while being extremely busy. Overall, my job is fun to be at. As long as I've been there, I've learned how to manage money and to deal with other people. Also to become more social and interactive with others."
good,"The job is pretty easy if you can handle pressure, but pretty much anyone can work there so I’d say the coworkers are the most challenging part. The customers are also challenging at times."
good,I like the job but now I am looking for a different field of  work. Was a great experience while working there with other employees. I enjoyed working with other people and meeting people.
good,"Working at Wendy’s is great for someone with no job experience and wants to gain some. Wendy’s pay in the Bay Area is really good. Though at times stressful, it’s a great place to start."
good,I was excited bout working their I enjoyed all my coworkers got along well with others.My availability was taken into honor the hardest part of the job was not having enough people on shift n getting really really busy for lunch rush.A typical day at work was just an ordinary day.The most enjoyable part of the job was the great Coworkers n the coolest understanding managers n just making th
good,Different management and things always changed and off balance and never enough people working that shifts so always got called in on my off day and always give them as much as possible
good,"Working at Wendy’s was a great first job and provided me with the knowledge of great customer service and how to work with others. However, as long as I been working there I never truly felt like I could stay there long term. I always knew I could be putting my hard work somewhere else that would better compensate me."
good,"Working there for 6 months, I could honestly say it was average. Outside of the constantly changing management, it was a good place to work. I honestly believe the downfall working at a franchise Wendy's is its investments into the actual store. The kitchen is super small and in direct eyesight of the customer. The grills used to cook food there are outdated (very slow) and they store their buns for burgers outside in a separate freezer..."
good,The one thing I would recommend is being aware of the location you are going to. Each store has a different employee environment and it is best to find one that is willing to work with you.
good,"I had a ok experience at Wendy's,I had similar job duties once before while working at Hardee's for four years.Im a cook and a grill operater,which includes making sandwiches,salads and wraps,and cooking frozen meats,while keeping my station cleaned and sanitized."
good,usually many people come through the drive through more than the lobby. so much so that we sometimes have cars to the front doors! I learned how to use a register and become more efficient at counting money at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of working here is the time I can spend laughing with a few of my co workers.
good,It was nice working with them. I really liked working with them.  I got along with everyone at work. I would really tell family to join working with Wendy's.
good,Not much to be said except that it was a pretty cool work experience at first but the as time passed things started to get alittle bit stressful but in the long run I’ve gained a few experiences
good,At Wendy's there was a lot of business days but as a team we made it through those business days. Wendy's was always a team we all worked as a family and did a good job at it.
good,Typical day was pretty fast paced . With the store being such short staffed I always worked more then my position and always worked overtime in a day.
good,"Some of the Wendy's are owned by franchises. Some of those franchises don't uphold Wendy's established culture. They poorly execute policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job is, interaction with employees, and guest."
good,"Depending on who you were working with, debated on how the night was going to go as well as your mood. Quick passed but can be sure at times. Job is self explanatory."
good,"The days went by fast sometimes. However, poor management often led to employee conflict. Which didn't always affect the work environment but sometimes things became too much to deal with."
good,"Not the worst job that I've had, in fact it's the best job I've had so far. But, theres definitely better jobs that you could be working out there. They paid me more based on my credentials, and my team was very good and accepting of me and my weirdness. The customers are the same as they are at any workplace, some really bad and some really good, so I don't really let customers dictate whether or not I'm happy at my job. When it comes down to work - I mea...work is work, so I don't really complain in regards to that. But, it can get kind've stressful when people start to line up around the building and dining room is filled with High School kids coming in from a game. I try to take it slow, and not let the rush get to me. The customer can sit and wait - their fast food isn't worth the employee's sanity."
good,It's a fast-paced work environment it has a medium stress level a high turnover rate for employees minimum wage pay starting out shift supervisors make a dollar fifty more
good,"It was a nice place to work but the only problem I had is the they hours otherwise it is a good place I go to work on time I do my work how it suppose to be done im respectful,always show respect to customers I help other when needed help,and I work as a team.."
good,A typical day working at Wendy's is still managed very hard. The management is terrible. She yells and degrade her employees. Never tells us good job after a rush.
good,every time I walking into work I got a hey sean. I worked long nights the managers were pretty cool and they had great food. my favorite part was getting paid
good,The team and staff at Wendy's really cares about its employees.  Unfortunately the pay is lacking.  There are positions for advancement through management however.
good,"Most of the time when i worked, the crew members really made up for the horrible expirience I had working.  If it weren’t for the people I worked with, I don’t know how I’d be onto another job. A lot of rushes were in place and too stressful for me."
good,"Very fast-paced, angry customers, recurring visitors, patience is key, you will run into many different personalities, not everyone will like you, you never know the exact reaction a situation will bring about, and although you must be understanding and remain professional, you can still have a good time. when you can make a customers day, you feel so great."
good,"This Job is okay but not really my career choice. It’s too stressful ,I work with incompetent people. The company overall will be great in Lynbrook with new management and crew members ."
good,If I had the opportunity to work in Wendy's again I would but I will work there as a management because at the time that I was there it was a fun place to work with the staffs was good the GM's was good even management was good so yes I will work there again
good,Opening and closing restaurant (working more than 12 hours a day) and poor management of workers who often did not show up for work. Did learn about food safety and earned a certificate.
good,A good place to work just needed more hours since I was a full time employee coworkers worked as a team to get the jobs done a very well coordinated team
good,I was young working at wendys it was fast paced and very busy during rush hour at the time I was pregnant and knew I couldn't stay because I need to make more money
good,"The company overall isn't horrible. just depends on who your working with. great job for teens. it's a pretty easy job, the hardest part is when it gets busy, or having to deal with difficult customers."
good,If you work for the right store it MIGHT be worth working. Overall i believe the company starts out paying $7.35 hr. I've worked here for over 1.5 yrs and only make $7.45.
good,Wendy's is a fast food company with great food. The work environment is very fast paced. My co-workers were very friendly and taught me everything since it was my first work experience.
good,The management is very poor. The workers are hard workers and get things done. Most of the time the people in drive thru are the busiest people. When times are slow everyone sticks up and tries to leave on time.
good,I loved to work there but management was bad. Alot of bad back stabbers and drama. But it got better. It was great to me and I loved the place. It's just time to move on.
good,"Easy workplace when you have a full staff, gets pretty crazy and hetic during rushes. Good opportunities to move up through the company. Customers are generally nice and respectful foods actually really good when cooked fresh"
good,"The company as a whole was nice, the management on the other hand main focus and concern was the dollar. Not making sure the customer was happy and pleasing them."
good,"Great management experience offered. Good to learn how to manage inventory, performing pre and post shift inventory analysis. Wendy's allowed for my initial accounting experience"
good,"I do not think it was a bad job, we just didn’t have good management working at the time. I think it’s a good place for a teenager to get a first job."
good,Working at Wendy's has been very educating & has given me experience with such a widespan of diverse customers to motivate me to be the best person possible.
good,"It wasn't an easy job- If you arent cut out for fast food chain then dont be disapointed not many people are cut out for the type of work. Try your best and be your best. You dont have to go to work for people to like you, go to work because that what will put you ahead in life."
good,"They expect a lot out of you but, they are okay. it is really fast paced and the one manager is rude to everyone. The shifts are pretty short and they cut hours none stop."
good,I had a good time meeting and helping routine customers when they came in to order. I also made connections with others who are now working at various other jobs.
good,Hot place to work. Management isn’t all the best and it’s very fast paced. I wouldn’t entirely reccomsnt someone to work here inless they are fast moving
good,"The typical work day was taking orders, and customer service. I learned to be more patient and to make guests feel welcomed and comfortable. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack, however; it did make me learn how to do every position. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with some many different people that came in throughout the day."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's. The teamwork environment in the kitchen was always so good, I loved talking to the customers and I especially loved making the food. The only reason I stopped working there is because I didn't get paid enough or get enough hours. I only got 4 hours every day and only got $8.25. But I did enjoy the job in itself, it just wasn't enough money for me to live off of."
good,"Good company but lacks motive to move people up "
good,"Quick paced, can be stressful at times. They could work on focusing better on their employees and not so overriding about their money. You have to have a positive mindset while working there."
good,Working for Wendy's was an opportunity to learn.  My responsibility was to stock shelves within the storage area.  Another responsibility was to take out the garbage and assist in clearing tables.
good,"It was a great place to work i gained a lot of experience, but the managing staff are a bit uncaring when it comes to employee needs."
good,"Wendy's was my first job ever! I stayed there for 3 and a half years! Not a fan of working with food, but if everyone does their job correctly it is not a bad place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy’s but I felt like my coworkers were not putting in as much effort as I was. The environment was very fast-paced and management was average.
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's includes taking orders, interacting with others, serving customers food, handling customer questions and concerns. I gained strong communication skills working here, as well as organizational skills and learning how to adapt to a fast paced working environment. Management would probably be the weakest area at Wendy's. There are about seven different managers and only very few of them know how to be professional and leave personal problems outside of work to where it doesn't affect everybody else. Workplace culture was somewhat comfortable, we kept the restaurant very clean and the employees are easy to get along with. The hardest part about the job would have to be the beginning/training. However, training time should only take a about a week tops, so after that, working here should be fairly easy. The most enjoyable part about the job would have to be the people you get to work with, they are some of the most entertaining and likable people around and will make you feel comfortable being new here."
good,"For the most part it was ok"" however Management sucked at understanding and encouraging it's crew, at times it was fun except when we were being robbed and even then it was still something to build on However the hardest part was learning the food items"
good,"i go to work, i clean my station, cook the food for my station , making sure the times and temps are up to the right times. friendly customers always come in."
good,"I work at Wendy's for almost a year; i had fun while i was working there. The people i worked with, were all great and fun people. I had barely any problems with the people I worked with. The management they had was bad because some of them wouldn't help us when it was busy. But there were managers there that did help us most of the time. But the managers that didn't help us, didn't make sure that we were working."
good,"I like working at Wendy's' but the management barley gives me days I work a total of 2 days a week when I requested more I still received the 2 days still. and I always get sent home because of labor, they pick and choose their favorites. if it was a better manager there I believe I would love to work there, I barley get any experience."
good,its a friendly work place. it fast paced but you learn to keep . not to long of hours small spaced but easy to work around others. overall its a good place to work.
good,"good for teenagers just starting to work. flexable hours and scheduling, no benefits, no PTO/ discounts or anything like that. very fast paced and a lot of pressure."
good,The restaurant gave me many hours to work but I was not able to drive so far every day to work. Sometimes I would stay very late at night to close. This became an issue while I had school on the weekdays and I had less time for homework.
good,"Always stay focused on the customers."
good,Ive worked at wendys for three months.  the head manager is great but the other ones are rude and blame you for things you cant control.  overall it isn't so bad.
good,work was stressful. moral was low on a daily basis. management didn't speak well to employees. employees didn't like to come to work. I worked here because  I had a love for the company but I quickly learned they only wanted me for my knowledge and as they learned more my hours got less.
good,i would not go back i really did not like this job the pay was ok but the people (employees) was the absolute worst the had no respect for others and management was a joke.
good,I worked there as a teenage. then went back as the store refurbished it self. I work there another 2 years. I was a food preper and opened the store.I
good,"It's what you expect from a fast food company,  I did learn better customer service, management could have been better not necessarily as to who the mashers were but the assistant managers should have been regular managers.  The hardest part of the job is getting out when you're scheduled to be. The most enjoyable part is building friendships with the crew members and making work fun"
good,"Busy store, high pressure, learn new products.  Workplace culture is diverse.  Hardest part of job was no set schedule, most enjoyable part of the jobs was meeting new people."
good,"The job is alright but it does get difficult for the low pay that they offer. To add on, there are usually not enough employees working during rush hour and it can get stressful when you get angry customers who have been waiting for at most 15+ minutes. The people that work there are nice but sometimes not very good when dealing with pressure as mentioned earlier."
good,"In the Alaska market, it was very tough to make our goals. Upper management was having issues training new supervisors. Retention was very low. Managers make decent money, but anyone else made minimum wage. As a salaried manager, the supervisors made more than I did most of the time. I was also expected to work 60 plus hours a week."
good,It wasn't much of as well organized place. The managers would not put in much consideration of problems within coworkers. Training for register was a bit nerve-wracking because the managers would get upset at the slightest inconvenience. Towards the end of the day managers would ask about how the day went and would then give tips so that was alright. They were very considerate about hours and days for any reason. They thought about the workers and how we're young but would still want to go out and enjoy ourselves. They would also have little contests with the team which made it fun.
good,"Wendys is a good place to start if you need a job quick. Fast food has no real potential for people who want a career. I loved the fast paced environment that made the shifts go by quickly. But I hated how in the summer there was NO Ac in the kitchen area, It would be so hot I had to mention to store manager about getting it fixed."
good,"My expierence was okay all in all, I got paid 8.50 an hour did 40 hrs a week, my crew members were very nice, just my general manager was hard to work with."
good,Once they got new management everything turned left. Morning would be fully staffed but night shift had a lot of call offs. Some of the head managers talked to you like you were beneath them.
good,Wendys is a good place to work with good people. Wendys is not my first choice because of how hard i work and how little respect is given. Although people are very respectful it's not a place I see a future in
good,This was simply my experience at my wendys location.  Many of the managers showed favoritism and rarely present when their assistance was needed.  We worked long hours with little recognition. A lot of the times we would be in a position by ourselves even during rushes.
good,"Starting my shift with warm friendly greetings from crew members shift supervisor store manager and owner. After clocking in take a swift and quick inventory of my station to make sure i have everything i need and to supply myself with whatever is needed. Performing my position/s efficiently and accurately and assisting other areas and crew if needed. learning of upcoming promotions, procedure or price changes and new product. Fun and reliable crew comfortable environment and caring individuals working as team during the  busiest  part of the day (lunch & dinner rush). keeping customers happy satisfied and coming back."
good,"every day is different depending on your position. sometimes you greet customers and take orders other times you just make sandwiches busy days are the best cause the day goes quickly."
good,"I used to like working there, but now it just has gotten way too crazy, and only a few managers are understanding about life situations. It lets you make new friends through crew members, but it's not all that fun."
good,Fun and productive work place.A great place for high school kids to make a jump start in their career.They will be properly trained for the position applied.
good,"enjoyed my time there. very fun and calm environment, managers made it fun and easy. learned fast. working wage can probably be a bit higher."
good,do not let anyone push you. always input your opinion. stand up for what you believe in. push for raises. always requests days off as soon as possible for a better chance to get it.
good,"My review at Wendy's is they took my hours away from"
good,This job will work around your class schedule but it can be an unfriendly environment and the management tends to favor certain employees over other ones.
good,Management tries very hard and succeeds very well to meet the customers needs at all times. Employees on the other hand are sometimes very rude and forget something in orders sometimes. Restaurant itself is very clean and family friendly.
good,"My experience at Wendy's I usually work cloase shift. I make sandwiches usually, help expedite,clean,and my daily tasks."
good,"Overall the entire staff members were dedicated to serving the customers. Due to a lot of misunderstandings that communication between the members of the crew or not understood,  the environment was not safe to work."
good,"Cleaning outside in the mornings or I clean the grill bread warmers and scrub floors"
good,"Had a hard time getting employees to translate and getting the managers to make employees do thier job. There were a lot of problems compromising with my schedule, work hours and off days. There was a lot of favoritism"
good,"I am the opener so I don't have to be to work till 7 but I arrive a hour or two early so i can be on time and be ahead of the game . So what I typically do is clean the grill platens the Teflon sheets or put on new ones. Then I have to put the chili on and time on it. Wash the rest of the dishes and put the oven racks in the oven. Next i have to clean the wire baskets which we drop nuggets and fries in. Then i have to put the pans in the draws "
good,"I start work at 6 A.M. I chop romaine and ice burg lettuce for sandwich lettuce, and salad lettuce. Make 130 salads a day. Stock as needed, front counter and condiment area. My manager is a peach. However, the other managers are more interested in sitting in the office when they're supposed to be helping. Co workers, if they are older, are hard workers and do their jobs, and follow the rules. The High School kids, and 20 something adults are lazy, worthless, just there to collect a paycheck. I enjoy working with the older crowd. There are a few younger employees that actually work. I like working for Wendy's because I am on Social Security Disability and am limited to how many hours I can work a week. I cannot make more than $675 a month (which includes the twice a year you get 3 paycheck In one month if you're paid bi-weekly. In the last year I had to call off twice. Once because my father had a stroke, and the other because I had a severely abscessed tooth and the whole side of my face and neck were swollen. Dentist didn't want me working around food. I have been working with the public for 40+ years. First in the medical field, then the last 7 years at Wendy's. There is no incentive to stay at Wendy's. No raises. No benefits. I work there because I have to supplement my Social Security and they work with my schedule. The hardest part of the job is the never ending pace. Having to pick up the slack for lazy co-workers."
good,Most of the time the employee and I worked well together. Customers and I laughed a lot. I learned how to run the store and be patience with people. Most of managers were good and helpful people. Co workers and I worked ok together I tried to stay busy.
good,"Was nice working there, great staff, updated equipment. Very good management, people that care about serving the customers."
good,Worked at a fast pace company not the best work place worked there for one year never got considered  a raise. crew members were not the best people to work with.
good,"When I worked for corp everything was better, pay, hours, coworkers. The customers were rude and nasty but that comes with the business. Privately owned wendys dont care about anyone but to put money in their pocket. The hours suck, the money the gyp your pay, they dont pay you for over time they treat the crew like garbage and expect you to bend over backwards for them, No loyality"
good,"Working with Wendy's was a great learning experience for me I learned a lot all in one year which was cleaning tables, cooking, bathrooms, mopping ,sweeping and closing up. the hardest part for me was busy fast days but I enjoyed watching my co-workers get together and work as a team so things could be done the right way."
good,Wendy's is a fast paced work environment that is a good first job for someone looking for experience. A typical work day would be very busy and you move around a lot.
good,"Fun work environment with great co workers.I learned how to handle cash, prepare food, and resolve customer complaints. The worst part of the job, other than hours, was smelling like fries after a days work."
good,Sonic was a good place to work with fun people. it was an overall good time. barley made any money though. worked there for a while
good,"A typical day at work would include handling money, taking orders, bagging food orders, stocking, cleaning the dining area, and washing dishes. I learned how to treat people and to treat people the way that I would want to be treated. The management was horrible. the managers would talk to us employees any kind of way, they would show favoritism towards different workers, they would spread lots of rumors and gossip about the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers and their constant threats to fire the employees."
good,Loved working with friends during high school but this place has bad management. Workers are worked too hard to be payed so little. place needs work
good,"every day was mostly very draining. The company has its favorite people and not all will fit in to the culture of this type of managers. To much back stabbing and pettiness of jealous people, not a good company."
good,"I had quite a busy day. I started at 8 am, i put potatoes in the over, started prep, set up stations, did dishes, made chili, and stocked up the food line. I also took orders, handled cash and communicated with other employees as well as customers. I was moved to front counter where I was mostly just taking orders, but would help in other places, clean, organize, stock and prep."
good,"While working for this company I got to meet a lot of movie stars I learned the true meaning of becoming a security guard., how you have to make sure you watch things at all times. in how I really enjoyed working as a security I mainly worked in stand in my feet for 12rsh ,watching movie cameras in watched movie equipment all day but it was well worth it because I learned  that you can do something different in life in also have fun while doing it. the hardest part while doing security was I had to stand up while eating my food we didn't get any breaks through the whole 12hrs I did everyday but overall I loved this job."
good,A typical day is taking customer orders and collecting the money for the orders. Interacting with other employees. Not much else to say.
good,"I love working here , seeing the same faces of my customers almost everyday is just amazing . Ive been here for a year and couple months. Yes we have our downs but we love helping people thats why I work here. Employees, will be employees this is our work facility and we respect it."
good,"i never really thought i would get this job but the manager gave me a chance and I liked it at first, until we had a new manager who does not know how to run a store but overall, wendys is a great place to work."
good,It was a nice place to work while still in high school. a typical day was preparing and serving food while giving good customer service. the most enjoyable part was having good team members and great customers.
good,it was childish and the managers was not cooperating... the coworkers was rude to the customers... they was not trying to train no one but i learned enough i did not enjoy working there probably at that location but i believe that if i was at another wendys it would have been different
good,Clock in start my positional cleaning open store talk to customers push for a great service.
good,"work, work, work  was all I did. stayed busy. I learned a lot of common core skills, how to work machinery. co- workers were cool and very helpful. they always helped when needed. we always made a team effort. there was nothing hard. everything about that job I loved. I never felt judged there"
good,"A shift was always run great if everyone did their part, including managers. Also, the day was great if we all work together as a team and helped eachother accomplish tasks."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. I worked during rush hour so it was very crowded, so I had to learn to work at a very fast pace and have a lot of patience. My co workers were very friendly we've always got along. My manger was awesome wish he would of stayed longer he was a very nice and helpful guy. there really wasn't a hardest park everything was pretty self-explanatory and easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was, working with my co workers and manger we all knew how to have a good time and laugh but also work hard at the same time."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a fairly easy job and involves a lot of team work. I use to love working here but the managers are just too extra and do not know how to speak to their employees. I enjoy the environment of the job, it becomes extremely fun when it is busy. The hardest part is making sure everyone does their job, so that there is a flow throughout the day."
good,"enjoyable coworkers n management very loving and caring had to be fast paste n do mutitask jobs  it was my first job i did everything open ,close"
good,"The shift managers are becoming hard to get along with now. I enjoy doing what I do as a cashier and I do my best to keep the line down but I can only take so many orders, I'm only allowed to take 2 orders at a time and sometimes we get soo busy that it's almost impossible to get that line of customers down unless we have 2 people running the registers. But besides the rudeness of one shift supervisor, It's a pretty nice place to work. Everyone is easy to get along with. The hours now are pretty ridiculous though. I've been there for 7 months now and haven't gotten any higher than 3 days and only working 3.5 hours on each day. Right now, I'm working 1 or 2 days and each day is 3 or 3.5 hours. The manager is pretty awesome and lenient. I haven't had any problems with her. The hardest part of my job as I said towards the beginning, is trying to keep the line of customers down and being able to have time to go out in the dining room and wipe down the tables and collect the trays. But I get the job done and still have time to finish everything before it's time for me to clock out. Anyways, the job is more for high school graduates who need a little bit of money to get by, not for people who have or soon will have bills and insurance to pay for, and a child to take care of, like me."
good,my typical day was coming in early getting to my station for the day and about then there is a small rush for 30 to 45 mins by them the night staff comes in and have to get settled in for the night
good,a tyoical day at work is slow than it will pick up. i learn how to count money even more and have an good mood with costumers and co workers. management is kinda off they have there ups and downs. the co workers are fake and cool when they want to be. the hardest part is closing the store and i enjoy getting out of the house and seeing pepoles faces.
good,"I loved working for Wendy's, for the most part. I was hired as a sandwich maker but quickly was trained on everything (or I trained myself) and able to do anything in the store - but I stayed mostly up front on register. "
good,Some of the management was not fair and had to work too hard for little pay.
good,"Stock and prep food, take orders, prepare orders, clean workplace. open and close restaurant."
good,It was certainly a job that kept you on your toes. There were so many personalities to work with and sometimes it was difficult to ensure that they all meshed productively.
good,Great place to meet new people and learn how to be customer oriented. Learned how to work very long hours without a break while doing what it takes to get the job done.
good,Wendy's was a very energetic fun place to work. Friendly management team and staff.
good,"I started working at Wendy's with three of my good friends. There were many nice good working people there for the two and a half years I worked there. The managers are super nice and for the most part were always fair. I learned how to work in a very fast paced environment working in the kitchen preparing food for customers. I worked on the sandwich station most of the time. I learned every position in the store. When I was working I was the person who would cover everyone on their breaks, then do other work that was needed to be done if it wasn't busy. At times there was drama with a few managers talking bad about the employees and the same for my co-workers talking bad about the managers. I don't think I was very fair that when I worked there for the time that I did I did not receive one raise in my wage. I asked and was turned down by the owner. I always had a feeling he did not like me much, there was a lot of favoring with him and some of my other co-workers. I was always doing extra work to make sure that the store looked clean. For example I spent hours scrubbing and digging the grease and dirt out of the tiles in the floor so they looked good as new and I didn't get any recognition for that. The thing I liked most about working at Wendy's was the people I got to work with. We all got along super well when I was there. We were like a big family."
good,It's a good job and they try to provide fast friendly service
good,fast paced throughout each day. A lot of pressured being put on you. management is not that great.
good,i come in sign in and instantly wash my hands. then i look to daily work sheet to see my duties of the day and then prep and begin them and continue the duty until my shift is over.
good,"improve on management, typical day at work is there alot of unfairness that goes around. Mistreating other employees due to there ability."
good,greet customers cleaning and satisfactory our customers.
good,working at Wendys had showed my true colors and what i really should be in life.but overall it was a fun job.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting all the products ready for the buffet and for the registers. I learned how to multi task and to inform otheres of their responsibilites. I learned how to talk to people with respect but with a force of authority,"
good,I learned more customer service skills. Also i learned to run a register a little more.
good,i would usually come in the restaraunt and start prepping and afterwards begin grilling burgers and dipping fries. I love the managers because they let me do alot of things like cashier and window server also when they thoguht i was getting bored with the cash register.
good,A good job to start when in a new state . Like i said the people i worked with was pretty nice and down to earth
good,I like workin with food I have a decent amout of experiance in the food buisness so its alright.
good,"I would start the coffee, stock the refridgerator, shelves, cups, condiments, etc. Management was o,k. Hardest part of the job was the non stop environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the food and the spirit of everyone as teamwork. I learned to cook somewhat and that it takes all you've got."
good,"clock in, help customers, take orders. Management are ok, simple people, co workers vary. learn the meaning of helping a customer. the hardest part of the job would be when a bus comes, the most enjoyable part would be the down time. the hours are good"
good,"I dint really work here for long because i moved to detroit MI, But it wasnt to bad for my first job."
good,Even when we were busy we all worked together to get orders out fast and right. And even when it was slow there was something to do. Chatting with your co-workers or the custmers was always incuraged as long as most of your work was done.
good,"you work hard for little to no recognition.  not worth the hassle, but there were some, very few good employees that made it worth working there.                     "
good,Everything was a very good environment. BUt the Assistant manager well i mean the main manager the store manager i guess . She lied to the employess . She would talk to you like you did not know anything.
good,Started working there in October 2019 and was working 4 nights a week. I eventually was reduced to 1 night a week so I ended up leaving in December 2019.
good,"It was a fun and amazing place to work at I enjoy going to work but, I need my hours and my pay check have a large decrease. So I need to move on to something better they have hired too many new people and do not have enough shifts."
good,good quality my managers were very nice I learned a lot they showed e all of the positions it was very fun to me my coworkers were also very nice to me
good,Wendy's worked with my schedule and was generally respectful when I was scheduled when I couldn't work to change it. If you are the type of person who loves constantly meeting new people it is a great job for you.
good,Its fun when guests visits the most enjoyable part of working.There was nothing really difficult about working here. I enjoy the different people I work around.I learned how to deal with angry guests.
good,it was okay for my first job not anything to be excited for I didn't really care to much for the atmosphere and I only got discounts on food and other wendys products but it wasn't something I wanted to keep doing
good,I had an okay time at wendys not really much to complain about just low hours and low pay. For someone who has to pay a lot of bills and gets paid bi-weekly but only works 20 hours getting paid $9.05 an hour wasn't dong it for me.
good,"Good for a first job , you get to build experience with the company & learn more about the food industry! You pick up skills you didn’t have before it comes with alot"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Wendy’s. It was very fast paced and I enjoyed working with most of my co workers. Just be prepared to do the same thing almost every day, they don’t like to cross train you have to ask repeatedly to be trained at a different station. I got descent hours and was able to request days off relatively easily without any issues."
good,Very good and face paced always respecrful employee. Great working enviornment with plenty of room to grow and open doors. Great food we always handle the food with care and safety
good,"South Greensburg Wendys used to be such a wonderful place to work. Everything was always running smoothly, the employees were always friendly with each other; little drama. Ever since we got new managers, the store has been falling apart. We are always running out of items, and the new managers seem to not care about the employees. People are constantly getting hired then not showing up up, and there’s always tension in the air now."
good,"I enjoyed Wendy's for the short time I was there. I was forced to leave because of management being unfair with hours. I went from working 35-40hours/week to 4hours/week in the last month of my employment. The shift manager responsible could not give explanation as to why my hours decreased so I assumed it was for a personal reason. MLK, Greensboro location."
good,It was ok at first and honestly you really have to get good at your position in order to not feel so rushed. Their are always a lot of customers and so it does feel difficult at times but it's not impossible. This job is really better if your younger and just trying to get a job due to how easy it is. The employees there are nice but could be better. Being nice is ok but at least do your job.
good,I was only just part but there was some weeks I would only work 6-7 hours that whole week. Other times I didn’t make enough to cover any of my bills. It was really hard to get a a lot of hours
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wendy’s, I learned plenty of things from my time there. "
good,"working as a manager for Wendy's has it's up and downs. I wish that my GM was more in tune with what is going on and would try harder to resolve issues in the workplace. I struggle to work for a company that has no disciplinary actions for employees who do not follow the rules of the workplace. I wish that my managers were more interested in the mental and emotional health of their management team then what they are, I pick my battles. I am currently looking for a career doing something that my heart truly enjoys, not just being stuck. The hardest part of my job is having a crew that refuses to follow direction and management team that refuses to discipline. I enjoy working with people so this job gives me that opportunity until I find something that I can do with my degree."
good,Wendy’s was a good place to work at but the manger meaning the GM was messy and was not understandable she alway ran to other employees tell people business I’m felt it wasn’t cool at all
good,"Management is never on the same page and conflicts occur because the district managers tries to run over top of the store managers which creates issues, because the crew level pushes disregards the store manager because of the district managers getting to involved in the store and try to run it from home."
good,"Clocking in, counting register and take orders. Learned how to move in a fast paced environment. Management was never really around when help was needed. Workplace was not exceptional. Hardest part of the job was the other employees  I worked with. The customers were the best part of the job,"
good,Wendy had very poor management very unprofessional the employees customer service was horrible the work place was very nasty and not sanitized  very disrespectful.
good,working fast food was ok while i was in school. once i got out on my own i need more money to maintain my life. therefore working fast food making less than 8$ hourly was not enough.
good,"a typical day was fast paced and busy most of the day managers easily get stressed out and then stress out the crew member, overall the job was pretty basic I learned a lot about what to do in a management position and how to deal with people"
good,"overall a very good place to learn about the fast food industry and their standards as a business. The hardest part of the job was personality conflicts and how to communicate between the management staff and co workers, once you get through those barriers its becomes a better place to work."
good,The pay is not good at all. There are no raises and no benefits. The good thing about this job is its best for high school students. The workplace is fun based off the kind of customers and who`s your manager that day shift or night shift.
good,"The staff is very fun and everyone is like family in the store. However, it is very fast paced in which can make it stressful at times if you are short staffed."
good,"While I wouldn't want to work here as an adult, it was a decent first job. I learned a lot and got used to a fast paced environment. I didn't like smelling life fries all the time though."
good,"Wendy’s is an okay place to work at , it is not the best nor the worst but I know there’s other places that you or me could possibly work at that’s better"
good,It’s A Steady Pace & A Fast Pace On Some Days (Mostly The Weekend). I learned have to cope with others & how to deal with situations. I learned how to do different stations & even to multitask.
good,Wendy's was a very fast-paced and productive job. I would recommend people to apply to Wendy's it was a fun workplace. I would go back to Wendy's but only if I have another job. Wendy's starts off with minimum wage which is really only beneficial for teens.
good,The Wendy’s I work at has a hard time keeping people because of management. With not a lot of people it is hard to run the store.I only learned the stuff they wanted me to learn. It’s just not as enjoyable as it should be.
good,Its ok i Wouldn't  recommend anyone to work there .The reason why because this job the manager has favorites.Luckily im one but i dont  think its fair every one should be treated equally
good,"usually put of front or drive thru, learned how to serve customers and give superb customer service. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with customers"
good,This was a very nice job to have. The people that I worked with were nice most of the time. There were very large lunch rushes in the drive through most days and very large dinner rushes everyday while working at Wendy’s.
good,"Since this was fast food, the work day went by quickly because of how quickly the job was. The manager was really nice and a good team leader. However the assistant manager was the one who was usually there and she wasn't as good of a team leader."
good,"Wendys is a great starter job. It was always busy and we always had stuff to do. We didnt close until 12 so we always had orders to prepare, and customers to satisfy."
good,"a lot is expected of you, but without a lot of training.  management can be hit-or-miss, and that determines how the other employees in the store act/behave."
good,my job was very fun and easy . i worked for this company for three years and i enjoyed my time . this job was a very good stepping stone for me an  showed me how to take leadership.
good,The amount of hours i was provided made up for the lack of hourly pay. The management was better than expected and i was able to learn everything needed to perform and complete my tasks.
good,"I was constantly stressed working at Wendy's. There was a lot factoring into that, and it is a fast-paced job. Worth the experience, however it was not worth the little money to be made there."
good,There is always something to do you stay busy. I like being busy it makes the day go by faster. Not much room for advancement and the raises are horriable.
good,"when I come in to work I get everything set up and then start my every routine. I start with the fryers I drop the fries, the chicken nuggets, the chicken for the sandwiches, and then start the grills to make all of the burgers needed at that time. I also do the cash register and the drive through window. I make the sandwiches and put all of the orders together for the people that ordered them"
good,I enjoyed the job and loved the fastpaced enviornment. I worked part-time and i would recommend it for college student who need extra spending money for themselves.
good,Wendys is very fast paced. You have to learn how to do things quick. They expect a lot out of you. The managers are very well trained. They understand if you need a day off.
good,"Good staff friendly atmosphere descent management staff easy going and competitive on quality of work, product, and efficiency. Not many men in management any too many people unqualified or undedicated."
good,"Wendy's is a good place to begin your working life. It can be fast paced, but it can teach good working habits. A store with a good manager can be a really great place to work."
good,It will build your personality or It can break you. The managers don't like to see you just standing around you always have to keep yourself occupied even when there's no customers.
good,"Its not bad place for a being job, the work is really easy and the pay isn't bad. You could be doing anything from scrubbing the floor to making burgers in the back. you never honestly know until you get there."
good,"I liked the restaurant, neighborhood, and the management but there was no chance for advancement with this company. It was just a job for the sake of a job. If that had not been true they would permote to other Wendy's locations. They quit doing that because they don't all have the same core values. I still like the old American life style better. Wendy's is it's nastalga then. Your actual reality may vary."
good,I did not enjoy this position as it was hard to work with some of the other people who did not want to do their jobs. The wage was not great and I was not impressed by the training.
good,"the job is ok I have been there for 11 years to today, my coworkers is good to work with, very friendly and very well respectfull' when ibe  at work I be at work always"
good,Ive worked here for over 2 years now and i hate it its stressful long hours and hot all the time the uniform is basically black and everyone is miserable all the time.
good,Nothing much to say it was a temporary job one of my first jobs I didn’t work there long but I did learn a lot about fast while working there for the short period of time.
good,"Taking, making and handing out food in a timely manner. Maintain a clean working area. Ring up and cash out customers with the exact amount of product and cash back."
good,"Wendy’s was the first job that I ever got. I like the food and the people I worked with were good spirited. The Wendy’s I work at now is good, but I prefer to work somewhere that’ll pay better."
good,Learned that not all managers managed. Coworkers didn't always get along. Those of us who got along felt like family. Sense of part of a team. Their was definitely slackers and manager favorites.
good,"I loved working there, but they don’t know how to work as a team! They leave people hanging! I wanna do something that I love, and fast food isn’t for me"
good,"It was fun working there, stressful at times simply due to poor management. But overall it was a great place to both earn your pay and meet new people."
good,greasy and fast pace with poor management. a typical day at work would be standing by the greasy grill sweating and working so fast sometimes i couldn't even think.
good,The work day typically starts with me cooking bacon from 9 am to 11  am. After washing the pans I pan the bacon and after that I make sandwiches until 2.
good,We are very busty so u learn to multi task aslo work with a lot of teenagers so your not teaching them a new skill your also helping them build a work ethic
good,"On a normal day, it would be well fast paced but that's like any other fast food restaurant. The managers worked very well with you and I learned a lot. One thing I did learn was how to make sandwiches and to also work with other people."
good,A good place to start my job to get into the fast pace work style but management and some crew members werent the freindliest people to work with and most the time the job was unsafe for me with fryer oil and the grill
good,It was a very fun job and the culture was great. i enjoyed working their and learning all the different stations but unfortunately I could not work as late as they wanted. I also had harassment issues that no one would solve.
good,"A typical day at work was working with a lot of people doing a fast paced job"
good,"Bad pay good environment $1.25 raise in a total of three years not good pay for someone trying to make a away of living.......,.........................."
good,i worked here part time in high school it was a pretty good first job everything is easy to learn and the managers are great. Wendy's hours are flexible
good,working at wendy's is fun . I've learned alot from working at wendy's. The managers arent so professional and they're not flexible with the schedule. But overall its a great experience.
good,"This Wendy's location is a bit outdated and it shows in the quality of the work, some machines are bad, some just flat out don't work half the time, and others are simply not at this store location. I understand lots of these things cost money that can be significant but if the store would invest in getting newer equipment that is standard at other stores than perhaps the work environment and quality of life would improve as well."
good,Wendy’s has great food but they treat their employees like nobody’s and pay them so little and they work so hard I really feel like they should do better in places
good,"Fast paced, fun place to work. It is definitely team oriented. Lots of things to do from cleaning, cooking, to running the cash register and drive through. My favorite part was working the Grill."
good,It’s a job for someone who doesn’t have to pay bills. Just extra money in your pocket. The customers sometimes can be rude but if you have a good management team they won’t allow customers to disrespect you.
good,Great place to work some of the management they have don't need to be in the position that they are and some aren't fair to all employees. Otherwise it is great for people who are starting their first job.
good,Overall working there for a year taught me many life skills that I will carry on forever as I learned how to cope with stress and anxiety and it was a quick paced job. I would typically take orders for customers and would have to make and deliver those orders to customers quickly and in a friendly manner. I would recommend it as a job for teens or people trying to build a resume as it is a great place to learn skills.
good,wendys was my first job and i liked it there very much but they pay minimum wage even if u got experiences in fast food i was making more money then a 30 year old man thats just messed up
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work at the managers were efficient, the workers were quite lazy, but others took their job very seriously. the hardest part was starting a new tast without proper training."
good,"I enjoyed the quick paced environment because it kept me busy throughout the day, Most of the management could have been better,  but it did give me good experience working with difficult people which I think is good for everyone."
good,A typical day at work was mostly easy going unless people called in. I learn a lot about time management and organization. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers. The part I enjoyed the most was working with the happy customers and the regulars.
good,"The people where fun to work with, but we were understaffed so it could get really stressful. It could also lead to very long days. Customers could get a little out of control if they had to wait for their food. One time there was a needle found in the bathroom that someone had used to shoot up drugs."
good,Good employees poor benefits fast paced work environment high turnover low pay for the work you do need better benefits for regular employees not just management no correct breaks
good,It has been a while since i worked here. It was a fun place to work when  i was in high school. I would say that it was one of my less stressful jobs in life.
good,This company has great food. It has a great concept. It's a great place for a first job. Management was good and employees worked together. Clean place to work.
good,I have nothing bad to say about Wendy. Everything was good. Some concerns but nothing the company can control. I thought the pay was fair. The managers were really nice and respectable.
good,"Wendys can be really fun if you work with the right people. My experience was very good, but certain regular customers/co workers were disrespectful.  People often try to find ways to complain and the work becomes tedious."
good,"I was given the morning shift, and I was never late, not once. I waited for my Co-Worker sometimes to open the restraunt, or she would already have it open. I always get there at 6:30 am and clean all my stuff like the grill, the grills equipment, spoons and much more. I would take it to the big sink and wash the stuff I had. I would also clean and disinfect the grill. Once I was done with that I restocked the fridge that holds the meat, chicken, and chicken nuggets. I Would also water down the parking lot when I was done sweeping and picking up the trash. After I did all of that, it would be opening time. I would wash my hands and get on the grill waiting to cook a patty (for the burger), chicken or even some bacon. I would work from 6:30-2:00 Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.some times I get a extra day; sometimes I get overtime... To much employee's where I worked at.."
good,the district manager dont care about employees or family life.50 plus hours a week were acceptable to him. refused to hire more managers or let general managers hire in people to take the weight off other managers and crew memebers
good,"easy"
good,"Wendys was a great place to work for. They offer their employees great health benefits, paid vacation time off, along with great pay. There is also room for improvement and advancement."
good,"Over worked, not paid far. only got one day off a week.  I worked 9am-8pm five to six day a week, management talk a lot of shi* about the crew and other in management."
good,"A typical day was pretty chaotic . the crew were very lazy . which made the management have to compensate for it. the costumers were nice and friendly ,. the employers and employees made the job stressful .there was never a reliable schedule"
good,"Enjoyable, but repetitive job. Some coworkers can be overly frustrating. Sometimes can have unfavorable working hours. Can encounter very rude customers."
good,"Although most days working at Wendy's was very fast and productive, it was good place to work for a start up job. Also, they will be able to work with you on hours."
good,"I liked going to work, my peers were great and friendly. Work went by fast, managers was on top of things. The only negative thing I have to say is when I went out of town for a week and came back, I wasn't on the schedule. After a week or two went by I finally got back on the schedule by calling and going up there MULTIPLE times."
good,The hardest part of the job was the prep work in the morning. The cashier part of the job was great. I had certain customers that would come in because I was working. I loved my customers and they loved me.
good,Great company overall....Very very busy!! ....Be prepared to WORK...... Food/lunches were always good...Good place to start out/part time or if you can get in as management.
good,The people make the job better than the benefits. I worked there over three years and never made more than 7.25. If you are looking for a good paying job this isn't it.
good,its a good place to work at the managemant was good to get a long with the co workers was fun to work with the hours was good hours it was a laid back job
good,It's a good company to work for there's alot things to keep you busy throughout the night besides taking customers orders. Just wish had better management.
good,Wendys wasn't bad but I do think when they don't want to give out raise they will try and make you quit. And I do feel like there is some favoritism in the place.
good,"Every new person always thinks that if you close you get to stand around and do nothing. Well that's wrong. when you close you clean the whole store. Every dish, every floor, every wall, EVERYTHING."
good,Wendy's was my first real job. I started working at Wendy's in 1996. My pay started at $3.35 an hour. I left and went too Dollar General Warehouse for better pay and benefits.
good,"I learned how to take orders , managing the register , preped dining areas , maintenanced bathrooms and worked in drive thru and I also grilled and fried food as well ."
good,"Some days be ok at Wendy's , then you have days when you don't want to be there. The management is horrible. They talk to you as if you not going a job"
good,I enjoyed my time working for Wendys but I needed a change in pace. Is a good job for high school but now that I'm out of high school and graduated I wish to pursue my own life and I wanted a job that paid more than minimum wage.
good,The managers are nice the employees are willing to help but when you're in the interview they say you're guaranteed 38 hours at least and then you get there to work and maybe you'll make 11 to 15 a week
good,Working with Wendy's was a good experience just had its bad days. The workers are sweet some not so sweet. If you hang around the right people you'll be fine.
good,"This would be a good place for a first job, but not for a career. They do not have a lot of opportunities to grow within their company. Favoritism is high within management. Rules are not strictly followed."
good,It is a great place to work if you like a fast pace environment.  Really busy during the hours of 11-3:30.  Really awesome people to work with and management is really awesome.
good,at wendys was a learning exp my first job and everything was new from cutomer service traing to working grill and leaning drop time temps and safe food handling precautions.
good,"Very Well Place To Work Although They Did Not Work With My Schedule As Well As I Would Have Liked Them To. Some Managers Were Really Understanding And Willing To Work With Me On Some Aspects. Could Be More Lenient Towards There Workers When Baby Sitters Fall Through Not All Things Can Be Helped. A Typical Day At Work Would Be Exhausting, Because They Work Their Workers Way More Than They Are Getting Paid. Don't Acknowledge The Good Work Certain Individuals Would Do. I Learned That It's Alright To Be Criticized Means More Room To Work On Yourself. Some Management Made An Effort Some Did Not. Instead Of Just Yelling And Getting Made Should Talk To The Workers More About What They Want Or What They Want To Accomplish Through The Workers."
good,the hardest part was the comments some employees would make about how well i was doing at my job. Management was okay but didn't really take action when there was a problem. a typical day at work was get there at 7 start getting ready to open open at 10 get busy at 11 sometimes have a short grace period around 2 or 3 then get off at 4.
good,Couldn't not please customers. A lot of things were unprofessional and rude. Manager were not holing expectations to the highest. Wendy's was not a good experience for me .
good,"Was trained on one position and even after asking to be trained on another it was like a smile-and-nod, but nothing came of it. Managers were always on edge, unless there were no customers. There were manager favorites, and the opposite, etc."
good,I would go to work at 11 and work tell 4 or 5. I learned how to make a sandwich in 7 sec. and I learned how to use a cash register and how to hand out the correct amount of money back to the customer.
good,"Excellent place to work for a fast-food job.... until the long-standing General Manager transferred and we went through a long period of instability culminating in the current General Manager, who is the least popular manager I've ever seen at the store (barring the one who was fired for theft)."
good,"Wendy's have it's pros and cons , very great environment, Customer and coworkers including management . Working for Wendy's is fun , I was hoping that I get advance to a ship supervisor but nothing was done ,"
good,employees just play to much and customer service is everything to me employees spend can be better management could talk to their employees with a little more respect
good,It took me almost a year of working with this company to get a promotion. I made minimum wage for almost a year. I loved the people i worked with. Their management team wasn't great. There were very little benefits. Working in grease was not my favorite.
good,"I've only been working at Wendy's for 9 months, but it's easy to see that it's a transitional job. The days can be pretty short, or a bit of a slog lasting for at most 10 hours."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in for my shift and having to pick up a bunch of others slack or listen to people talk about how slow we are when the crew does most of the work some managers are good but other don""t do much i feel like i can do what a manager does just dont get noticed."
good,Poor management lack of worker which make us employees have to pull more weight than thats exepected. They pay us minimum wage and for the work we endure we should be paid more
good,i had fun working for wendys the only problem was that most of the times we were short staffed and because of the shortage we would have to pick up the pace just to keep up and because the demand for wendys people would wait a long time and get angry at that fact.
good,In Rome this company is pretty hard to work for. I must say on some days the company can have good perks. Owners wife can be very hard to work with so you have to be careful.
good,Didn't really enjoy this job the atmosphere was very negative and the management was horrible. Im not sure what else i can say buti just didn't like it!!
good,Not much money for the work that is required. On days off the managers will always call you to come in so you really don't get days off. People treat fast food workers very badly and you have to take it. They will intentionally talk down to you because they can. Very unfortunate
good,"When i start working at wendy's i start experience new stills and know the different working inside and outside. I learn how to handle cash, make sure everything is stocking or putting in the right order and Coordinator. The hardest part of job is that i work hard for almost  12 hours but the pay rate are not good as i work hard for it."
good,this job is a very fast paced company. you have to be able to work efficiently and quickly most of the time to keep up with all the lunch hours. other wise the hours weren't to bad. and you usually had a set hours throughout the week.
good,"Wendy's was a fine place to work at. I had some good times, and the managers were nice. Didn't want to make a career out of grilling meat so I decided to join the Army."
good,"Its a repetitive job so same thing everyday. I learned about the ingredients and style Wendy's uses to sell and promote their product. Management was amazing, even though i only worked with two out of three. they showed me the most upright respect and made sure my day was joyful. I worked in fast food before so i basically knew what i was going into when i applied. Hardest part of the job was the grease and changing out the hot oil weekly. overall the most enjoyable was making friends with new co-workers and having an amazing management team all throughout the day."
good,I made some good money and I had room to move up . this was one of my first jobs. it was not all that bad. I must say that   I really learned most of what I know about fast food working here.
good,"Highschool job but has its perks. slow advancement,  and long hours, just like any other fast food restraunt to work out. but my store had wonderful people to work with and even better people to serve"
good,"Wendy's has allowed me to put money in my pocket while at school, though it has hindered me from internships among other opportunities. Though this is not the company's fault. I need money and these opportunities do not allow for that."
good,The management could be better. I learned great skills but not in the best circumstances. There are no lunch breaks for the drive thru window position or anyone for that matter.
good,"Not enough staff on duty managers never helped out when needed, the staff on duty would barely ever actually work I was on drive thru taking orders and taking money and sometimes making food .. doing 3 jobs at once"
good,A typical day at work is fun at wendy's. I learned how to better work with customers. The management was out of hand. The hardest part of working at wendys was the management because it wasn't any structure. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the great customers.
good,"My typical day depended on the shift I had to work. If I was an opener I had to run around like a mad woman trying to get the store ready in 2hrs. Had to get the inventory done and get the safe and drawers ready on top of getting food prep done. If I closed I had to do closing inventory, make sure the safe was even at the end of the night, on top of running great service times and keeping my employees in check and the customers satisfied. I learned the eventually you're work place because a second family, and that to be a great manager you need to appreciate and thank your employees. The hardest part about the job was trying to keep the district managers happy and meeting their expectations, they would coach you on what you need to do to run a good shift, yet they couldn't handle the stress themselves. Every district manager I worked with had never started from the bottom. They were hired in from the outside with no experience in fast food and tell you how to run a shift. The most enjoyable part were the amazing people that I met while working their. I spent 6yrs with Wendy's and I still keep in touch with my original crew. They're my family and will always remain that way!"
good,"-bad management "
good,I really enjoyed working there. Do not get involved with anyone you work with it makes work very hard especially if you break up. Management was great. I really enjoyed the customers you get regulars that will come in every day and see you it put a smile on your face.
good,has its slow days and fast paced days but all in all it was a pleasure working there as a cook and cashier. hardest part would be just cleaning the grills at nighttime when it gets busy
good,"The day is full of stocking cleaning and pre preparation for the next wave. Maintaining a quick and efficient pace of service, while providing fresh and hot product constantly. No matter what the situation always conducting yourself with the utmost polite and professional manner."
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's for me was making sandwiches and wraps, working cashier and talking to people, and cleaning up at the end of the day some nights. I learned that I am more productive in a less social environment. The management at my location were great people. They were funny, friendly and enjoyable to talk to. My coworkers were also very friendly, polite and fun to be around, which made my days working there much more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was talking to the customers, especially if there was some sort of conflict."
good,I enjoyed my flexible schedule friendly staff nice employer pays not the best but it is a good first time job works with the CO-OP program  if you want to do that
good,"Although Wendy's is a fast pace environment, I feel as if that job is easy and fun. Ive worked all the positions and succeeded in all of them. My managers loved the way I worked and liked me so much that they gave me a raise. The hardest part about the job is working short staff because a lot of people call out every day. But even if we were short staff, that still didn't stop me from reaching my goals."
good,"Wendy's was fun to work at, it helped me build up work experience but after 4 years it is time for something new."
good,it was a challenge learning different aspects of fast food chains. a typical day was coming in start to prep for the day then half hr before opening starting to cook for opening and taking temperatures on product for safety and keep the area i was working clean and sanitized so there would be no cross contamination
good,"I work with a verity of different race, ethnic, cultural, and age groups on a daily basis."
good,A typical day at work would be getting up early in the morning and being there by  7 am to prep food and get the products and service ready for the upcoming day ahead.I have learned that it is a fast past environment that I love and that the customer is always right. Management was an alright set of people they could have been a tad bit more nice to the employees. My coworkers I adored and loved and got along very well with them. My hardest part of the job would have to have been picking up the slack that some of the managers wouldn't do that they should have done. The most enjoyable part was seeing happy customers and the complements that they gave were so heart warming and nice.
good,"Management did not seem to care how clean the store was, but the managers did make working their a fun experience. Most of my coworkers do their job completely but there are a select few that think it is alright to do just part of their job. I learned how to properly handle hard situations that customers bring up that we must fix. The hardest part of the job is trying to get a good rhythm down with all of our coworkers to please the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job though was that most of the crew members are around the same age and can joke about the same things."
good,I liked the management and I got along with my co-workers. I really liked serving others and helping them as much I can. So I really enojyed it.
good,"never could plan a family event (wedding, funeral, birthday) due to subordinate Mgr needs in their life.  Training was spurratic and incomplete.  Never worked one on one with training mgr."
good,A fun workplace with cheerful staff and a friendly atmosphere providing good hours and great experience to learn - Hospitality
good,"Based on teamwork and cooperation. If one person is missing it throws off the balance. Overall, was a fun environment if you like to stay busy."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's mostly through the customers & coworkers, they taught me so much & I really found it enjoyable to come to work & look forward to being able to see, help, & serve them."
good,"I was a cashier, I always made sure the customer had the upmost satisfaction, had good friendships with customers and co-workers."
good,Wendy's was a fun place to work at.The only thing that I didn't like was the pay. It was to little for a person who had bills to pay.
good,"A typical day at work includes running the drive threw as well as being a cook and making sure customers were happy . I was cross trained in EVERYTHING so i did every job in the store. My management team was horrible , they still owe me money from working and shorted my check every week . My co-workers were thefts , very lazy and schisty. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the other employees because  the sandwich makers only spoke spanish so when the order came up on the screen they would mess up the order. I ordered a # 3 wich is the triple Burger and they gave me a spring salad and it was 1/2 not even full."
good,easy fast past job learn lots of safety and how food should be cook management could be better lacking leadership co-workers are for the most part all hard workers taking there job serious. hardest part the job is keeping everyone at a comfortable pace when rush hour comes along. most enjoyable part the job is talking to the customers and making sure they enjoy there food.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me either working the front cash register, fry station, or first window. If I worked in the front I would be in charge of taking customers orders and cleaning the dinning room and bathrooms. If I worked at the fry station I would be in charge of cooking the fries and nuggets for both the dinning room and drive thru. If I was stationed at the first drive thru window I was in charge of taking the customers payment and making changes to the orders if they had any. If there were no orders in drive thru I would be doing the dishes in the back.I learned how to work at a fast pace. I also learned to understand people that work in fast food. There are customers that get upset with you over almost nothing but the workers still have to keep a smile on their face and doing everything they could to make the customer happy. The managers I worked for were really great. They taught me everything I needed to know and helped me when I had questions. The same goes for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was working until 11 at night on a school night. The thing I enjoyed the most was working with such great people and coming out of this experience with a new outlook on fast food."
good,"Working in fast food has drained me, and I feel like I lost so much of my life. 40+ hours a week for small paychecks that you can't live off of. I can't say I enjoyed this job. I learned that this isn't what I want to do."
good,"-busy shorthanded a lot "
good,Love working with the staff here.  While the job is demanding and quite challenging at times it is a great place to hone your multi-tasking skills.  Teaching new crew and training new managers is always fun.  The hardest part about the job is the expectations they sometimes set for management.  Expecting them to do the job of four people in a limited amount of time
good,"es un ambiente laboral agradable, es un trabajo pesado debido a la gran cantidad de clientes, es un poco difícil debido a el poco personal con el que se cuenta, el personal por lo general no dura mucho en el trabajo. la convivencia es entre empleados es agradable, es fácil hacer colegas  se aprenden muchas cosas utlies y estas en constante capacitacion."
good,"Job would be better if more hours were available. Staff is Great, very understandable. Hours and pay are minimal. Not a career decision."
good,I like we have team work for this company I topical any time we have people in the restaurant
good,"N/a."
good,"My managers are the best! When I got hired on it was a nice welcoming to the company. Thre are a select few that have always been on point, in my opinion. If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't work there."
good,"show up on time and get the job done, I learned that hard work is always required at the work place. Management is good, they get the workers to do the work. The coworkers are all nice and fun to talk to. The hardest part of the job would be to keep up the fast pace for hours, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be when it gets slow and you have a chance to speak to your coworkers."
good,"While attending high school, Wendy's was very willing to work with me around school."
good,I enjoyed this job for my first job. The crew members were all so welcoming and manager made me feel important on every shift.
good,"a typical day at work for me most of the time is really busy. but i always find a way to make it better by interacting with the customers  and other co workers so the day can go by fast .  if smiling laughing and enjoying yourself no matter what you are doing makes the worst possible job , the best."
good,"A typical day at work for me usually consists running a drive thru and getting a set drive thru time. I learned from working at Wendy's to get an education because that is not where someone should spend the rest of their life. My managers were always nice and handled the customers effectively. My co-workers ranged from reliable, to the not so reliable ones. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the fast paced environment. The part I enjoyed most was the life lessons I learned while working there."
good,long busy days but atleast you did somthing and worked hard for your money
good,"Fun to work with some of my fellow co-works"
good,Only teenagers. Needs more people that care what there doing.
good,"Working for Wendy's International is a very different experience from what I was typically use to in a office setting. Your day goes by a lot faster and you are always busy with something to do. Although to do tend to work a little closer with people than in a office, the people are a little more open and up beat about life. "
good,"A typical day is busy most the time, i've learn how to fry french fries & operate the service window. Management was ok & co-workers all got along. Hardest part was learning which butons to press when taking a order & the most enjoyable part is trying the new foods that would come, so that we can recommend to customers the best choice to order."
good,Preparing meals and cashier was what you did here everyday. At times it can get packed and your speed needs to be on point.
good,Wendy's is overall a great place to work. The managers are flexible with the hours and you still have time to live your life outside of the workplace. It's a great learning experience.
good,Its an alright place to work if you want to stay on your feet then that's the place to be.
good,I learned to be more positive and friendly in dealing with customers. I learned to pre-change to the next dollar without using the register. I learned how to be more professional in my everyday work environment.
good,"While working at Wendy's I gained valuable experience working with customers. I learned how to work in fast paced environments and how to most efficiently serve customers. I learned how to work with proper food sanitation guidelines and how to work with difficult customers."
good,"This was the very first job that I obtained. I was so enthused about my first job. I learned so much about the fast food business here. I started out as a cashier, and ended up a team lead. I loved working here as a teenager!!"
good,Usually worked a 10-12hr shift. The higher up management could have been better. Enjoyed working with the staff and coworkers. hardest part of the job was finding home and work balance.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be if working during the morning time, morning prep. Getting ready with all the things needed in order to process the food according to procedure. "
good,Each day I would clock in and be assigned to the back door drive thru. I learned very well how to properly clean food preparation equipment. The managers worked really well with each employee's schedule. Our co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part was cleaning fast enough for closing time. I enjoyed the company of my co-workers very much.
good,It was an exciting and fast paced environment.  Fast food management makes is hard to have a life outside of the 52 hour weeks.  The scheduling is difficult working all holidays and rarely getting a weekend off.  For management staff breaks were few and far in between.  Employees often did not show for shifts which made the work even more difficult
good,"great customer service,team work ,have specific schedule.do more than one task at time."
good,"Well I have been with the company almost five years before I left. It is a very nice working environment. I basically worked every position and every position does come with a tutor to help you out. Doing that was mainly my off job when working, is to help associates understand how things work or what to do in certain times. Position include:: Drive Thru Windows, Cashier, Sandwiches, Grill, Fries, Runner, Morning Stocker, Prepper. It is a fun job most of the time, can be hectic sometimes. Depending on what events are signed with Wendys, also what events are going around the city itself. Have had multiple parties, graduations, boy scouts, girl scouts, donation parties, etc."
good,was a very good job for me at the time when i did get it. but as i got older i started seeing things that wouldn't make any sense. bad management skills was a main reason for me leaving but very good people to work with most of the time.
good,First job so i was in the learning process. Very helpful in furthering my work ethic
good,"The hardest part of the job was that they did not give much hours and paid less then reg wage. Management was good, knew how to treat its employees. A typical day at work was sometimes boring and sometimes fun. I joined school and left because this job was not helping me financially and looked for a better job that could help me financially."
good,it's a fun work place. i enjoy majority of the workers.
good,"While working there was not much fun only work. But I leanred to hustle and multitask. Management was unprofessional because the general manager was more of a friend, and would act as if people were against each other. The hardest part of the job was during rush hours when there were multiple orders at once and keeping every station stocked and getting every customer their food efficiently. My favorite part of work was the the times when the restaurant was dead and we all had a few minutes to really hang out a little."
good,"fast pace environment, over worked and under payed. managers not responsible for their duties."
good,"it was a good experience working for this company, the days and nights were usually busy, which was good always work available, i learned how to build up my customer service skills, as well as working under pressure and at a fast pace, the mangers of the company were pretty cool, and management wasnt bad , but there were certain regulations i felt was ridiculous. i loved my co workers they always kept the job fun, and the team work was good. hardest part about my job was an unsatisfied guest/customer espicially if they say ur the cause of their problem, the most enjoyable part of my job is when a guest/customer gives me god feed back on my work performance."
good,"Not that bad of a job. Simple tasks, asked to be done correctly. I was a part of the management team and found that there was no agreement among management and also the hours get stupid at times. I spent maybe one night a week with my fiance."
good,"This was a great stepping stone in my life. I'm now searching for a career, i'm into longevity Wendy's was just a stepping stone but i loved the job. I loved interacting with customers and a great productive work place."
good,"Cashier,Customer service,sometimes would prep food.Didnt learn anything there already knew from work at McDonalds.Management was great.co workers were ok.the hardest part was when we got a bus then it got busy.but i enjoy being busy.The customers were the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,i would go in and make sure there was enough product for the line and restock anything that wasn't i leard how to be fast at a job the management wasn't alll that good people would do whatever they wanted sometimes and there would be no control they co-workes were fun but sometimes to much the hardest part was doing stuff you had to do went there was no time but you had to find the time to do the most enjoyable part was making some good friends
good,"This job is the bare minimum for most people. It's generally the same thing every day. They train you on one thing at first and keep you there until they need you to do something else. They generally have no drug tests, and a criminal background is fine. The management can range from very friendly to outright hostile. The co-workers can be your best friends, though some may be scary due to their background."
good,Fun working with new people. Very easy job. Very clean and neat. The most fun part was taking orders and making orders. Very good food.
good,"For a part-time job its great, pretty flexible and the management was great but depending on who it is. It's close and they aren't that strict about much, just show up on time and do what you have to do."
good,where i work they dont want overtime so it basically sucks
good,"It’s a good job for a teen looking to pay there phone bill and have a little extra cash  you can move up pretty quickly but not a lifetime job.  The pay is pretty good for fast food, but most people get paid different amounts it just depends on the manager"
good,The fellow employees were great and the managers were mostly fair but the general manager for my location at the time was extremely unpleasant and unprofessional.
good,My experience up there when I was working for Wendy's was hard-working and if someone asked me questions I gave him the honest answer. If I had any questions I would ask it.
good,I love the past paced working but there is sometimes a sense of nobody working to improve but rather have fun. Hard headed management and people that don’t take things seriously unless put in a place which should not have to be done.
good,It’s okay. Just go in and be about your money and not about friends. Because they will turn on you just be about your money and don’t worry about what they say in there because they messy.
good,"The work there wasn't too bad. It wasn't perfect. There were days that work wasn't the best, but I felt needed and like my wellbeing was important. The management seemed to care about me as a person."
good,Nice place to work. Nice people. Friendly and helpful. It is a fast paced environment but everyone helps each other and works as a team. I enjoyed working there and think it is a good experience especially for people looking for their first job.
good,A typical day at work is often busy and there were often times not enough people on the shift which made the job the hardest. The managers were pretty nice and made it their responsibility to keep the store running as smooth as possible.
good,"Management is hard to work for and I am stuck in my position unless I transfer locations. This has been my first and only job and I am currently shift manager, but the store manager is very critical of my work and constantly puts me down."
good,Good working environment if just fall in line with the popular group sometimes you feel like you don't have enough training before they put into live fire
good,"Working at Wendy’s was nice as a first job, but I have grown to dislike going to work and earning money being an employee here at Wendy’s, I’m looking to get a new job that I would be more happy to go to work everyday and earn money"
good,Had lots of good times enjoyed working just not great pay and some long hours of being on your feet.over all fun but not practical for a real career more for a part time or first job.
good,The management was not the best and they never had enough people so I constantly got called in when I was off but I would always go in and help when I could. I got along with the crew very well and it was a good first job.
good,Its not all but you never know where your going to be at for the people as myself knows all positions. The schedule may change day by day short staff cause of bad management I think. The hardest part is working on two positions and only getting paid for one.
good,this was a nice experience for my first job position i enjoyed meeting new people learning new things not to mention the experience showed me alot that helped me overall in fast food facilities
good,"The managers work depending on their mood, and the procedures are really relaxed. I was transferred from a Wendy's in Colorado to New Mexico, and it was basically the same. Some different equipment, and the managers did more, but they were still more worried about food cost than maintaining fresh product. There really is not much advancement, they'll just bring a manager from a different store in, and they cut the shift lead position out."
good,It was very laid back and fun to work at. There is advancement options available for those who qualify and they give felons a second chance at opportunities
good,good entry level job for a school student like i was or other wise. learn most tasks that all people should know for the most part. only complain was i was the grunt but hey i enjoyed it
good,During my time of working for this company i've had a hard time dealing with management issues. Previously they were under a different coorporation but I came a couple years later with new coorporate thinking that things would be different. But their management has been very poor considering they have belittled me and the crew members that i referred to work in the store with us and it was from the district manager who has now switched to carlisle district.
good,Working at Wendy’s was a very exciting Job. From the customer to the workers . I got the hang of things every quick . The only thing was that they didn’t give you enough hours instead they would cut them. Overall every great place .
good,Tough me a lot about the work force. And gave me new skills and helped me work on lacking skills  this company was a good starting point for look forward to a career
good,It’s a fast food job but the management wasn’t there when I worked there. I was barely appreciated for my hard work. Plus they did not want to work with my schooling hours.
good,Wendy's was a good job have nothing really bad to say about the company. They are serious about the view of the store and the satisfaction of the customers. They set goals & tend to meet them.?
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is laid back with occasional rushes. Cleaning duties throughout shift and having to attend to customers. I learned customer service skills and cash drawer basics. The management varied in exceptionalism, some were great leaders and others set poor examples. The culture was relaxed and fun. The hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hours straight and getting no breaks. The most enjoyable part was co-workers."
good,Wanted to stay working there but they could not change my schedule in anyway to accommodate for school. Would reapply after my schedule changes after this semester in school
good,It can be fast paced usually during lunch and dinner times. I would always try to be busy and help my colleagues so when you need help your colleagues are there to give a helping hand.
good,"Even though Wendy’s can get crazy busy at times it’s an okay job for the most part. It’s fast paced, your always on your feet, and the staff and managers are decent people."
good,"It's a great job for those just starting out. I enjoyed my time there, but I have a brand new baby. I won't be able to return to work for several weeks, but things have gone down hill and I honestly feel like I'm wasting my time now."
good,"As a Shift Supervisor, I did have many duties. My job was to assure the operations management was being communicated to the team. I needed to make sure there was communication within the supervisors and the crew members to make sure the operations were flowing. I had to deal with many different people, as far as dealing with customer complaints and satisfying the customers. I also took on the responsibility to do weekly and monthly inventory. Also, I did some payroll duties, such as sending over reports of the hours to the corporate."
good,If you are young and trying to just get some cash this would be a decent job. You don't get paid enough to actually live so this would probably be a tempory job. Not as fast paced and stressful as McDonalds.
good,"Too many young kids that were more interested in playing around and taking selfies than working . Managers were not always consistent in giving direction. This made it harder for the managers who were working hard. A lot of the time we didn't have the tools to do the job as efficiently as it could have been done. Overall I had a positive time there, I learned a lot from some very good and knowledgeable people, If I had to go through it all again, I would."
good,"i enjoyed most of the people i worked with, i enjoyed helping the customers, if they needed anything, i loved a fast pace environment, and getting the job done in a quick and efficient manner."
good,"i didnt have such a good experience , i felt they where racist. I believe that that company had so much more potential than what they showed. I during that time i was on an intensive probation that required alot from me so it was hard to focus."
good,"It was ok working here. A lot of drama unrelated to work and some stuff that was absolutely unnecessary. But, most of my co workers were decent to work with. My manager was really bad."
good,"Workplace culture is great, very routine-based tasks. I feel like I'm paid fairly , and I my coworkers are great. I wish the scheduling was a bit more flexible, but it's great besides that."
good,at Wendy's you'll be working closely with fellow employees and providing service with a smile. You'll uphold the company policies for safety and quality.
good,"It all depends on who owns the company. My franchise is all about the money, not the crew. They always worry about themselves than the people who run their stores. On the other hand there are franchises that care very much for the crew and treat us like humans and work with us. I wish corporate would push for better work environment for franchises to fallow"
good,"Wendy's is somewhat fast-paced, mainly during lunch hours, it's a pretty decent place to work. If Management is not being too friendly with the employees and everyone knows their Roll and stick to it, I think Wendy's could be An outstanding Restaurant."
good,"I was nice to everybody I was everybody friends in Wendy’s."
good,It’s a great first job. Money was good for a student fresh out of high school. Except they do not pay holidays or have paid time off. Very little exceptions to calling out. Some days were great other very busy. Team work was a major role.
good,I’ve been with them for a while and have been through multiple General Managers. The Crew members are great to work with but It feels like Upper Management just doesn’t care
good,working at wendys was not bad for being a teenager in high school. it was always quick paced and busy. everyone always worked together to get things done.
good,Wendy's was a very fast paced work environment but I did love working with the people I worked with. Very friendly people and co workers. I also loved the customers.
good,Cash register waiting on customers prepping for next day cleaning tables drive thru grill and fryer Bagging  food  serving Filling sauces  napkins wiping tables
good,Fairly easy work day. sometimes drama got out of hand. somewhat flexible schedule. Most employees where nice and professional. managers were mostly very good aside from one.
good,Working in fast food was a very fast paced working enviorment. I learned patience and appreciation for other people. The hardest part of the job was having to balance work and school.
good,"The work is grueling and incredibly fast-paced, but that's to be expected in a fast food place right off a major interstate and highway. Most of the managers and crew members are friendly and helpful but there are a few exceptions that can make a shift more miserable than it needs to be. The hardest part is usually keeping up and dealing with the heat but, again, that comes with the territory. This job did help me to come out of my shell a bit, and getting to know some of the people I worked with was genuinely enjoyable. However, the bad days were exceptionally bad and I wouldn't want to go back."
good,This was my first job i ever had so i dont really have much to say about it but the regular generic things but i will say its fine to start there for a fisrt job.
good,"fast paced, young culture but experience is looked upon as a plus within reason. great company to start out with and build your skills with, growth within company does happen but is a rarity"
good,I love the people I work with and whenever I’m having a bad day just being there puts me in a good mood and also the customers too . We all work together and help eachother out on our shifts that way it runs smoothly and I enjoy and appreciate everybody I work with
good,"Wendy's is a great job, especially if you're a teenager trying to get into the habit of working. The only complication was that there never was a steady schedule, switching shifts was complicated, and certain managers were very rude and had no respect for personal issues like family. Other than that, Wendy's taught me how to be hands-on and how to deal with stressful situations as quickly and efficiently as possible (like lunch and nighttime rush hours)."
good,"Wendy is a good job to work at as a gate way job! A job to teach you customer service , basic cleaning & multitask training all in one. I would recommend this job to student in high school."
good,i was a cashier for the first three months then i work drive through. it was the same as far as mcdonalds. fast pace happy people food and cleaning. i enjoyed meeting different crew members as well as customers.
good,Wendys was a great start for me. It taught me skills I needed to move on and try better things.I learned how to be a leader and do paperwork needed to run a business properly.
good,I was at Wendys for only 9 months before I got promoted to manager. I really enjoyed going to a couple different classes out of town to improve my management skills. But the management was really favoritism towards females more them males. Other then that they have a great training system and wonderful delicious food.
good,"Was an okay first job. I liked the people I worked with. Easy for first timers, it was a piece of cake. The store I  worked at kept up with all the procedures and did not cut corners."
good,"With wendy's some days are busy and some are slow. But it's a great place for young adults still in High School who need jobs. As for those who need more, ask for a little more pay and never get it. They require alot for the little pay they give. Sometime you have to watch the people around you, because you could have people who keep up mess or try to always tell the boss how to run there store."
good,I feel this is a good place to go if your looking to start your first job somewhere. fast food is a very fast paste of work. the hardest part is sometimes you will have to deal with mad or upset
good,"I really like working here, everyone was great, and I liked how along we all got, we were all productive, and stayed positive. It was a great work place."
good,They are helpful workers and good people and good management team but everyone there thinks they are managers so no one is doing they job right but all help out a lot and keep you up to date
good,"Fast paced working environment. Running registers, making food, counting inventory, closing cash drawers out, overseeing employees. Hardest part of job was making sure inventory was counted properly. Most enjoyable part of job was customers and co-workers."
good,"Wake up, go to work, do your job, rinse and repeat"
good,"I think the establishment is good but, should have better options and more room to do things. We should be able to have more room for kitchens and place to store the products that we recive as a company to store"
good,"They pay is too low to be able to survive and live a comfortable life, financially. No one can survive on 7.85 an hour even if they have full time hours. The company's owners didn't approve of people working overtime hours, but really you have to in order, to get a decent paycheck to atleast pay on some living expense."
good,Nice clean place as a first job. I started off not knowing anything at all but the staff was quick to help me out on the spot. Management was efficient although more people left then came to the store to work
good,The work place culture is very quick paced. Not a job that I recommend for anyone living on their own. Management is great! Best managers I’ve ever had.
good,This Company helped me out a lot with becoming a adult and they trained me very well. I completed my tasks everytime I can in for work. But they like to cut hours way too often even though you go to work as much as you can.
good,This is great place to start as a student to grow and evolve to determine your role in the adult world. The greatest days are the busiest which are weekends.
good,When I started at Wendy’s I was excited & once I got to working there I really enjoyed it I got to meet some really nice & funny people then as it went along it seemed like it started going down hill we lost one of our best managers & after that Wendy’s started falling. They started bringing in new managers & crew members there was some good workers & some not so good but only one manager was my favorite & she left
good,Washed dishes of cooked French fries. If I washed Dishes I also was responsible for taking out the trash in the kitchen and dining room. and cleaning the restrooms. Management was okay. The hardest part was cleaning the restrooms. I enjoy being the fry cook.
good,Wendy's is a great place to if you can move fast and handle your stress levels. Wendy's taught me how to move fast and hold my composer in very stressful situations it gets tough when lines get long and food runs low but if you work as a team nothing is impossible.
good,i worked as a drive tru worker as well as making all salads and prep work for the line . i made all the days salads then made all the condements that come on top of the sandwichs
good,"Wendy’s has been a good place to go have lunch at for many years. However, working there at the time I did was hard. I was still in school and my schedule couldn’t seem to work around it so I quit."
good,Closing is really hard and you should be fast because you only have 30 minute to finish your job. Not all managers are responsible and the do not have enough experience.
good,"I loved working here but the management was extremely poor, there was always way too much drama. I did love my customers though and enjoyed some of the people I worked with. The work was easy and the hours were decent."
good,"This is similar to any food service industry. Wendy's in my area wasn't exactly very well managed, we had many store closures that caused me to move up to three stores within just a year of my return back to Wendy's after a momentary absence. "
good,"Wendy’s is a nice place to work if it’s your last option. Talking to other co-workers and from my own experience there, those company does not give many salary raises or work benefits."
good,"Management is great! however the job itself is a lot of finding ways to stay busy. No accommodations for weather at all, with the wig it was far too hot in the summer, in the winter both the fabric of the outfit and the short sleeves and pants made it too cold. I worked through the Tollstrip corp branch, they did what they could but there wasn't much they could do. The hour sheets were also a hassle."
good,"Working at Wendy's; even only for two months, I grew to like it. The fast work environment, positive grew and sometimes even understanding managers. I learned while working at Wendy's that the more work you put in, the more hours you'll get out, especially if you improve on the things you once failed at. My hardest part at Wendy's was washing dishes  and doing Prep on weekends. because I love being social with the customers and making sure they come back again. All in all the most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was the friendly faces who worked with me and also the regular friendly customer who'd come around."
good,"Fun but not forever, you find flaws in the work place the become a hassle to complete your job. This job will turn a people person into an introvert.           ."
good,Friendly working environment. Plenty of hours if you are willing to work. No room to advance and no pay raises. Very repetitive work. Not bad place to work.
good,Good work very good coworkers it’s hot coworkers play n laugh all day they put ppl where they don’t need to be but they want women to clean up bathrooms and do men’s job
good,"- hardest part: overwhelming customers"
good,"While working at Wendys I learned how to perform great customer service by helping customers efficiently, in a friendly manner. And handling payments and receipts in a store."
good,It's a good job for a student or someone starting out their work experience at. It includes employee discounts. Quality food at a reasonable price. Good management.
good,I always did more than I was required to do and some other people didnt do anything and got away with it. It was a fun environment to work in because of the people.
good,"While it was hectic at Wendy's, I learned a lot of valuable lessons. I learned to be flexible at all times. Each workday always has unexpected situations and problems. However, rather than feeling pessimistic about work, I tried my best to maintain good relations and communications between me and my co-workers in order to meet the demand of the customers within the goal time. While we did not always meet the goal, it was a fun experience for me because I enjoyed challenges."
good,"This was a great tourist restaurant in Arlington, TX. Wendy's was very popular with the locals. It also accommodated the occasional buss load of high school sports from out of town for either lunch or dinner.  The restaurant also had lots of overflow from Six Flags Over Texas. Wendy's is a can do operation. They were always professional and courteous and highly skilled and knowledgeable in the restaurant industry. I would say fiercely competitive. They were unfortunately not scared of their own employee turnover or attrition in the workplace.If you could not be there for an reason they would hire over the top of you and discount your labor practice."
good,My first 2 and half years were ok until we kept switching general managers every couple of months. Then things spiral led downward fast. Poor management was the reason for me ultimately getting fired.
good,"Nothing to say about this company. Worked as a Team Leader, not paid extra pay. Opened and set up daily, cleaned dining area and bathrooms, made sandwiches, ran drive-thru window."
good,"Overall it’s just a regular job where you come in and work and then later go home. "
good,"Everything was fine when I first started. Nice amount of hours and pay rate $8.85. The managers were difficult to work with. They were not really good with training, only two of my co-workers were patient and helpful everyone else was the opposite. We were often under prepared and I would always end up staying later than I should have. Not that it was a problem but I saw it as poor management. Also they didn't cook the fries in the right basket they'll cook them in the same basket with nuggets and that bothered me because im vegetarian."
good,"Good place for your first high school job. "
good,"wendys can be fun to work at sometimes, and other times it can be very stressful, you always have pros and cons with each job. i like working nights even if it gets really buys, it keeps you on your toes"
good,Wendys was a fun starter job. As a high school student starting out the best job is a fast food job until you figure out what you want to do. It's fun and it keeps you out of trouble
good,"I worked there for 5 and a half years and the staff slowly kept getting worse and worse. If it wasn't the new kids coming in that seemed like they have never left their house it was new management that never worked in fast food before."
good,"Received and disbursed payment by cash, check, credit cards,vouchers or automatic debits. assited customers by providing information and resolving their complaints enjoyed coming to a fast paced job customers loved my personality I greeted  customers entering establishments made my area cleaned evey time I was on the clock."
good,"good team work, decent leaders, would give people promotions that did not deserve them just because they had been there longer. No good benefits or bonus program."
good,"Working at Wendy's was a great experience as a first time job, the instructions were clear and the employees and managers were very helpful and encouraging."
good,"This job was okay, a little intense, but relaxed, no drama, very welcoming, anything you need, they will help out, very caring employees, well clean job."
good,You have to be able to work with people and  you have to have a customer service attitude because your going to be meeting new people all of the time..
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be talking/ holding conversation with customers too ensure customers that Wendy's is and always will be a friendly place, welcoming all customers with open arms."
good,The environment and co workers were great and helped you learn whatever you needed to learn management was relatable and friendly but when they got really busy more work was put on employees that knew due to lack of trained employees.
good,Fast pace. can be a very friendly environment. Wendys takes pride in there product an it is very important to stay on top of the quality. team huddles are conducted all day to keep team update don sales and goals.
good,"Worked there when I was 14, it wasn't a place for me. I felt that the other employees always spoke in their language about me and I felt left out, which no one should feel."
good,It's a fast food restaurant. like any other the pay isn't great and hours very. overall i didn't mind it. but what really got me was I was in line for management which was cool until i found out i would not be getting a raise from min wage and little to no benefits.
good,I was a cashier and I took orders in the drive thru. I loved the people I worked with. I wasn't a big fan of the managers though. It was a busy store.
good,"you got paid based on what you did, the pay for me was reasonable. I never complained about the hours because they let us have a life outside of working. the management was always on our back couldn't ever have a breather. There was no hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was people, I love meeting people."
good,Wendys was a ok place to work im not a big fan of fast food as a career i felt the structure of the restaurant needed a better work system and people to follow the rules if they are going to enforce them the employees are hard workers
good,I enjoyed working at Wendys when I first got hired however after about a month the management team changed and I no longer enjoy working there with the new manager. I also do not believe they are good at resolving internal conflicts because they do not confront them or talk to the person involved in it.
good,I did like making the food and running around the store. it was a lot of fun to work there and the people were great. its a shame i live so far away now.
good,"I have learned how to deal with costumer even if they were mad about wrong order. Cooperation with manger and co-worker is the best enjoyable time at job. Wendy's is friendly place for work. The hardest part is when the business is slow, manager send you home early."
good,"On a typical day i would, assist customers with food orders, operate the cash registers, assist with preparing food, assist crew members to keep team workflow at efficient level, and clean dining room and clean work stations."
good,"A typical day at Wendys was to come in, great all my coworkers, clean up the kitchen and prepare food for the day. Next I'd take orders for a couple hours and talk to my coworkers and guests all day. The workplace was fast paced, but also positive. Which made working there a lot of fun for a first job. To finish up the day, I'd count down my till to the amount needed for the next day, fill out a little report and clean up my working area for the next person."
good,The people you work with are very nice and the management is very easy to work with and is considerate of individual needs. They are very understanding when it come to scheduling.
good,The dealing with the customers was always a challenge in and of itself. The hardest part was making the team work together to get the product out. it was rewording when all ran smooth and everyone left happy.
good,"Wendy's was an extremely fast paced place to work. It was interesting because of the vastly different customer base that you encountered on a daily basis. However, the company did not pay competitively nor did they offer the same perks and such to all employees/managers. While the general management boasted on family values and familial importance, they did not follow through with those statements when push came to shove."
good,you are busy start to finshed. make the orders hand them to bagger or front counter. you get a break  in am  after break you take trash..  if you get a break from cars you go do dishes.. there is always somthing to do.. fast food is a busy fast job.
good,"I made a lot of friends working there. Started as a Crew Member and became a Shift Manager before I had to leave due to pregnancy complications that left me unable to work for a time. My biggest issue was that some older coworkers didn't take well to answering to a new manager. During down time, there was a lot of laughter between doing work. During peak times, it did get hectic, but having friends working with you makes the team dynamic better."
good,When I started at Wendys the work culture/environment was amazing.  Everyone was so nice and it was just a great place to work.  Somewhere in the last couple years the management just went down hill and the stress levels went up.  The stress levels started to affect my outside life and my relationships with my family so I decided it was time to find something different.  I also wanted better opportunity for advancement.
good,"I loved my time with Wendy's. It was a very fast-paced job, and my managers let me make my own schedule. It is not the greatest work environment, but it is a great way to have a career while in school."
good,"need more job training, crew trainers, increase pay rate with in months, benefits for employees as well as managers. the hardest part of the job is working a such a small space."
good,"Fair working conditions, hardass bosses, simple repetitive work, customer service, kitchen, and cleaning. The pay should be twice what it is for the expected work, but getting hired and keeping a job here is easy if you can take the stress."
good,It was okay to work for them. It was fast paced and had to learn fast on some things. It was very competive there. They also work with me on my situration and hours
good,"If you're in high school and trying to find a decent job that's flexible, I would recommend Wendy's. It's an easy entry level job and gives you good work experience that you can later put on your resume."
good,I did cleaning at Wendy's. It was an ok job. I worked to my self.  I  worked about 4 hours on work nights. I cleaned and closed down the dinning area.
good,Do your job and be on time and you have too work fast pace when your working in fast food and also try too make sure all of your customers are satisfied at the end of the day
good,"Beside the non communication between our supervisors to actually have the tools needed to do our job &o each kind  implementing there own rules for there shift, is a great full or part time job wether your looking to make a career or a part time job while at school. Love the food, the fast paced  environment  which makes the day go by fast."
good,"This was my very first job. I worked here through summer. The manager was fair, recognized specific skills, and pay was good. I left when Summer was over to focus on school. Good job."
good,Wendy's is a decent place to work. You usually end up with a pretty stable schedule but sometimes they're not able to work with the hours that you need. The staff is friendly but it is very fast paced and tight work environments.
good,"A typical day was productive, lunch time was especially busy. I learned how to work the register and use/clean fryers and grills, and worked on a lot of communication skills. Management made work an enjoyable place to be. Most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships made with customers and employees."
good,The location we were in was just horrible. we would have homeless people or drug addicts outside asking customers for money and they would only come in for water or the restrooms to shower in.
good,"Otherwise, wasnt a horrible place. Fast paced some days othere are slow, gotta keep busy. Discount is nice if yu like fast food. Not much room for promotions."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wendy’s everyone was so helpful while i was working there Pregnant . It’s so professional and everything was clean and sanitized.
good,Enjoyable work place easy to learn how to use the equipment. Customer service is very respectable always nice. Clean environment fast food service is surprisingly fun
good,worked register waiting on people worked the drive thru and done sandwiches fast pace worked the window done the grill  worked with some good people worked very hard and made salads
good,"Management was poor , team members had terrible attitudes . No one worked towards improving service. A typical day consist of me walking in and the store is a mess , both drive-thru and the front of the house is backed up , and everyone has an attitude."
good,it was like any other work environment that i've been to wasn't really an experience. Wendys was the most sanitary place i've worked at.Nice unhostile enviroment
good,Opportunities for advancement if the one is willing to contribute to the betterment of the company. Great way to gain experience in working with multiple personalities and customer service.
good,"Working at Wendy's was great for gaining job experience in customer service and money/time management. I would recommend it for someone just getting out of school looking for new experience or just to gain some extra cash but I would not recommend it for a full-time, pay your mortgage, job."
good,"A typical day was a stressful day. Managers and supervisors who just yell and get mad when you do something wrong, instead of being a leader and showing you or letting you know the correct way of things. Management definitely had favoritism towards certain employees and made others feel put down in a sense."
good,"I didnt want to do a review. It was just an ok job. Nothing too special, just a great job if your just trying to put money in your pockets and nothing extra"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's. You clock in figure out your position you are doing for the shift and then you just work that until you leave. I learned some interesting things at Wendy's some being I learned where and what work environment I don't want to be in or form as a manager in my future. I management was okay it wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing. For a fast-food restaurant,  would say they did their job. The workplace culture was mainly people complaining during their shift but there were times we did have some fun and enjoyed our shift. The hardest part of this job for me personally was trying to keep calm when an employee was freaking out or even when a customer just threw a hamburger at me (yes that did really happen).  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to talk to the customers I loved seeing some of the regulars."
good,Fun fast paced environment always on the move. Work between 9.5-13 hours a day. High turnover. You would get good and bad customers. Short at least one crew member a shift. Equipment issues probably once a week
good,"great work place "
good,I appreciate my time at Wendy's as a team member. I have experienced many thins also. Thanks   Cleaning duties assigned to individual team members.  Hardest part is when time periods go by slow because of the lack of customers on certain days at certain times
good,"i come in to do my job, i prep food for the shift, I clean the grills I take orders from customers I make sandwiches i am a productive worker I come to work everyday, I don't have a hard thing about my job because I know how to do everything. just not enough money"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be taking care of customers at the drive thru, washing dishes, cleaning tables, making sandwiches, and just keeping the customer happy overall."
good,Wendys is a great place to work depending on the management of the store youre working at. Discounts are offered on most meals. Schedule is flexible and can usually be worked around depending on the need
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy, it was a very fast and challenging . some days the shift was long and fast while some where short and slow . but overall Ioved working there"
good,Working here can be fun but a lot of the times a lot of the employees are treated horribly. Especially the ones that do everything and will come in on their days off. The bad employees are treated better then the good employees and it is highly unfair. Customers can even see what happens and that can be very unprofessional.
good,You need to be quick on your feet during rush hours as well as quick thinking to knowing what to say and how to solve a problem when an angry customer comes in.
good,"When I began my employment at Wendy's, the hours were great and I was given plenty of tasks to complete during the shift. I don't have as many hours as I used to, and now am usually a cashier, meaning I don't move around as much as I would have liked. I enjoy being in charge of the dining room the most because I have to be constantly moving. Working for the company was overall a fun experience, but there was definitely an issue with workplace gossip that I didn't enjoy."
good,The most part I enjoyed about the job is cleaning around me. I love to be in a clean environment. The hardest part I of the job I had to deal with is that it's just a little bit of space around you and you have all the workers around u and the place just keeps getting dirty.
good,"a typical day has two rushes, one in the morning and one at night. i learned how to make sandwiches, run register, run drive thru, and take orders. the hardest part is cleaning."
good,The quality of food and service was great. The customers were always  pleased and came back frequently. The staff and management were friendly and professional. It was the type of environment you would want to come to even on your day off.
good,was one of my second jobs and it gave me knowledge and experience that i continue to use today good for teens in school or just to get back on your feet.
good,"usually busy between 12-2. Days are not hard at all. you can work at the front,drive thru, grill, table,or fry station. Everything is very basic and easy to learn. no free lunch"
good,Working for Wendys was fun and very competitive. It was a great place to meet new faces and satisfy customers. It sometimes overwhelming. Its also sometimed very stressful. Although a great place to build up customer service skills
good,Working at both places had it's ups and downs but my regular customers made my days enjoyable. I learned to make big decisions that benefited the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on the customers faces.
good,"Wendy's, Palm Desert was by far a great job despite the lack of benefits. You are given no paid time off, but hours were fairly flexible, up until about the past 3 months or so, it just deteriorated, hours getting taken away from hard working employees being given to newly hired minors who show no interest in working or show no respect to customers and management. Hardest part of the job is probably drive-thru , but otherwise mostly enjoyable."
good,"wendys was like my family. My co workers were awesome and my customers new me and i new them. We all grew a bond. The hardest part of the job was trying to memorize everything that comes in certain sandwiches but the enjoyable part of the day was probably the lunch wave because it made the day go by much faster. Management wasn't the best because he would name call the employees, he was so cheap and so unfair to all of us"
good,"Its a quick paced enviroment, may be diffcult but a great starter job for any teen for a first job. If your dedicated youll learn every position in a flash"
good,"Great team work, Hard working employees. hardest part of the job is don't get the garbage area clean and organize it was hard to get it maintain. management was a bit odd. it was stressful management. unhappy dominant management. bossy."
good,"I liked working at wendys, mostly because of the staff. Working at wendys wasn't a bad job though, i found it easy. I would go back if i had to. The manager is a very interesting person. The job its self can be a little overwhelming at times but its something you kind of get used to after a while. People will be people, rude but thats life. With these types of jobs you defiantly can not take everything to heart."
good,Working at Wendy's gave me that customer service experience which led me to being a barista. I would recommend a high school student to work here to help teach discipline as well as manners.
good,"Good first job, teaches you to respect the workers. If you stick with the job for at least two years, there is a significant chance that you will be promoted to manager or assistant manager. Will get lots of hours if desired and management tries their best to work a schedule around yours. Only downside is that I've never recieved a raise even though I'm one of the hardest workers there, never call in, and am always on time."
good,"a strong work ethic is key to success with this company. attention to detail is a must and the need to have the customer being  first mine set will go a long way. team members also very high on the list, how you treat them how you train them and retain them are key."
good,"Typical day in Wendy's was to go in and work in the area they put you. If on sandwiches, you either worked pick-up window sandwiches or dining room sandwiches. clean up the area and break the line down at the end of the night. During all of this, the environment was very high school like. Everyone talked about each other, among others."
good,"Wendys is a good fast paced fast food restaurant. competitive. good hourly pay. a typical day at work was coming in at 5pm and cleaning the condiment station because morning crew were busy and couldn't keep up with it. gets busy around lunch and dinner times , bathrooms need to be heavily watched. at least at my old location , high energy except around dinner time everyone tends to get a little frustrated"
good,"Not a bad job to have.  I only left because I moved out of the area.  Overall a good first job in a fast food place, steady paced and always something to do."
good,"The manager was so disorganized, always scheduling when I had class after giving her my schedule more then once! The thing that sucks is we only use one window."
good,it was all in all a good work environment. sometimes fast paced but well balanced and good team work. hope this review helps others who want to or are looking into this type of job.
good,"One thing I learn dealing with rude customers, some things just not worth it, instead of taken things in your own hands.. Sometimes you just have to look at the situation differently. I know a lot of times they might say "" Customers are always right"" but in reality  they are not. I Say this because no matter if you are one of those type of co-worker, Always on time everyday, work hard,  do what you suppose to do everyday as a professional employee, great performance, always been that sweet,  loving,  caring, nice person to all customers, You always have some of those customers come in everyday, all rude, grumpy for no reason or mad at the world.  An you Couldn't  have did anything to them but instead you take it in consideration, where you have been done hold so much in, an a long period of time,  were you explode. That's why I say ""it's ok, fast food not for everybody. Some people can tolerate it and some people can't """
good,"good day friendly customers "
good,Good pay and horrible management. I did not like the managers most of them have no idea or have zero background in IT or Business Analysis. Leading team member to chaos! Horrible!
good,We always had a busy day working at Wendy's. I learned how to work with different people The management for Wendy's was good they worked with me when I needed days off.
good,"it was busy but some of the managers were kind and understanding, so it wasn't so bad. Some of the customers could be rude and impatient, but if you are kind to them they will likely be kind to you."
good,I worked for the company for 11 years so my time spent there was valuable to me. I had the chance to work with multiple supervisors and crew members. I glad for this because I gain knowledge from so many people over the years at Wendy's. I am glad to have been a part of the Wendy's Fast Food Chain.
good,It was my first job. Ioved the environment but it was really stressfull. Customers can be very rude but  the management was great at handeling it. I see my old manager everytime I go back home.
good,The rawson group was one of the better wendy's I ave worked for. I did a have to travel to NY  the crew was great along with the other mangers. The area superviser was not right for his position
good,I been working here for 9 years almost and it fun but no benefits and I need them. I like the area it's close to down town Atlanta my managers are also nice and productive
good,"It's workable , the customers are friendly , some of the managers work with your schedule and try to help you. The Employees are nice and will help if needed"
good,Good experience for young individual to gain experience in the work field. I learned how to deal with people in the way I interact  and deal with them in a more professional way.
good,Enjoyed learning how to work in a fast paced environment I am thankful for the opportunities to grow within the company unfortunately it was my first job and it wasn't really the career path that I had wanted.
good,"Typical day of work consists of taking orders, washing dishes/cleaning trays and tables, stocking, making sandwiches/drinks, cleaning bathrooms when needed, greeting customers, smiling "
good,Great place to work if you have to work fast food. i was in highschool when i worked here and they were good about not keeping me late on school nights. learned skills all around the restaurant thats helped me with other jobs.
good,"The store is fun to work for and the management is easy to get along with, I really didn't want to write a review for this one but it made me so now I'm just trying to reach the word count"
good,I have been here almost a year no room to advance and no room for a raise even though I am their opener full time. I do get Monday thru Friday weekend off and I am off by 3.
good,"Day at work...Fast pace, cleaning, Closing and opening dinning room.....prep food, cook , service window, ability to mert new faces, very friendly co-workers."
good,"Higher mangament needs give the crew members  respect and vise versa. Managers get free lunches, need longer break time and to get out 10 minunte breaks."
good,"Friendly managers and crew. Usually will be on one position for 8 hours. The work is not difficult, but must remain focused during rush times. Easy first job to gain work experience."
good,"-a typlical day at work involves alot of cleaning, food preperation, interacting with customers, and basic problem solving"
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers. I has many regular customers that i built relationships with.
good,"Had a bad boss that always was eating instead of helping us out never had the schedule right ."
good,Good job with the focus of serving customers with kindness and preparation of foods in a healthy safe and deligent environment. Also communication with other team members to complete orders
good,The problem with Wendy's is that they dont enforce anti bullying of other coworkers..  they did a horrible job here.this is what led me up to quitting the job.
good,"Overall Wendy's is a great franchise to work for. Personally I, and other employees in the shop have had issues with the manager of Raymond Terrace not treating the employees fairly. That's why I left the job but Wendy's itself are a fantastic company and handled my case of unfair dismissal and being treated wrongly by the manager very well."
good,"Typically, it stays busy here with some 30 minute slow periods. There are two managers, and they stay on shift until 5pm. There's good teamwork and it makes work fun. I learned how to have fun while still being productive."
good,I liked wendys but the environment was too fast paced for me.  I would become strssed out during rushes along with my coworkers. I made friends with my colleagues and i liked my supervisor.
good,I liked it cause I was always buisy and moving I was grill cook and maintenance I basically i did evrything they needed me sometimes crazy hours flexible positions
good,"It's a fast paced work environment.  It can be a fun place to work at times.  Customer Service and quality of food is important as well as service time that the food has to be prepared, cooked, and served in from the time the customer places their order to the time they receive their food and drive off the drive through pad.  It's all timing.  Every associate and customer has their own character."
good,"i did mainly dishes and register work while working at Wendy's. I loved my coworkers and the hardest part of the job itself had to be doing the dishes and register at the same time, especially during closing hours because its very busy and you must clean all the dishes as well. the easy part was dealing with guests. most people coming to eat were very nice and friendly. Management was good. Although they could have scheduled better."
good,"a typical day at wendys is a struggle for having enough people at the store and spending hours in a rush."
good,It was hard working job. it pays minimum wages which can not help me to maintain my studies or living. Living in Toronto cost me a lot of money. Wendy's did not give me a flexible hours.
good,The possibility to move up the chain at this place of employment is good. I went from crew member to crew trainer and was also able to help with managerial duties. Opportunities such as this makes the job more enjoyable and well worth the effort.
good,"By the time I left I was shift Manager so I basically did everything. Drive thru, making sandwiches and preparing food, inventory, dishes, cashier, and help keep the store running smoothly and organized. I enjoyed working for this company."
good,"I was a trainer, I loved meeting the new managers that would come to our store to train, they were unique and I learned a lot from them,  I enjoyed the challenge of a fast paced job, customers were great and they knew I would serve them well, always friendly. great work experience and team...."
good,Great first job and would recommend for any teen in school looking for a job.Most co workers are great to get along with along with most of the managers work great around your schedule and help you when needed.
good,Depending on Location Management changes as far as DM prevents/prohibits you from lots of things such your raise and benefits . Co-Workers are wonderful never had and issue.
good,The managers are Disrespectful. The coworkers are rude. Also the job itself isnt bad minus the fact that you stand in water all day because a sink is broken or something else went wrong. But the managers let you go from a job because you are juggling two jobs to survive. That's not right!
good,"A mediocre place for a first job. Management is less than desirable and co-worker treatment is poor. Work environment is not the best, but is okay for a first job for a few months or so."
good,"Wendy's has prepared me for great customer service contact."
good,"There was nothing special about working here."
good,"a typical day at work would consist of a lot of pressure. a lot and a lot of pressure. working in a fast food restaurant can be very tiring. working long shifts and standing on your feet for hours, this job has taught me how to multitask at its finest. many would wonder how, this is because at wendys just like any fast food restaurant has you working on many things at onces. For me, i usually work as the cook dropping fresh meat, chicken, fries and all kinds of stuff, there is a lot to worry about when working as the cook, making sure its cooked properly, making sure there enough meat for the sandwich maker to have and a lot more."
good,Very quick pace and had to be nice to rude customers. It is more of a layover job til you get the one you desire. Great job for college students that need money. Very demanding job.
good,"i liked the fast paced a fastfood restaurant has, but i did dislike that there was so many personal problems at this location. i worked at different locations and it was nothing like this one "
good,"Wendy's is a tough challenging surroundings that comes along with fun moments as well as difficult moments .there are difficult times when it gets busy ,but sometimes they're funny and enjoyable moments. I can honestly say I've learned a lot. Mostly from co-workers."
good,I learned alot about the business it was my first job i enjoyed it. Had made quite a few friends that I still know to this day. I learned about customer service and trying to make people happy.
good,"A typical day of work at Wendy's for me is to come in speak , look at the position chart and take my position. I learned how to use there system pretty well , how to mange a conversation with customers, and the biggest task of all multitasking. My co workers were normal they all had a set personality.The hardest part was learning how to multitask; I have that down pack now.The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"This was a great first job in high school. It is good because I started out only being able to work few hours a week because of my age but then i gradually was allowed more, and they worked around this as well as around my school schedule. Everyone all helped each others jobs and made sure there was excellent customer service."
good,"i worked here along time. i new how to do everything. i trained others in cooking and sandwich making. Show workers what to do. after all that ,i still wasn't promoted to manager."
good,"greeting customers, submitting orders, operating the cash register, perform food preparation and drive-thru duties"
good,A typical day at work included me sitting on a microphone answering orders or making sandwiches. I honestly do not feel like I learned anything except dealing with complicated situations. Management wasn't there half the time. Co workers were rude.
good,Jobs quick to apply and you get a call right away. Warning this job is not for everyone. Cashiers is the easiest job their. I personally loved it I was a cook there. I had my personal space. Got payed every weeks. Sometimes was offered more hours. Gotta be on your feet a lot  and a fast paced job.
good,this was a temporary job that I got just out of high school. Because I was just starting out in the work field and getting familuer
good,"A great place to work, but highly repetitive day-to-day with relatively low wages at the associates and supervisor levels. Each day was very busy and multitasking was par for the course for everyone. Slow downs in business without side work made it boring certain days. Great management and team atmosphere for the most part."
good,This job required me to do so much work in so little time. The easiest part about the job is doing the job. The hardest thing would be getting my co-workers to do the same amount of work I was doing.
good,Wendy's felt like home while I was there. I got along well with other coworkers and management. I got to know my customers and what they wanted before they even gave their order.
good,"Being a Crew member at a fast food restaurant like Wendy's is fun sometimes.You have to work as a team member as well as pro-vie the best customer service fast and make sure the order is correct and given to the right customer. The coworkers are nice sometimes not when we get busy sometimes they can be pretty mean, bossy, and rude. The managers are pretty rude depending on the manager  . The hardest part about the job is working as a team when there is pretty big rush with no help when a worker needs it or customer needs it."
good,"A typical day at work involved taking orders, aging food, making sandwiches and communicating with customers and other employees. While working there  I learned to deal with customer issues, we often felt with the customers ourselves instead of involving a manager. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the amazing people that I was fortunate enough to meet."
good,"I was required to work multiple positions at multiple locations consisting of cashier, front counter, cleanliness and maintenance, food prep, grill, sandwich making, etc."
good,Wendys will help getting their employees servsafe certified. Wendys tries to follow procedures for the most part. I am management material however I do not agree with most of the new beliefs that Wendys stands by. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to correct the crew members when they aren't doing their job correctly.
good,I loved to work at Wendys mainly because of the great people I got to meet an d work with. It was my first job and a great learning experience. they did all they could to help me and I am forever grateful because of that.
good,"Being able to think fast was the main job at Wendy's and having excellent customer service skills was stressed the most to us. I learned to handle ever situation even if I may not agreed with it, with a smile. No matter what position I work at I had to learn that my station must be neat, I must look neat and I must move the line so every customer is served. I became so advanced that I began to train new workers and allowing them to catch on fast. My co -workers always made work better because we were like a family, even hanging out outside of the work place making bonds. The hardest part was when it got real busy and you may have a line out the door and you trying to just keep calm and make sure everyone is properly served. The most enjoyable part about this job is being able to feel independent and help others."
good,Customer Service was the best part of the job. Very well ran company they set the standard for fast food restaurants. Learned to be an effective manager.
good,"i am a very fast learner i also have cashier experience "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing dining room services and communicating with the customers in a friendly and respectful manner. On this job, I learned about quality, cleaning procedures, and also doing things in an orderly way. The co-workers were very easy to get along with! Although the co-workers and management made time pass by faster than normal, thankfully there wasn't a part of the job that was hard for me. I was able to do everything to the best of my ability with no problem."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's included assisting customers, making sandwiches, and collecting money from customers. While working at Wendy's, I also assisted with the cleanliness of the store."
good,"At Wendy's a typical day at work is very productive. Most days would be very busy but we had a good crew so we handled it with no problem. It's also a fun working environment. Being employed at Wendy's taught me time management, people skills, and how to multitask. The hardest part of the job would be trying to prepare the food during rush hour and you have to prepare the food in a certain amount of time. I must say the most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's would be meeting new people; coworkers and customers."
good,"One of the managers was horrible. Overall you want get many hours, but its a okay place to work i guess. Only got a 15 cent raise in a year and 1/2."
good,Wendy's gave me a good start in customer service experience. I did more work than what they actually paid me. Overall learned good team work.
good,"this is a fast pace job, you learn a great deal to balance off multi-tasking and learn to give great customers service "
good,"The lunch rushes will sweat you, but being part of a team makes it tolerable. There is a lot of work involved for such a minimum wage job."
good,"It is a good place to start when you are trying to make money or just have a way to make a little money to save. It is a nice place and nice people to work with there."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would include set up and wait for the hunger people to pile in.  The hardest part of this job was cleaning the Frosty machines at night, well it's not so much hard as it is aggravating. The thing I enjoyed most about this job was when I became a Manager and I had my own crew members to look after."
good,Everything about Wendy's was fast pace. There were many people to manage but when everyone worked together it made things go a lot smoother.
good,productive workplace with good work place I count money do paper work I put my co worker in postion I greet customers I love to get to know people
good,"Working at Chuck E. Cheese's taught me patience. I was working there in high school and I started out as a Birthday Hostess. I was motivated to learn other positions in the store so I did. My manager was willing to train me and I was excited about learning. My co-workers where all fun to be around. We often met so we could see how we could make every child experience a better experience every time they came to Chuck E. Cheese's. The day I resign was the hardest thing I had to do. But overall, Chuck E. Cheese's was one of the best jobs I could ever had during my childhood."
good,All in all it is not a horrible place to work. It does make for a great first time job or a job for someone who is just looking for something to bring in income while in school. There were great days and then there were horrible days. It all really comes down to various factors such as what is happening in the store that day and who you are working with.
good,I love it. the worker was great I learn so much about people nothing was to hard. I love seeing the smiles on the guests face.
good,You will find a great people in your age if you just fresh out of college or in your 30s. It's a fun place with people from the business to creative side.
good,Everybody was a family their and worked as a team! The hardest part of my job is not getting enough hours. Put I loved all of m co-workers.
good,"There are several positions at Wendys and when you get hired they put you where they need you, and after that it's hard to move from there. Work was usually slow unless coupons were distributed via mail, so we were required to clean a lot in order to stay productive. Management was as expected, friendly but stern when need be."
good,"work days consisted of serving peoples all day."
good,Nice place to work. People are nice.  Customers are very pleasant.
good,not a bad place for a first job. it wasn't too fast paced and has very good training.
good,"I think that wendys was a decent job. It taught me a lot of core values in the work place. My manager really helped me stay on top of things so as I spent more time there, I was able to get things done faster on my own. That job really showed me what teamwork was about. Everyone helped each other and showed me how to work better in a unit. It also helped me alot with my customer service skills."
good,great customer service and training crew and mgrs and etc and running of store with great quality of food and service
good,Pleasantly greeting and taking costumers order for hours on end. i learn to be a good listener and how to handle stress.
good,A typical work day would consist of being face to face with people. I learned costumer courtesy and balancing your cash register. The management didn't really work together they would always seem to contradict each other. My co-workers always worked well with each other and always had a smile on there face. The hardest part of the job would be working in small areas and moving fast. The ability work with people everyday.
good,"Wendy's is a good starter job, You go in and you learn fast or you don't work out. On a good day, you leave feeling exhausted but good. On a bad day, you don't want to do anything but stew. The best part of the job is when the customers really show their appreciation, because we work our butts off."
good,"A typical day at the company was very routine and lacked new challenges. The goals day to day did not change much, which made it hard to be excited. However, it developed me into determine individual that is resilient."
good,nice people and place to work just to many workers not enough hours for me to be happy.
good,"Very busy every second of the day. I dealt with alot of customers and promoting new food products that have been released on the food menu. Our customers were loyal. There were no difficult moments, we always worked as a team to get whatever we needed done."
good,This is a great starter job for teenagers just starting life.
good,ok...just want a job i that i don't get board with. Looking for something that pay's more yearly.
good,I actually enjoyed working at Wendy's I just wish I had a more dedicated hard working team to achieve our store goals.
good,The working environment was decent as long as managers weren't breathing down your back. I did my best at all times sometimes going over the top. They work with you a little if you have a problem. I broke my finger and they gave me a hard time about it.
good,Customers would come into the restaurant for fast service and quickly prepared food. I learned the ins and outs of the Wendy's fast food service. The management wanted to make sure all customers and employees were treated fairly.
good,A typical day taking orders preparation collecting payment. learned patience is the key when dealing with unsure customers. Management was great. Co-workers where ok yet miserable. The hardest part was dealing with a worker that ddnt understand what was going on. Enjoyable about my job was everything.
good,"The environment to me at times is very unprofessional. I am not talking bout the customers I am talking about the people employed in it. I have been there for 5 years and the different type of management that I ran through out of all of the years is a bit hectic. I was offered to join their management team but thing are not organized or professional enough for my taste. I learned a lot of work ethic here, and also met life long friends."
good,If you have people skills or are wanting to learn people skills you'll never find a better place.
good,A typical day would be me going in at 11 and working til 5 or 6 or even later because other co-workers didn't want to come in.  I learned that smiling can cheer someone else up no matter if you're having a bad day at work. The management was okay but could better. My co-workers we're fun and outgoing and i had a great time with them. The hardest thing about the job was when i was in medical assistant school i missing some time in class because i couldn't get off work and missing time with my daughter. The most enjoyable job was the drive thru and dine in area. Customers had me laughing and having fun once you got to know them on a regular.
good,I would arrive at 6 p.m. and leave around 3 a.m.  I learned about food safety and quality control.  The mangers were quick to help or explain what was needed.  The coworkers knew to focus on their respective positions to ensure quality in rapid time.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the fryers at night and the most enjoyable part was the ability to continue learing Spainsh.
good,"Good people, learned a lot from my co workers and manager. I was a great experience."
good,A typical day at work is me coming in from 5 to clorse. A nice fun and loving environment.
good,"nice breaks, managers are nice and willing to work with schedules and help employees out"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's involves sanitizing and cleaning the stores equipment before starting the day. There were seven other employees  which I helped train that were all younger then me. I then put out all of the promotional displays and turn on the store lights. Through out the day I would be extremely approachable to anyone behind the counter, also using free samples as an incentive to new customers. Towards the end of the day, I would do a stock count of the store for all of the merchandise. Depending of the levels of the stock I would go to our store room and get what we needed but I would also quickly clean and organise the storeroom. After closing I would print off the receipts and do the float for tomorrows till . I'd finish off by washing all of the equipment and trays we used during the day, ending with a mop of all the floors ."
good,Its a learning place for people.It is a fast pace job. You had to be quick with what ever came at you. co workers were okay working with each others.
good,"Apprentissage de la langue dans un Fast Food avec un management made in USA."
good,"Working at wendys as a crew member growing into a manager has taught me alot, i have learned so much and so many people. Managing a crew was tough at times but made me feel proud knowing that i can really help improve the business, helping costumers with there issues and made me feel proud. The hardest thing about working there was that sometimes the employees and the costumers were not always on balance, and i feared for my safety. The area was not the best which is the reason why i resigned from the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i could help people and i was a positive image and i played a leadership role in a growing organization."
good,Working at wendys tends to boil your patience level.Managers are very unorganized
good,A typical day at work was hard work. Always moving and very fast-paced. I learned that the customers are always right. I learned that some managers are lazy. Management was good and kept on the workers to help them become better at their job. Management compliments the workers when they're staying on task and moving fast. Co-workers were grumpy sometimes and could be bossy to other workers. The hardest part of the job was closing. I would be at work until almost 2am when I closed. Night shifts were the most enjoyable and opening shifts were the easiest.
good,a typical day was run the drive thru window make the orders keep the dinning room and restrooms clean.
good,"i worked for this company as a crew member, i did prep work, grill, fries, customer service, cleaned, made sandwiches."
good,service customer. Read an make orders. Prep and clean for next shift.
good,"Wendy's takes pride in having and serving a quality product with excellent customer service served along with it. Their philosophy is a valuable one... ""Just Be Nice""."
good,"A typical work dat at wendys is very energetic. As soon as you walk through the door you're already working. But the work that is given is very simple and easy to learn. Working at wendy i learned how to be more organized while working and how to keep up working in a fast paced environment. The managers were very friendly,helpful, and very understanding. The hardest part of the job while working at wendys was working the drive-thru. The enjoyable part about working at wendys was reacting with the customers and me and my co-workers getting along working as a team so that the day would go by smooth."
good,"Cashier was my main job to ring people up, prep some food, deliver food, c;lean, trays, stocking and managing the dining area."
good,"Wendy's is a good job. I just feel that the company doesn't treat their good employees the way they should. Co-workers are great and management is also very good. I enjoy all the people I work with and I love working with customers. This job has taught me many things such as how to manage time, how to be a leader, how to handle money and how to handle tough/high stress situations."
good,"handle cash, clean tables, assist customer, help out with other areas of work"
good,"The typical work day was fast pace, and demanding at times. There was allot of preparations for the work day and during. The management was okay. The co-workers complained allot and often put the work load on poeple who they notice that go above and beyond on the job. The hardest part of the job was carrying the load of work for people who work too slow. I don't think there was anything enjoyable about the job. I learned how to do front line operation duties and supervise and train new employees."
good,It was a great fun environment but there was no benefits until you hit like 10000 hours after being hired. So it took forever to get benefits.
good,"Since the economic downturn, cutbacks in management support and decreased hourly guidelines made my position requirements extremely difficult to maintain at my acceptable performance. The requirements of Wendy's International and the franchise owner were incompatible to a fair and fulfilling career."
good,wendeys was one of my first jobs it was an experience and it showed me how to balance work school and parent hood the mangement was ok but my over all experience was good.
good,"Normally we are all working as a team and getting what we need done by satisfying our customers. I've learned a lot about the business, the employees, customers, and managers. I've learnd that Wendy's takes their business very seriously ad we take reallygood care of our customers. The management is great, all the managers are friendly and polite. My co-workers are great I love them all dearly as if they were my own family members we all work hard. The hardest part of the job would be us getting a little furstrated to get the time down in the drive-thru however we all manage to get through the process and get the job accomplished. The most enjoyable part is when we all can just relax, talk and laugh about the kind of day we've had."
good,"A typical day at work was to go to the freezer and make sure it was stocked completely. breaking down the breakfast grill, and clean it. Most of all make sure that the customers food was mad to perfection. I learned that the quality of the food must be good so that my job could have the best rating. I learned to insure the customer was always right. My managers were not bad people, and the co-workers where very nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was of course making sure that all customers where satisfied. It was an overall pretty good experience."
good,I sometimes recognize customers voices and can sometimes finish their orders. The hardest part of my job is working harder than managers
good,Work here was fast pace and intense. But it is a place where involvement with the public is a must and i loveworking with the public
good,I enjoyed working at wendys I met allot of great people I was a cashier so I was dealing with customers all day and it was my job to make them smile and have a great experiance and to me it was a blast.
good,wendys has a great manager training program but as far as advancing with the minnesota franchise there is no advancement unless you know the right person or you are family or freind.
good,"respectful employees, fast pace and learning environment, customers become regulars, persistant and patients, helful managers, constant cleaning and stocking"
good,"Had fun working here, co-workers were interesting. Always something to do and never a dull moment. Customers were nasty at time but could also be the most friendly people ever."
good,I was promised a higher wage as I am a high school student looking to make money before college with the help of a slight wage boost. Never got in return and am now looking for a change.
good,The only thing I really had problems with with some of the coworkers. The management was great.! Very flexible schedules. Just some people care about more than others.
good,"Management is great here we have some of the best managers I’ve worked for in the fast food industry. I would recommend if your looking to work with a family and have goody moments, this is the place to come."
good,I work at wendys because i need a job. But i need a better job to have a better living. I need full time 40 hours a week. Plus alot closer to home i dont have a vehicle so have to relly on rides and bus. This job is litterly 15 minutes from home.
good,You get learn more and people treat you well. It's a ok place to work at in my opinion. You have be flexible when it comes to schedules and you can get tired of smelling the food but it's cool.
good,Working at Wendy's taught me how to work with people and get along well with them. It taught me how much I actually like working with people. There are days that are harder than others but for the most part the crew is nice and always willing to help you.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I loved my coworkers, they were very welcoming and kind. Always offered to help when needed. Management was very stern but also compassionate when needed and flexible with hours"
good,I really dont like working here at Wendy's.  But it oays the bills. Some of my co workers have good teamwork. An they work u like a dog an dont appreciate you or your work. I will really be blessed if i can just find something else better. My personality is too great for their rudeness.
good,"Typical work days, my wendys was always short-staffed and most of us were always unhappy because all our customers were rude and angry most the time and just trying to cope with the facts that no customer actually cares about you and working the long night shifts that just feel like it never ends with the waves of cars of people who need tons of food"
good,Wendys is a great company to work at depending in the store your place in the environment is completely different everywhere. Personal experience i didn't get any benefits whats so ever but it was a great experienced I learned a-lot but the pay needs to be better.
good,"This was years ago, but I remember mostly the good times. There were some rough moments with not great co-workers and bad customers, and by the end of my time there I was definitely ready to leave, but overall it was a good experience for me personally. The managers tend to be kind of manipulative though."
good,"Wendy's wasmy 1st job. I was there for almost 2 years. My GM told me once I graduated high school she would make me a crew leader, which never happen so I looked for a new job and got one where I was making more money so I left."
good,"Fast pasted work environment, with good work hours. Nice coworkers, good training and management. The store is very clean and the food is good. The managers also make sure you are trained well and you have help at any time"
good,Its okay to work here if you have lots of time to work many hours. Not much of a work life balance but if looking for hours make sure your working at a busy location it's a fairly an easy job.
good,"Wendys was a very safe and fun environment to work in. With so many different positions, there's opportunity to expand you learning capacities. and the managers are great too."
good,"Need to be able to learn fast, work fast, and act fast. No laying around, do your job. Be determined to get your stuff done. Will be able to relax at times."
good,A good place to gain customer experience and as a first job it is really not that bad. Easy to gain knowledge and it is not that hard to start working and gain experience. You will learn a lot working here.
good,"WIth decent worklife balance and generally managment trying to do whats right and works out to the best potential, i'd loved to have worked here longer but the pay was horrible."
good,"For me personally the Wendys I worked at was not a very good place especially since there needs to be a lot of communication for everything to go smoothly, the sandwich preparation crew just sat in the back and talked and when they actually made sandwiches they were all wrong; to make it worse only the cashiers and people on kiosk would get lectured. Favoritism at its finest"
good,Bi weekly kinds sucks but teaches you money management  and can also make you more of a team player every one has a certain job and when it's done well every thing  will Turn out great
good,Good work place. Its not the company its the people they hire. They was not willing to work they came to work to play and argue. The company should give discounts the days you not working as well like 10% off.
good,"This isn't meant to be a long term job. Unless you are manager, you're going to make minimum wage. My manager was awesome and very understanding. She is still there."
good,"They would over work the best workers. People would skate by on breaking the rules, but if others breathed the wrong way they got reprimanded. ALSO YOU MIGHT GET STUCK THERE."
good,"In the mornings, before the store opens, I have to make sure all the tables are wiped down and clean. Clean the windows, bring in mats, stock the condiment stand. Make sure everything is stocked. The hardest part of my job is making sure (whoever is on front counter) is doing their part too. My most enjoyable part is knowing I made my customers happy."
good,"One of the best places to work at in the fast food industry very sophisticated menu, proper training and always supported by management they really do want you to succeed and grow with the company"
good,"It was my first actual job as a teenager, It was really a good experience. Learned to work with different people and it was fast paced. Hardest part was just different management and not having no benefits."
good,Its a good a job if you're single. It pays well and has great benefits. As I stated I have a family which I would love to have more time with and can't because of the way schedule is done.
good,"Worked Part Time while I was in school"
good,this was a great first place to work for me. I wouldn't recommend staying past high school there are way better opportunities out there. managers are mostly awesome
good,This was my first job and i worked here for four years. Honestly i worked here for way to long and should have left way earlier. I quit because i worked way to often and got paid minimum wage 7.25 for about three of those years with no raise and had to ask for one. When i got a raise finally after three years i only got 7.56 so i had to leave.
good,My time at Wendy's helped me improve my situation. Allowed me to learn and grow. I will always be appreciative of that. My work ethic was appreciated and rewarded.
good,It was ok . There where some nice people that would help you out . But there where also the ones that just sat on there phones . I thought cashier was and ok job though
good,It takes alot and u must be a fast learner. Also since of urgency  is a must! Fast  environment  busy and keeps u on ur toes. Be able to learn something new each day  u work.
good,I really liked working there at first but then after a while you realize that they’re making you do all the hard thing and the managers just pass out food and we still get paid less!!
good,It’s a good place to work just I need more money for college. I work part time there I go to college in the morning and I want to work night shift for the mean time.
good,"The Wendys I worked at is full of fun co workers, even the managers are amazing and the owner! I loved that place, but their pay is just minimum wage."
good,Fast paces environments and a bit stressful but overall it’s a good place to start working if you never work before because you learn how to move quickly and get things done fast.
good,Typical day is to make sure that the store is ready to serve guests by the time that we unlock doors. To make sure that every team member is rush ready in their positions to have a fun and fast paced lunch rush. After lunch we resotck stations and clean up own areas. I make sure that everyone is getting this done
good,"Depending on shift can work long hours, unaided. I had plenty of interaction with mentoring bosses to teach me skills I previously struggled with. It was great mentoring younger people and seeing them advance their lives."
good,"Easy for high school students, fast paced, a lot of friendly managers, free food for days that you worked, flexible scheduling, day shift or night shift"
good,"In Wendys the crew treated each other like family when it came to getting our work done. We made sure we could all agree on things and made the best of our work place. If anybody asked me what did I love more about this job ,I would say the teamwork. One thing I disliked was that sometimes it would get out of hand and even though we had good managers other managers would start drama and discuss their coworkers businesses; Also managers treated some crew members better than others. Another thing I disliked was that the place was a bit unsanitary."
good,i feel like wendy’s is a great job to start out with. you’re always busy and will have something to do. i feel like wendy’s is shaped me into the hard working women i am today.
good,"Fast food not much to say just a temp job during school entry level nothing major, minimum wage don’t expect a lot of money being made................"
good,"I'm treated well and it's easy to develop a routine. Fast-food is just gross and stressful work in my opinion, but Wendy's would be among the least gross and stressful."
good,I've worked fast food in the past and Wendy's is by far the better work place (personally) to work at. The company is overall a good part time job. I feel the management I worked for needed to be checked big time but you expect it in fast food.
good,It laid back cool learning how to get close to people they are clean they pay good l love there hours  we get good discount on food learn to move fast past
good,"We as a team do super well, although due to new recent developments of people who have been hired and are getting paid $9.50 while I’m getting paid $8.75 and still haven’t received my 6 month raise, I have decided that the management is slow and I’m not getting treated fairly."
good,My review for Wendys is that i will never work there again for reasons i do not want to state. Some of the team members were nice and good to talk to and work with.
good,"Good Place to work if you can handle the fast pace of the place. But definitely made the time fly by as you stayed busy. Good Training, good benefits, low wages."
good,"Got many hours but upper management not very understanding, not sure why I'm being forced to write a very long review, shift leaders all play no work yay"
good,The management was very unorganized and made me work illegal hours as a minor. The team was full of great staff and I learned very useful skills to continue in life
good,"This job is a good job for high-school students, or just a regular part-time job. Wendy's was my first job, they really helped introduce me to the real world."
good,Working at Wendy’s really gives you an opportunity to socialize more than other jobs considering you have to be able to communicate with customers. You also have to have good communication skills to be able to communicate with coworkers and customers.
good,Typical day for me was very easy.  Once I had been trained in the responsibilities of the job it was easy.  I did the same things every day I worked.  My supervisor was great.  The person I interviewed with was great.  Keep in mind - I worked there almost 30 years ago.
good,Overall Wendy’s isn’t that bad I just think it’s time for a next step now that I’m 18. And another part of why I would like to be apart of this team is because fast food isn’t something I want to do now that I’m legal.
good,"I overall lived my job but as a wife and parent, it was hard on my family. The working hours sucked as a manager. Cause it was always changing and you couldn't really plan anything unless you had to request it off."
good,"Not many hours are given per week, but easy to learn multiple positions & is a fun job to work at. "
good,"Management was good. Hours were fine. They were flexible. Sadly, the other Wendy's burnt down and doubled the employees. This created a lack of hours."
good,My job as a manager was to help with any of the customers needs and also help train the new employees and current employees. I also did paperwork throughout the day and counted money and made sure everything was in order
good,"The management is easy to work with."
good,"I overall enjoy working here I am looking forward to being in the medical field. The pay was competitive but was not enough to provide for myself and my two daughters,"
good,"Busy, always on your feet, although the people are nice, poorly managed and understaffed. A decent starter job but i wouldn't stay for longer than a couple months"
good,great place to work with friendly people. flexible with their hours and treats their employees right. fast pace job that teaches many different responsibilities.
good,"While I worked there, I was trained to run every position and would sometimes have to cover two positions. While I regret that oftentimes I would have to do more than one task at the same time to get speedy times in the drive-thru, it would have been bearable had my coworkers been trained better. Regardless, the company itself is not a problem to work in and could actually be very fun."
good,Very relaxed place to work. Nobody is going to get too mad if you mess something up because most people working there have no prior work experience anyway.
good,I had my ups and downs at Wendy’s. The management tended to show favoritism towards members of the crew.  At times was poorly manage but always on point when it came to service. Really lived up to the name of keep food fresh. I had the honor of being a cashier in the dining room and the drive through
good,its a nice job . no complaints..i mean its fast food...it is what it is ..nice management.friendly co workers .easy work . training is fast n easy . good for a student or a retired person.
good,"Very clean , nice co workers ,fast pace job. Has manger training .working as a team ,working 4 days out the week .didn't seem to get bills paid .so seeking another job offer"
good,"I did not care for some of the managers at the store, however, I always worked with a smile and did whatever needed to be done. I liked the pace of work and my coworkers"
good,"A typical day at Wendys is a busy line with about 8 or so staff members working quick and efficiently to feed our customers. Staff is easy to bond with, and management is professional."
good,"Maintained sanitation, health and safety standards in the work area"
good,This was a great job to fill in time till I found something else.  Made decent money.  They need to change up management there to make the same rules for everyone
good,"just a stopping point"
good,"Beginning work with Wendy's, was indeed an experience. From being spotted walking to work to the process of getting to know my team. I had a descent experience working with the company, but everything has a time and season. I would recommend workers to join the Wendy's team as long as capable to work in a fast-paced business."
good,"While I was there I was treated good, although the management was poor, it was a learning experience. It advanced my mind, in money and communication. I would recommend this job to first timers."
good,over all good company but they need  to improve the store standards and quality of the food   and they have late hours till 2am which is not good  for just approx$200 last hour
good,Wendy's is a great place to work if you have the right management. It was a great job and made a lot of friends. Very little drama. The management just sucked.
good,The manager didn’t care about anyone. Just herself she was a rude boss. Never can take blame. She would treat people lower than her. Always in a bad mood.
good,"There was always something to keep you busy. It’s a great job for a teenager, to teach them how to work to make they’re own money. They gave free lunches. I actually liked it."
good,"I learned how to deal with different types of costumers, how to cook, and how to manage doing dofferent stuffs at once.  Sometimes it was boring, while others it was actually fun. The managers are always nice and tend to help with what they can"
good,A typical day at work was either really busy or very boring. I learned a lot of how to deal with rude customers and how to do my task under pressure. The culture is elderly and middle aged. Not too many young people come in there. Hardest part of the job was to deal with the customers that were rude or had to deal with things going wrong in a high pressure enviroment.
good,Cooking food to order while taking orders and handling cash/card transactions at the register. Maintain a clean organized work space. Wash dishes and keep station stocked. Remove any garbage from workspace. Pretty straight forward job you just need a keen eye for attention to detail and be able to work in a fast paced environment.
good,It was never a dull day at work. You come across so many personalities in a short time span. If your not get with people this definitely is not the job for you. Although the pay should be higher the experience was wonderful.
good,"Working at Wendy's it is a very busy job. It is a good job,it is for younger adults,but I would like more for myself"
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was the fact that mostly everyone I worked with were nice people with good communication skills. The hardest part was how stressful it can get when large orders come through and you have a very small amount of time to get everything together while also retaining the quality of the order.
good,U never get a raise and seems ure working for free. I like making sandwiches and i like helping people u dnt get no fre lunch witch i think u should...
good,"Was overwhelmed with the graveyard yard shift.  Thought I was underpaid to be on multiple positions at one time. Didnt get much of a break or lunch for a long working shift. Had to carry heavy material, keep in mind I'm only 100 lbs. at the most. The job was very demanding and didn't pay well."
good,Working at Wendy's was always exciting and fun. I made so many friends working there and the job wasn't too hard and not too boring. I would recommend that everyone tries working in fast food at least once in their lifetime.
good,"When I first started working here, I loved it without a doubt. When new management came into the picture the store just slowly started going down heel."
good,"While at Wendy's i learned how to become a strong team leader! The focus was on team building , great customer service and quality  control. Making sure that we served the best product around. During my time at wendys we really focused on speed of service! Ive learned so many great things from this company."
good,"A typical day while working at Wendy's was very busy. Management wasn't the best, but they were there whenever you needed help. The hardest part about the job is working the long hours whenever somebody wouldn't show up for a shift. I remember working 16 hours once while i was still in high school."
good,"I love working here, but it's an entry level job, not something to look at as a career. Good people, good work. You learn a lot on the job, such as cashier, working in pick up window, coordinating, cleaning, properly handling situations, and making the food"
good,Lots of hard work small compensation. Enjoyed working with the public and fellow employees. Enjoyed learning Spanish from co-workers. No benefits. Hard to plan around schedule.
good,"Hated to have to quit, but understood why completely. It was a nice atmosphere though and the other workers for the most part got along and worked well together."
good,"When I had worked at Wendy's in Hayes, Virginia I was one of the Cashier's. My main job/expectation was to serve to customers meaning I took their orders, received their money, and gave them their food."
good,I mean it's a great job for a high school student but I'm trying to do something with my life and that's just not what I'm looking for in all honesty.
good,employees were upbeat coming into work was always fun but there was not enough employees working so all of us were working harder than we should’ve had to. manager was paying new hires 8.50 while I was being paid 7.75 after working there for 8 months.
good,I enjoy wendys very much they are like my second family Nd we have eachother back and teamwork makes the dream work every time and I learned something much and interpreting a lot of knowledge
good,Like every other fast food restaurant the pay does not coordinate with everything you have to deal with but all and all it was a good learning experience
good,"You have to learn quickly on your feet, both physically and mentally. It gets repetitive and monotone after a certain time, if that's what you're looking for. The people are nice and like to work as a team, but at the same time you are responsible for your own station and are kind of thrown in the deep end."
good,"I am just filling space here, it was 20 years ago.  I still at Wendy's they still cannot  figure out how to do breakfast well."
good,This job helped me as I went to school and after being promoted to shift manager I wanted something more out of life and I tried to advance my career.
good,It was a fun job everybody was usually positive and laid back. The mamagers were great very strict on schedule but never in your face angry. Very patient and understanding.
good,"Wendy’s is a good place to work. The managers at the restaurant are friendly and will help you with whatever you need help with , if the store is not already busy."
good,"Coming in each day consisted of prepping station with essential ingredients. Cleaning during and at the end of the shift was essential to. Opening and closing the restaurant was easy,."
good,"Wendy's is still very much about Dave's morals for quality and efficiency. If a customer wasn't absolutely pleased, we gave them a free frosty, and a refund if needed."
good,it was OK i guess like it was just a summer job for me to earn money and so i don't think all this is necessary but it was required for some reason  .
good,Wendys was a great place to work.  I learned valuable lessons that I will be able to apply both personally and professionally for the rest of my life.  I met and worked and befriended so many wonderful people in my 12 years with them.   towards the end it was there was just too much tension between different people and I simply didnt want to be apart of it any longer.  im thankful for my time there
good,The overall atmosphere was friendly. The customers were regulars that have a consistent routine. Majority of the managers were understanding. The rest of the crew was upbeat and fast moving. An average day in the work place was basically fun and productive.
good,"Good working environment management needs to keep track of employees better I got blamed for something another employee did "
good,The job is ok if if your first job  they hire alot depending on the area and they're chill somewhat. Your going to get customers that are rude and angry but that's at alot if jobs ust have to stay calm and learn from your mistakes.
good,"A typical day on the job would be stressful, mostly being short staffed, everyone was for themselves no one would help each other."
good,Wendys was my first job. It was a fast paste working environment with it being fast food. Working at Wendys was great I met a lot a nice and trustworthy people.
good,"A typical day at wendys for me would be fast paced and always multitasking back and forth to dishwashing, stocking and cashiering . There i learned how to handle cash and a cash register efficiently. At Wendy's management was excellent and very understanding cause they were just as busy as the basic Employee as far as multitasking. The hardest part of being a employee at wendy's is rush hour when  lines are backed up around lunch time where that would cause difficulty to multi task. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and the way they would treat you with kindness."
good,"Been working hear for about 3 months now and it is not the best job for me because the payment is very low so yea"
good,Wendy's was a great job for me in high school. I learned new skills and was able to have a flexible schedule. I was not designated to one specific area. I was able to float and learn many aspects of food preparation and customer service.
good,The place is not bad to work at all but it has it's days just like any other job.. people come and go some don't wanna work.. others will be very hard and helpful workers
good,"You're never bored"
good,"It needs to be said that this is a fast food job. Food service will always feel like a thankless job. That being said, I did enjoy working for Wendy's. The company itself was an easy one to be associated with. I liked the fact that I came in every day and worked with a team. It was easy to learn on the job and gain work experience. I found that the people I worked with were funny, outgoing, and enjoyable to work with."
good,Introduced to experienced management was a helpful asset to understanding the basic principles of management. In this field you learn how to multitask and complete assignments before the deadline.
good,It could be a very relaxed and fun place to work and instantly turn very stressful as soon as a rush would hit. Hours are also very flexible so it is a good job if you have kids or are going to school.
good,Working at Wendy’s was a pretty reliable job for me! I was just looking for part time and it was great being there they were very flexible and nice! Great hiring process!
good,"Depending on the management, the work environment could be very cohesive and almost seamless, the job can be very rewarding as you meet personal and collective goals."
good,"There was really never any guaranteed position. One day you're on cash register and the next you're either on sandwich station, fry station, or PUW. Management was okay at best. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace."
good,hours were not good and the work was fast. getting paid every 2 weeks and working slow hours was a problem for me there. i was seeing about 200 something sometimes every pay period.
good,"A fun environment to work, with great managers. I have learned the entire menu, and there is no hardest part of the job. I left the company family friendly."
good,"I worked at Wendy's for over three months with no call-outs and taking extra shifts, I then call out for 2 days because I was throwing up and get my hours cut to 8 hours a week, which does not pay any kind of bills what so ever."
good,"friendly environment with helpful staff and clean environment. If they could have offered more hours/days to me I would have stayed, but they couldn't and I travelld a ways to be there each shift."
good,Wendy's is a fun fast paced environment that the customers can make even better. never a dull moment working there. The people that you meet make the job very rewarding.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the other employees there. They were very friendly and laid back. When I started working here, I had no working experience so they taught me everything I had to know."
good,"All of the managers I have worked with are all very unprofessional. The main two are exactly opposite. The general manager completes every task, is very clean but has legitimate mental issues that make it hard for her and everyone else to carry out tasks. The other manager is very nice and caring but likes to close earlier and not follow requirements. The employees are great people and I enjoy working there but the management ruins it for me. I was offered a position as a crew leader or manager but will not take it up as I’d like to leave fast food."
good,Loved working there . Had a lot of people and good friends completely new and different environment and great staff to work with. Good management and soperviers
good,I honestly wouldn’t mind going back to Wendys because it wasn’t a bad place. It was just the manager there treating me bad out of all of the other employees.
good,You are induced into a greasy environment that makes your whole body hurt. add in the convenience of just buying lunch from work you are setting yourself up to be sorry. Need to work hard for minimum wage while others get away with doing less and yelling at management positions. Although lots of the coworkers were great the whole place was slowly falling through the wires.
good,"The days would be determined by the customers but mostly they were good. Managment was great, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,The management was to work 52 hours a week on a rotating schedule. The crew and management worked side by side to give the best customer service possible.
good,"It was fine to work there. I did not mind working there. I would go into work before we opened, made sure everything was stocked up before we opened. Management was o.k. they would work with you."
good,This place will always hold a place in my heart.Started at 16 worked there on and off a long time.Met people who truly became family and friends.Was stressful a lot of the time and so staffing issues happened a lot.Changed ownership many times and management.Things had gone downhill and just ended up stressful and not the direction I wanted to be.Will always be grateful for a job there.
good,"Its a great job for kids and retired individuals. I enjoyed working here, but we had to merge locations due to corporate and the new GM didn't want to bring on any of the old crew. I had to leave but I wasn't intending to do so."
good,"Sometimes the day was doing fine until some managers would get too pushy and demanded too much to specific. Management was good, favoritism was a big thing while working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting able to make salads."
good,"It's everything you'd assume of a fast food job. Good start up place to work, hard to make a decent living. Wouldn't recommend this place as far as a career."
good,"I worked at Wendy's as a high school job. It was pretty relaxed on some days which on those days I could quiz myself through the day and study , while other days were long and sped up and I had little to no time. On average you can maintain a household if your full time with a side job. But where's the quality time you get with your family?"
good,"A typical day at work requires a lot of movement and focus. A lot of multi-tasking has to be done. I have learned so much about handling situations. Many of the shift leaders call me their little manager because if at any time that they are busy, I could handle any situation from either the crew of a customer in a managerial way. The hardest part of the job was when we would run out of product because of the customers response. It was always fine though because if you stay positive and reassure them of our substitutions, it was always okay."
good,a typical day at work was caching out customers and putting meals together if it wasn't too busy. Otherwise periodically I had to go out in the lobby and clean tables. Then stock the condiments and napkins and silverware.
good,"I enjoyed the work I did there, and I liked the people I worked with. The managers were very understanding and accommodating as far as schedule issues."
good,It was a good experience..i enjoyed working there with my co-workers..we had many ups and a few downs..i miss them over there..but most of all im gonna miss my regular customers
good,Wendy's workers are all hard working and fun to work with. Also as a team work perfectly and is always looking to find a way to help you. Management could use some revisions however I am sad to leave such a fun workplace culture.
good,I enjoy this job very much. I am always order taking or a cashier in drive thru and I love having that little interaction with the customers. I'm also a very good cash handler.
good,"It's a fast food job. There isn't a lot to add. The pay was only just above minimum, there really wasn't room to advance, it is more a transitional job than anything else."
good,I had great managers who looked out for their employees and enjoyed the people I worked with... Job was minimum wage and part time so nothing that stands out.
good,"It took me 6 months to get this job and I would say it was worth the wait because It trains to the capacity where you can become great. And you can start off with the least amount and about 3-4 months, you can have the most hours out of everyone except the managers."
good,It was an great experience working for Wendy's. My coworkers were wonderful and the manager that was there was more the helpful and always made sure everyone was comfortable and doing there job as it was to be done. I'd like to thank Wendy's for giving me such a great work experience and chance to succeed in life.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the customers. "
good,I personally did not enjoy working for Wendy's just because the high paced work environment was not ideal for me. If you are willing to work for speed and quantity then this is a good place for you.
good,"management was alright for the most part, the new district manager made sure his family could work there. i enjoyed the fast pace and made some good friends there. high turnover, good food, strict on cleanliness, which to me was a good thing when working in the food industry"
good,"Depending on the hours, sometimes working days were really slow and then were fast pace during lunch hours. You had to clean in between as well as adapting to different positions if there was a lack of employees present."
good,"Easy you just have to have a nice hard working crew and the job could get done fast its all what you and your crew out forth I recommend this job to anybody, I just feel as thoe the pay should be more."
good,"I make sandwiches and keep sandwich area clean. I make fresh salads and prep vegetables, and cut and clean vegetables. I also grill the meat and fry the chicken. I take out trash and keep the place smelling fresh"
good,"come in set the work area up, learn got to be arlert at all times, mangement is alright just follow the rules getting the orders out fast, when work is slow everybody talks and laugh have a little fun."
good,Great Employees up fast in varmint horrible smell safe area Lazy boss low discount Short staff  slippery floors clean environment large bathroom  there’s always something to keep busy
good,"Fast paced environment, friendly customers. Good benefits, could use better management, and it was overall a good experience to work there. I would recommend a friend to work there if theywouldnt mind."
good,"Wendy's has started having to many cut back, that affect the employees, who are the main people keeping the stores running. Needs to pay lower management like my self and the crew more money for the jobs we do."
good,If it's your first job and your still in school it's a great first job. I however need something a little more substantial.  At the end of the day it is fast food.
good,I took the orders and made the drinks. took the money from the costumer and gave them their food in a time;y manner. most of the managers could have helped out more but never did.
good,Good if you still in high school bad if your out high school can't deal w minimum wage and you get free food which is always good and a plus to help out
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's can be some days stressful, friendly, and busy. We are never slow, we always have a lot of customers. I learned that working together will get the job done faster."
good,"Great place to work. Not a lot of money. If you're looking for somewhere we are going to fit in, laugh, I have great customers and enjoy your job but make a little to nothing as far as financially then this is the place for you. Unfortunately I do have a family that I must take care of in the pay was so low I could not bear to work there anymore. But for teenagers just starting off  part time, or even full-time job here would be sufficient I suppose."
good,In Colorado for a first time job it was alright. I liked everybody I worked with . We always had fun but got our jobs done. Night shifts were exciting when we didn't have that many customers. We always left around 2;00am
good,"It was good pace to work for my first job, management is respectful and motivating, the job is fairly easy, you meet a lot of interesting people. There is room for advancement"
good,"Wendy's has a great menu if your in the mood for fast food. Customer service, cashier, expediting orders, restocking and, general restaurant level cleaning conclude a normal days fulfillment's.  Learned every position through rotating training regime. Hardest part of job was anticipating fluctuating customer flow to  food preparation demand with an eye toward controlling waste. Good people and, good, fast food the best aspect of the job."
good,"It was a decent place for a first job, pay was low and work was physically demanding at times but had a lot of really good managers who did a good job of keeping the crew motivated"
good,It was an 8 hour day. Usually cashier work or working tables. Making food or cleaning up. I enjoyed the other employees and management was reasonable. Working with a variety of customers was also enjoyable.
good,"The work was decent, not extremely hard when you get through training, it is a fast food restaurant keep in mind. The customers are usually understanding in training but I only left because of the lack of hours."
good,"Wendy's has been a integral part of my life for the past two years. If you work hard in this company you will be given management positions, as I was offered to and gladly accepted a shift supervisor position after just 13 months in the company. However the environment can sometimes be successful, as call outs or late comings can result in the back up of cars in the drive-thru line and customers out the door. Other than that, the people I work with care for one another, and it seems like there's a family waiting for me every time I go into the store."
good,Hard to understand. Everybody was nice and easy to work with but too much work and very little training. The managers just kind of threw you in and said show me you can do it.
good,"The staff is very respectful, the supervisor is fair and the business hours r flexible.  Personally as a maintenance technician the job is pretty sweet."
good,"Store manager was rude and disrespectful to my student schedule. Schedule was often constantly changed and many of my shift were short handed. When we were short handed, I had to switch between fry station and front counter often, even during busy times. They tell you to put the customer first, but only when it's convenient for the manager."
good,A typical day at work consisted of prepping the salads and condiments for the day and night shift.The mangament team was very helpful and stepped in whenever needed.
good,"its fast paced"
good,"Most higher ranking staff members made the job fun, but the atmosphere isn't great. You have to have ALOT of patience for people and cleaning. Fast food is pretty nerve wracking at times, but you get used to it."
good,a typical day listen to someone take thier order while you get the food together before you take thier money and give them their food. the hardest is having a line rapidlyaround the building you haven't had a break all day or ate..
good,I liked most of my coworkers but I also worked here for three years. The management wasn't so good at times.  People got away with a lot of stuff they shouldn't have like ALOT. My first general manager was my favorite most understanding manager.
good,i enjoyed my time at Wendy's. I developed a lot of skills there. i felt that the employees that worked hard and did their job well was always over looked and never giving an opportunity to advance.
good,Working at Wendys was ok & very fast paced. I wish we would have gotten paid more due to the stressful working conditions that we had to maintain and work in.
good,"If you are looking for a good first job, working Fast Food is a great place to start. It was easy and fun work, but there was no chance of advancement and the pay was below what I believe I am qualified for."
good,"Excellent place to work good environment,good crew members and awesome customers.Would reccomend to anyone who needs a good laid back kind of job,where you can work and enjoy working at that."
good,"Worked here for a summer and the managers are all really nice, communicate well, and get the job done."
good,"Management should try to have new associates shadow an old associate so they can pick up daily routines quickly as compared to just a ""Tell and Do"" policy."
good,"Would bounce around the kitchen making various foods and drinks. "
good,"It wasn't a bad job, I like Wendy's overall.  There was room for raises/advancement and pretty easy training.  My issues were with management....just terrible.  Misguided, no soft skills, unprofessional, and basically the reason for most people leaving."
good,I have fun and work with great co workers-staff. At this point in my life finding Wendy's has helped me and my family out a lot. I'm grateful for everything that the company has been able to do for me and my family.
good,"A fun place to work, and learn all about customer service. It just lacked a good upper manager and decision maker. There were a lot of things going on that shouldn't have been, and if the right manager was there it would have been easier to work and not stress over everyone else not doing their jobs"
good,"This place is a great place to start going to work if you are looking for your first job. You get taught many new thing such as customer service, team work, and how to keep moving at a fast pace."
good,"Preparing the restaurant briefing the Staff ,"
good,"I loved my job, I worked there for three years but never really got a raise. My co-workers were like family. I miss my location, tried working at another location and the management was a mess. I'll never work at another Wendy's again."
good,"Be able to work with all kinds of people. Its a fast past job, get to meet and greet a lot of customers. You must have a friendly do to you interact with people."
good,"They help as much as they could with money but the job did not pay enough versus the work, They needed and expected out of each employer. Enjoyed the relationship with my coworkers and supervisor"
good,Reliable gob more long term. Reasonable raise rates. Good hour avalativity for part time or full time positions . Good food and  quality as well as production paces.
good,Wendy's is a a great place to work. Although it can be very stressful at times. But this fast-pace business will make your work day past in no time.  Patience and a smile is the key.
good,Fun place to work but has a lot of confusion that goes on at the job lots of gossiping between the employees and Managers other than that it's a great opportunity for a first job.
good,"Well for first time workers this could be the pace for you. Yes it can be stressful and overwhelming, but when your shift is over your done for the day."
good,"good place to work when you are young! easy to make friends etc. it is very fast paced but there are still ti,es to enjoy your time there with your coworkers"
good,"Wendy's was a fast paced work place. Wendy's was not paying me much, Managers were nice an understanding, Unfortunately it was very unorganized. i Would not consider working there again."
good,Loved working here it was my first fast food job loved the general manager one of the shift managers is the reason I left she showed favoritism hours got cut for no reason check was never rite
good,"I've worked for Wendy's for almost 2 years. I've been at 4 different Wendy's so not all my experiences are the same. I've found out if you work hard that you can get promoted real fast, which is definitely a benefit. I hated being a crew member but do love being  a manager. I love running a team and love the benefits such as vacation time, sick time, and insurance. Wendy's is a great place to work if you are trying to be a manager but a little bit harder if your'e a crew."
good,"i loved working at Wendy's but as much as i did there was no communication! the management was poor but i still made it work, overall good experience."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Wendy's was the customers, and the crew workers.....the hardest part of the job was coming to work when not paid"
good,I love working at wendy's . they have benefits and insurance they also have raises and bounces . . you also have a good chance of moving up in the company  .
good,"great company to work for, learning they various menu is pretty easy to being face to face with customers or being on the headset through drive thru it wad all a great thing to do. Customer service skills should be great along with communication skills."
good,"At a day at work I am on register or I am in drive through so either I am greeting customers placing their orders and making sure they get what they come to Wendy's for. Or I am greeting the customers while placing their foods in bags in a certain amount of time and giving it to them through the window. "
good,fast paced job  food prepared fresh everyday vegetables cut by hand hardest part off the job was making big orders and handling crowds in a little area
good,"Overall nice work place, its like coming home to a house full of people. We all are very helpful of each other, we're good as a team and individualy! My bosses are very good at what they do and how they handle things."
good,Fast-pace and enjoyable workplace to socialize and improve your character. It definitely has all the requirements of a fast food restaurant. I love that it gets supervise occasionally to make sure everything is running correctly and safely.
good,benefits at wendys is not as well as othe fast food establishments but its ok to work for them as a starter job. Very flexible with scheduling that i had requested.
good,"Work there is boring. And very hot, because there is no air conditioner in the kitchen. Customers are very rude and so aren't the other employees. Work is difficult if not mentally prepared."
good,I liked how well I was able to get along with any customer. Just because I am a nice well spoken young lady. I always liked leaving from work with a great mood. Knowing I help brighten someone's day.
good,Was not impresses by the company and chosen management. A lot of favoritism amongst managers etc. Not very clean environment nor friendly place to really enjoy.
good,"it was ok couldve been better . need better organization in the store , lack of work ethnic i dont know what else to type ............................"
good,"Opening the store, running mid-shift, or closing the store working should be fun; not a headache. I loved my job i just hated that no benefits came with the job we got a little to no discount."
good,En general todo muy bien organizado pero con muy pocos beneficios.
good,Always busy an always something to do. Get a technique so your job can become easy for you. Once you get the hang of everything it's smooth sailing  from their.
good,"I have loved working there and the people are very fun, the scheduling is very accommodating. Very easy to work there and customer service is the number one priority."
good,Wendy's is a extremely fast paced environment as well as requiring a lot of patience with customers and staff. Making sure customers are well treated is our goal
good,This job has lead me to become more efficient in my daily life and be more assertive in life. The hardest part of working at Wendy's would be assuring that the counter doesn't come up short!
good,"Normal day at work, one goes through training and spends the time constantly providing fresh food and attending customer needs. Here i learned some interpersonal skills, different marketing strategies, and Managing the workforce. Managers were usually internally hired like me and directed how the store would run, thus would be stricter during day hours where sales peak. The workplace culture was pretty friendly, just a group of people trying to pay for their car or feed their family. The hardest part about the job was managing a constantly fluctuating labor poor to synchronize with the store hours. The most enjoyable part was overseeing a well managed run, where everyone working at an efficient pace would make work go smoothly and end the day on a high note."
good,"They interfered with my school schedule too drastically, due to the fact that I was a good worker. So I had to leave in order to focus on my education."
good,"Quick paced environment but doesn't give enough hours for someone looking to work full-time. Good and nice people to work with, managers are easy to work with."
good,"Typical day smiling at customers, cash handling fast and accurate, operate credit card machine to process customer payment and register,answer customer questions about food and it's freshness and ingredients, cleans and straighten out tables and restrooms at the end of shifts.the hardest part of this job is not having the items when customers need i always takes care of my customers. the years i've worked i had employee of the month for 6 months , i enjoyed that title.I never  let my boss down,the hardest part of this job is maybe moving on to higher livable salary.I love this job and my customers."
good,"My experience at Wendy's was pleasant overall. I worked under an amazing set of managers. Our specific location wasn't as pleasant as the other ones and there were many times customers were rude to me as a cashier. Overall, tolerable."
good,I enjoyed my co workers and we all made working as fun as we could. I think there could have been at least one more worker there to make things easier.
good,"Wiil you be working from the time you clock in until the time you clock out. The work is so strenuous you will want to cry when hired. However, if you stick with the job it will teach you how to work hard and earn everything you get in life. If you can work hard at Wend'ys then you can work hard ANYWHERE."
good,"fast paced, long shifts few breaks, managers are fun hard workers, owner rude yet also respectable. If told to do something you are expected to fully comply even if not in job description"
good,The Wendy's I worked at off threat has been very good to me. However there are like any other fast food and the turnover rate was high. The hours were kind of a mixed review. There was plenty to give and I had no problem until it took up most of my time I was barely home. I did make a lot there.
good,Typical fast food job nothing special about that side of things. Mostly stuck around because management was amazing and super fun as were my co-workers
good,"I saw this job as a starting point, or a practical alternative at my age. Finally being able to accommodate my own desires and save up for long-term goals was a good way for building character."
good,"Wendy's was my very first job as a young girl. I was 15 years when I started. As i grew to it I grew a bond to my co workers and managers. I learned so much my time there. I learned how to deal with customers, talk to customers, make customers happy, cash handling and how to deal with customers. I always knew what my job was when I clocked in never needed an instruction. The hardest part was dealing with the drama. The most enjoyable part was having a great bond with some of my managers and co workers."
good,Its a good place to work overall. Just dont like the management they don't know when enough is enough. Wishing things could be different. I wish this Wendys could go back to a number one store.
good,"People were always cheerful, and happy to see you when you walked in for your shift. I learned a lot about multitasking, and I improved my communications skills dramatically the four years working there. Management was okay, I often found myself in manager positions as they would be off doing something else (which wasn't needed to be done). The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with."
good,"The people you get to work with are great, but there is a lot of work to do when it comes to closing time. Sometimes it is hard to go to school while working here because half the time they dont give you the hours you are available to work."
good,"It was my first job and it had it's ups and downs. The manager did not like me, but as soon as he saw that I could work quick and well, I was of value to his company. He tried to force me to work till 12am because I was 18, but I didn't have a car and would have to walk home every day. My guardian had to come in to talk to the manager. Besides that, the employees were very kind and helpful. They respected you once they got to know you. It's a good starter job."
good,Wendy's was a learning step for me. Because I have never had a job into I started working at Wendy's. I used Wendy's as a training program to get me ready for a life of working in the real world.
good,for a part time job this is a great place to work and meet new people. there is room to advance if you are interested in that. Also they work around your scheduling needs if you are in school
good,This job was a stepping stone it molded me to be the employee I am today. It help me think of where I wanted to be and made me realize the type of work I wanted to do.
good,"Wendy's was my first job, and taught me how to work in a fast-paced environment. I learned how to multitask, be assertive, handle money, work a cash register, and work with coworkers and managers. It was a lot of long shifts of all standing, and the crew never really got too close. However, overall, it was a good first job and learning experience."
good,"A typical work day is about an 8-hour shift. Depending on the day, I would sometimes be on fries, sometimes on sandwiches, and sometimes on drive-thru or the front cash register. Most of the time, they ended up putting me on the front cash register. The hardest part of the job is probably not stressing out when there's a line out the door."
good,"it was good, especially for a high school student looking to make some extra cash. I enjoyed the 3 years I worked there. except only having two days off a week."
good,"This was also a fun place to work, good food,  a lot of friendly customers, free meals and great people to work with.  However, I worked the closing shifts and didn't have a lot of time with family."
good,"A typical day at Wendy is getting prepared to open for the customer.  As a employee even though I wasn't a manager, I was mainly running shifts on my own. When the manager was in the office , I always took charge to make sure everything still running smoothly."
good,Love the employees i work with. Working with the people i worked with made it completely worth being there. However management could use some help. The GM at the Milwaukee location in Lubbock is rude and impolite to her employees which was an issue for me. All employees are equal give respect to get it.
good,"Learned to communicate and work as a team with others."
good,"On a regular day at Wendy's as a cashier, I would have to come in and clean my area up front and stock up for my shift. Then go out to the dining room stock up out there, also clean the tables and pick up anything big. After I would have to attend any costumer that came through the doors. While sometimes helping on fries and anything else they would need help on during the times I was not busy. At around 8 pm i wouldve have started to clean the tables, the window ledges, the lights, stock up again up front and dining room. After i would vacuum, broom, scrub, and mop and then make sure everything is clean to close dining room. After that my shift ended at 10."
good,i started working at wendys during basketball and school and they did the best they could to work with my existing schedule and still give me hours through out the week. .
good,"Fast paced"
good,"It was my first job and I appreciate the experience, I learned a lot about good work ethnic and customer service. The management was great and the coworkers were amazing."
good,"I have enjoyed working here until I was not getting enough money to live off due to lack of people buying food, which resulted in fewer hours for me. The people I work with are amazing and would hate to leave them, but overall a great place to work if you are into a fast paced environment."
good,This company provides a very unstructured environment. Managers are not understanding. Always working at a faced paced. The pay isn't that great for the work that has to be done.
good,It's not a horrible place to work.... Employees are respected and management makes an effort to meet employee needs. Clean and maintained well by staff.
good,"A typical day at work included assigning cleaning tasks for employees, preparing meals for customers, taking payments, prepping food for morning shift, cleaning store equipment, training employees for new positions, and locking doors when leaving. "
good,"Taking Orders, Making sandwiches. I learned how to work under pressure. The management was exstreamly helpful by not giving up on us.The hardest part would be learning all the diffrent sandwhiches. I enjoyed working as a team the most"
good,fast past enviorment with very demanding people learn to alot of real world skills with okay management hardest PART keep cool head with very rude costumers and people while trying keep mangement happy most enjoyable part is the check at the end of the pay cycle
good,"depending on who you worked with really states how hard your shift is going to be. If you work with someone who is not a team player or only plays at work then your shift is going to be a hard long one, but on the other hand if you work with someone who is helpful and doesn't play around on shift it will be an a relaxed fast shift with everyone working together."
good,"Loved working at Wendy's. We worked as a team, always helped each other succeed to meet, above standard, service, to all of our loving customers. Good, friendly, genuine group of workers, in all departments."
good,wendys is an ok place to work they are nice and will help you with any problems but alot of drama and rumors you have to deal with there thats really the only bad thing but just keep your head down and do your job youll be ok
good,"Great Restauramt"
good,"The management was horrible.everyone was very unorganized and did not do thinks from ""The Book"". I really did not working at wendys at all and will not recommend for anyone else."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with, stocking everything making sure we have enough product to last through-out the day. I've learned how to approach people better, and how to run drive-through. Hardest part of the job is doing my daily cleaning tasks while running drive-through."
good,"I loved this job, loved coming in and seeing the customers and taking their orders. yes some days you don't want to be at the job but that is normal for the most part. Most of the time loved working with crew. Working here I made a lot of new friends and felt like I was part of a family. Learned how to handle customers that are not happy and how to work as a team."
good,"I did like my job just was not something i wanted to do for my life time,but it was a job and it was just a pay check to me but the job was easy,  if i would have to work there again I would not,"
good,"Productive, a topical work day is stressful not everyone helps to make sure the customers are token care of. once th rushes are over every kind of leaves their posts which causes another rush because now one person is fulfilling the customers needs"
good,"Customers don't ask much from a fast-food restaurant: just fresh food, a quick turnaround, and competent, friendly service. Sometimes, to my delight, the experience exceeds my expectations. I'm writing about such experiences with the drive-thru but when I work the drive thru window register customers compliment on how fast and how polite we are. I work on weekdays only. It makes me feel good when the customers compliment our work. I have been working there for about 7months."
good,"Cleaned tables, Air vents and Restrooms."
good,"wendys was a  good place to work if you are looking for something to do while attending school. a typical work day at wendys. clock in and then check your area , make sure things are stocked properly"
good,There are a lot of customers and we serve them at a fast paste and and a smile on our faces. I learn how to use the register and have good customer service.
good,they need to hire more employees to speed process up during lunch rushes and don't depend on one person to work every time when someone calls out . thats the reason for having more staff .
good,"Throughout the years I learned the ins and outs of the job, becoming efficient at many jobs that I ended up training both crew and managers how to do them. Many days were run smoothly from certain crew members, but many days were also hectic from employees not knowing what they were doing. I learned that sometimes you have to be patient with people because they may not learn the task on the first try, but if you stick with them, they can do a lot of good in the long run. Overall, the experience was enjoyable, but the management team has to be changed because they were sometimes cruel, inhumane, and impossible to satisfy, which ended up being the reason why I left the company."
good,"This was the beginning of my customer-service career. I began as soon as I was eligible which helped me quickly develop the understanding of how a restaurant functions. The first thing I learned was how to prepare condiments and food items for fast service. I then learned how to time-manage by making fries and putting together sandwiches to coordinate with the orders given. The next advancement I was placed in was primary customer service. I greeted each person who walked in the door with a smile, promptly computed their desired or recommended order, and continued to take payment and give back correct change. This job gave me the base training that I can use towards any restaurant, and for that I am most grateful. The hardest part of the job was closing the restaurant. It wasn't that it was difficult, by any means. It was just very intricate and tedious cleaning process."
good,"During high school it suited my needs well. Flexible scheduling but minimum wage pay. But for young kids, not that bad of a deal."
good,"wendys is a very enjoyable place to work, foods amazing. ive learned alot of things working there how to grill food, deal with customers, handling tough situations i have learned how to deal with these situations now, It is a great opportunity working at these places, it teaches you things in life and how to do things."
good,Very good and friendly environment . Manager was helpful and co-workers were always willing to teach and help. I loved working in Wendy's .
good,I felt that some job combinations didn't compliment each other such as cashier and dining room. People can't order if their cashier is cleaning the bathroom. No real complaints other than that. Pretty average.
good,definitely not a job i would ever go back too. bad pay and when i worked there the management was worse then the pay. the work for the most part wasnt that bad .
good,"Overall working at Wendy's was decent. There are few things I would change, like how my coworkers tended to yell. Besides that it was a pretty okay place to work. The customers made it every bit worthwhile when o saw their happy faces."
good,"Ok place to work for a first job. Fast paced kitchen setting where you interact with a lot of customers. If it gets slow you will be cleaning windows (inside and out), floors, tables, chairs, and the restrooms. The restrooms are out of control nasty sometimes and the kitchen gets super hot. Good crewmembers who work together."
good,"Random times, but good consistency of hours."
good,"A normal day at Wendy's is that its a fast paced environment. We take care of the customer in the fastest and efficient way possible. We always ensure that our guests are satisfied and if there are any problems that they leave happy and with out problem. Management at my Wendy's is great, but as i am a manager there i could say they do need help to train upcoming managers. They employees and fellow managers are always pretty friendly to each other,  We try to make our environment a happy and enjoyable place to be, I believe the hardest part of my job is that training is quite difficult when you are under staffed or have inexperience employees."
good,"I typically go in and look at my where I am designated to be. I will take orders and when we don't have costumers or cars I will go and start stocking my area. I'll either wash dishes if I am at the drive thru or keep the dining room clean during down time. Working in a fast paced environment have both been hardest part of my job and the learning experience.  Management is amazing always working with my school schedule and being so caring and supportive. My co workers are exceptional, always working as a team with me to get to our goal."
good,"Wendy's is a very reliable company simply for the hours they give, all though the work may be hard the managers made it easier to get threw the shift."
good,"Considering the fact that I worked there for almost my entire high school years, it actually taught me a few things in life. I started working there my sophomore year of highschool around Dec. 2011 and onto Dec. 2013, my senior year."
good,i really appreciate the company management. all the co- workers are cooperative. i love specially drive through service.
good,"A typical day was food preparation, customer service, sandwiches. The hardest part of my job was being on my feet for 8 hours straight, with a 30 minute break mixed in. But with the diverse group of employees we had there was never a dull moment at work. It was always a good but productive fun."
good,During my time working at Wendy's I had a positive attitude towards everything but at the restaurants the manager didn't know how to be prepare for the day. If during the day something didn't run out that was a surprise to everyone
good,"good place to work great people to work with, somedays very hectic but managable i learned how to run the store and hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers."
good,"A Typical day at work included interacting with coworkers and customers. Work was exciting. We had fun with making customers smile and laugh as they came and go. Working at Wendys I learned to work wit a team to get specific tasks done. Even when things get frustrating you must keep going as a team to make things come together whether it was getting the customers food to them in a timely manner, or keeping drive thru time at a decent time, or even cleaning u the restaurant to go home. My coworkers and I built great bonds on and off the jobs. Managers were very understanding ."
good,"Wendys is a good first job, you learn a lot. i have grown tremulously in customer service because of it. It is more of a high school job and its time to move on"
good,"When I worked with Wendy's, it was great. For the most part the employees were great, and management was amazing. "
good,"Working at wendy's has definitely taught me great customer service, especially working at time when there are huge lines and long rushes; being the cashier there were many times where I was yelled at customers and I learnt that no matter what to just keep smiling"
good,"This, I can confidently say has been my favorite position in my working life.  The people on all shifts were very welcoming, and became family.  I highly recommend this company as a starter career in the food industry."
good,Very precise on the way the day goes. Great team work they always get together in pull through a hard work day. The GM is a great person shows concern to her team and they love to work beside her to make the store be its full potential.
good,"While working at Wendy's i acquired better people skills than i had before. I dealt with the public all day everyday. The management was great and understanding, and the co workers were all around the same age so we all got really close."
good,"A+  on atmosphere, loved working there and would still be there but to much money kept coming up missing from purses etc."
good,A typical day at work wasn't worth the pay feels like we should have gotten paid more. I learn more about fast food and what really goes on behind the counters. I learned how to deal with customers and basically customer service. The management changed very often and some mangers were very unprofessional. there was really no hard part of the job and i enjoyed ever part because of the people i worked with and the daily customers that kept me going when i wasn't really in the mood.
good,The Legacy Corporation lacked real stay value due to a lack of promised raise review every six months and the lack of benefits. They were very good working around schedules and management was fantastic.
good,"A typical day is busy! I learned that people are different, unique, and we all have struggles, but together we can handle things better working together and encouraging one another. Management, The higher up, the more stress. The hardest part of the job is working short handed and over 50 hours a week. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people, and rewarding crew for a job well done, even if its just a pat on the back or a thank you_ goes a long way!"
good,Everyday was a different day and I always learn something new. The hardest part of the job was actually keeping the customers satisfied at all times. The most enjoyably part was seeing the customers happy after their daily visit.
good,A typical day at the Wendy's I worked at consisted of making sure we had enough product for that day and having a decent time for the drive-thru.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant lack of respect for management by the younger employees.  I learned how to function in a fast-paced environment by focusing on the more important tasks first.  Management did a very good job in making sure that the store ran as efficiently as possible.  The most enjoyable part of the the job was working with people I knew and liked.
good,"I had a wonderful experience with company. I would recommend this restaurant to any whom would apply. Great people to work for and made it feel as a family business and you are a part of their family."
good,"Benefits are very good. Medical, dental, life, matching 401k ( up to 3%), pto time. Not very good at planning ahead. Management staffing spread thin. Very few overlapping shifts, very hard to get out on time."
good,"fun, easy to learn thing some help from management. easy going some hard work learning to deal with staff and customers."
good,Nice coworkers flex schedule good place to work with good management. I enjoy the people and job and would like to do school work.
good,This was a fun place to work. The team was required to meet customers needs in a timely manner. The management team was strong
good,i enjoyed this job a little bit but it didn't have many advancement opportunites. I found that some of the rules were not right.
good,Would not recommend this job to anyone who is not under the age of 30. Have to be in an certain circle.This company does not like people who complain about things or if a certain manager or supervisor does not like you they will treat you like garbage so that you have no choice but to quit.
good,"Typically my work day consisted of attending the front cash register or coordinate the drive thru, making sure the orders go out to the customers correctly."
good,Overall the job was very enjoyable and was a good experience for me. The management on the other hand was a different story. Some of the management have attitudes with employees and harassment is a constant.
good,It's a good place to work.  Nice colleagues.  They just never gave me a better shift or trained me in more challenging tasks.
good,I learned how to make sandwiches but the other stuff they barely trained me and I loved making stuff and I love to cook and wendys was fun but some of the people were rude to me
good,"This job is pretty fast paced and challenging. And if you don't have the right instructions on how exactly what you hired to do, everything will fall apart. It was a learning experience, but you will benefit from learning how to handle stressful situations"
good,"This job teaches on great value, ""Take responsibility without placing blame.""."
good,First starting out we started with many new people. The company was newly built and I have been there since it's fresh new beginning. I have watched many people come in and out of those doors. Everyday is a busy day and we learn from our managers and crew leaders everyday by their actions.
good,Easy to get along with co-workers and management. Usually very busy and sometimes stressful due to under staffing busy days/shifts. Pretty simple to keep busy with cleaning and restocking.
good,"i had a great experience working at wendys, my co workers were great and the crew members made my days shorter when i worked 12+ hour days. I learned how to be a great manager and how to deal with hard customers."
good,Fun supportive job can be very challenging at time but helps you grow and too a stronger harder working person. Teaches you how important it is too always be friendly and treat people how you wanna be treated.
good,not a bad job makes a nice amount of money don't get enough hours so if you got pills that need to be paid this isn't really the job for you simply because you wont make enough money to take care of everything you have to do
good,"a typical work day consists of coming in and stocking up my work area with the items i will need to get through the day. "
good,"nice friendly job environment, co-workers was nice and helpful, managers was inspirational and always pushed us towards success"
good,"-Slow because of weekdays"
good,Very busy days at work  i learned to be self motivated is the way to go in the sales and customer service filled .My management was ok but not  fair on my hours.my co -workers was very helpful . The heard art of the job was keeping up with the orders  the most enjoyable part was the store discount
good,Worked 8 hour shifts. Some overtime availability. Great atmosphere. Co-workers were more like family. Hardest part was rush hour.
good,"The average day at Wendys is pretty much laid back, busy here and there, but not constantly. I have learned how to work with other coworkers, managers, and personalities.The hardest part of the day is probably lunch hour. The most enjoyable part of the day for me is making customers happy and getting great feedback."
good,It was ok management wasn't the greatest and scheduling so they were always understaffed. Staff was kind but not professional
good,"I have worked for 3 different Wendy's. West Chester, OH; Union, KY; and Dry Ridge, KY. "
good,"I worked here for my first job in high school. I was there for three years. I enjoyed my co workers and got some great real life work experience. Things however, did start to go downhill toward the time I started to leave. Management started to go downhill. Never had things in order (running out of product), hiring people who were not willing to work or provide great customer service. I have been in recently and things have seen to gotten better. So good luck to anyone who chooses Wendy's."
good,"Air conditioning was constantly breaking making work nearly unbearably hot in the summer months. Did not take kindly to asking for time off, even for legitimate reasons."
good,"Working at Wendy's gave me the skill to work on the cash register. I did night shift so it was kind of hard dealing with customers during the weekend because they are intoxicated. Sometime I be afraid to take someone order when they are under the influence, I don't what they are capable of or if their mind is in the right place. I enjoy working at the cash register because I love meeting new people, I enjoy having conversation with them and having some laughs. The most hard put of my job is trying to figure out what some of my costumers are saying, and try to get them to understand what I'm saying. Its really difficult but I got through it. My co-workers are just amazing, sometime we have our disagreement but it takes an adult to really come to conclusion to figure out what the problem and how can we solve the issue. Other then that I don't regret working at Wendy's."
good,"A typical day at work would be, I will arive early to my shift. I clock in and the days starts with hungry customers. As I take orders throughout the day, it is my job to keep customers happy and make sure their experience at Wendy's is great."
good,"I work on the grill so i take care of all the cooking, prepping of the food and cleaning. The management is very good, the managers are professional and helpful. Most of my co-workers are young and at times can be hard to work with because of what they rather do then should. The hardest part of my job would be trying to keep up with everything that they ask of me, with the position i am in they demand a lot, and i am responsible for making sure everything is done quickly and in an orderly fashion, i feel i partake in a lot more work then most of the co-workers there. I do enjoy my job, it has definitely helped me to grow in my focus and hard work skills, the best part of my job is knowing that i am helping in the maintaining and growth of this company."
good,"-A typical day on the job would be adhering to food safety rules, preparing food, cooking chicken and burger meat, and cleaning dining area."
good,"it gives and opportunity to meet a lot of great people it is a very fast pace so time fly's"
good,"It was fast food work, so you make and serve food and keep the place clean. Typical, simple work. In the process you learn how to clean very well, and you get experience in an FDA related environment."
good,"A typical day is getting the store  opened every day, I have learned that I can learn new things if I set my mine to it. the managers try there best to help you when you need help. MY co-workers and I do the best work we can  as a time working together. the work is the hardest part of the job. Learning new skills and getting along with your co-workers is the most enjoyable thing about the job."
good,"There were times where the job was not so bad, but more times the job was not fun and was difficult to concentrate to due lack of management sometimes"
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work. Great place to enhance your customer service skills. The Crew that i worked with was fun very helpful. The challenge was to serve quality food at at certain time, but the job was done well."
good,Being a cashier at Wendy's requires you to be able to complete multiple challenging tasks a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is discounts.
good,Wendy's  is a good place to work it is rewarding you get to meet great people and you get nice discounts on the food working there is fun and rewarding
good,"go in and prep for the shift then open store and serve the customers, or make the orders etc.  hardest part of the job was when we were short staffed.  most enjoyable part was the friends I made.  My co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"When I worked for Wendy's my day would consist of clocking in, speak with manager on what position need help, I would go to my position for the day and work till asked to switch duties or end of shift. The problem and complications at my job were the hours, management and the enviorntment. There was fights, fusses, and no overtime."
good,"Clock in, see where you are going to be working, work your section, help where you can, and do your cleaning. That is a typical day working there. I really didn't learn much. The GM is great. The AGM was horrible. The hardest part of the job was leaving when I was put on bed rest. I enjoyed working there. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful."
good,At work i always worked hard. i learned how deal with dirrent peoples attitudes. i had the best management staff. i loved working hard and getting paid to do so.
good,Very flexible with work schedule. Training on the job was fun and easy. Managers were down to earth and understanding of life that exist outside of the job.
good,the management team there they need new management as well as the general manager she keeps drama going and a person you cannot work with.
good,At first I had doubts but as I learned the job and the responsibilities it became a great place to be employed. Throughout the years I worked here I've learned a lot and In my opinion can work at any restuarant of my choice or is willing to have me as an employee.
good,"The location was busy, it was fun when I first started but the GM played favorites and it wasn't very fair."
good,Wendy's is a place where you can start your first job and experience how it feels to be in the work environment.
good,"a typical day at work at the Wendy's store would sometimes be either really busy or was going at a steady pace but was always a good day "
good,"My years at wendys have been a crazy experience, you do so much for a little pay and also dealing with difficult customer it was a learning experience for me but I never seen myself in fast food"
good,They offer flexible hours but not nearly enough hours. I need more hours than they offer.
good,"I spent 3 years in the Wendy's environment. There are of course things I enjoyed and things I hated. I liked the people who worked with me. The managers were kinda mean, and not understanding. I liked being busy all the time doing small things, and having fun at the job in general."
good,"I worked for Wendy's for 6 years and did well with the co-workers until I moved into Bloomington. The managers are crazy, rude, and unprofessional. They would pick the people they didn't like to much and try their best to make them want to leave the company. After putting in 3 years at a Bloomington branch I called it quits. I was always on time and never called in and only got disrespected. I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay as long as did."
good,"everything looks okay, but then start doing jobs that dont expect for your position, they use it like they want, never grateful"
good,The typical day at work would be repetitive but it was a blessing to be able to work
good,"It was fun interacting along with the customers and co-workers, not something I could have made a career out of, but still enjoyed my employment here."
good,"wendys was a great place to work loved talking to the costumers and doing everything in could to help them and make them happy "
good,"Typical day involves stocking, steady flow of customers. Several fellow employees do the minimum amount of work that is required."
good,"Wendy's is a very fun place. The staff was pretty cool, real team players. loved meeting the new customers and the elderly customers were so sweet."
good,"A typical day at work would be great but you do have employees that are either not trained or not suited for work, the typical day consist of high traffic of customers in a short amount of time all day."
good,"Ive worked in 3 different wendys locations (Hampshire, Round Lake Beach, and McHenry). McHenry is the only location I have worked at that had bad management. If you had an issue, you would have to talk to the District Manager because the General manager had favorites, and if you werent one of the favorites, she wouldnt do anything."
good,"the Managers are ignorant and inefficient, employees suffer from bad management and lack of incentive. Work is grueling and stressful in a terrible environment. Terrible environment is poorly air conditioned and the work involves lifting heavy objects and standing for hours on end. You can work for 4-5 hours without a chance to move from a 5 foot position of where you are standing due to the amount of customers and your need for fresh product or providing service. There is no incentive to do well, only incentive to not do terrible. Pay is terrible and includes a insulting 10 cent raise every six months. Extra jobs are assigned mainly to male employees due to heavy lifting and intense strain. No time to complete all your goals and you end up getting yelled at for doing a good job by taking time. Unrealistic expectations of to much work for one person done more impressively than humanly possible in less time than a blink of the eye."
good,"Although Wendy's has it's perks, there are many flaws.  New employees aren't trained properly so the old employees are forced to teach them on busy days when we need them to already be skilled.  We are only allowed to work 28 hours a week, however with all of the new hires, workers who have been there for a while have had their hours cut to next to nothing.  Along with that, many employees work very hard and are paid very little.  The hardest part of the job is the fact that our employers don't come to us with problems or questions that they have, they talk to other crew members about it instead of coming directly to us.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the bonds you make with certain crew members.  Real friendships are formed and it's nice to have something to look forward to when going to work."
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's consist of customer service working with cash register credit debit machines, OSHA, store preparation for all shifts and inventory and organization. Management was great they help out and they are very understanding willing to work with your schedule and personal life. I trained many employees starting out at your store so I got along with everybody. The hardest part of working at Wendy's is getting robbed. The most enjoyable part is customer service building a bond with the regular customers know their orders and preparing their orders satisfying their needs and wants."
good,"MTO food the general public was really diffucult to deal with "
good,"Definitely a fast-paced environment. I learned speed, excellence, and efficiency while working here. Management was decent. The people were great to work with and a lot of fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was the occasional short staffed shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the other co-workers and the people you served."
good,"wasn't their long, but the manager was awesome. cooking in a fast place, with awesome chances of moving up."
good,"Acomodaba la mercancía que llegaba, etiquetaba y hacia el inventario,en general había un buen ambiente de trabajo,revisaba que la mercancía que llegaba estuviera en las condiciones necesarias para sacarla a al venta,lo que no me gustaba eran las horas extras que aveces no eran pagadas en su totalidad."
good,Great team work everyone helping each other and getting along.
good,"Everyone works there hardest here, but sometimes your hardest is not enough. In order to succeed, you must be fast, smart, and have a great smile. For most people this is not hard, but for some, they will quickly realize that Wendys is not the place for them. Managers try there hardest to keep everyone believing that each worker is treated equally, but most days, that is not the case. If you are not liked by the majority of your co-workers, you know it. There are many of the typical issues inside the work place, but most workers here are great at hiding that fact from the customers. We put on our best smile and make them believe that everything is perfect."
good,"A typical day of work usually consist of staying on task, being efficient and getting the job done correctly.  I feel teamwork is critical and everyone should work toward the same goal ."
good,"typical day ..time management = prepared products and open store,"
good,"fast food next to Worlds of Fun, very fast paced, stressful but good work environment"
good,i learned what it takes to run the store from the front to all the duty's the manager has.
good,"The day would be determined by the managers, there are different positions that need to be worked and depending on the position your tasks will vary. I learned many things, team work, speed, cleanliness and sanitation, customer service and basic inventory calculating. "
good,I enjoyed work it was fun most of the time. Or maybe it was the crew and mangers we always brought out the fun at work and was still able to do  the job with great accuracy. I really enjoyed being recommended by a customer to make a sandwich. Just to know you made something great they enjoyed and the was happy with it. The hardest part of the job was when we would get backed up and some of the food was not ready and we did not make service time . So our boss got on us but overall i loved my job at wendy's
good,"A typical day at work included the managers running around like chickens with their heads cut off because they either had too many people on shift or too few. This made the situation stressful for everyone, because there was a constant pressure to keep a magical balance that can be almost impossible to maintain, especially if the computer says to send people off of their shifts but it's during a rush hour. The entire management system seems wholly unorganized."
good,"Managing employees, cleaning, stocking, dealing with customer service and keeping track of product is done everyday. Everything that will be used for the day is prepped every morning and when we are low in the middle of the day we prep again. There is no hard parts to the job just constant cleaning. Dealing with regular customers and happy employees makes the job enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of prepping food, cleaning restaurant, also help other teammates with their duties"
good,"Being in the fast food is no walk in the park. When it comes to Wendy's; the one I worked at, they did not like the social as aspect of the job. Training was impeccable and hard to understand, at its easiest."
good,"Managing and training new people everyday"
good,"I went in either in the morning or the evening and would start out wherever my managers wanted me to. I would work up to 10 hours a day. I learned how to run every part of the restaurant and could do anything my supervisors needed me for. The management was ok but would try to satisfy everyone, which led to favorites and crewmembers trying to get favored for better shifts and hours, along with raises and longer breaks. My co-workers were fun to work with but most were very irresponsible and petty. The hardest part of the job was to work with one of the managers or employees who did not like you and they would try to make your life very difficult as a result. The part of the job that I loved was when it was busy and all you had to focus on was getting food made and orders taken as quickly as possible."
good,"MY over all review is I like this job because I was Experienced in operating a grill I was offered a Position to open and Close I liked that I was receiving a full 40 hours at times plus I was operating the  Oven and Deep fryers I Was trained to Filter the fryers ,I would also perform tasks such as Temp Checks that were keep track of .I would Rotate food as required by Company policy .I would have to perform Closing tasks .I did enjoy my job I have a Passion for cooking"
good,"We are usually busy, I work 12-13 hours days, without a complaint, I help take orders, make the food, and a cashier most of the time. The hardest part of the job and stay positive and not letting rude people ruin your day. My co-workers are the BEST I love each and everyone of them."
good,"Fast moving pace, multitasking required,"
good,Near movie theater.. Very fast pace.. Closing in a timely manner and making sure morning shift had everything ready for them. Co workers and I had fun and got the work done... Best Crew Ever
good,I learned the in's and out's of the entire wendy's franchise. I worked drive-thru and learned amazing customer service and the computer I placed orders on.
good,Managers had their favorite employees and would give those employees all the hours and not give the ones who did do their job hours.
good,"A typical day would be working with fellow employees, but many of them are lazy and don't do their jobs. I learned how to work a register and fryers. The managers are nice. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep the dining room clean when there is always a line at the counter. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers."
good,"Preparing meals .Run cashier and take orders. Working as a team member, and keeping my area clean.  Making sure customers are satisfied with services received. Management and coworkers made the job process easy because we was a team. I really did not have a hard part of this job, the most enjoyable part was helping people."
good,"It was busy and I like that cause it makes the day go faster. The attitudes were horrible, people got irritated very quickly. I learned all the sandwiches, beverages, and how to do fries."
good,The workers i am privillaged to work with always make my day fun and entertaining i would recommend working there
good,"Besides the negative customers and sometimes unethical employees, the hours were always good in the food industry."
good,This was my first job so I really didn't know where to start. I was pretty scared on the first day and had no idea what to do. In the end it taught me alot about the work field.
good,"a typical day at work is being on the front register. i take the customers orders, clean the lobby and the bathrooms and i clean the trays and stock the condiment stand. i also have to stock my line and shift and assist the other lines, which means helping in other places such as the drive through."
good,"Very easy, and helpful. Ive learned new things and was always open to learn more."
good,"Not a bad job, wish i could have worked something else besides grill and could have maybe worked nights and not mornings."
good,I have enjoyed working for Wendys. It is a fun friendly workplace where we all work together to get the orders out in a timely fashion and keep the work place looking good. It is easy work but sometimes  it can be challenging.
good,"chaotic and crazy"
good,The pay was awful the job was great but there was no opportunity for advancement. There was not enough hours.
good,"no rasies and a year wait for medical, was understaffed hard time with some of the managment, now its being rebuilt, no job, will have to be re-hired"
good,The crew worked well as a team. Our managers expected the BEST out of us and that's what we did...unless we wanted our hours cut. It was an okay job considering I was 17 & still adjusting to working along with school. The pay just was not enough.
good,"pull daily numbers/ communicate with Gm team."
good,"Most of the time I enjoy my job despite it being fast food. However, the wage for crew is not livable. Minimum wage, and you can only work 29 hours a week tops. 700 in a month is a great month compared to others where I've made maybe 200."
good,Coworkers are great. Fast and friendly environment. Fun place to be at.
good,"What I've learned working at Wendy's is how to prep food, run register, serving the beef, cleaning the grill, dropping products and making my customers happy while keeping a smile on my face."
good,"A typical day was fun with the interaction with the employees and the costumers, management was easy to come to for help your co-workers made you feel important, no matter what their job title was and I enjoyed the flexible hours and of course there was the food."
good,"The managers cared enough to give the employees the work time that would best fit their families, school time, other job, whatever it was."
good,The job it self was stressful but it was a great job. The management and crew felt like family I had a great experience there.
good,The job was ok other than the fact that they ask you to do multiple things for one positions pay.
good,A typical day at Wendy's  would consist of me clocking in and working at the front counter. I generally take orders and distribute money back and forth to the costumers. I've learned that every costumers isn't as friendly as you but you still have to remain humble and stay positive. My co workers was amazing and supportive. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude costumers.The most enjoyable moment was coming to work when everyone was upbeat in a positive mood and sales was through the roof.
good,"I   learned  how  to  deal  with  people  and  helping  others ."
good,Promotes great customer service through QSR environment.  Staff are flexible and willing to learn.  Management were helpful.  Mid-management responsible for effective and positive staff morale as well as maintaining policies and procedures
good,"Served customers food orders in a professional and courteous manner. Prepared quality standard beef patties and chicken on the grill and pressure fryer.  Prepared customer sandwiches to the standards of the company.  Ran a fast pace and high tempo drive through, providing professional customer service conviently from their vehicles."
good,I like to work there  but  i think they put too much work on me  for 3 hours a day
good,"i was the cook just Cook and retrieved all the thing from the deep freezer ,"
good,"I did the morning prep of salads, veggies,an set up sandwich line. I learned that some management really can treat crew members like dirt an make some employees cry an walk out. I enjoyed most of the co-workers I worked with. The hardest part was going into work to deal with the managers that treated the staff like dirt. The store manager was fun to work with an always perky an up beat."
good,clock in and start my duties
good,"I worked for wendy's when i was just starting out in food industry, the managers there helped train me in a way to take leadership. I enjoyed working there and would again."

good,"I Trained for 2 months and 2 weeks i started at the bottom and trained on all positions.After the 2 1/2 months of training I started at my own store where i took much pride as it being ""my store"""
good,"I worked as a closing shift manager in a few wendy's locations with the main one being in Troy, NY across the street from a college. I barely made enough to pay my own bills and traveled an hour one way just to get to work. I went to college and got a degree in psychology hoping to apply that educational experience into dealing with conflict resolution and measuring customer satisfaction, I received not a penny more, and this put a hurting on me because I had to repay student loans."
good,"although the work was not hard, there was all ways something that needed to be done. The days went by fast due to the fact that its fast food. I would have liked to get paid more however"
good,"Fast paced , very busy, I learned how to use the register, take orders, work the drive thru window, learned how to wash dishes with the dishwasher, learned how to cook meat on the auto matic grill, my co workers where all polite and easy to work with, management was good, under control , hardest part of job was dealing with a very rude and disrespectful customer even when they where acting out of character for no reason. Most enjoyable part of the job was making customers smile and helping them"
good,"My main problem was how rude one of the managers was. She was nothing but a jerk to me when I wasn't even working her shift. I would come on for my night shift as she was coming off her day shift and she would raise her voice at me, force me to do everything by myself so that other workers had nothing to do, and she had no care about the fact that cleaning the ovens caused me to have an asthma attack."
good,"I Learned How To Pace Myself And Know How To Work Different Machines And Tools To Prep Certain Foods, Also As well As How To Maintain The Freshness Of Foods. Co Workers Are Pretty Down To Earth And Calm Natured But Things Can Get A Little Hectic In Such A Fast Paced Place. Best Thing Was The Food And Seeing How It Was Prepared And Learning From The Managers To Use In Your Life No Matter Where You Go."
good,The fun you have here is directly related to the happiness of the customer. So as long as you have a smile and do a good job you'll most likely have a good day. Close to your co-workers so hopefully you all get along.
good,"Very professional work enviroment, clean work space, worked alot of hours."
good,"Loved working at Wendy's and would love to continue to work at Wendy's, but being a college student, I need to find a job that can provide more hours. I learned a decent amount about respect, tolerance and safety concerns. I enjoyed everyday working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working until 1 a.m. but the most enjoyable was the environment I worked in."
good,"Wendys is a great place to start and end a career, if the owner/ operators are serious about their employees the sky is the limit for growth in the company"
good,"they really worked around my life schedule, including high school, and family issues."
good,"a day at work was always busy,busy busy, me and employees learned how to work as a team and how to have rapid fast customer service.the hardest part of the job was the labor the easiest part of the job was the slow days we had when there was hardly any customers ."

good,"I was in school, first job, and i really had fun.I was cashier when i started, moved to sandwiches, side window, back register, and last the grill.It was exciting and encouraging"
good,Although it was a privately owned business and didnt offer many benefits it was a great place to work. There were great people and it was a very rewarding job
good,Working in a fast food restaurant will teach a person how to work with many types of personalities.
good,"This was a part time job for a high school student. I feel that this job help me be a little more grounded and help me get an ideal on how to manage time, money, and work. I had great co-workers. At that age dealing with the customers were hard, but i got thur it and I feel that it help me to be the person that I am now."
good,fun but to much drama in the work place. complaints for customers about noise but it was worth the experience.
good,this is a fastphase job where you actually have to move all parts of your body but its a nice place to meet new people and new friends and a great place to have practice or gain knowledge about customer service
good,"This job Is the longest job I have ever held. A typical day at work was stressful, constantly doing other higher managers jobs. Management was ok depending on who was managing that day. My co-workers, some were pretty lazy, others worked hard. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn new things that were not apart of my job description because others would not do their jobs. But the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my regular customers. They always came in and put a smile on my face, and I always felt great when they enjoyed their stay."
good,"Fast paced workplace. I lewarned a lot there. I learned how to use a cash register as well as proper customer service. The managment was fun and yet still very firm to get what needed to be done, done."
good,Everyday was tiring the managers were very childish. I learned that in some work environments you have to be bigger person in the situation whether you a regular worker or just an employee. The co workers were ok but also reserved.

good,"I can honestly say that working at Wendy's for my first job was a very smart move. It was a great way to introduce me into the job world. To make a career out of it though would not be wise. For people who are just entering the job market, I would advice working there."
good,its was an overall great place to work decent advancement room.
good,It was good I like how they ran they company it was a good job becomes of where I live but it was some bad stuff and it like it wasn’t clean good and I had to do everything
good,"it is an amazing workplace to built speaking and listening skills and helps in chasing and carving interpersonal skills. Also, one learns how to multitask."
good,"On a typical day, especially during lunch and dinner hours, it gets extremely busy, but manage to work through it with correct number of staff. Usually two to three supervisors and managers, plus up to six crew members. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and coworkers. The hardest part is keeping work area clean during busy times and when the district manager is present and oversees what each individual is doing. Some of the management staff were friendly and understanding of my abilities to complete my duties, whereas some others didn’t."
good,"I had a good experience at Wendy's up til the end of my employment.  The other employees made working there enjoyable ! I was a manager in training towards the end an that's when it got difficult . I was a cashier, food handler, food prep, an I cleaned almost every part of that store at one point ."
good,"Been a long time since I worked here, but overall, I liked it. Benefits took a little longer to kick in than I would have liked. "
good,"Most of my time at Wendy's was a good experience, I love my regulars who would come in asked for me by name so that I could make their meal the way they wanted it. The rest of my time at Wendy's was not as good and it usually had to deal with those at the top. Along with a high turnover rate."
good,They Hardest Part Was The Night Shift Having To Clean Everything Up From When It Was Busy. The Managers There Were Cool At Times We Would Have Fun But When It’s Time To Be Serious We Had To Stop
good,Very friendly and professional both staff and managers! Very understanding and willing to work around your schooling schedule. Should I mention that the food is great?
good,I liked my job because it was something I knew. I had been working for the Wendy's company for years and I just worked. I loved my customers. They made the day go by and enjoyed my services.
good,"Working for wendy’s, varies on the location of the store. Very fast pace and can be very challenging if you are not a multitasker but the job will help in that area. Also great first start job, will work on your customer service and patience along with team work with other employees."
good,I always had the best time working at Wendy's because I was working with friends and we made it fun while we were there and we always did great work no matter what
good,Good place to get your first job at.  Everyone was nice an cool to work with. Only bad part about this job was no hours an low pay. Good things was that they would work around school.
good,"For it being my first job I didn't work for long there. However I learned that not everything had to be done extremely quickly, how to work well with customers, and how to work under stress. My only complaint at the store I worked at was I felt like some if most of my co-workers didn't care. Management was great."
good,I always enjoyed the fast pace of fast food. The people that worked there were always enthusiastic and full of energy that really improved the work environment.
good,at first i was the salad prepper and then they would rotate me to front line and the fry station. I learned customer service and productivity.management were awsome.
good,It Was Okay To Me I Got Along Very Well There An I Was Comfortable Also Because I Was Working With Two Of My Family Members While I Was Working There I Enjoyed My Time While I was There Very Well.
good,"Wendy's servers didn't have to walk outside all the time to serve foods, unless we had to take food to those who wanted something fixed. The experience was awesome."
good,"Fun paced environment to work at, always busy and active. Also can have a good pay and the mobile apps is quick to have a pick up out and great customer service."
good,"This place was not bad to work at, that is if we have enough staff to run shifts. That is typically where things take a turn. Management is scrambling and gets frustrated very easily at the staff that DID show up to their shifts, meanwhile there seemed to be no repercussions for missing work constantly. That is the only thing that made the place unbearable. Aside from that customers were almost always great, in almost two years working there, I can say that I only had a handful of situations in which I had a hard time with a customer."
good,It was a good business setting to help me further in my work ethic it was good cuz it had good personalities that teach you how to interact with people in to deal with customers in a humble manner
good,"Everyone had fun with each other during their shifts, but when it got busy it sometimes became hard to get everything to well on time. Overall, it was a an enjoyable job to have."
good,"I’m a good person to be around I have good vibes and I like to meet new people "

good,"I found it to be both challenging and rewarding, My co-workers are collaborative and my superiors are supportive. Training has been provided to ensure efficiency in the workplace."
good,Good job for high school student or someone looking for a career in fast food industry.  Very fast paced working and decent working environment for learning
good,Working here wasn't the best but it was mostly because of the customers rather than the company. Once you get in the flow of things you really start to succeed.
good,They work with you on certain situations you may come across. Fast pace environment at times. Laid back place to work majority of the time. Will train you on pretty much anything you want to learn and willing to learn.
good,It is a great first job and teaches you a lot about business if you would like to move up into management. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to try something fast paced.
good,It's a good  company to work because includes different kind of people and they help to you to learn new things in the work so you can feel comfortable.
good,This is a great place for someone just starting out in the work force or just looking for a place to earn a little bit of extra money. The staff and management are usually fun to be around and do not mind helping out when its needed.
good,Fully enjoyed working there. Would definitely do it again. I liked working with and for the customers. It made me happy to know that they were pleased and would return because of my work.
good,There's nothing bad or good i could say about the company i just work as my job describe it so i dont see the point of this review and have a great day
good,"My typical day at work included receiving orders, helping to complete those orders, cleaning the dining area and bathrooms, and cleaning trays. I also helped with restocking things in the cooler. I learned how to prioritize and work hard as a time to be the best Wendys in town. My managers always encouraged me to do my best and succeed in the job. They were also super understanding of my class schedule and made adjustments when needed."
good,"Wendy's has been around for quite a while. Making it a very popular choice for lunch and dinner. Whenever we knew we would be busy, the management would make sure to have enough people working that no one felt overwhelmed by the lunch rush."
good,"Its A Good Environment To Be In,"
good,For a fast food place this company was well diverse and clean with caring about the customer satisfaction first and having a positive environment for all people
good,I was working 5 days a week from 4 PM to 3 in the morning. The reason I want to leave is cause the paid wasn't livable on. So I need to find a better paying career.
good,Its a good company to work for. They really build a family if you stay long enough. Its alot of multitasking and the pay is not really worth it at all.
good,Coming into work you usually knew what you were doing. I learn how to keep a businesses running and how to control a crew. Managers were nice. The hardest part of the job was keeping things from breaking. I loved my crew members and the costumers.
good,"Wendys is a great place. Amazing staff , and everyone so nice , havent had a problem with anyone there , great food , and i recommend this place to everyone i know"
good,I loved every bit of Wendy’s just not the traveling part I could laugh with the coworkers joke with everybody and the store work was very easy beings though everyone was cool
good,Ran shift cleaned store fright counted tills maintenance cleaning parking lot and outside of store great and talk with customers about the quality of their food and visit
good,I was only a kid when I worked there so my work schedule was limited. Management helped to work around my school schedule and offered as many hours as they could to someone who was underage. I liked the service they offered.
good,How to become a good sales person And be respectful to other people and responsibleAnd how to control my angerAnd how to handle myself one situation go down
good,Good job got along with everyone but the one male manager he’s nasty and weird I learned all the steps very fast my boss was caring and helpful ur like a family at Wendy’s
good,it is a great family oriented business. in this  day and age of fast food Wendy's still offered a healthier choice options and with a smile. it isnt  hard work but more repetition
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.Its a very busy place to work.Like any other restaurants,no weekends off unless you requested it.The management team are great people to work with.Everyone works as a team"
good,My over all experience with wendys was great the first time around we had a good hard working crew and I was almost bumped to management until I was allergic to the dish soap and quit. The second time around wasn't the best it was like everyone lost interest in producing quality food for the costumer.
good,I was a cashier at Wendy's I loved every minute of my work there. I liked the fast paced that it gave me. I like to work at a fast pace it makes the day go by faster.
good,Agotador pero aprendes demasiado un ambiente de familia
good,I’m a very reliable worker.Good and fast learner and a good cook and back room worker as well. I can get along with other crew members and I’m good at learning sandwiches
good,"I'll start by saying  this is they longest I've ever worked for a place, theres times where we are short staffed and it sucks. And sometimes the managers are nit picky and there's not a lot of positive feedback from certain managers to the people under them"
good,Wendy’s has grown so much to try new things new ideas to make the costumers happy and want to go back to Wendy’s because it’s a loving family restaurant that sees potential in peoples growth
good,I Would Work For Wendy’s Again. it Was Great Pay Great Hours & Very Good People. The Customers were friendly. They Also Will Rehire If I’m Interested.
good,Highly developed direct reports. Fast paced. Results oriented environment. Generous bonus package. Health insurance is lacking. Director lacks effective leadership skills.
good,when i worked at this company they respected and me as a crew member  at this company. At the Wend's i worked the people i worked with did care about me there and would work there again.
good,"It's been a while since I worked here but it's a great place to start. As a high schooler the pay was decent, but there wasn't much room for growth there."
good,Wendys is a great place to work if you are able to keep up with the fast pace work environment. Customers are usually fantastic and management and supervisors are fair and diligent
good,"a typical day at work "
good,"It was nice there , overall their employees were funny and very out spoken.I did not like the attitude of the employees. But when they were bringing new food. They were good at doing that."
good,"The pace is a bit hard to get used to but once you do the job will seem like a breeze, Very fun place to work at! I honestly recommend this job for people who are looking for good hours!"
good,It’s the same as any fast food job there are slow times and fast times good days and bad days but in the end if its what you like go for it and work hard to move up.
good,its just a regular fast food place.. not set schedule not well paid but flexible and understanding if you are in school. they also offer free meals to managers.
good,It is a great place to work.i always had a good experience during my shifts. It's a fast paced environment. The pay period falls on the beginning of the week which is nice.
good,"Working there in 2016 was a stressful job at that year, but I went back and seen that it is a new management team and everything and the works in the back i know very well and tells me it’s different and not as stressful as it used to be."
good,"I like to move up in company and i did not and i work there for 3yrs trained ppl who became managers.Assisted in the preparation of food for student/faculty dining halls, and catered events, "
good,It was a good experience working and making my own money for the first time and I learned a lot about money. I also learned team skills and skills that would benefit me working by myself.
good,Fast paced team work. When it all comes together it is actually fun.  The number of inspections can be distracting.  Wendy’s has been around since 1969.  Known for quality and fast service they have weathered a lot of storms. Operations and procedures are very detailed.  For those who love routines this is for you!  Tools are in place to help train yourself and crew.
good,This flexible hours they will work with you. And it's not a trick working environment very relaxed and there's not a whole bunch of work to do and pretty much anyone can do that type of work and training is only like a day or two but you kind of still on as you go hand easy to understand what you're doing as well.
good,Im good qorking with people and i believe that i have a great work ethic with going through all the things that i have delt qith qhile working at wendys
good,"Made money, they are your typical fast  food restaurant. depending on location and profit company sees you may not get as many hours as you want but its what you make of it"
good,"Worked there my whole life almost 21 years. It was a great place to work when we had staff and support from everyone.  "
good,"Very family oriented, loving crew. They looked out for one another and help each other out. Even though i was forced to leave if I could go back I would."
good,I had to make sure the lobby and drive-thru area was stocked with the proper items. Had to keep the restrooms and lobby cleaned. Took at the trash when needed.
good,In my opinion i think wendys is good because it helps u work on your teamwork/communication skills;I also think wendys is good because by working at food joint u have to be respectful to everybody and u will nee that in life to get promoted up the ranks interms of promotion from any company.
good,"After working for them for three years, This job has been more stressful than I can enjoy, but I did have smooth shifts sometimes, so I recommend only as a start."
good,"wendy’s was my favorite job i’ve had so far and it taught me a lot.i unfortunately had to leave due to family issues and school, but i appreciate my time with them and will carry the skills they gave me throughout life."
good,its a cool starter job but i need more pay and benefits for me and my family i think they need to hire more minority if you ask me but other than that its a cool job
good,"Typical fast food chain, easy to work at with lots of consistency. Management was overall pleasant, the other workers were hard workers and didn't slack. Overall a very put together place."
good,it was fun to work with friends and make free food and drinks all day. not good on my weight though but i would go back. i love the food and the commradere
good,"Your average fast food experience, pay is okay if you agree to close a certain number of times a week. No benefits if you're not a manager and there's a policy where they basically try to shaft you on your pay if you come in on days off because they're supposed to pay a little more but they try to keep people in the dark about that so they don't have to."
good,Overall it was a good experience I had a good manger and we did a lot of different things . I got introduced to food prepping and dealing with customers Wendys was a good for me
good,If you live working at a very fast paced environment constantly standing then it’s the place for you.I would not recommend it for anyone but it’s a good first start to get that work experience.
good,Buena en cuanto al conocimiento adquirido. Pero le falta organización.
good,We can learn many things . Customer service food handling team work etc it has good environment. All crew members are very co operative . Every one help each other
good,Company have teach me the necessary skills to grow and become an excellent Management skills. This company have mold me to become efficient in everything I do.
good,"got to learn lots of things."
good,This was a fun place to work. I worked very hard here. I also meet some fun people along the way which meant a lot to me then. I learned how to balance my income and responsibilities as this was my first job. I also managed my professionalism at all times.
good,This job was great while I was in high school looking for part time employment to help put extra cash into my pockets. They scheduled your fairly and offered great amount of hours to work.
good,Liked working there every one is very helpful and training is available at the site give your hands on training and one on one training as well I like the people that worked with me
good,"Wendy's was a fun job for me, it helped me deal with stressful situations and it was rewarding at the end. I worked with great people and our work environment was pretty clean, all I have to say is get ready to smell like grease."
good,"Wendy's provides a great team atmosphere and a fast paced work environment that can teach many skills that can be used in all aspects of life, including other jobs in the future.  It is a perfect place to gain experience for those just entering the workforce as well as a satisfying and fun place to work for the experienced employees."
good,"Often got along with co-workers."
good,Wendy’s has been decent but has a “ make change when problem happens environment” instead of taking initiative as we are trained to do the management allows things to happen as long g as it’s not a problem and doesn’t correct all of the issues necessary to run a shift
good,"Entraba a trabajar alas 4 del a tarde.,llegaba directamente a pinchar tarjeta después medirijia a mi puesto de trabajo al frente interior como cajero dentro del restaurante. Para recibir cantidades de órdenes de los clientes"
good,"Me considero una persona responsable y trabajadora. Manejo siempre buenas relaciones personales. Tengo capasidad de trabajar bajo presión y me gusta trabajar en grupo. Soy una persona líder, cooperadora y me esfuerzo por lograr metas en el trabajo."
good,"I worked at Wendy's during my sophomore year of high school and it gave me good experience in janitorial work, cashiering, and customer service, and gave me steady closing shifts to accommodate my school schedule. Management was understanding when I requested certain time off for extracurriculars and when I put in my two weeks. They did require I take out my nose ring during work hours which lead to it getting damaged and infected, and I had to get rid of it entirely after a while."
good,"Working in the kitchen was fun sometimes, but a lot of the time it was stressful or confusing, and everything is so fast paced and stressful for everyone else there too, the more experienced workers included that no one ever had time to really explain anything in a hands on way, leaving me to use videos on a computer to learn, but that didn't help much. It was...stressful."
good,Working at Wendy's was fun. I learned how to make food and help people be happy. Management was cool and friendly. The hardest part of the job was the fast moving pace. The most enjoyable part was making people happy and making friends. I quit because I had to focus on school. I have since graduated.
good,I had to deal with different people everyday and I had to learn that everyone isn’t the same. I had to learn how to control my self in order to make the customers happy
good,Well working at this establishment was very stressful but then at the same time it help me get through my rough times and the management could have been better and it was always short-staffed so we would stay in there longer than we would expect to clean up but other than that I actually like working at the establishment
good,Stay to yourself and work and u will be ok I loved the experience and I worked 2 years for the starboard company but I don't like the pay rates it's alot of work for so little pay
good,"Although the management was tough, I was always pushed to do my best and it was very rewarding! The crew was very nice and productive and the managers although not the best still supported and tried there best."
good,"If your just getting out of high school, or need a part time job Wendy's is the place."
good,The manger at Wendys was so disrespectful made me have me a choice for Wendys and football so I quit for football. She would always talk about how much money she made the management was just terrible and so was the hours.
good,It's an okay job just to get on your feet but not a long term job. It's more for the high school kids are older people. Overall the job is good but could have better benefits.
good,The hardest part of the job is getting more ice at the ice tray and cleaning up the stuff out of the fridge. The most enjoyable part of the job is cleaning the dining table at Wendy's.
good,"count what we have left and then prep what we need for the day, put bacon in then at 10 we open then, they will put us where they need up. take care of people, clean the dinner room."
good,"Wendy’s really ain’t so bad to work at, me I’m just looking for better for myself and family and difficulty more pay. Just wanna became important for my family."
good,"This being my second Wendy's restaurant I worked for, I came in knowing a great deal of amount of information. It was a fun experience and ended with me having to relocate and switch jobs."
good,Great Customer Service . Good Working environment. Customers are great as well as the crew! Fast Fast As An Like Fast Food !good Place To Be And A Good Place To Eat !
good,"I love going into work only to see smiling faces and hear my name being called by one of my coworkers or managers saying hello. I made friends, improved my communication skills, improved my multi-tasking abilities and it was a nice first job to have. Still enjoy my job until this day but I am looking for something more. The management was really kind and helpful when I required it. I was a quick learner for the most part. The hardest part of the job would be when it got really busy, both inside and at the drive-thru and I would have to go back and forth from both since we were understaffed at the time. It's also really hard to work when it's hot outside , made the place somewhat unbearable. I really enjoyed helping customers, their children, and making more hours than I had hoped for."
good,"Wendy's was a very exciting workplace to be in. I met new people and gain plenty of experience from them. They each you to be polite at all times and customers were always right. To whomever is to work there is a very lucky person, they will enjoy their work experience."
good,wendys gives great opportunity for employment while helping you to grow and move forward. it is a great place to work whether you are just starting or expanding you work experience
good,Same days are better than others. Some days you are so busy you start and next thing you know it's about time to go. Other days you feel like you are there forever. But downtime is good too because then you can get the cleaning done that needs to be done.
good,"Very productive workplace and a friendly/fun environment. Working at this company showed me how to multitask, work through rushes, and to become very social."
good,Working for Wendys was a really fast paced job that kept me on my feet and helped me become more comfortable with people and dealing with multiple things at once.
good,I loved working here! They took care of their employees. I had alot of fun! I learned alot and achieved alot while working here as well. I would definitely recommend this work place.
good,When fully staffed it is a awesome place to work at if not you are required to pick-up extra shifts.Some guests can be very demanding but we do our best to make them happy.
good,This was my first job I've ever had and I was there for almost 4 years. The last manager that was there made me hate working there. I was not impressed with how they handled things like when they have a problem with you they would scream at you in front of everyone instead of taking you to the office to speak with you.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, got along with everyone, not a person who likes to work fast food. I enjoyed talking to the public that came in. I love interacting with the community."
good,"Working at Wendys was a pleasure. Because of the location of my university being in a different town, I had to move, and quit working for the restaurant. Wendy's helped to train me in a fast-paced work environment, and on how to work best under stress. Some days were fairly difficult, but most flew by, and work was actually sort of fun."
good,In a days work your tasks vary. You could be helping customers up front or bagging their food at the drive through window. Maybe making sandwiches and salads. As well as cleaning around the restaurant .
good,"I loved working here because all my coworkers were like family. I'd say it's a pretty decent place to work and depending on the restaurant you work in, they might let you have free food, which is pretty cool. Don't push that one though, LOL. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all kinds of different people whether it was a customer or a co worker. The training here is video based and there's a lot of videos to watch. The hardest part of the job was cleaning and it was definitely not very fun since there was a lot, but my store was also understaffed for the most part. Overall, I really enjoyed working at Wendy's and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a fast-paced work environment and working with customer service."
good,Great place to work past paced keeps you on your feet good benefits pay ok.need better job more hours something to learn more about and work my way up
good,Wendy's is a great place to work for just starting out. helps you get the understanding of working before you get out of high school. Gives you great customer experience while working there
good,Very fast paced and multi-tasking environment. You get to enhance your customer service skills and your communication as well.You get the feel of money handling and also beating quotas and making your store hit its numbers.
good,This is a great place to learn the value of a dollar. there is always something to do. they make you clean or restock thing if it's slow. I also took out the garbage constantly
good,Wendy's is a great place to get started when you of unsure of what it is you want in life. Career options are available at any job but by far Wendy's may have a promising future for those looking into a management position at a young age
good,"Management was lacking, they could never separate personal life’s for work life’s. Other than that great work experience learned a lot. Management was the companies biggest down fall."
good,"I got hired at wendy's at the age of 16 it was my first job. I worked at wendy's until I was 18, it was a great experience and bought me my first car."
good,Wendy’s can be a good place to work at if you are well with people and it isn't very hard. I find it to be easy and it is better than manual labor. If you work just a little hard it is easy pay and pretty fun but it can have its ups and downs.
good,"fun first job. not much else to say you make sandwiches, deep fry fries, flip burgers, take orders, make orders day in and day out. clean stuff that is about it"
good,The other employees were fun to work with and I had a good time working there. I was paid a good amount and I was treated fairly there. The environment was satisfying.
good,I loved it while I was there. I really enjoyed working with my closing team. We built a bond a created a system that mad our nights fly by. My closing manager  was awesome and always worked twice as hard.
good,"Starting wage in my area is $10.00/hr. In my restaurant, I found little, to no room for advancement. It would be a good first part-time job for a high school student seeking to make some money over the summer."
good,"It was an okay job. It is enough money to get what you need. The pay I feel should go up. Working there is easy, but sometimes the hours are long. Getting discounts on food was awesome."
good,I enjoy meeting all the people I worked with there. I also gain some new friends by working there and it help me open up more from being a shy person.
good,"Very fast paced, but also the workers work hard to give out efficient orders. Collaborated with crew members to ensure fast and efficient quality service."
good,"Great environment to understand the basics of a job, i.e., teaching time management, handling the different type of people and dealing with stressful situations. A typical day usually was medium paced. The front counter would have one or two rushes- an influx of six or more customers- throughout the day. Drive through have more rushes; however, there's still small cool off periods where you can take a short break. The hardest part of the job is call-offs and summer rushes. Most of the time, it would go hand and hand. A lot of people would call off, and we'll be understaffed to the point where you'll most likely do more than three jobs at once while dealing a with a rush of impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is you'll get a lot of friendly customers, especially if you're helpful to them. Most of the other employees will help you when you're struggling and are kind. But longterm the stress can get to you, and you won't have much time to be with family or even friends."
good,I worked for a franchise and the bosses were kinda not there for their people. The employees how ever were great and made work go by quick. I just felt like since they were owners they only worried about the income than anything else to make their team happy
good,I enjoyed working there until the new owners took over. Culture changed immediately and not for the better. Made a decision to leave based on desire for something better.
good,I don't mind my coworkers but working with food is getting old and being in a new area would be the best for me. A good first job. Learned how to work with a register and handle money. Hardest part is standing and constant business on the weekends. Most enjoyable is honestly when it's slow or if i'm on break. Management is really good so no worries there.Overall a good place but not for me.
good,"It was very much the same thing as the other two restaurants, you would get more added to your plate, due to people doing their tasks incorrectly or just being AWOL. They were just about themselves & seemed to not care for their coworkers."
good,"It was a relatively simple job, but required some hard work. It wasn't a great job, but it was okay. The pay was terrible, but the managers and fellow employees were decent."
good,quick paced and fun . the employees was friendly and so were the customers. they job didn't pay much for my liking.and theres not a lot of benefits. great for first time job experience
good,"Great training, encouragement and compensation. Good leadership and opportunities for new and experienced employees. Enjoyed But I moved away and had to find other employment"
good,"Working here is a great place to work, we all strive for the best and owners and GM do an amazing job. I am looking for a career and not just a job. I will miss this place when I leave"
good,Must be able to work fast and communicate well with team. It's fun and you get discounts on food. Most coworkers are great. Sometimes you get free food
good,"Coworkers are amazing, as well as management. Environment was nice, very welcoming staff. The job keeps you very productive, teamwork is necessary for this job."
good,"i loved working for my General Manager, she was the best. The owners of this restuarant were not capable of managing so many stores. The owners were only concerned about making money. Did not care about thei emploees."
good,i worked at Wendys for about a year and a half i worked at drive thru and at the front counter. i have cleaned toilets and made sure everything was okay.
good,Working at Wendy's taught me patience and understanding. Although it is fast food there are so many things to learn from everyone. So many different types of people come in everyday and you have to learn to handle them individually. It is fun getting to know the people for the community and seeing them come in everyday just to say hey.
good,"I worked there my last 2 years in high school and 1 year after I graduated, my pay only went up 75 cents from the entire time I worked there, closing is better than opening if you don’t mind getting up early"
good,"i loved working at wendys , getting along with all of my cowrokers. The pay wasnt good for me because i had to provide for my son on top of paying for bills."
good,they are an ok company to work for but not the best one out there sometimes they wouldn't work with your schedule and I have two kids that need me and depend on me so if you have kids under the age of ten years of age I wouldn't recommend them
good,"A typical day at wendy's would be working as a team to make sure ends meet, making sure everyone has the proper tools to complete each task that is assigned."
good,"Wendy's restaurant was a very fun and relaxed but also fast pasted work environment. The Wendy's location in Atlanta, Ga. on piedmont road does open interviews with same day hiring."
good,Coworkers are great and so is management. Customers can be tough due to the location being downtown. It can be stressful and you might have to stay longer.
good,It a fun and exciting workplace and they treat you like your at home I jus got tired of  the fast food business and wanted to do something new it kept me busy tho
good,"Managers were nice. Wendys is fast paced, stressful at times. Learned many different kinds of combination of sandwiches. The other employees were kind and helped me out if I needed it."
good,A good place to eat and doesn't cost much also a quality place to spend time together with friends. All the team members are helpful and are always ready to help their co-workers and always ready to clearify the customers doubt.
good,Working at Wendy’s is not bad at all. Besides people who have problems at home and then take them to work and messes everyone else’s work day up. I personally would not go back to Wendy’s but for a young working beginner I would reccomend.
good,it is a productive fast paced work environment where you are always doing something hardly lets you sit and rest with how busy you get. If there are no customers you are cleaning the store so that it looks good for inspections and other customers to have a good dining experience.
good,"The amount of business received varied based on time of day, typically slowing down significantly after 7. The work is never difficult when working with a solid team. The hardest part is dealing with rushes especially as one of the employees that cooks or assembles the food"
good,"I operated the Point of Sale system, handled cash, prepared and cooked food, and kept work area clean, stocked, and organized. I learned that its important to work as a team. the workplace culture was fast-paced and exciting. The hardest part of the job was handling difficult customers. The most enjoyable was working as a team to help customers."
good,"A typical day at for Wendy's consists of me stocking the used condiments,storing the nuggets,fries and patties on line . set up grill placing the right temperature as well as all other burners. Iv learned to stay ahead of speed of service,maintain freshly grilled patties nuggets and fries in timley manner .. I learned to open and close the restaurant as well. The hardest part of the job is not doing the job good enough to know the daily routine of running a restaurant.. The most enjoyable part about the job is realizing How much my hard work and customer service skills guided a part of the company's GROWTH."
good,If everyone worked together everything would be fine. There's too much drama in that specific work place the store manager is too busy trying to. E in everyone's business
good,"As a customer before I decided to work for Wendy's I Visited Wendy's in Columbia, Mo. I ordered a salad for my daughter, a 4 for 4 for my other daughter and a grilled chicken sandwich with fries for me. The sandwich was cold and the fries were cold. I asked for a replacement sandwich of fried chicken sandwich. That sandwich was ok but very cold. I’ve never had a problem at Wendy’s before. I will, however, give them another chance. I was quite disappointed as it was a cold rainy day and I wanted a warm meal. Maybe I should have waited until I got home for the meal."
good,"worked at Wendy's part-time for more than a year"
good,Everything got done in a timely manner. Everyone got along really well. The customer's always seem to come back time and time again. It was a union job. And if you were struggling with a drug or alcohol problem they wouldn't just fire you they would work with you to get into some sort of treatment and give you a chance at getting your job back.
good,"Great experience, fast pace work environment. Great beginner job for those getting into the employment race.. Had several opportunities become a manager and advance."
good,"What else can you really say? It is your typical fast food chain job. It's a great place if you are young and just figuring things out. However, you would have to be there a long time to see any real or significant professional growth."
good,Great place to work the co-workers made my job there. Very much enjoyed my regular customers providing the orders and speaking on first name basis. Great job for anyone looking to please the public.
good,All workers are nice and very easy to work with and so was management. Customers are typically very easy to work with so long as you're patient and understanding.
good,"nothing it was a summer job, so i dont know how it was. I'm just writing this because it is mandatory. Wendy's is a good place to work. I hope you have a nice day."
good,"Usually enough work to keep you busy all day.  Sometimes had to go looking for things to do.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere. Not much variation in the job duties. Great place to work when you have kids due to ideal of family comes first."
good,"I really enjoyed working for wendys, I needed to stay home with my son and all my peers were wonderful very friendly amd we all worked together quit well for the most part."
good,"Varies in shifts. Someday I'll be there from 6am to 2 pm. Someday I'll do a mid shift or a night shift. You get to know all different customers and all different workers. The manager tries her best managing the schedule with the hours she is given by the owner. Sometimes those hours are ridiculous and we don't have much people to work with us.The job is harder when there isn't that many hands in the kitchen, especially when we get random rushes. The best part of the job is the strength and connections of the people I work with."
good,belle equipe bel endroit avec de bonne personnes mais beaucoup de travail pour petit salaire comme dans tout les fast food
good,Its been along time since I worked at Wendy's but I remember it being a nice experience. I actually got engaged to a co worker many years later but without Wendy's we would of never met. Otherwise it was pretty stressful and quick paced.
good,"management was horrible but the staff included you and made you feel welcomed, during rush hours it gets very hectic so dont mess up any orders or else"
good,wendys is a decent place to work for. ive worked here three separate times. we are like a close knit family here. i like it but i dont plan on staying here for the rest of my life. im just looking for change now. its a very easy job.
good,"good for a short term job, but some of the management is a little off their hinges. always short handed, but the customer base is wonderful, just not a permanent job."
good,At Wendy’s we had to really work fast and work hard because we would really get packed but I had to leave because of the distance. Wendys is really fun they give you great discounts and the co workers are fun
good,Great place to work great hours and opportunities to have a career and make a difference. The energy is just wonderful smiling is always a part of the uniform.
good,Typical work days were busy. I learned that it takes communication to make things go smoothly. Management was hard working and organized. Things went well when everyone went above and beyond to get everything done even if it meant doing things were not assigned to them to for the day. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the fryers and the most enjoyable part was making sure customers had the best experience and were happy with our services.
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's a lot. But sometimes it is quite diffcuilt to get the costumers orders right when their trucks are loud, they do not speak loud enough for us to hear them or they will not repeat themselves when asked a question."
good,"A typical day for me was coming in in the morning and working on the cash register and or making sandwiches."
good,"Typical day at work start at morning 10:00 AM"
good,Wendy’s was generally a fast paced job no matter the position. There was always something to do. My co-workers were all nice and made me feel like an essential part of the team.
good,Not my problem Wendy's okay place to work I have some manager that were difficult that did not want to let me forget progressed but also has some managers that wanted to see me succeed and go further
good,"most things were made fresh, we had a pretty fast paced. hardest part about the job was window drive through & to keep up the timer. Everyday is always a busy except occasionally when its pouring outside."
good,"It's nice working there,the environment is quite. Everyone works as a team to get the job done everybody's helping one another and it's very relaxing to be honest"
good,"Good starting job with available hours to work around school schedule,  food discounts, and also including great staff and coworkers to help maintain a safe, fun, and productive work environment."
good,"It was a interesting place to work. You are constantly busy, during lunch time especially. you have to be a team player for things to run smoothly. Not being arrogant or anything, but I became employee of the month twice within a six month period. Not bad for an old man."
good,The Culture of Wendy's was amazing! The company was employee focused. They made sure that all employees felt like they were just as important as the CEO.
good,"Making sure operational practices of all stores making sure each runs smoothly, cleanly and meets any budget and sales goals and is complying with any marketing campaigns and promotions."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the management was nice and helpful when you needed it. I enjoyed my coworkers. The only problem were the hours, it was very difficult to get a day off, and you only get paid minimum wage."
good,"Might need better employee assessment, and less flammable."
good,if you don't like working in a fast paced environment this isn't the job for you and although there is room for growth they only need you for a higher position if someone steps down or is fired
good,"A typical day at wendys is make sure ll employees re doing the work, making sure all our customer are satified, I learn how to give the best customer service, the hardest part is the schedule."
good,"As far as a fast food restaurant, it was kept very clean and up to date. Management was mostly professional and everyone got along well and did their part."
good,"Good job, great people! I did feel over worked and exerted while working there. Breaks were not made a priority. However; management was good about communication with their crew members."
good,I loved working at Wendy’s the environment was amazing and my manager was the best. She was strict but she still had fun. If I could go back with higher pay I would .
good,Love the work atmosphere enjoyed the opportunity that they provided for you to have as you worked there you can always move up as long as your willing to put in the work
good,"Wendy's is a good place to work you just have to have patience.it is very laid back, Wendy's give discounts on the food once you have earned them. It's a good job"
good,Once you clock in its already busy most of the time so you have to come prepared and be ready to be moving because its a quick pace environment. i improved my communication skills because there's a lot of talking if its either communicating with your co-workers or customers.
good,"When I was working their, it felt like family to me. They were very welcoming. They also were very helpful during the training. The one thing that bothered me was how much they pushed for fast service like it was the last drink of water. But I like working fast but some times it was too much."
good,"I started working for wendy's at the age of 21. i learn how to better communicate and of course, customer service. i learned that teamwork plpays a huge role."
good,Wendy's was fast paced with everything. It all must have been done in a quick and timely fashion. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the ice cream machine.
good,I was a cashier. They have good benefits and have flexible hours. They are understanding and try with you to make your experience with them a good one.
good,"It was a new Wendy's..well it's still new. Only about a year old. This Wendy's is unique because it it the only one in the city of Perris, compared to the nearest Wendy's in Sun City, or Trautwein."
good,Having this job as a teenager would be great as it teaches you about responsibilities and how to be a team player. It also teaches you to be self sufficient at the same time as you would want to be able to handle the job.
good,"Wendys was a good experience and helped me gain intel on how customer service works. Friendly people, hard work sometimes. Sometimes it gets super busy but with the right people everything goes smoothly."
good,I get to learn every job type within Wendy's and it helped me understand of what its like to work at a fast-paced environment while learning the customer-service routine.
good,"It was a fun place to work at overall but when I finally got my life together, I left there and got on with my life. Management was great there as well."
good,"the location where I worked had a strict manager who always made sure that everyone did what they were supposed to be doing. Not only that, she wanted us to stay busy or look like we were. I appreciated the fact that it was important to keep a clean lobby for diners and condiments stocked at all times. Not like other competing businesses. Wendy's in most ive been too were always clean."
good,"it was stressful at times and others where prity relaxed, most of the time your focused on making sure things where fresh and out with in 115 seconds."
good,The restaurant is well staffed and clean but service could be quicker. The store is old and in need of a remodel and has equipment repair and maintenance issues which need to be addressed
good,I like working at wendy's but I was new to fast-paced job environment so it was easy at first but after practicing I began to get used to to it. I think they should stop rushing to prepared people food.
good,Very flexible with scheduling great company opportunity to grow and develop vacation and sick paid holidays paid bonuses a very friendly company good salary
good,I oftentimes felt underappreciated. Did a lot of the cleaning and grunt work yet felt near the end of my tenure management had moved away from a food employee reward program. I enjoyed my coworkers for the most part and would still recommend the job to others.
good,Everyone should experience food service. It was a great place to learn patience and appreciate fast food workers. Also very fast paced environment and exciting.
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers and the managment made it a very nice place to work. They took care of there employees and cared about the job they were doing.
good,this is this wends on ford road and southfield service drive. the crew was nice and the managers didn't mind stepping out the office to help out......
good,Working in the fast food industry is way different and cool loved it there clean and not slippery environment costumers for wonderful we did everything and was very busy loved it at Wendy's if I had to go back I would just to say hi
good,"During the day it isn’t to busy, but mid afternoon it’s busy sometimes overwhelmed because everyone shows up. Staff making sure everyone receive their orders. Great team effort and positive attitude. Cleaning environment and facilities."
good,"Great company to work for, if your in the fast food industry theirs management positions available. Need to have great customer service and patience dealing with customers. Great environment for fast paste workers."
good,Everything is very easy. You have to be the one to put effort in. Some days make be hard and you can also lose track but you will get back on track. Just keep doing what you’re doing and always respect the customer and others.
good,"Working hard pays off at the end, I don’t like drama and I love people who respect me and respect others. I am willing to fix any problems that go on or that will go on."
good,my son was sick he had to do breathing treatments so it made me late or had to call off if breathing treatment didn't work then they cut my days down to 1 day a week so i left. i would have stayed but the assistant district manager didn't like me as well. so i felt like i wouldn't have been able to move up.
good,"This was overall the best job I've ever had. I would recommend this job to anyone as a starter. It's a fast paced fun filled job. You can grow very quick with the company. However, management needs a little work on their attitude and coaching skills."
good,working at wendys it help me in many ways but as i got better at it(i am a fast learner) they got worser they couldn't see people there cause its arguements every day or somebody getting sent home cause of something little or people gettin hours cut short also wasn't gettin paid at the rate they was looking for
good,Productive and fun at sometimes and great team work the most enjoyable part of the job is at night because really be ordering we be about to close for the night
good,"I was Wendy mascot for 6 or 7 years. I was Wendy for the St.thomas starts jr b hockey club games, what I love. When I was Wendy for the hockey game once a little girl said your my role model and I want to be just like you (Wendy)"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was lack of security of fellow co-workers bringing their 100% to match my intensity to do a good job. I learned how to cook beef and chicken, whether it's frying or grilling it."
good,I don’t remember working there all that much I was really young when I was there... but Wendy’s is a good company to work for.  Not so good if you need full time hours though
good,"The best part of the job was familiarizing myself with the customers, learning the procedures for every aspect of the job. The less desirable part was the negative spirit of some of the other staff."
good,It's a good place but it doesn't pay much for the cost of living in today's economy  my job is to cook operate cash register post up pop (picture of product) stock product and check off invoice
good,"I would come in and fill the condiments, wipe off the tables, then go and clean the bathrooms. I would also wash the baking trays and then fill them with bacon and cook them for the cooks"
good,Wendy's focused a great deal on policies and procedures. Training and development was a high priority along with food safety. They provided a structured training environment for all new hires. The bottom line is that is very difficult to find good associates to work there for the pay.
good,Its a good starting job to get money in your pocket unless you plan on owning a franchise. For the most part if you are part-time you can easily get full time hours in one week.
good,"You have to work fast but is fun working with others, i always help the crew and i like it very much, is always good to help people when they need you"
good,"Wendys was cool it was my first job , met some friends who I'm cool with today . good place to start if your are a teenager the pay was ok I was still in highschool at the time"
good,work was stressful but I got to the point where i was use to how fast and good you have to be while being on a timer and still make good numbers while making everything correct. I think the hardest part about it is having lazy or new workers who didnt know what to do or didnt want to do anything they were told to do. Other then that things were good until they had a manager switch and they had brought a new manager in that was sexually harassing the girls and i turned him in and nothing was done about it.
good,it was a very hard job to do. being a cashier is hard. taking orders and making bags and taking money. keeping the customer happy. but the manager always made sure we were good n helped out.
good,"I liked workin at wendys just wasnt getting the needed hours to take care of bills, fun working environment specially  since some of my old high school friends worked there as well."
good,"I've learned how to operate register inside the dinning room and I also learned how to operate the drive through register."
good,"When dealing with customers, make sure to smile and be friendly. Always use manners and be courteous. Working with hard working people will encourage you to do your best!"
good,"Was a job, just not enough pay. to much else to it. management was fine, couldnt make a liveing, bills always more than pay, ect ect ect ect ect ect ect"
good,Wendy is a good place to work at when you are new to work. I learned how to manage my time and keep up with the pace depending on the time of day. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and my coworkers who had a lot of experience to share. All and all my time working here was splendid and I was a bit sad when I had to leave due to circumstances.
good,Overall I made an poet amount of money. I was in high school at the time so I didn't really need much. My hours were okay but I would have been good with getting more.
good,Worked at Wendy's for nearly 15 years. Gained a lot of experience dealing with different customers and satisfying their requests. Always was on time and ready to work. Received several employee of the month awards during my tenure.
good,"the job its self was fine. main problem was that I never got off of work on time due to employees never coming in on time to relive me of my shift, causing problems with people who give me rides to work. along with not giving proper requested off days when they are needed for appointments/vacations."
good,My time at Wendy's was very helpful. It has taught me alot of important skills that I believe are very necessary to have in the work-force. You can learn a lot from working hard and working fast. It teaches you to be more efficient and think/react quickly.
good,Hands on management.Work along side your employees and learn to work on the floor as well as get your paperwork done in a timely manner.Food safety is a high priority
good,"Company was real understanding when my"
good,"Its a great place to work , they people there are great and help out a lot in and outside Of the job ,and my General Manager is amazing. I can honestly say I like my job"
good,very fast paced enviorment with little advancement opitunity yet i enjoyed my time spent here manegment was always helpful and directive would recomend for a first time job in the food industry.
good,As a crew member my job was to ensure all customers were treated the same with kindliness and friendliness. Ensured all food was fresh and up to quality for customers. Maintenance work. Housekeeping work. Cooked and prepared meals for guests.
good,very typical at work. i learned how to use the grill and cook a lot of different foods.the management was terrible.the workplace culture was decent. the hardest part of the job is when u have to hold your composure. the most enjoyable part of the job is when u can finish your hours and go home
good,I'm currently working at Wendy's but I'm looking for somethng better with better pay.. they are all so nice..its a fast place to work u have to keep moving n pay attention to everything
good,a typical day at work is fun and sometimes stressful when it comes to dinner rush but its still a good feeling after a long day of being there. The hardest part about the job in my opinion is having to deal with the customers if they're having a bad. The fun part about being a part of there crew is making new friends. The management is good and the workplace is mostly fun and enjoyable depending on who you're working with.
good,"The managers can be stressful at times, however, if you enjoy working a lot, they always keep you busy with various jobs. And place you in jobs where you are comfortable working."
good,"Overall Wendy’s is a Complicated job to get used to, But easy to learn and maintain.  If you are a person who cannot handle multiple task, fast working environment, handling upset customers, and all while keeping your store clean neat and your customer servic at a good level then the job isn’t for you. "
good,"this job is fast paced and will keep you busy. it will train you to work fast, multitask and have excellent customer service. you will enjoy a job like this wether part time or full time."
good,"Fast pasted, multitasked environment, productive environment, nice co workers, reasonable pay and hours, daily lunch breaks, employee discounts on employee meals."
good,Things get very hectic at times and in those moments you must know how to focus on your specific task and do it well.  The people working there are also very friendly and are enjoyable to be around.
good,It was stressful when short handed and would have to double the work and sometimes would not get breaks. Giving us less hours wasn't the the ideal if we would have our  40 hours plus that would be a great choice. As well as a better pay would help out. Wendys was a great place to work but need more stronger management.
good,Workplace was fun and clean. Managers made sure that all the duties were performed properly and always completed during the appropriate times. Everyone working at Wendys followed all the rules that were given.
good,Wendy's was a great first job. They offered flexible hours and worked around my school schedule. I would consider going back but I need to work closer to home.
good,This particular store has been torn down but Wendy’s itself was not a bad place to work. Usually friendly environment and flexible hours. I learned a lot quickly.
good,"This was a high school job for me I’m older I have more bills now so I need a better job that pays more . "
good,The store would be run very well if we had more managers than we actually do. We are understaffed half the time but over staffed yeh other half. The hours need to be fixed so they don’t have bad shifts.
good,"The work environment was fun, the management was fantastic. The pay was good. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with certain people that I actually enjoyed working with."
good,"It is exactly what it seems. I’d say it’s pretty fair and straightforward. The things I might complain about ex. Standing all of the time, or low pay, are things you’d probaby expect working fast food."
good,"used to mess around a lot had a lot of fun. having to clean behind the fryars was rough and gross and greasy, they were acc terrible in firing people i passed out in my car on break for 4 hours and still went back to work and everythings fine lmfaoooo"
good,"My time at Wendy's was fun, I learned new things about people. MY communications skills Increased, Problem solving, I learned patience, and to come out of my shell"
good,Good Customer service is very important. when the store gets busy you much be able to act fast in a situation and have good conflict resolutions.patience is also important.
good,"Its a very face work pace, especially if your under staff. Can be very easy and difficult, but proper training is essential. The only great thing about Wendys is being able to be ranked to a higher position which is more pay."
good,"went to work started taking orders and making food.did not learn anything managers were lazy made salads cut up food made tea.."
good,"When I worked at Wendys I was able to work in a good, nice, open company. It was a good company. I hope more people work there in the future. It was a good company."
good,"Loved the job, had a few different views but I always followed company standards witch were pretty high. Great management and advancement opportunity."
good,It is just something for u to work through and earn money  it is stressful at times when they hire the wrong people in the organization but it is a fun environment
good,The pay is minimum wage and it’s hard to get a raise it also doesn’t have benefits such as a 491 k plan for retirement and crew don’t get paid vacations or sick days like we use too
good,I would go back to working at Wendy's if they are willing to hire me back. The Managers were pretty cool and laid back always doing their job. The workers were a little lazy but I figured maybe it was because they all were young high school students that was the hardest part about my job was working with minors but other than that it was a very cool job
good,i enjoyed working here. Made many great friends while working here. They always made going to work enjoyable and fun. Great place for first job but not much room to grow within the company and raises do not exist.
good,Workers were easy to get a long with. Had some trouble getting some of the hours I needed for collage. Hard to take days off with some bosses. Had some poor communication when requested days off. Workers were great with customers though.
good,"My experience was okay, it just depends what Wendy’s you work at. The one I worked at was very fast paced and we got a lot of rude customers not to mention rude mangers and other crew members."
good,"Management was unprofessional, but the crew and the workplace it self was very organized and had good professional attitudes towards customers. I enjoyed coming into work and being able to have all kinds of positive attitude toward me and being able to put a smile on my face on most days. Very welcoming and I enjoy it a lot."
good,"The job overall was good , but some of the way things was communication wise was off . Most people had good coustumer service only part I didn’t like is all of those nasty greasy dishes at the end of the day . After I ask not to be put at the sink"
good,"Wendy's, owned and operated by Georgia-Texas Enterprises, is a great culture to work for! We suffered a house fire in December 2017 and the company not only put my family up in a hotel for 6 weeks, they also created a GoFundMe Account for our family!"
good,"fun work place for a first time job, nice environment and great people. flex-able hours and good pay.  Management is always there to help you when needed. also great training"
good,"Nothing special, just another fast food place. But I did lean how to multi task very well, the management sucked for the most part, but it was always a good time with favorite co-workers, and it never got hard, only when somebody would call out at the last second"
good,"Wendy's is a friendly environment and the people are great. Over my time of working at Wendy's, your co-workers become like a family. While sometimes you get upset with them, but you will always be able to work it out."
good,the staff here made job more enjoyable but i got tired of always coming home smelling like greasy and the work conditions were horrible when it was summer time.
good,"Wendy's helped me learn how to work with a team in a fast-paced environment. I went to school and worked evenings and they were good about being flexible but because I had so many senior activities and obligations I ended up not being scheduled for many hours and my parents and I thought it would be best to resign. The only negative was that one of the shift managers sexually harassed the female employees, fortunately, management dealt with it quickly by terminating the offender."
good,"taught customer service experience"
good,This was a good place to gain work experience. I started on the grill and went to maintenance. Performed basic repairs as needed and requested per management.
good,"Wendys open at 10 o’clock everyday and they don’t serve breakfast , Wendys is a popular fast food place , but I feel like if they served breakfast and opened earlier they would be better"
good,"It was stressful and active. The workload was consistent, my training was spotty and I was often placed in positions that I had incompleat training for."
good,"a typical day at work can pretty hectic especially during the summer months and much harder when we are short staffed. "
good,i enjoyed my time at wendy's and i really liked all of the people that I worked with. i enjoyed the teamwork aspect of the job. slight learning curve to begin due to the fast pace.
good,"Great first job with great people, can be drab when the hours are slow, but overall a great experience. Worst part is when it is slow and there's nothing to do but clean."
good,"En esta compañia el ambiente era bien ajitado, pero muy bueno ya que habia mucho trabajo en equipo ."
good,"good people, worked well with everyone, I left because I had found another job"
good,"Management at Wendy's actually invited us to improve our customer service techniques by having us set personal goals. They listen to what you say, and let you know when your work isn't up to par. Vast room for improvement."
good,"Wendy's is a good job. Sometimes fast paced depending on how busy they are.  It's a fun place people always smile show pride in there work.  Making sandwiches was my favorite because I always enjoyed making people smile and with the rite burger you definitely seen a smile on your customers face. "
good,I really liked the job I met alot of nice people while I was working there employees and customers & it wasn't that far from my home & I really just liked that atmosphere
good,"While the job itself sometimes called for a lot of quick action, it wasn't hard to do so after a couple weeks of practice. The General manager that kept track of us, our advancements , and store stocking was inadequate  and didn't even bother to do his job properly, forcing the other managers to work harder and constantly work me than 40 hours a week. Sone times the crew would also work about 50 hours a week as well due to his lack lof care and poor scheduling skills."
good,"good work enviroment, very fast paced, in addition to friendly staff. a normal day at work was, cash handling, multitasking, cleaning, decision making and problem solving."
good,"Extremely stressful, but rewarding to those who chose to engage in this field because of fast paced environment. Good platform for those who have higher ambitions in this field."
good,"I enjoyed it for the first part of my time there, I liked the people I worked with, a lot. But it gets tiring working fast food, being on the same thing over and over again. I was told I was one of the best employees but nothing ever showed for it, I was just put on drive thru nonstop."
good,"My experience working at Wendy's was alright. It was fast-paced and always extremely busy. However, there were a lot of scandals surrounding management and how they were handling money. The pay is not worth it."
good,Wendy's is a really great environment to work in. My coworkers are all very nice and so is management. I really feel appreciated when I work and feel like I am a part of a team.
good,"It wasn't that bad, just taking orders and dealing with customers. Sometimes customers were a bit annoying, sometimes co-workers were a bit annoying. But overall it was alright."
good,"I was with this company for years. I started as an employee and within time worked my way up the chain of management. This is a company who if you work hard, will reward you for your work in the end. They take care of their people and their customers. Taught me a lot about customer service and the financial side of the business."
good,I liked my job I jus took sick..I had no problems.it was a clam job most of the time..I liked working around new people and learning new things..the food was great...if I had to referal a friend or two I would it's really a good place to work ..
good,It was an ok job. Sometimes it was a but hectic and chaotic but i would work there again. I learned how to deal with customers and how to provide a good customer experience.
good,"fun place to work, co workers were great and efficient.  Managers were very helpful and the workplace culture is fun, but still gets things done.  They can give you extra hours if you ask for them."
good,They are very family orientated. Was good about giving time off when needed. Easy to work with staff and for the most part management. Low stress environment.
good,Working at wendy's i learned there is are a lot of friendly people in this world. Not everyone is snooty. Sometimes you get a nice boss and sometimes you don't but at the end of the day it was a new experience for me .
good,"I honestly loved this job. The company as a whole is good to work for, for a fast food business anyway. The management treated us like their kids. We were one big family. Unfortunately, fast food is a very fast and competetive business, that doesn't pay very well. That leads to a high turnover rate, which leads to an unfortunate lack of skill among the majority of the employees. This leads to most of the work being done by the minority of crew members."
good,"Wendy's is a good place to start in the work field, you gain good experience, people are nice, it is fast-paced. As long as your are doing your job there are no issues."
good,"Good place to work if you are in school or you love the food.  I had fun working there , the employees were cool, they keep you  smiling."
good,"Some poor management but not all were bad, very stressful when busy, but all in all the coworkers were helpful and easy to work with. They helped me learn a lot."
good,I enjoined working at Wendy's. The managers where great along with the general manager. The hardest part of the job is that there was a lot of high school kids that worked there at the time and they are hard to get long with at times.
good,Work on a everyday basis is face pace and working. Ive learned how to communicate with people and how to work as a team. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with all the people
good,Just be nice.. Its a part of your uniform... The Customer is always right... Be ready to work time you clock in... First impressions are the best impressions...
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy's due to the management that I had. My managers were very kind and helpful, especially during a rush. The hardest part of working at my particular store was simply the crowds of people that would come in. We were near the beach so sometimes it was overwhelming, but the managers made it bearable."
good,"When I worked there, everyone was fun and awesome to work with and everyone got a long perfectly. You wouldn't have to worry about not receiving help for making food, or drive thru, or even just everyday stuff. If you needed to leave early or go run an errand they would help you out."
good,"It was a pretty decent place to work, it wasn't hard or challenging. Fast food just isn't me and I really want to get out of the food business. I would recommend it as a great first job for a high school student."
good,you come in and u can smell the positivity and willingness to work the mnagers support u encourage u they always push u too become better outside of wendys
good,"Would recommend working here cause of good communication that goes around help is always there if needed."
good,i started by preparing salads and other foods we used for the day. i enjoyed talking to the customers i ran the drive thru on the days that i worked. it was a helping environment
good,"Working at Wendy's was okay it got me by while I was in school. I learned at Wendy's that you have to move a very fast paced, because its a fast food restaurant, and I love the manager she always made sure I was okay, etc. The hardest part at Wendy's for me was been a cashier"
good,"The employees made the area a great place to work, the customers we mainly very sweet. The job description was very easy to follow along. The environment altogether was pretty nice."
good,Wendys is honestly a great fast food corporation to work with. The company allows for advancement within the company. It is extremely fast-paced due to the high product demand. You can end up working long extended hours throughout the day and sometimes on off days. Working in customer service is always moving towards improvement and satisfaction and Wendys does that very well.
good,"A typical day at work was stressful and slow paced. I learned to count money, how to cook on the grill, and customer service. Management was lacking. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable oart was the friends you made."
good,Its a nice company to work at. You learn a lot of new things and how to deal with different kinds of problem and people. The best thing about working here would definitely see the happiness in people and interacting with new people.
good,Wendy's is a fast pace environment that gets you moving. Really improved my speed and motivation to complete jobs quickly with a quality service smile
good,"This job is very fast paced, involves multitasking and being dedicated to your work. I learned that learning a little more every day will make you better and have a better knowledge of things. It might be intimidating at first but once you get the hang of it, it'll be easy. The hardest part of the job and most challenging part is preparing an order during busy hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with good people."
good,"Wendy's was a get your foot in the door job for me. It wasn't a job that I was going to spend the rest of my life doing. I started my Wendy's job when I was a teenager, but I wanted to better my career so I started CNA classes. I did enjoy working at Wendy's because I got to meet a lot of wondeful friends that I still talk too. But I knew that this job wasn't my life time goal."
good,"I was 18 when I started working at Wendys. I got to work with many positive, enthusiastic people. My reason for quitting was that I had another job and wanted to focus more on my degree. It was good in retrospect."
good,This job was very useful to me. It kept me busy. Stayed out of trouble. At this time my daughter was on her way to enter this world. An wendys is how i supported her .
good,"Good customer service"
good,"wendys is a great place. the environment is amazing, making new friends with the regular customers, knowledge on handling cash also on cleanliness. we don't really have to spend a lot on food since we get staff discount. the staffs are lovely we work as a team its always bout helping one another and the customers and that the customers are always right."
good,"Wendy's was my first job and I would definitely recommend it to anyone for a starter job. I learned a lot of good skills and was able to grow as a person while working there, but did not find it suitable to stay there as a career."
good,"If you are looking for gaining experience in the workplace, this is the place to learn it. It was a great first job while I was starting school but it is not suited for a long time career."
good,just another regular day at work to me. the job itself was very easy but the way the management team prepared each work day for us was very unprofessional.
good,"My co-workers at Wendy's were nice and very helpful, and they did train me appropriately; demonstrated how they do procedures and they never left me standing alone clueless. Overall there was a positive workplace culture. "
good,"All of the crew members worked as a team, we were all like a family. The management wasn't very good, they're lazy and do not follow the company policy. They tend to be very rude to customers and the crew members."
good,Very fast paced and productive establishment. I developed fundamental and customers service skills here. I enjoy working here because the corporation gets weekly feedback on our productivity which helps upper management delegate more authority to upcoming crew members. This oganization host a community night once a month to give back to the community. I love the diversity here everyone values the culture.
good,"Been working there for about 3 years now and I like how repetitive the job is . its fun to work there most of the time when it's not coupon month. The supervisors are nice but, I don't like the manager."
good,Great place to work just the work schedule was not working at the time with me. It’s a great fun fast paced job helping you become sociably   They can give you the hours you need.
good,Working at Wendy's can be great on days but when certain crew members are working it gets stressful because they don't want to work. Management is good but they tend to play favoritism.
good,"From my experience, i believe working at wendys is best if you're in high school. its great place to start work if you have no experience. you can easily get promoted if you're good at your job."
good,"i have been working at Wendy's full-time,,fast pace,"
good,I've been working there for 5 years and I feel as though I have wasted a lot of time and feel unappreciated for the hard work I put in. I feel so malnourished because its hard to eat when youre on a go go go schedule.
good,I ran the grill cooked for breakfast and lunch wired days and nights i also handled the register while working the window provided good service helped clean up and stock freezer
good,I like working with my crew and customers. It given me a great opportunity to achieve my goals and help problem solving.I learned a lot of new skils and made realized that Listening is a great advantage of understanding problems.
good,What i learned from working there is that its a steady pas and the management there was okay. The workplace culture was friendly people are so loving and they help you when you need it. There was not a hard part of the job it was explanatory. The most enjoyable part of that job was being around people and being apart of that team.
good,"Always hiring because the employees are leaving because of the management."
good,"A typical day at work was walk in and clock into work, then wash your hands, after that, you would see what position you were going to work that day from a manager.  Good overall management. good workplace. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with rushes and the most enjoyable part was working with team members."
good,"The job is a very fast paced job your always going going going. There was times were we could catch a little break, but like if you work there for a really long time it’s like everyone becomes a little family that you can’t stand sometimes but love."
good,While working there i learned how to operate every position there was. From the front of the house to the very back.I also learned how to properly interact with customers; weather they are  a satisfied customer or a customer that needed a little help.
good,"The first year I worked here I was getting great hours, towards the end, the managers had chance and they started to replace everyone. The managers were not nice whatsoever. I wouldnt reccomend working here"
good,"Team based environment, very friendly. Available hours not always taken into account when scheduling (i.e education, ease of transportation etc) Good training."
good,I had a very good manager who helped me learn my position quickly n efficiently she also helped me move up in position and gave me more work time because she saw how dedicated and good I was at my job
good,Very fast paced and friendly. It's hard to advance into management or to get raises. I worked there for more than 6 years and only make ten cents above minimum wage.
good,"wendy was a fast paced job ,got through most my days fast. learned how to cook ,prep food ,and keep my area clean at all times .i felt as though it was time for me to go to something better"
good,"I'd say working for Wendy's was like any other fast food, but the food seemed to be cared for and made with more care, at least where I worked. This was my first job and I'd say overall it was a really solid first job. I'd recommend it for anyone's first job."
good,"A typical day at work would either be slow paced depending on what day of the week it is, most times the pace of the day varies depending on the weather. Always doing something in the kitchen, never stand around doing nothing, always doing something. I've learned a lot working at Wendy's, how to adapt to the environment and the pace of the workplace. The hardest part of working at Wendy's is keeping your cool when things get heated. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's is, working hard and it shows off when it's payday, motivates you to work harder and harder."
good,"I did not mind working there. i liked what i did. i was the closing grill cook, and also the drive window, taking customers orders taking money handing out the complete orders."
good,I would reccommend that everyone should work in fast food at least once in their life. It gives you several different perspectives.Since you meet several different types of people you truly get the right perspective.
good,"I love my job, I just simply don't get enough hours and my coworkers turn to me to do their job. I also cannot pay my bills with the low salary and hours I receive."
good,"Working in the fast food industry can be stressful, but still rewarding."
good,"Wendy's is definitely a great option for anyone just entering the workforce. It is a good way to gain some customer service experience, as well. Just be prepared to stand for a very long time."
good,It’s what pays my bills honestly. Not saying it’s completely horrible but it’s not exactly rainbows and sunshine either. My back is constantly hurting and we are always running short handed to meet labor guidelines.
good,To many people that related to in work place they have to much horse play and not enough focus on work mostly younger generation should focus on the job at hand instead of horse playing in job place
good,"Fast Food is what it is? Not glamorous and not a high end job. But out of all the fast food places, Wendy's is the best one. They treat their employees properly."
good,"good job for a teenager, working in school and or until you find a new job. i started on the girl and ended up sandwich maker. had fun working with the people that i worked with."
good,I didn't have no worst day at wendys. I learn how do everthing at wendys.managent was ok.work was ok.the hardest part of the job was doing everthing by myself.the enjoyable part of the job is when I got pay ever two weeks.
good,The thing I liked the least about working at wendys was the late hours. Working there was almost always hard work. I don't mind working hard but a lot of my coworkers were teenagers enough said.
good,I no review on Wendy's  I still work there it's ok just really no room to move forward in the company but it's great to start out and for school kids or people that never worked before
good,"Decent place to work. Quick paced. You would likely do a bit of everything, such as making sandwiches, taking orders, running the grill, cooking the fries, and bagging orders."
good,it's an okay place to work if you are fresh out of school. the people are fairly good but i wouldn't want to work there for a long period of time.....
good,"Although it was my first job, it was not as bad as expected because it was in the food business. Obviously, I always left smelling like chicken nuggets but I did not have many bills so my pay was okay."
good,this was my first job i learned so much from working at wendys and it helped me develop my interpersonal communications with people as well as how to talk to customers and work with money.
good,It was a Great opportunity for me to learn great customer service and to work with a team I who knew great team work and how to keep the day going while still pushing out orders in a fast pace
good,I made the work place to be fun and for my employees to love to come to work. I think by having a work place that everyone would get along will be a better business to run and it will make the customers want to come back
good,it was an ok job ....got to give them created they have hired be back a few times...very fast paste place sometimes stressful but enjoyed a few fellow employees!!
good,"It's not the best job, that's for sure. It's a typical fast food job. The people that worked their were pretty friendly. It's not where I want to end up, but still, a jobs a job."
good,"For minors or people that can’t get good jobs, this is the best job. I personally love the job, I just need to move up in the world and get a better paying job that fits my knowledge"
good,"The thing I loved the most about working for Wendy's was the teamwork atmosphere and attitude. I loved having the choice to work closing shifts, this was my favorite shift to work at Wendy's."
good,"Great employees, hard working and dedicated. Positive environment with potential for growth. Lots of customers service interaction and problem solving opportunities."
good,did not enjoy this place  it was very hot and grease stayed on the floor at all times and it just wasnt my cup of tea. to each their own i guess. goodluck though
good,It was fun and easy to work there. The managers are great people. The workers help out everyone and it feels like one big family when we all work together.
good,I was a shift manager but could not discipline employees. Dealing with customers was a challenge but I learned a lot. Scheduling was done fairly. I think they could have paid more for their employees.
good,"I was front register ,made sandwiches worked drive through, cleaned dining room. You have to be a team player if your working in fast food. Management could of been improved but not a bad experience. I was grateful for my first job opportunity."
good,It's a fun environment to work with great people great management everything was fun clean efficient they're all about the customer very family and friendly oriented
good,"Depending upon the manager, this company can be very flexible, especially for those going to school (high school or college). Uniform shirts, aprons, and hats are provided. Must provide your own pants and slip resistant shoes. The slip resistant shoes are a must for safety."
good,"Its a great first job, and if you're looking for a second job for extra money every 2 weeks I would suggest it. You'll stay on you're feet (depending on where you're located) and they have flexible hours."
good,wendys really cared about there employees now the hours were bad I was getting about 3 hours a day it wasn't good at all but what I did like that they really care about there employees
good,great upper level management fun and fast paced environment very friendly customers and staff great environment flexible schedules ok benefits vacations are great
good,"Despite being a fast food restaurant, all of the food is delivered fresh and is used immediately. Food quality is of utmost importance to Wendy's and it shows. Customer service is also important to the workers. Of all the fast food industry jobs I've worked at, Wendy's has had the best experience for me. Management has always been polite and informative, ensuring that their employees are best instructed in helping customers have a positive experience. Workplace culture is actually laid-back despite being a fast paced environment. At times the job can get stressful during lunch and dinner rush hours but for the most part the job is actually a fun environment. The hardest part of the job I would say is cleaning the frosty machine. It takes a very long time to clean properly and correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Oftentimes older, wiser customers come into Wendy's instead of the young and rambunctious crowd. As such customer interaction is always an enjoyable experience, even during times of rush hours."
good,It was a hard job to handle considering the fact that i was a student at the time but it was exciting at the same time to build experience in the restoration field. The hardest part of the job was to make the sandwiches quickly since it was a fast food restaurant.
good,"-Employed courteous customer service as customer’s first point of contact to uphold a positive impression of the company "
good,"Always a very busy, fast paced place to work. There were always new things to learn and new ways to do things that would help make the work days a little easier especially when the lunch and the dinner rush would hit."
good,"Great staff fun people nice location friendly customers"
good,"Restock, take payment, give change, take orders, compromise with people, give a good deal, give out orders through the drive through, making orders, bagging orders, interacting with people, answer phone calls, dealing with customers satisfaction or complaints"
good,"Your always doing something, doesn't matter the position. They have a very fast paced environment. It is very easy to learn the various of positions that they offer."
good,"The most I enjoy is the fact that it is fast pace and you get in and get out, I wish they would offer more pay then they do considering the amount of work employees put in."
good,Working here was good just not a career. Perfect for teens and college students but not much room for advancement. It's hard to get a raise and if you do it's anywhere from a quarter to 50 cents
good,Was fast paced but it made the days go by quickly. high level of work but typically not stressful if you are able to multi-task. great management and amazing people to work with.
good,"I must say, I enjoy working here. It's a way to bring in a bit of money. Not a lot by any means, but I was fortunate enough to get a good bunch of people who like to talk and joke to pass the time. Makes for a good environment overall!"
good,"Learned much about the fast food industry and learned how to be a people person and deal with conflict. I did move up slowly, but did eventually make Assistant Manager."
good,"Very fast pace customer service, many employees to help run smoothly, can get bonus, go to fun events. Training classes, train employees and deal with complaints"
good,it was very interesting it was a different type of work experience each day. managers were a little leniant but it wasnt a free for all . its a fast paced environment
good,"Learning how to multi-task, dealing with customers service and different attitudes even from co-workers. Fast-paced, certain store areas are a non stop."
good,"It was my favorite job ive had, met lots of great people, and learned a lot about customer service. It gets stressful at times but overall a great place to work."
good,Wendys would be a goid place to go if you nesd money and your lookimg for something temporarily. Not somethjng your looking for long term its a good job but not something that really fits me.
good,was mostly in training while I worked there. very good training program with capable people leading and helping with my training. i had the opportunity to work at 5 different restaurants which was very helpful.
good,I love working here but the pay doesn't fit my performance. I still want to work here I just need another job to help with my household expenses. I have 4 kids and working off of $8.25 a hour is not meeting my requirements as a Father.
good,The people there when i worked there years ago were friendly. I don't know what they are like now. I had fun while i was there. I would say it was a good first job to have.
good,"Its a fast paced friendly environment. The managers are great and work with as much as possible. They put you were you work the best. If you work best on sandwiches or drive thru, then that's where they will put you when they can."
good,Its definitely not a life time job. But if you're 16 and looking for a place to start out at this would be the perfect place. The staff is nice and the manager is understanding
good,"I worked at Wendy's back in high school, 2011 up until 2013 and it was great working there a two that time, everyone was family and everyone had fun together and also took care of outback store and customers equally. DONT know how it is working there now though"
good,"busy  "
good,I would have 3 different positions in one day. I would start off prep and then head to sandwich maker and end up being a Cashier. Although it wasn't hard switching around may be challenging for others
good,"Its a great way of learn how to make your own money and learn how to work well with other learn about foods and drinks orders customs service, cleaning up learning about other foods that others eat"
good,"Fast food fast past environment. Pay is not that great for the work that you do. Job was just temporary to pay bills, but wasn't enough hours. Crew can be very young."
good,"Pretty good job, My first experience serving people. the workers and management could have been better, very slack and not enough effort put into the work."
good,Wendy's is  a great store and a good place to work at if you want  to work there as a beginner job. I have been working here for 7 months now and I'm just ready for something new.
good,Lack of management. Very poor management and treated people like they were mentally disabled. They wanted a maintence person instead of a person that was good at their job and sent you home more than you were working.
good,"Depending on manager things can be easy or extremely busy and overworked"
good,Now that they have a better management team great place to work. Flexible work schedule and work with you when you need time off.  There isnt really anything hard about the job as long as everyone works together as a team like we should.
good,im able to work under pressure and achieve the required target. Im very adaptable to any environment and quickly learn the company ethnics and busines
good,"Count drawers,do inventory, schedule, night closing. Learned how to be a better team leader. Management was good and fair. Hardest thing was getting the younger kids to come to work. Free food, fun enviorment."
good,"I cooked the food according to store needs, regularly clean the grill when no food was being cooked, often i would clean around my kitchen area. Take customers orders and cash them out as well"
good,"Working at Wendy's isn't hard starting out, you just have to be willing to learn and maintain a fast pace. Cooperating with other employees to get the job done is also key."
good,"A typical day at work would see me flipping burgers and making the various forms of chicken. Some nights I would close which is a long and drawn out experience: pulling out the grills, cleaning behind the grills and the grills themselves, mopping the floors, getting the chilli meat ready for the next day ect."
good,Wendy's is a pretty good place to work at. The reason why I left was because I wasn't making the type of money I wanted to make. If you are a school kid it's a good job for you to have.
good,"team work wonderful and flexible hours good for first time jobs but not so good pay for management"
good,typical day consisted of making food and cleaning while in a relaxed environment. maintaining food quality and safety and customer service was to-p priority.
good,Good place to learn how to deal with customers in a very fast-paced environment. Good for time management and team work skills. Also helped advance my problem solving skills (eg when customers were unhappy)
good,Wendys had a fun work place. I enjoyed all my co workers. We had fun and also got the job done. Wendys was fast paced but also relaxed. Very productive.
good,"I enjoyed my job as a crew leader & the crew I worked with, but wish I could of made crew leader or manager because of my experience & dedication to the company. Some days were harder than others but nothing I couldn't handle."
good,this location is a hard place to work at they train you for the real world and you have to know what you are doing when you work here it also can make for fun times
good,"It all starts with clocking in and getting assigned to an area and starting work. Providing good customer service and keeping everything stocked is a must. I learned how to do thing quickly and efficiently and how to work well as a team. Managers or shift leaders help whenever they can because some voids need their approval. everyone generally gets along and even though all our cultures are different we all coexist. although, big orders and rude customers are the only difficult part of the job it makes things more enjoyable when we can all get along and joke around while getting work done."
good,"This is a good place to work if you enjoy keeping busy. It is fast and stressful but teaches workers how to work together and respect each other. Working here taught me patience, respect and how to work as a team member. It also taught me how to treat people with kindness and dignity."
good,I like working were I'm at its just I need a new job its time to do something different an motive me to want more in my life working at a fast food company is not wat I want to do forever .
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo para los jóvenes que empiezan a trabajar.
good,"Takes drive through orders , assembles orders on meal trays, sanitizes work area, assembles meals in bagging station ,cooks using fryer and restaurant grill and efficiently stocks sauce and utensil station. "
good,good place for young people to get a solid foundation on work ethic. There is room for advancement if you are willing to put in some work. discount meals
good,Going into work was never a big hassle because the people I worked with were enjoyable. People rarely called out and the managers were understanding. They took their time when training you and let you get comfortable with your position before leaving you on your own. The only bad part about the job was sometimes our boss understaffed us to save money.
good,"Management at wendy's was always more than adequate. Always very respectful and still enjoyed having fun as long as work got done. The most enjoyable part of the job was how fast paced everything was, it made the hours fly by."
good,I would come in an get my station ready an I would make sure everything was stocked an ready an at the end of the night i would sweep an mop the dining room an make sure it was very clean an smelt good.
good,I liked working there because i knew a few people previously to working there and everyone there made me feel like family so i was never the odd one out
good,Fast paced  job   fun great   experience  hard work   great   for teens  I'm a closer   I work really   hard  but it teaches  you a lot  of  patience   love the foundation   from   drown up once   you learn  it it become  a peace  of  cake   love the manager   they all are awesome   my favorite   part  of   the day is making  the   quest happy
good,"Great first job. Solid working shifts, a lot of responsibilities. Most enjoyable part was the customers and creating a personalized setting. The hardest part about working the job was dealing with poor management."
good,"I went into Wendys as a management trainee.  The training is good, on hand training as well as videos, etc.  Pay could be a bit better.  Job is easy, fast paced.  Good place to work if you love customer service work."
good,"management team never worked together, you had to worry about if taxes were being token out your check the proper way, had to worry about if someone will take cash out your register, also had to wash dishes and collect money out the drive thru window with a wet arm."
good,This job was a great place to start getting some great first time work experience as well as good interaction with people. The job offered a lot of hours with good flexibility and a good amount of fun that made the job worthwhile.
good,"Wendys was my first job and they hired me on the spot. I enjoyed working with the staff, we eventually became a family. There are good days and bad days working in fast food, but mainly good ones at this location. Management acknowledge those who worked hard and deserved a promotion. When things were changing in the workplace by corporate, meetings were held to make sure everyone was on board. They were very good with giving me time on the schedule because I was in school and then I eventually found a second job. One thing I learned working at this company was ""the customer is always right"" even if you know they're wrong. Maintaining professionalism is always important in any workplace."
good,A very productive workplace. You are always busy preparing food and serving our guess. Making sure the customers are always satisfied and have a wonderful experience at Wendy's.
good,Wendy's is a good place to start for your first job. I enjoyed working here. It's a fast pace job but you will love meeting the customers and working there.
good,"Disorganized really. I've been working there for almost a year and yet, no progress. No evaluation, no raise, managers will take advantage of your kindness/time, and attitudes through the roof. All that aside, they did give me a job when nobody else would, so meh.."
good,It was a lot of fun working here. I got to work as many hours as I wanted and or needed. Management was excellent about working with you and your personal schedule.
good,This is a fast paced environment to work. You need to work quick and learn fast. Stay on top of all your duties and make sure you stay busy and all will be good if you work here.
good,"it was a good first job, easy, nice, wasnt very clean and the managers went from good to worse. the customers were very nice and would often remember me and appreciate my word ethic."
good,if u like fast pace jobs then fast food is the way to go learning how to take order and hand them out was a breeze but making them was hard making sandwiches was difficult for me because everyone is different in their own sandwich way
good,"Good place to get a job at if you are looking for Career experience and family friendly workers and managers. Taught how to do my job well, and was paid fairly"
good,This is a very busy place and can be very stressful. I learned a lot about food safety and how to deal with public. Being a team player is very important.
good,"I enjoy the work, the co-workers.  It's fast paced every day. So far everyone has treated me very well. I really don't have any complaints at thistime."
good,The crew members were always staying on task. Helping customers were easily aided. The sandwich area were not really clean. The pattys could be old at times if the cooked didn't watch the pattys as intended.
good,"fast paced lots of new faces meaning customers"
good,Management is amazing. Favorite part of the job is showing younger ones how to become independent and grow in companies. Hardest part of the job as an assistant manager would be trying to make sure everyone helps get prepared n stays busy. There's always something to do you just have to show people. Whether or not your busy there is always work to be done.
good,"One manager there was very awful but another than that everyone was great and I really liked my general manager. I liked the employee there , everyone one nice but that one shift manager ."
good,"I was able to work in every position in the store from being a cashier,cook,prep,and drive thru. I handled money and food as well as interact with customers."
good,"Favoritism is one of the huge issues here including they want everything to be done within there time frame. And is isn't reasonable neither, lets say you have from 6:30 a.m to 9:30 a.m to get the store prepped and ready for business, they will cut that down to 8:30 when depending on our location we can get very very busy and seeing how all the prep work gets done during the morning and they don't want to bring in other people to cut that hard work in half and have better quality food prepared, honestly. They expect too much from the ones who work there butts off and to those who don't and slack, they treat them as there equals. Makes no sense no need to break your back if you get treated like the trash can and windup getting walked all over. Nope."
good,this was where i met both of my best friends everyone was friendly so there was a lot of socializing with a lot of responsibilities but that was expected being my 1st job i still had school to think about so we was mainly talking about school
good,"it would be pretty busy at evenings and nights, but nothing we couldnt handle on a daily bases, that was my first job, so i learned pretty much everything, the management was pretty nice, they was really about keeping the customers happy, and keeping everything together. the hardest part about working at any fast food place i personally think, is trying not to eat the food, but for the most part i enjoyed my job and even my coworkers"
good,"A typical day at work included having to most work at a fast pace and have a lot of teamwork. I learn that not many people are nice but I have to keep a smile on my face, far as managers they dont mind you having fun just keep the job done."
good,Most of the people I've worked with I loved working with at Wendy's the company is great and everyone is hard working individuals. I enjoy going to work and providing excellent customer service.
good,Management is sometimes lacking and crew leaders don't always set the best example.  Some are on phones and then reprimand others for being on theirs.  Have to work weird hours and don't often get breaks
good,"work drive thru and front counter taking orders"
good,I was a grill man or a sandwich maker my day consisted of making food and making sure customers received the best quality product they could. However I feel the management and supervision of employees lacked significantly and and be improved on greatly.
good,"very fast paced work environment which sometimes can be a challenge but very rewarding. deliver great customer service, and they will return and recommend to others. everyone plays a very important role in delivering service promptly.when once messes up, it slows down the whole process so you have to be on top of your game once you clock in."
good,Wendy's is a good company to work for if it's your first job. The management is really good and the hours are fair. The staff make sure their fellow staff feel welcome.
good,Lots of drama and management was not on top of things... Not a very clean environment and things would not get replaced as they should have. Some days were fun and enjoyable.
good,Ok place to work but left because they were shutting down for remodel. Down side is that you food employee discount only applys during your work hours.
good,Really enjoyed working at Wendy's made mistake to quite there cause my boyfriend at the time owned his own construction company so I went to help him full time and let Wendy's opportunity pass me bye.
good,Great people loved the job taught me alot how to balance my money the food was wonderful great environment thay also taughtme about discipline and makeing smart choices
good,Wendys is a good expericence but it takes alot of patience and energy to work with customers. You must be willing to handle attitude and deal with your temper.
good,I liked to take orders make the food have fun and work at the same time clean work as a team and make sure our customers were satisfied with there orders
good,"we was busy and have very friendly regulars that come everyday and stay there for hours. they always come in happy to see us and leave happy, and even when we are busy and the lines are long they never rush us because they understand"
good,Good work environment and good workers. Easygoing and very flexible. Gives you a good opportunity build your people skills and gives you a chance to be a leader.
good,"It's ok. You have to be willing to slave for little money, a lot of people call out, so if you're not that person you will be SOL because then you'll have to overcompensate for someone who didn't show up"
good,My experience at Wendy's gave me the opportunities to know what I am looking for in a job. I appreciate everyone that I worked with for teaching me and helping me become an efficient and effective worker.
good,While working at Wendy's I learned a lot not just the company but from the workers and also the guests that would come. I learned that it's not all about money that when you say that you had to go to work it's not a bad thing because while working at Wendy's we had fun but also got what needed to be done out the way first
good,working at Wendy's help me with my people skills and learning how to communicate and interact with customers better. Had fun and the management was filled with a bunch of good people that know how to do there job.
good,"I learned a better way of how to respond to peoples needs an their different personalities. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people , hardest part of the job is the hours."
good,I loved working at Wendy's it was a great place for me but it was a great paying job so I had to find something better paying for me and my family. If it was better pay I probably would go back. All the employees and management was great.
good,"Working at Wendy's is generally fast paced and can be stressful at times. While there, I learned a lot about food preparation as well as many vital parts of restaurant operations that take place behind the scenes. My managers were very helpful and took time to make sure that the restaurant and the employees kept up to high standards."
good,I worked here during the summer when I was in high school. It was a great summer job with friendly employees. Learned a lot about customer service and people skills.
good,"Great place,employees and customers. very busy and fast pace. Never really had an issue just low pay at the time.Enjoyed working and getting to know the regulars."
good,"There was always something to do with little down time. Although when there was down time and all the cleaning was done, it was difficult to know what to do with myself."
good,Working at wendy's was a simple job. It was not hard and semi easy to pick up different tasks. There was a new challenge everyday. The managers where okay but did not care for the crews< personal lives.
good,I happened to learn a lot from my first job at Wendy's such as working the register and greeting customers preparing food and drinks and maintaining a clean work space. Coworkers happened to help out a lot having it be a team effort to provide the best customer service and all. The most enjoyable part of the job would to have been to satisfy the customers and them leaving with a smile on their face.
good,I enjoyed working here because I worked with my mom and best friend I did not like that management was mostly hands off and if few employees were at work id b slammed as I was expected to perform at all stations at the same time
good,Wendy's stresses the importance of customer service and making the customer happy. One of the great things about working at Wendy's is interacting with different people and being able to put a smile on someone's place.
good,"It was a decent job when I was 16 or 17 but now that I have grown older, I want to work in a field that can really get me somewhere in life. Sprint seems like such a good place to build from."
good,Being around co-workers that made the place entertaining. I learned that the most hardest part of the job was that some coworkers did not do their job properly but would never be punished
good,"Understaffed, managers pick favorites, lots of changes in management, worked around my life schedule, very unorganized, don't give beaks when they should"
good,"Wendy's was an experience in itself. I met alot of different people working there, ranging from customers, to fellow associates, to the management staff alike. Wendy's, while it didn't offer any benifts, still showed the employees how much they care during the holiday season, by giving out a bonus. I learned how to multi task, and learned different positions while working there, such as, cashier, sandwich maker, fry station operator, and working the window. It was definitely a job willing to let you try every position avalible and more experience opened up doors to management. Great company, great leaders to work for."
good,The job itself is not a difficult one. However day to day management sometimes have trouble predicting certain issues such as inventory. There shouldn't be any reason why after a certain period of time that you should be constantly out of key items. On top of that working in the day time had its challenge but night shift was CONSTANTLY understaffed. Sometimes to the point that it interfered with the rate of service and the management would not hand out proper breaks when they should have. Even when brought to the attention of management they attempted to make deals in order to keep the service time manageable. The toughest part of the job would be drive thru. This area was the prime target of missed breaks and being that its the spot with the highest potential for stress it causes issues. Personally the most enjoyable parts of the job were washing dishes or being a cashier on front end. The workers there for the most part are friendly but due to poor management they quickly become tired of working there and switch jobs.
good,"Very fast pace experience and great customer service skills."
good,They are a great place to start working at a young age! They worked with my hours and managers are a hoot! It's a fairly easy job thanks to the crew members.
good,"I met nice people there, such as the managers and the employees. Food was always great and the customers were always satisfied. I loved every single one of my customers"
good,I loved my job until I stopped getting breaks consistently and was only getting them an hour or less before I got off. Really understaffed and I feel as management is scared to hire more people.
good,a typical workday was fine.  the crew worked together effectively and efficiently. the most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and making the food
good,I arrive at work I begin to prep for the following shift. I take a roster of who I have for my shift and plan the DOP accordingly. I also do brief inspections to insure that the employees are dressed accordingly and understand their duties for the day.
good,"Fun for the most part. Unprofessional managers, very sneaky. Other crew members made the job very fun and a good learning experience. Dont regret working here. Gets hectic sometimes."
good,"Good place to start working teaches you a lot of things like customer service, how to handle certain situations, and cleanliness. You can move up in this company as well if you're good enough."
good,Crew cook the food stayed fresh customers keep coming when I started working there back in 2011 I had a lot of original customers come in everyday asking if I am working for good quality food
good,"worked part time, great job to have while in school or on the side. people were nice. i did not get full benefits due to my schedule. overall fun crew"
good,A good place for firat timer applicant to apply for a part time positon if your in school and need a little bit of cash this is the one stop shop for you
good,"fast speed paste, good fresh food, friendly enviroment, crew members work with each other to make sells and make sure customers are happy and satisfied with their meal and survice"
good,Working at wendys as a cashier was alright. Some days it was stressful when busy but other days it was slow. You clean dining and restroom areas and take orders. Help out drive thru when the inside isn't busy.
good,"Wendy's is a pretty easy job I believe anyone can do. Be confident, friendly and helpful to the customers. Must keep your station clean and neat at all times."
good,"I loved working at Wendy's i got along great with the management and co workers, hope to experience something like that again. Loved the food and making it fresh meat and amazing bacon."
good,When fully staffed work task were easy to complete. When short staffed (usually happened at least twice a week) work could become stressful especially when store was busy for there are less people trying to make up for the absence of another crew member.
good,I enjoy all the associates and crew people that I had to work with it was also good being able to work in the kitchen area as well as the fry station so many new items to see and work wifh
good,"Great place to work. We all work as a team to provide exceptional customer service in a timely manner. We may have a few irrate customers here or there, but other than that. I enjoy working for Wendy's and serving customers ."
good,"I've worked at wendys for almost 3 years now. It's not a hard job but it tests your patience. If you're a hard worker, you'll get lots of hours. Most people working there are nice and it's a fun experience and builds your confidence. Only issue is bad workers get paid the same as the hard workers. Also the drama is awful."
good,"I enjoyed my time at wendys, but my ownly issue was most of the shifts i got were not good for my schedule and thus i eventually had to quit so i could do my schooling. Management was good and coworkers were friendly."
good,The food it good. Work invernment could be bettter. Need a bigger work area. It was to small to have 5-6 people in at a time. needs a dry stock area away from garbage
good,worked her for a long time glad I dont any longer am I done with this stuff so I can continue to fill out this application for another job? like seriously this is ridiculous
good,Can be hard working in customer service but the people you work with can make it better. I have enjoyed working for this company the last 3 years and would recommend to people who are just starting out.
good,Wendy's was my first job in high school. Iearned alot about costomer service and muti tasking. I learned that you are not going to always like who you co- work or mangers. But you must remind humble and do what you have to do to get to the next goal in your lie.
good,My review of the store is that it lacks maintenance and the Manger is a carefree manger she eats the food and doesn't do anything a manger should do. I learned how to maintain a clean work environment  i also learned how to become a fast cashier.
good,Wendys is a work place where you can go from a stating crew member and work your way to a General Manager. All you need to do work hard and follow procedures. Wendys is a family friendly company to work for and will work around school functions and doctor appointments.
good,"taking orders"
good,took customers orders. made food for customers. sweep and mop the floors. was a great place to work. they were flexible with the hours. managers were a blast to work with
good,I liked working here for the most part the people were great customers were great just all round best place to be in my opinion couldnt be worse good working experience
good,Being able to come in and just get right to work Wendys was a great customer service job and was very much of a fast paced environment. I learned that the customer is number one priority getting good reviews and feed back from the customer that we serviced is an essential component to feeding the companys growth as a franchise. Management was very strict and always made sure that everything was running on all cylinders. I would say the hardest part about that job was making sure that the outside of the store was kept nice and neat while being busy servicing 30 plus customers and I would say the most enjoyable part of that job was the discount you were given for food. As far as the culture goes everybody was consider and treated like family we were one unit trying to come together to accomplish one goal and that was to remain a health nice and neat lucrative business.
good,"You learn a lot "
good,I learned a lot from my team members. They where good as being a good help when it came to helping one another. The food was also good there. The job was great
good,"Fast food is a hassle. You have to be speedy and accurate, of course. The people I worked with were wonderful. However, I feel as if I grew out of that job. It was too tedious and the hours were not enough for me."
good,"I did not really like it.  The employees were disrespectful and well as the managers and customers.  I will never work there again, as well as any fast food place."
good,"It gets busy mostly all day every day, learned how to handle busy crowds, not having a manager understand that you can't work every day of every hour when you are in school."
good,"I had a lot of fun in wendys, the staff, our managers are all fun to be with. We always greet each otherwe help each other. We build a very productive working relationship. We make sure that no one will left behind. We make sure that we meet our customers needs and expectation."
good,"My time working in Wendy's was very relaxing, loved my position I had of being a cashier, never messed one order up, anybody that's looking for their first job I will choose wendys..."
good,The Management Is Very Great . I Feel Like An Undefeated Team With The Crew . They Work With My Schedule. Only The minimum Wage Gets To Me. I Think Its The Safest Place To Eat
good,Wendy's was a great t place to work but but they had some bad mangement skill alot of the managers were very lazy. I enjoyed taking a customers order the most.
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. I usually went in at 6 am to help open the store and clean the fryers. I loved opening the store. The day started so fast because I stayed busy. I had to clean the fryers, grills, and the fry baskets. I had to make sure buns and tortillas were stocked and pulled, get enough product pulled up front to get us through lunch and take out trash from the night before. Most of the managers are awesome. They really care about what is going on in the crews lives.  The hardest part of the job is hitting drive thru times when the customers want to take forever to order or they keep changing their order. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fun times we have when stress is low and business is slow. Most of the time the managers try to keep the tone light and stress low no matter how busy we are. Most of the time they say, ""If you are not having fun it's not worth working."" I agree with that statement completely."
good,Decent work environment. The co workers there were helpful from the start. Management was okay. Most enjoyable part of the day is being able to meet the customers needs and them complimenting you on it.
good,great place for a beginning job usually meet happy and nice people. tend to have good friendly staff as well which is a plus.highly recommend this place for hire
good,I love working with Wendy's. I would work there again. I would tell a friend to work there. You just gotta know how to work at a fast past if you wanna work there.
good,I like who I work with however the job alone can be overwhelming sometimes. There is no discrimination whatsoever and that is important in a work place.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consists of coming in 3 hours before we open to do prep. This means making fresh salads, cleaning the store, and stocking. When the store is open I make the sandwiches as well as help take orders and hand the orders to the customers. This job has taught me to multitask and deal with all kinds of people."
good,"working at wendys was fun, fast paced, and easy. It is a great entry level fast food job for younger people who need to get into the job market. i had a good experience"
good,some times the people they hire dont last and if you make the boss mad she will cut our hours badly but there are good days and you have regular customers that make your day better
good,a typical day is flipping burgers all day from 9-5. I learned how to keep busy and maintain work. management is okay if you have okay bosses. the hardest part is dealing with nosey co-workers. the most enjoyable part is the friendly co-workers..
good,You would have to get very used to people yelling at you on a daily basis because usually when people come into fast food restaurants they are in a hurry and sometimes like to take it out on the employees. If it wasnt for the very good group of employees i worked with i probably wouldnt have made it very long at this job but i enjoyed coming into work everyday and working with everyone.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a part time job. My manager was very gracious about working around my school and other work schedule. My co-workers were great as well.
good,This was a very good job friendly lot of cooking cleaning prep food mop floors wash windows always early i always stay doing something me i just cant stand around and not do nothing
good,"They gave me good hours and I loved all the people I worked with! The general manager that was there when I was, was the best! This was a good place to work."
good,A very fast paced environment. Very busy most of the time lines were normally long at lunch time. I rung up customers and cleaned when necessary. Nice place to work.
good,Management is okay. They give you opportunities to advance; however when some advance and become power hungry they do nothing to prevent people from leaving. Hardest part for myself was really finding a staff and fellow management to stay on board. They had great benefits until we were bought out and then healthcare doubled if not tripled.
good,"well when we get to work we gotta clock in and prep everything for the customers before we open. its a good company i loved working at both places. i learned so many things. the hardest part of the job was nothing it was easy for me but, the easiest was communicating with customers ."
good,"If you work for Wendy's corporate as a manager, the benefits are amazing. Plus you have constant overtime.  The company itself is great. Love the super fresh ingredients."
good,They let you train in any place you want and help you out on many things. They work with your schedules as well as needing emergency days.
good,I got alot of experience working under pressure. It wasnt all bad just very unorganized.  The managers didnt communicate very well at all. I like to keep things organized.
good,"A typical day at Wendys consists of positive vibes, keeping busy and making sure coworkers are caught up. I learned that its not bad to ask for help and that even though at first it seems terrible it gets better and a whole lot easier. Management at Wendy's is like like any other management for fast food. Managers are there to make sure we get our job done the right way and if not the right way, they will help out and they do. Everyone at Wendy's are friendly and try to smile even if the day i bad. I enjoy every part of working with Wendy's they make it fun in some ways. I think that the hardest part is trying to keep up with the other sandwich artists or whatever they would be called."
good,"I was a shift leader. I would be in charge of all non-management employees.I learned how to be a leader and how best to instruct new employees for them to best grasp the tasks they would need to do. Management was constantly changing, they all had their different rules, but I just always followed the Wendy's way. The workplace culture depended on the employees, since there was a constant rotation of hiring/firing/quiting of employees."
good,They do not always approve of scheduling conflicts but are understanding for the most part. They give hours depending on how well you work. Very nice employees and pretty good management.
good,"great first job, fast paste, friendly crew and owners.everything about the job is pretty easy, you just have to be up for day after day of the same thing."
good,"They were well organized"
good,"As executive director of Wendy's Venezuela I had the opportunity to do great changes in the company's sales and profits in the first six months. It was a great experience for me and I gained lots of experience from this job. The workplace was enjoyable and everyone was kind and responsible. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the country's economy and still managing to succeed at increasing sales and profits. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know almost all of the employees and working hand by hand with VP of operations, marketing, HHRR, finance among others to improve the company's overall."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I made lifelong friends with some of the employees. I was in charge of closing the store at night and they worked with me through my pregnancy at the time."
good,"Easy job but very fast paced, you're always in a rush. I learned how to cook burgers, make cheddar cheese, and some salads"
good,My employment with this company was to long ago for my impressions to be relevant. At the time I left I needed a career change.
good,"Ill come in at 8 in the morning on a Sunday. I would cut tomatoes and chop lettuce. Prepare the sandwich stations and wipe down all areas. At 10 we would open and ill be in the drive thru window until break time. At break ill order a meal and get half off. After break ill return to the window until the end of my shift.In the window i would receive cash and deliver change, hand out drinks and food and also fix incorrect orders."
good,Wendy's provided a flexible schedule so that I could work as much as possible while attending high school. This job taught me certain responsibilities that have helped me in the advancement of my career.
good,"I don't know what to put here. It's not letting me leave this page, and there's not really much to be said about it. It's your typical fast food workplace, filled with a mixture of cheery and miserable people. Welcome to life."
good,"Well I've worked at two Wendys and they were both fun to work for. Everything is prepped before hand and we had a time limit on everything. Therefore, there was no time to fool around. Customers came in right when it opened so everything had to be ready. We were allowed breaks but we would wait til the busy hr was over so that we would all be able to help."
good,I was a great place to work with a fun group of people. The had a lot of crew building tools to help advance your position if that is what you chose to do
good,It was a good place to work at with some amazing people. I enjoyed my managers' eagerness to educate; this made working there a much better environment.
good,I learn how to greet the customers when they walk through the door and smile and show good communication the hardest part is when we get big rushes and we have to have the food ready at a San time
good,"The crew was great, the menu was easy to leearn, The system was probably the most updated of all the the other customer service jobs that i have been in."
good,"Fast Paced breakfast and lunch "
good,"It was a good job and fun filled."
good,I like the management there and i learned a lot about fast food. The hardest part is the closing a lot of clean up. Days there can drag since no breakfast is serverd
good,I would come in prepare food and then make it throughout the day.I had very good management.It never got confusing. I think the best part of the job was to make food for people.
good,My management  at the Wendy's  I was employed at was absolutely  wonderful. I couldn't of asked for a better crew for my first job. The work isn't to hard but sometimes it does get complicated during busy hours.  Working at Wendy's  was a good expirence.
good,I had a great experience here. I say this because you get to meet people from all over (truck drivers & Travelers). I enjoyed meeting their every need on the food they desired.
good,"Wendys is a fast paced environment that allows you to gain the skills necessary to work in fast paced high stress environments. They teach you money handling skills, customer service skills, and public speaking skills. Everyone who works at Wendys is fun and joyful, and take pride in where they work, even the highschoolers. Hardest part: Cleaning the fryers. Most enjoyable part: driving home at 2 am in the dark by yourself, alone in the roads."
good,"I love working at Wendy's,it's a great place to work,fun and exciting. I like the fact that theres new people to meet every second of the day. I love making customers happy."
good,"Coworkers were fun. Training system takes a little long to finish. Management is good. Customer satisfaction is priority, although hard at times it is also a great satisfaction to yourself when they are."
good,they are big on speed. The managers will tell you too speed up when they see you slowing down. Its a fast past job thats for sure. They take cleaning seriously.
good,"The tasks at hand were simple to grasp, not difficult  to follow simple instructions. If you wanted more hours, you typically picked up different positions."
good,"good crew bad managers, enjoy to work minors pass tie, minors close the store, a lot of shoving and cramped spaces. employes arent appriciated"
good,A typical day at work is usually fun. Hardest part would be succeeding our daily drive through time. Most enjoyable part would be work with such great people and making customers happy.
good,"During a typical day, I was constantly moving and working.  There is always something to do and I love that!!!  I learned a lot in the managerial area of my life.  Working with older employees as well as younger ones"
good,I was a supervisor and I love working with people and being a team player I treat the employees like I won't to be treated I've had a lot of support working at Wendy's it was very clean
good,Working at Wendy's is a fun experience. It helps you build your people skills and let you work with a variety of customers. Its a good place to work if you love dealing with other people.
good,"•	Take customers order correctly."
good,Loved working here. My staff crew were awesome. Great hours. Management rocked very organized. Owners came frequently. I trained to do everything took a lot of knowledge with me when I left
good,Fast paced work environment that requires attention to detail. Fun working atmosphere with coworkers. They will work around your schedule.
good,It was a nice start up job for me. The management was very polite and very helpful in training me.  Nice and very clean restuarant.. Awesome customers too.
good,getting food prep done first thing cutting all fresh produce and meat makes the day a little more enjoyable knowing good food is going out and the customers make even a little better
good,They call it fast food for a reason. Need to be able to effectively multi-task and remain calm under high stress and pressure. The work crew is usually friendly and welcoming.
good,"My experience at wends as my first job was great. I am currently still there because i enjoy the staff I work with who make the work fun. A typical day is very structured around routine behind the counter but I always try to remain present and welcoming towards all customers. I learned a lot about customer service, people and how to better interact in a workplace. The management is great and very understanding especially to working students. I've never had any problems with any of the management. As mentioned previously, all the co workers I've had have been a pleasure to work with and they are what make me enjoy my job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with conflict from customers. I have never had extensive conflict, because i try to handle the situation as reasonable as possible but being criticized unreasonable can be stressful. also the late hours of closing the restaurant has interfered with sleep and school work. the most enjoyable part of my work is being in a friendly environment where all the co workers get along and every one is treated equally."
good,Nobody truly like fast food work but someone's got to do it. It's a thankless job and only for those who handle stress very well. It can all run smoothly but when it's bad...it's bad.
good,"It was a nice first job and most of the people there were nice to me, but it could have been a little better for a restaurant."
good,Fun place to be. I enjoyed coming to work everyday. I had great managers. Fast past and was easy to do. Coworkers were great and awesome to be around
good,Started working here back in 2012 and it was the perfect place for a teenager to start their first job. Great staff and great environment.
good,"The managers didn't know how to run the shift. They walk off line , be on they phones. Didn't know to take care of they crew. But Overall it was a good experience for a first job."
good,The franchisee is great to work for overall. They treat their managers well and have room for advancement. I would of possibly stayed with the company id I had not moved.
good,If you like working in a fast paced environment that prides itself on promoting within you should look into this company. Most Managers started as line cooks or cashiers.
good,"Within the years I've worked at two different Wendy's, and I've loved it both times. People were understanding and helpful, they trained me very  well."
good,It was a good first job for me when I was first starting out.  They were also very helpful with working around my schedule when I was in high school and playing soccer.
good,"Clean and sanitary work environment"
good,"There was never a dull moment, I worked hard for nearly 4 years and learned every position that was made available to me so there was not an actual normal day."
good,"Working at Wendy's was easy, and it kept me busy and productive as I should be. I enjoy working with others and keeping customers satisfied. Always moving at a steady, but fast pace.. I succeeded many things within a quick time frame."
good,"Depending on the GM and shift managers it can be a fun and exciting place to work. "
good,You got ok pay and are constantly moving you have to basically learn almost every position in the store but its not bad you meet new people and learn great customer service
good,This is and can be a fun place to work as long as there are enough staffing. This job is a very fast paced business and is designed for the younger workers.
good,I usually worked 2nd shift soo my shift started about 4pm and ended at midnight. I clocked in and always counted my drawer.. Usually talked to my other co-workers to see what needs to get done and how the day has gone.. I run drive thru and maintain backroom cleanliness.. Everyone i worked with well we had alot of fun at work but we still maintain everything
good,I love working with people. I love being able to help others. I love collaborating with others and learning new things. I am very loyal to my company.
good,Its a very nice place to work yes some of the workers are disrespectful but you just have to ignore it even if u dont want to you do because you have a job to do and your not gonna let anybody mess it up.
good,"This was my first job I ever had. I loved the place, loved the people. Management was amazing and they were also very nice and organized people. If I could have stayed I would have"
good,The Typical day at Wendys is very busy because you are constantly getting orders from the costumers and making them happy. What I have learned at wendys was how to take orders and make the orders that you took. My coworkers was people that you can count on when you dont know were thing go or how to do it. The hardest part is when you have a costumer that is just rude. The enjoyable part of wendys is when everything going good and the costumers enjoyed they meal.
good,"It's cool not to bad  but I wouldn't prefer to work here. I had a good time working here but it's not worth it, not a lot of money"
good,A day at wendys could be slow or fast depending on what day it is. My managers there were nice but strict on their job. always there when there is a problem. My co workers always worked hard and and we did our job as a team. I would say the job is fairly easily not hard at all. The most part i liked about my job was seeing the customers and my regulars come in. They made my day.
good,"I had a good time at Wendy's with co-workers and I would like to go back with the same people and everything but that's not going to happen, everybody has move on with their life so am I."
good,There were good people at Wendy's that made the day pass we had fun I learned a lot from the costumers to my coworker I hated missing a day never wanted a day off.
good,"The experience of meeting new people on a daily basis was rewarding, however the chance for advancement was limited. Therefore, I could not envision myself working for company with so few advancement opportunities for a long period of time."
good,My job here was good because I learned how to keep a fast pace and always stay moving. The management was very helpful when I needed a certain shift or some time off.
good,"A regular day at Wendy's consist of a lot of fast paced working, working well with others, and keeping customers satisfied. On the job I learned to always follow safety guidelines and communicate with other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was ""rush hour"" which was around noon, and cars started to come through the drive thru one after another. The only hard part about ""rush hour"" is getting the food out the window on time, and terying not to let the cars stack up."
good,"With Wendys it is a great career, with room to advance. The management all the way up to the owners are very nice and do what they can to help you both personally and professionally"
good,co-workers were nice and supervisors knew when to have fun and when to be serious overall not a bad place to work but hours weren't great
good,People always smiled at work and made sure the food was prepped in a timely manner. Manager was willing to remake orders if the customer wasn't pleased.
good,a typical day at work is very enjoy able. i learned to cook the food and take orders. management was always good to me and all my co-workers are grate people. the hardest part of the job is closing because you must clean the store before going home but i enjoyed every moment of it
good,"The store could have been much more maintained. Areas of the tile were breaking the coke fountain leaked, etc. To many call outs without disciplinary actions made providing for customers hard."
good,Wendy's was a really good platform for my job experience. I got to learn how to manage the store and responsibilities and manage the time. I was able to cooperate with people and learn how to deal with them. The drawback of the job was the long hours but the fun part was that we used to spend time together and work as a group and finish the task on time.
good,I really enjoyed working at the Wendy's on West End because my team members made me feel welcomed as soon as i started. They were very kind to me and showed me how that particular one operated which made my job a lot easier in the long run.
good,ive learned how to cook and prepare food at the right temp management was fair and easy to talk to co-workers helped each other the hardest part of the job was rush hour the most enjoyable part of the job was when everybody was in good moods and on the same page
good,"on an average work day at wendys i would walk in and have to take care of a good majority of peoples work and mainly stuck to the grills and fryers, most the time on my days off they would call me and ask for help then i would change my plans and come in. coming in on my days off happened most of the time."
good,my day always seemed to start at 4 am. working long hours was tough with a small child at home but I always enjoyed my staff and the interesting things customers had to say
good,"Its a fun job that works great for younger people.  The pay increases very slowly, however, you can move up in rank.  There is a lot of students that work there and that make the workplace fun."
good,great opportunities for career advancement. I love this job. Started off as a crew member then advanced to shift manager then advanced to restaurant manager
good,Dealing with lots of money.  Also dealing with people busy during the begging of the month.  Work wise mostly worked alone self directed at work place accounting took place for the most part.
good,"My day consisted of working in the kitchen and as a cashier. It's a fast working place but it was fun, you have to be constantly moving. I got experienced in customer service."
good,This wendys that I worked at was very stressfull didn't like to give breaks cut hours to almost nothing if I was scheduled at 9-5 I would probably work 9-11 on a good day
good,"The job was nice as far as fast food jobs go. i would recommend it over McDonald's and Burger King. The drive-thru is demanding during rushes but over all, it is not a highly strenuous job."
good,"Everyone has a place in the company but the owners and managers know it's our company as much as theirs. They cared about us and help us to grow, strive to learn new skill sets and appreciate us and we can see that every day."
good,This was my first job. I learned a lot about customer service and customer relations. My co-workers were wonderful and so was my supervisor. I was voted employee of the month in February 2008.
good,"The company continues to grow through franchising restaurants. I worked for corporate and was part of a sale to a medium size franchise. If you desire working for corporate, be sure it is in the Columbus Office."
good,I loved this job. The only downfall is that they was messing up the checks. Typical day at Icing is smooth sailing and very easy. You never really have a bad day working there.
good,I was not paid what I should have legally been paid. I complained 4 times about a manger and nothing was ever done which is what lead to me quitting. Good hours tho and some eployeees were friendly.
good,A typical day at Wendy's was very fast paced and everything managed to run smoothly. The management and my co workers never failed to run a good shift. The hardest part of the job was trying not to get too overwhelmed when it got busy. I loved the spirit and positive energy that my coworkers managed to bring with them.
good,"-almost always busy"
good,"Wendy's on Green St. is like a family. They work together to get the job done. Occasionally, there are some fuss and fights, but in the end, everyone gets along."
good,"Managed shifts and banking. Responsible for opening and closing store. Made sure health safety was followed while handling, storing, and preparing food"
good,"It's a fun place to work at. When it comes to Business it get serious. It's a good experience for a first job, not a career that will take you far."
good,"Dealing with distressed customers, whether because someone accidently forgot something with their order or the customer themselves are having a bad day, is the most stressful of it."
good,"lot of room to grow and transfer in the company good co workers, good hours and a wonderful mission statement, great benefits"
good,"A typical day at work was fun, challenging and easy at the same time, I met some great people while working there, and Wendy's is an all around company to work for and gain experience. The hardest part of the job was completing all cleaning tasks before your shift was over due to being busy. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making customers happy."
good,"There was always work to do because it stays pretty busy. All stores do not operate the same, the work load is not equal but a lax place to work."
good,"Being a hostess was a great starter position for me to learn customer service in a fast paced environment, where things can go wrong quickly."
good,"Wendy's is a growing and a learning experience .Wendy's  is a great company to work for. a daily routine as a cashier at Wendy's include greeting customers, taking customers  orders , and making sure the dinning room is well kept."
good,"I worked 4-6 hour shifts working fry station and the line.  While working at Wendy's I learned to be on time, how to work hard, to be respectful of coworkers and customers, and to follow directions.  It was my first job experience and I worked over the summer to save money.  The hardest part of the job was working around hot oil.  The most enjoyable part of the job was following simple directions and getting paid. I also made friends and enjoyed myself."
good,Good first job to have and easy to move up the management ladder if you want to continue multiple years with the company. This company is a very fast paced work place with many positions to learn and gain experience in. Also a relaxed atmosphere and gives good raises every 6 months.
good,"I spent majority of my time taking customers orders but I would take a break from it to do my other tasks such as cleaning the dining areas, restocking, and checking the restrooms to be sure they were stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, and hand soap. I learned how to hold small conversation with people and always keep a smile on my face because whether you know it or not people are watching you. My managers were very friendly, understanding, and lenient especially when I began working, we became friends quickly. The hardest part of the job was learning to master using the register when it came to putting in customers orders especially when they had special requests but it wasn't rocket science."
good,The night shift crew has great team work. Usually very busy at work except in Winter. I learned how the cash register by working in Wendy's.
good,just a basic entry level job. always hiring so always see new faces. depends where you work it could be good or bad.
good,Mostly stress free until lunch or dinner rush i learned how to work in a team atmosphere and how to make things run more smoothly the management there was kinda cool my co-workers we always fun to be around they made the shift go by quick the hardest part of the jib i would say had to be dealing with the customers who came in with attitudes or wanted to get smart and the most enjoyable part I'd have to say was closing with certain crew members and managers
good,The business stayed very busy throughout the day. The hours were great as well as the management. Co-workers were really great to work with and very friendly on occasions.
good,"Great for right out of highschool, or needing money for college. Hours are flexible, easy to learn and use systems. Good for life experience."
good,"Great company great people, non-reliable management. The management changed almost every 3-4 months. I love the environment, but want to expand my experience in other areas and skills."
good,At my few years at Wendy's I learned how to become more of a leader. There were a lot of days when I had to help out people when we were busy in a rush. It was a good way to learn about how to work under pressure.
good,"Not a bad first job, really teaches responsibility of the workplace. If one person does not do their job properly it ends up slowing everyone else down as well. Management was very cooperative with scheduling especially for inconsistent college classes. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the rush pace, the most enjoyable part is definitely the people you work with, that really makes the environment what it is."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's.  The management staff and employees were professional and fun to work with.  In addition to my position as a cashier, I also worked as a food preparation worker and general maintenance worker."
good,"Was fun working with the my co workers, the mangers were nice and very understanding. have a lot of fun there but then they started cutting my hours and i had to find another job."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is an immediate jump into a position. Business is busy and rapid with little slow downs. I learned to developed quick speed and multi-tasking skills. The management is alright. The crew is actually in position more than the manager which is not really helpful. The co-workers are cool people and good team players. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with supplies when we're really busy and completing my job tasks in between taking orders in an orderly fashion. The most enjoyable part is the employee discounts and the ability to sit for a little since we don't receive breaks.
good,"A typical day would consist of working in the drive through window, ringing people up, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"While working at wendys the employees did welcome you with open arms. The work is equally divided but you are pushed to your limit when you are now faced with a short staff and high volume of customers. Management did become hands on, but unfortunately theyre was no room for advancement and no room to grow."
good,They didn't really work with my schedule and were kind of jerks about everything. It was an okay job though and they made sure I always got my hours.
good,"As a Shift Manager I would assist the General Manger in managing the operations and staff of a Wendy's restaurant, including the execution of all Company policies, procedures, programs and systems. I would consistently provide friendly guest service and hospitality, promptly and em-pathetically handle guest complaints and concerns and maintain high standards of customer service during high-volume, fast-paced operations. I also oversaw and maintained inventory of all product in the store, controlled labor by reducing labor cost by maintaining excellent service and profit levels. Other tasks included opening and closing the store, keeping control of all registers and safes. Logging temperatures to ensure food safety and maintained clean and save environment, including the kitchen, bathrooms, building exterior, parking lot, dumpster and sidewalks."
good,"In my time at Wendy's I have really enjoyed the skills I have learned and the people I have met. The workplace is clean and taken care of. However with it being a fast food restaurant, things get heated during rushes and the overall energy of the store gets very tense as the employees and the managers get stressed.But, the regular customers really break the tension as they are so charismatic and understanding, and there is nothing better than seeing their smiles. The managers are hard working and try to be as lenient with things as they can. Being a closer makes things easier, you get to know your managers almost personally, and they try to help you with the more complicated parts of the close and prep such as tearing down equipment for cleaning, and preparing things for the following morning."
good,Co-workers were easy to get alone with as well as the managers. A typical day at  wendy's is easy going until lunch hour and game days. Called in on off days and did not complain
good,"I loved my female managers, we actually became close friends. I learned how to better multitask and how to take constructive criticism well. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers and the crew. The hardest part was chopping lettuce at the end of the shift because it took so long to cut it all and then clean all of your equipment."
good,"Fast-paced work environment with friendly and supportive co-workers. Management team was helpful, and willing to teach. Despite the long hours, still a rewarding experience."
good,"I had a very fun time working for this company. There was always things to do, and the company grew a part of me. I would definitely work there again."
good,"Being the first job, Wendy's is one of the best organization to work at. Very friendly and flexible environment and co-workers to work with. The hardest part about this job was working long hours."
good,Great place to work if your still in high school. But if your looking to pay bills then wendy's not the place to go. Overall great place to be.
good,It takes MONTHS to be moved up to a team leader so most of the time people don't try for the reasons also being that the position is also rare and no one wants to make a career there at first.
good,"Overall great starter job, great management team, fun and interesting co-workers, hardest thing is service times, remembering all sandwiches, the most enjoyable thing is food discounts, and meeting new people."
good,"Learned working in coordination with the co- workers. "
good,"I would take orders and deliver them to trays, clean tables and washrooms. I would also prepare for opening in mornings, prepare food along with turning on fryers and stoves. "
good,"I loved working here until they got new management and they didnt have a clue about customer service which took them down hill fast but when I worked here it was awesome, we all worked as a team and it was not really a job cause it was family!"
good,"Cleaning tables, preparing food, taking customer orders."
good,"Cleaned work area and food preparation equipment.  ●Set thermostat to heat oil to specified temperature.  ●Immersed baskets into vat manually or by hoist"
good,"This company provides a great work atmosphere, flexible hours, understanding and genuine staff and managers, as well as opportunity to move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would start with working the second drive through which would consist of preparing drinks, gather all the food, along with bagging all the food items. I would then continue to hand the food out of the window to the costumer. My other duty's were to work the registered in the dinning room. I would also make sure the dinning room was presentable when we were slow. Management was very on top of things. I enjoyed always staying busy. I did not enjoy working around food so much."
good,"It was very busy on  Friday's and Saturday's. But other then that It was very fun, very fun place to work at, & was great to learn new things."
good,"We clean tables, we clean the bathroom and mop. We take orders and grab the money. We also make food. It was a good environment."
good,"fast paced had to think ahead mostly, enjoyed people who worked there had a good team work thing going, always had to make sure you had enough meat on grill incase we got slammed"
good,"used to work their youll be moving alot "
good,Great work place to start when you are just getting started on the working field.  You can learn a lot about yourself and others when working in the public such as this place.
good,"Average day to day work varied greatly, due to the general lack of social skills of a couple of a couple of the managers, since fixed, and the nearly venomous attitude between the morning and evening shifts."
good,Horrible management not all manager just two or three but they say it only takes one apple to spoil the bunch. a typical day is fast paced but the team of co workers are very supportive.
good,I was a cashier and did customer service. Handled complaints and questions of the customers. Helped with prep and cleaning tasks.
good,"Fast paced, First job as a teen. Easy money. "
good,"A typical day at work was as common as any fast food restaurant, but always a great entry level job. The pay and hours were decent, and I learned the necessary skills any teen needs for a job. Management ran a tight ship, and my coworkers were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was the early morning cleaning shifts, but nothing too complicated."
good,it was stressful to work at wendy's some of the managers was great they would make it fun for the crew when they wasn't busy and some of the staff was great.
good,It was okay til the night time when I came in for work then it became hard but it was great work the boss was kind but could be a litte nicer
good,Worked for wendys for19 yrs crew and their situations were the hardest but also with the custormers the most enjoyable typial day running service ordering cash intentory
good,"Good company to work for, they keep you busy so there is no down time.  They are willing to work around scheduled appointments.  they have a great manager."
good,"I learned multiple skills while working at Wendy's, and they always helped me learn more. However, they sometimes won't support you if a minor situation breaks out, but this does teach you independence."
good,while working there it was good invirement and I'm good at communicating with other people with no problem. My work speed is average but I can get the job done when needed I don't have a problem with completing a task even if it takes a little bit more of my time.
good,"worked 3hr day, 4 days a week. management was easy going and worked well with me on the hrs I wanted at the time. co-workers were typical teenagers, a few adults who were there for a few hr like I was. my day was basically get in do the job and go home."
good,It's a good company work for but not very good benefits.LDF companies to work for good possible management material and be very loyal worker and excellnt employee.customer relations are very appreciated within community
good,Working with the wendys team was nice and fun. The hardest part of working there was leaving my 4 month old son at the time.
good,This variety shop specializes in hard to locate items. Staff is very knowledgeable  and friendly. The are willing to go the extra mile to help you find what you need.
good,Was a good job overall. Management was unprofessional but I enjoyed company of other co workers.The hardest part was dealing wth rude customers and co workers
good,"A lot of cleaning"
good,"made shift plan"
good,•a typical day at work- fast. •what you learned- how to talk to people. •management- good. •your co-workers liked them.•the hardest part of the job- the hours. •the most enjoyable part of the job- the people i worked with.
good,I loved the work load that was given to me on a daily basis because there was never a dull moment. This job is very positive in terms of recognizing employees for doing good things on the job.
good,"I enjoyed my time here and the people I met. It is a very friendly place and they always strive to make sure the customers have a great experience. I learned every aspect of the job and i would say the hardest part was carrying the job, many of the people that were hired just didn't feel the need to work. The manager is great at her job but does lose her temper, but she was like a mother to us. I really enjoyed interacting with the customers, especially when they began to know me on a first name basis and were always looking for me."
good,I can see me working in a different and better location then the one i was working at before. I just wished it was a better environment for me. It wasnt to my liking.
good,"Wendy's is an overall wonderful company to work for. There are good promotion opportunities, teaches a good work ethic and i took pride in the opportunities that they gave to young people for their first job. they set a standard for quality fresh product.."
good,I was responsible for calling customers acrossed the nation in order for them to participate in political surveys. I dealt with a range of different personalities while doing so.
good,"Had to move to Columbus Ohio due to personal reasons. enjoyed working a strong and talanted group of people, Again learned alot about team work."
good,Working at Wendy's is a fun experience meeting and greeting customers showing them we always offer good quality.The most enjoyable part of my job is to hear a customer say you was so polite in handling my order.
good,co workers were easy to work with no drama managers were good they did they'r job but the hardest part of the job was get hours
good,This job was a great chance to work in a fast pace enviroment. always on your feet working but a great place.great place to work
good,I liked my job but had to leave due to pregnancy complications and if i went back after i would have had to start all over again .
good,"A typical work day included me coming in about 15 minutes early and either opening or closing the store while running shift. "
good,"Would do various things like take orders from customers, cook on the grill, prepare food. Got along with all my coworkers. Learned valuable people skills"
good,"I was only there for one day since it was a stage but I enjoyed it because time went by fast and I was constantly doing something different. I spent most of my day learning how to do the warehouse but then I after the warehouse work was done, I was put on the floor to put the clothing I had tagged in the ware house."
good,"This was my very first job i was still in highschool they were not good with flexible hours, they kept me n summer hours which was entirely to many for which i had to resign."
good,"Fun place to work. This was my second job. New and different learning experience as a teenager, I learned responsibility."
good,Wendy's is a great restaurant and the environment is wonderful. the employees are friendly and everyone gets along well. The customers are  nice and friendly.
good,Enjoyable work environment and great people. Down side would be people who didn't want to pull their own weight. It was great bonding with regular customers though.
good,You are always doing something.  Shifts go by quickly.  Lunch and Dinner rushes can be very stressfull. Upper levels of management are always giving feedback to every level in the stores.  Promotion from within is constantly occuring.
good,It was a job to start to get me out in the world.  I prep the food for the orders that were taken. I also did dishes in my shift too. Then I found  the job for me that went with my career I was going into.
good,"enjoyed working with co workers, and customers. a positive work atmosphere and work environment. serving customers with a smile and friendly attitude. serving fresh, quality product in a quick but acceptable time."
good,Been there for a long time. I have been through a lot of employees and management all has been a great experience. Its a fun and safe place to work for.
good,"Very upbeat atmosphere. Very supportive  training manager. Good training skills, walking distance from home. clean place and always something exciting to do and learn"
good,Nice place to learn some basic life skills and how to behave in the workforce. Getting to know my customers taught me a lot about people and how being kind can change a whole person's world. My co-workers were absolutely amazing and made the job worth doing. The hardest part was actually watching these people you had trained and grown with leave for greener pastures.
good,"we are always busy especially at lunch and dinner time,i have learned a lot about customer service,it can be a very stressful job ,the best part is see the customers returning to the restaurant because they had a good experience."
good,"I loved working here, everyone was pretty much nice to you except the only bad part was getting all the drunk customers at 1 or 2 am"
good,A typical night at work was pretty simple. The coworkers were very nice and helped if needed. Once the lobby was closed it was very easy. All  had to do was restock the condiments and clean the lobby.
good,The location I worked at was always on top of their customer service goals and the management encouraged and congratulated improvement and a job well done!
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's was always busy. it made the job fun and you were always doing something. it made you work as a team. I learned a lot  working for Wendy's, a lot of the prep work, using the grills, properly cleaning fryers, and cash. The hardest part of working for Wendy's was when someone would call in sick and a rush would come, that's when team work really came to play."
good,Was able to work steady hours. Had fun at work. Management was back and forth on following policies and not following policies.
good,it was fun working here but the managers wanted me to work until 2 am when i had school the next morning so it is not ideal for students unless they are willing to work on weekends like i did
good,"I am a punctual person and always willing to do my job and more. I have learned while working at this company that customers satisfaction is the only thing that matters. I am a great team player and always willing to help, if needed. I enjoy the customers ,esp. older customers because just sitting ,talking a listening you can learn a lot from them and also love their stories. I do whatever it take to get the job done."
good,"The work wasn't that easy. It was a fast-paced environment and the Wendy's I worked at was in the heart of many, many activities from the spring through the fall. With that being said, the drive thru was wrapped and lines out the door. Although the work wasn't so easy and relaxing, the managers did everything they could to make everyone feel comfortable and appreciated."
good,"Was a very fast paced company, lots of multitasking and organization was required as certain times of the day would get very busy. Handling cash was a huge part of the job and had to be careful considering there were lots of customers in line."
good,"Learned about team work, cash handling, and customer service. Wouldn't change this experience and has taught me life lessons"
good,"During the day my duties would compose of setting up foods and goods to areas where they're needed. I was also in charge of transferring monies from the register to management after taking customer orders and requests, along with keeping up with store cleanliness to company satisfaction. Many times I would have to take over shifts from people not showing up, this would disrupt my schedule but would earn me more hours and more respect from a supervisor."
good,always on the job going from attending the grill to dishwashing while being kind all the time to my fellow coworkers. For this i recommend Wendy's a place to work.
good,"I am a people person and working for this company, all types of people came through the doors. Yes there were problems, but they were usually solved quickly. I had the opportunity to work in almost every customer service position along with helping with morning food prep to nightly cleaning duties; preparing the store for the next day. I learned to keep costumers patient and remind them that everything was made to order so it was hot and fresh. The employees were really nice, but the managers changed and it was no longer a fun place to work and so many people quit or got fired."
good,"loads of information to gather learn as a new sales associate hard to communicate as I'm not bilingual and had someone speak Hispanic coworkers were great to work with, not managed."
good,Helping put a smile on people faces when they received their delicious food. Make outstanding food to the perfection of each customer.
good,"Work is easy, good hours, pay is not all that great, dont give raises yearly, no benefits.. the environment is great if you have a team that will work together and have fun doing your job"
good,"Working at Wendy's was relatively easy, the pay wasn't very satisfactory, but money is money and when you're young and broke it suffices. Management was very lackluster and the employees were very unprofessional, but to each their own."
good,"nice teen job was there for three years, nice little check in ya pocket, wage should be much higher I should say. a lot of work at times, especially if short staffed"
good,I love the people. Customers are the important part of the job so I do what I can to make them happy. I was with the company for years.
good,Co workers walk around like ghost. No team spirit cant even smile at a customer. Looking for a better working environment.
good,I loved working there because of the managers and coworkers- it made going through the daily routines of fast food worker easier. I also enjoyed providing exceptional customer service.
good,they had a good work environment where everyone worked together. the have advancement opportunities. nice management. considerate supervisors.
good,Wendy's a un service impécable et une propreté limpide. pendant toute l'heure d'ouverture il y a un employé chargé de nettoyer en tout temps et tout le monde apporte quelque chose de plus a l’entreprise avec son aide et son engagement a la tâche.
good,"This job has given me many opportunities to better myself both professionally and personally. The general manager for whom I have worked for the past two years is a very respectful woman and is most respectable, in my view, for her impartiality and patience. "
good,"Enjoyable workplace, learned a lot about myself, employees and employer. The company did help me grow as an individual and brought out my talents not only as a person, but as a professional career person."
good,Loved the crew and team that arose to many challenges. Leadership established set programs and adhered to high company standards. Challenges arose when personal family issues came into life.
good,I learn how to work with many different people. The job is best for some one in high school. They do not provide health insurance and you will not get many hours. I did learn a lot from working there.
good,I learned a lot being hired in as a Manager. Matter fact my GM at the time is one of my mentors. A very fun place to work at the time. Then he retired after we were bought by different company.
good,"Typical day would be meeting and greeting with guests and taking orders. Meanwhile, ensuring guests have the right orders and are pleased with their service. Nevertheless, I ensure my area is clean and everything is stocked."
good,"Very fast-paced environment, really amazing team, great management. A lot of growth within the company. Flexible hours for a student."
good,This job is very fast paced and is ideal for people who absolutely need something. But there is not much room for advancement and pay isn't the best.
good,"People are nice to work with, and they care about there guests. very fast paced and you have to keep on your toes. They do train in management food prep and cashier."
good,"The staff is easy to get a long with, so there are no problems at work."
good,"At wendys you will interact with the costomer whether your in the dining room, kitchen or on the register. every one has a different experience."
good,It was a busy place to work which i enjoyed. I like to stay busy and on my feet. I didnt like that there were so many young and immature people there that just didnt do theyre job. Overall it wasnt a bad place to work
good,"Wendy's provided me consistent employment for over three years.  My eyes were opened to co-workers stealing from the cash registers and each other.  Co-workers disrespecting each other, and general immaturity in the workplace."
good,Great work environment good employees and nice management. I enjoyed working there. I got alone with everyone made had any problems. I could say one of my best jobs.
good,Nice place to work for a first job. You get to interact with a wide variety of people. Helps develop your money handling skills in a professional manner.
good,"Wendy's Canada is an all around positive environment and work place."
good,Get to work. Joke around with co-workers while setting up for lunch rush. stayed calm while under pressure at lunch rush. co-workers were there to help when falling behind. i learned to keep calm and work with each customers needs and assisted with meals and answered any question. management was very easy to get along with. when you have question. they have answers. the hardest part of the job was maintaining my speed while assisting customers during a rush. the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the looks on the customers faces when they take the first bite into thier meals and their faces just light up from the amazing taste.
good,"I learned a lot working for Wendy's. I learned how to perform management duties, writing schedules, controlling inventory, food safety, reading food cost and labor reports, reading production and profitability reports. The hardest part of the job was the late night hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying our customers and the people that worked for us."
good,"This is great as a first job type of thing. Easy to learn, easy to move up. If you're willing to listen, and work this is the place for you! Very professional, and fun work environment."
good,"I only had one manager that gave me a hard time but as long as you listened to her and did your best, she wouldn't bother you much. We were all adjusting to her as a new manager from a different location so maybe that added to the problem. Other than that, in order to advance in my job, I had to switch positions with other employees because they lacked motivation to help you learn your way around the kitchen. It's really a ""do it yourself"" type of job"
good,"Dial and complete surveys in a cubical with a set amount of calls to make."
good,"I worked the register, cooked, and cleaned my work stations and dishes. I learned the proper ways to produce the delicious meals provided to the public. The hardest part was dealing with rude people and cleaning the grills when closing. I enjoyed making the food that people enjoyed eating."
good,I really was looking forward to my new job but we were switching managers and tasks became more difficult as the environment become unfriendly.
good,"hands on at all times."
good,"The atmosphere is always a good. Never had any issues with drama. The pay is just not enough to take care of bills, its like your working to pay bills and that's it."
good,I listened to customer orders and handled change transactions. The most important part came from keeping customers happy and moving along.
good,I stayed busy from arrival til shift change. There's alway's something to be done.When there's no team work it can be stressful at times.
good,"On a typical day when I arrive to work, I am running the store. Ensuring that all aces are in the right place. I am couching the opening manager, day manager and night manager on tasks that have to be completed. Or how they can better themselves. My store is the training store for all managers for the six store franchise. "
good,Wendy's is a great place to work but the team aspect should be enforced a little bit more. Team work makes the dream work and prevents so much stress on certain employees.
good,"This is a place were one can learn all the aspects of customer service at its best.  One deals with customers face to face to make their buying experience the best.  The typical greeting rule applies, service to the customer with a smile at all times, and once done with the customer a last confirmation that all was good before letting the customer go.  Any problems with the service, quality of the food, time spent on handing out the food order or anything else, was taken care with the upmost respect and sincerity by the Team Leader( myself), Supervisor, and or Manager in this same order."
good,The crewmember it self is not bad employs or employers.The Store it self is a little rocky but everyone is trying there hardest to help get the store back in shape.The customers seem to love us we have a lot of regulars.
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced environment with time limit on production along with focusing on pleasing the customer giving them quality assurance
good,This was my first job. My review of this job was it was a cool job to have. Not very much money but besides that things were pretty good. I loved my co workers and the managers did everything they could to make sure we had the tools we needed to be as productive as we ould be.
good,"•	Greet and assist customers"
good,"Assisted the Marketing Director, Training Director and Maintenance Team plus our store locations in WA/OR.  Answered phones, filing, mail.  Enjoyed working with Colleagues."
good,"This is a good job for people who want to stay busy, like me. It is a job anyone can do and is a great learning experience. This is the type of job that teaches you teamwork no matter what way you look at it. It requires for everyone to be working together for things to run smoothly."
good,The best thing about working at Wendy's was there food and there amazing discount that they gave workers. I was struggling at the time but the 69 cent chicken sandwich always make me feel rich.
good,this was just a littloe job until school started be owner was a great person.the dining area was great and clean. the store owner was very kind.they can use more organization
good,"A typical day at work would greeting guests as they walk through the door and taking orders. Then I would get the food ready for them. At fast food there is lots of cleaning, therefore when no guests are around you would be cleaning tables the floors and bathrooms. The management was really poor. Management could  not schedule or encourage their employee's!! Lots of yelling at the employee's!! Managers were not easy to talk to! The most enjoyable part was meeting new people! However, the hardest was keeping food prepared for the guests! Other than the managers, the co-workers were very friendly."
good,"A typical day at work is full of cleaning, making sure the food is properly prepared, and that the customer is 100% satisfied. i have learned how to deal with huge rushes, how to deal with unsavory management and at times co-workers. The hardest part of the job is during the rushes, the best was when everybody was getting along and nobody was stressed out."
good,The managers at Wendy's were every welcoming when I first started working. The longer I worked at Wendy's I realized how determined they were to make sure everyone improves at their job. One manager would even go far enough to make another manager look bad so that the second manager is forced to improve.
good,learned how to be patient when it came to making peoples orders. I learned to work at a fast pace. was an easy job. The management was fair at times i got a long with all my co workers. the hardest part of my job was washing the dishes.The most enjoyable part was seeing people smile everyday
good,"Managing crew members "
good,"overall, the experience is a positive one. there are ups and downs, but everyone works together. all in all the experience is decent"
good,Wendy's is always busy everyday. I'm always on time for my job and I work hard to get my job done. I am currently a crew there since 2013. I learned to do what you can without getting stress. I can work with most of my co-workers everyday. The hardest part of the job is when we all don't work together as a team. The most enjoyable of the job is making the customer happy and feel like they are welcome to the restaurant.
good,"it was really very great experience to do work with Wendy's. All the team, manager every body was very good. All the team members were very helpful."
good,"The people are friendly and the environment is, as a result.  My coworkers were helpful and the managers had very unique personalities."
good,Cashier throughout the day and provided safety observations through the day to make sure everyone was being safe and following rules.
good,Wendys was a great place for a first time job. It gave me the support I needed for a first time job. If your looking for a first time job as a teenager wendys would best fit your needs.
good,Just answered phones at a call center for them. Did data entry into their complaint hotline software along with several other companies.
good,"The job has a learning curve, but not a difficult one.  It is very fast paced, and the busiest times are during meals.  There is also a late rush for the folks who get off work later in the night."
good,"Working in a high volume store, leader of restaurant.  Manages employees as well as daily operations.  Coaches employees on positive customer service."
good,"I was cashier, greeted customers, and took orders."
good,"A typical day of work consists of grilling/cooking food, scrubbing the oven and grills, making sure the store is clean. I don't have any problems with the management or co-workers, I generally get along with everyone."
good,"Minimum wage is all a high school kid needs, clean work environment, good managers, Good training program when you start working there."
good,"I learned how to interact with customers and serve them accordingly, I developed great communication skills, I was always very friendly and up for anything that came my way, the best part was seeing my favorite customers."
good,a typical day included at least two full buses it stayed busy all the time   the crw was fun easy to get along with...Management was usually stressed out...enjoyalbe part was the customers
good,Hardwork but very little pay. No room for advancement it was like staying stuck struggling because of the hours and pay. The people where great to work with. I learned a lot from this job.
good,"I learned a lot about work and life from this job. The management was tough but was still great. I was a cashier at this job and had a great experience with Wendy's, the employees were down to earth, the work load got a little hectic when it got busy was still over good."
good,I had a blast working here through highschool. Made lots of friends and it was a great starting point for my outlook of the professional working world.
good,"Opened the store in the morning and prepared for customers. In the morning I would provide maintenance on the equipment and outside by cleaning and making sure everything turned on properly and also set up all required equipment for operation of grill position. Once opened, I work the grill and manage chicken/meat levels or work in the drive thru, collect money and hand out prepared orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a team environment with multiple people around you, yet being an independent cog in a big system."
good,I could have been a better place to work if they cared more about the people that they hired. They need to treat the people that work for them a little better.
good,"I try to brighten each and everyone day at Wendy's, Great place to visit with free WiFi. The new soda machines are great. and they make everyone feel welcome."
good,"When working for Wendy's you should expect lots of prep work in the morning, fried foods and a whole lot of cleaning. The hardest part of the job was the night shift close to closing sometimes you would get a rush just as you are closing."
good,"It's an OK place to work, however, some employees are of questionable morals and behavor. I quit working there, not only because my car broke down and I had no other transportation, but because of the behavior of some of the other employees. I couldn't handle all the yelling and screaming at one another ALL the time over nothing."

Then Id get into position rather I was on front line, drive thru, sandwhiches. I knew how to do everything in there so the managers didn't have to say much to me."

good,"good place to work, room for advancement. sometimes management is shady though . ive been with this company for 5 years and its mostly been ok"
good,"Some days at work are busier than others. Weekends are more busier than week days. But also lunch hours are the busiest time of everyday. My managers work as hard as possible to keep our company up and running. Some of my co-workers could work harder, but thats not up to me to decide. The hardest part of my job is working with people who dont know what they are doing or putting up with rude customers but i deal with it, Cause my job is more important, need to make money for my son. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers come in and have a good attitude, and when my co-workers are in a good mood."

good,"I learned a lot about food preparation and customer service as well as safety and health skills. There really wasn't a typical day at work, even though thee actual work itself was the same, because every day brought new customers and experiences. My managers were great overall, they followed all procedures correctly and got the job done right. My coworkers were my other family, I was very close with most of them. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast-paced environment and learning the computer system when we got a new one in September 2014, but it was something I easily adapted to and got used to. The most enjoyable part of the job was thee people overall, both customers and within the store. Overall, I had a very good experience working there!"
good,"Constantly busy with multiple people in a very confined work space makes it difficult but tasks are still accomplish-able. Acquired the ability to accurately and swiftly take orders, prep orders, and send out to the right customer. Mostly friendly staff.

Most enjoyable making friends along with learning new skills to help better further employment."

good,. running the store lots of work not enough pay. full time. managing many crew members.
good,A typical day at Wendy's would leave you tired but accomplished. Everyday I would sell product to customers and workout their problems if they ran into any. The best part about this job is the customer base. Most of them are regulars that I knew on a first name basis after awhile. The hardest part about this job is learning how to handle each situation. No one person is the same and so each situation is different. Learning how to approach each upset customer to ease the tension was the hardest task but once learned I had the best customer service at my store.
good,"A typical day at work will be to take people orders and make sure you do not make a mistake. Also making sure the dining room and bathrooms are properly cleaned and stocked as well as the work station. I also had to make the drink, shakes and prepare the frosty's  and cones.

I've learned how to be more flexible with unexpected changes in procedures. Some co-workers are nice and easy to talk to and a few were annoying but it was easy to ignore the stupidity that would occur at work or the laziness of a few co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be the days before inspection, the most enjoyable part would be when I worked as the person that closing the dining room since I was able to help out around the store and other co-workers."

good,"I learnt a lot from this job. It gave me a sense of responsibility. I interacted with the clients and made sure everything was at their liking. I also cleaned the dinning room, So they could eat in a clean and proper environment. The staff was very pleasant to work with and so was the management. I had a very nice experience working here"
good,I am not sure if it was the location but a lot of the time the crew didn't work together and the managers pick and choose favorites to give all of the hours to. But no one stayed long. I stayed longer than most people. In 8 months I saw 12 or more people leave.
good,"learned to be adept in the kitchen and fast paced. everything else was a learning experience, but now i am perfectly adept to the job"
good,"It's a good first job, the people are awesome. The work, not so much."
good,"People think fast food is easy. They should try it. After you go through a $1200 lunch hour and you come out smiling the body hurts but the crew at this store make it easy. Also this is a small town and everyone knows me from Wendy's and I take great in knowing people come here because they know the food is hot and fresh and the store is clean and they will get treated great."

All of my co-workers are friendly and do an awesome job everyday.  Management is well trained in areas of teaching new job habits without bringing down others.
good,"I started at crew in September 2012. Through hard work and devotion, I got a promotion to Shift supervisor. The hardest part of this job is the inconsistence of a schedule. I enjoy the company of the other team members and customers."
good,"occasional rush hours at lunch,learned a lot of different things,managers were OK except one i had to report nothing was done so i had to quit,co workers were nice hardest part was getting food out on specific time"
good,"Wendy's, I would say would have been the most cool job I had, as weird as it may sound. I would work harder than most, but I did  it because I really enjoyed it, I loved the place and I loved working with my co-workers."
good,i work at the company they move out of the country with my family
good,It's a fast paced work place with lots of cleaning and must have good customer service
good,I loved working as a team.co -workers were very nice and very patience. I liked greeting customers nicely and see how satisfied they were with my service
good,Shift supervisors are in charge of a shift and the crew members working that shift. A manager must ensure that food is prepared and served as quickly as possible while maintaining exceptional quality in the food being served.
good,"Typical day at work was : start out with managing the fries and nuggets and then get to do the drive thru."
good,"I really enjoyed the physical aspect of running a Wendy's.  On the grill or making sandwiches is a lot of fun.  The real joy came from developing people into shift managers and Assistants.  I started as a Assistant Manager and within 3 years I was running my own store, and I had no previous food service experience.  I had great bosses to start off, and they really pushed me in the right directions.  The toughest part was controlling food costs and crew turnover.  But with some good coaching those were easily maintained.  I learned how to run a business because of the training program at Wendy's."
good,Was a nice work place with awesome employees. It was  a different experience working in fast food.

good,enjoyed working there. Worked hard and tried to have fun during shifts while still getting all my tasks completed.
good,"There is no typical day at Wendy's. You're always doing something different, and thats fun! Throughout my employment at Wendy's I learned everything from opening to closing all the stores I worked in. I became management quickly and loved the people I worked with. The hardest part about working at Wendy's is the very strict sanitization standards and service times, anything shy of perfection is unacceptable. The best part is learning new things, you're never stuck doing the same thing for long!"
good,I would have shifts all over the place sometimes in the morning and sometimes at night as well. My main shift was in the morning so I would go into work at 6:30 and I would have to put away the order that came in with all the products and I liked doing this to help me stay fit. After I put away all the product I would set up the food line and clean up outside to make sure the store is ready to open for the customers. Then after that I would make the order for the next shipment to come in which I enjoyed doing as well. And as Safety Marshal I would go around the store and make sure everything was safe for employees and customers and make sure all the temperatures for the food were right where they were supposed to be. I loved my co-workers there as well I made a lot of life long friends here. I also loved meeting new people through the customers you can meet a lot of cool and nice people. The hardest part of the job for me was doing all of these things at once it can be a little hectic.
good,"Although fast food is crazy, the people are awesome. Busy, non-stop and lots of challenges."
good,"Loved working there but very demanding, 60+ hours a week, learned a lot about financials, how to co-manage within a team.  Hardest part was being short staffed best part was customer interaction"

good,this was my first fast food job and i enjoyed working the drive thru because it was very fast paced and i learned things quickly. i had plenty of co workers. a typical day of work is really busy at the drive thru
good,Days would be fast for a few hours then slow for a couple just because of the type of business it is. I learned how to cook a burger correctly in a fast food environment. Management was mostly laid back as long as you got the job done. Most of the co-workers were good workers and able to get there job done correctly.

I also had the pleasure of working with some great leadership along the way who believed and supported me.
good,"Early shift"
good,"This Wendy's franchise seems to hold it's employees to a higher standard of customer service and efficiency, which was fine by me because if I'm at work, I don't have anything to do other than work.  As a cashier, I still had to clean tables, mop the floor, clean the bathroom, and other undesirable tasks, but everything I did had a reasonable connection to providing customers with good food fast at a good price."

good,"It's busy during lunch hours and dinner hours. I have learned to be outgoing and be peppy, basically, be out of my comfort zone. The management is good and my co-workers help me out a lot. I think the hardest part of the job is making sure I put everything right in the register and making everything is in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and making friends."
good,"Easy to do the work here at Wendys, great management, learned a lot from people here, everyone was willing to help each other out."

good,Wendy's was a very lively environment where in times of rush team members were very cooperative.
good,I learned what i was trained on and did what was expected of me and if an oppurtunity to do more presented itself and it didnt impede on my normal work i took the oppurtunity to do it. I was always clean and organized at my station i was assigned for the day and did what was expected of me to the best of my abilities. I didn't get to involved with my co-workers I generally kept to myself and did my job.
good,"A typical work day for me wasn't very great, I did far too much for far too little."
good,Wendy's was an alright place to work.I had some really great experiences while working at Wendy's. I had a lot of different managers and all of them were about our well being. The most enjoyable part of working there for me was the fact that I got to meet a lot of different people from many different places.
good,"typical day at wendys, you walk in and you find out where your position is. you count your till make sure its balnces at start of day of 200.00. and you do what you position requires, normally i am on drive through, so i take orders, collect money, seek for customer satisfaction. as well i would be washing all the dishes that get dirty through my shift. i prepare bacon pans as well as assist the front counter cashier with there orders if they are busy and have a line up more than 3 customers so they do not have to waitas long. "

good,It was hard to separate both work and family life. The work came home with me....the phone calls continued at home after I had left my shift. I worked there for many years.  I feel that 30 years in the food industry there needed to be a change.  I felt that I could not possibly bring change here so I needed to make a change for myself.  I enrolled in school with a greater satisfaction and accomplishment.  I feel rejuvenated and opportunity for me in the future.
good,"Cook burgers. Help guests, clean restaurant, complete side duties."
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced with great quality service"

good,"Open any position, co workers were good to work with, management would do their part, hardest part would be dealing with rude customers, and enjoyable would be customer satisfaction and knowing I served them."
good,This was my first job which taught me good multi-tasking skills and customer service.
good,"What's most important is teamwork! No matter what happens or goes on throughout the day, working and collaborating together always makes the day go faster and easier for everyone. The hardest part is if you don't have a mind to work and the most enjoyable part is everyone is themselves. We're not so uptight. We all laugh and have fun but when it's time to work we all agree on the same thing and naturally come together like a family."
good,"•Giving tours to new guests."
good,"A typical day included cooking and preparing food for customers."
good,Training at Wendys needs to be reviewed. A new employee is suppose to watch videos and watch how it is done then do it while being watched. Instead they just toss new employee in to sink or swim. When confronted about it management stated it was a waste to follow procedure due to waste of training funds. However when one messes up they are quick to discipline the employee. That is commonly called passing the buck.
good,Very few people came through day to day but the employees kept work fun.
good,"I learned so much at Wendy's. It sometimes gets busy and can be very hectic. My general manager is great, and so are some of my co-workers. Not all workers do what they're supposed to. Two of the managers there are not as fair either. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and the most enjoyable is seeing the same faces and meeting new people."

good,what more can I say it was hard work for little pay and you went home everyday smelling like grease
good,this job was ok only because my friend and i worked togther. if not then i would not recoment anyone to work here the management is really bad. the manager (Joe) waste more time trying to talk to the underage workers than running the business.
good,"Fast food can either be a nightmare or it can be a good starting experience. I learned how to move fast, interact with customers, multitask more efficiently, train employees, and occasionally lead. The best part of the job is your coworkers, the worst part is customers that are very rude."

Then I Would Move To The Front , And Work In The Front Serving Drinks , Greeted Customers As They Walked Up To The Register , And Assisted The Customers On Making There Orders. I Always Kept Whatever Station I Was Working At Clean At All Times."
good,"This job takes a lot of time, and really isnt for anyone who is in school. It can get extremely complicated! The work force is filled with all kinds of people. If you have any prejudices at all, you should never work here, and you will not be tolerated to work her. This place has a wide set of cultures, orientations and such things. The people who work here are usually fun and high spirited, but of course sometimes have very short tempers. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to meet so may different people. The hardest part was adjusting to an open minded group of friends! You are instantly accepted in most cases here."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendys especially during rush hour. It challenged me to move at a fast pace and accurately.
good,"Clock in, check shift chart to know where you were going to be, and relieve the person in your position. "
good,"Co-workers were awesome! Management was great, very responsible with situations."
good,"When working for the general work force of Wendy's the expectations are well defined.  It was easy to go in and do the things that needed to be done, and easy to learn and deliver quick and accurate results."
good,"I do not get enough hours at Wendy's and this is why I'm looking for another job, also the manager love to pick their favorites and I do not to work in an environment like this. I love being on drive thru. I work my best and I am really fast at getting the orders out and ready. Front isn't my favorite but when I'm put there I get the job done and make the customers happy."

good,"As with all franchisers, they like to higher high schoolers to be able to give them a bit of change for school and summer. If the workers had better worth ethics and the environment was not a bit hostile (from customers) then it would be a more enjoyable job."

good,I in joy meeting new people coming in and out of the restaurant.
good,"I learned many required skills for basic fast food service. I learned how to make everything on the menu, handle cash, and speak Spanish much more fluent. The hardest part was cleaning the grill. The most enjoyable part was of course making money."
good,"I was in high school and its a great job to have as a teenager.  Its hard to remember all of the tasks of the past outside the give ins of greeting the customers, working the register, and restocking the shelves; it was so long ago."
good,"My position here was a cashier. I assisted customers with placing their orders, and ensuring that they received such order accurately. I answered general questions pertaining to the menu and surrounding areas. I learned how the fast food industry works, and how hectic it really is. My management team was the best. They made work enjoyable with their sense of humor. My co-workers always pulled together to get the job done. The hardest part was cleaning the restaurant after hours. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet people from all walks of life."
good,Great communication with staff ...enjoy serving quality food and service to customers.
good,"People are really good to work with, fun to be around. Learnt customer service, closing and opening the shop, doing the till at the end of the day."
good,"I had to take orders, collect food and drinks and give it to the customers. I also had to sweep,vacuum, and mop the lobby, kitchen and restrooms. I also had to do all the dishes in the restaurant and take out all the trash in the lobby."
good,When I have a few day I needed off they were willing to work with my schedule. They also are willing to let me work other than just being a cook. They have trained me for different jobs.

good,"A typical day at work consists of delegating tasks, customer service, keeping the restaurant clean, and counting cash. I learned how to be a leader and a team player by watching, interacting with co-workers while getting paid. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers."
good,"•	Learned valuable cashier skills, including handling of money and dealing with customers. "
good,"All the horror stories I have heard as a kid seem silly compared to how Wendy's lays it down. I'm washing my hands after almost every thing I touch. Don't even think about using something after it hit the floor, that's going in the waste bucket that managers count every night. I enjoy my job as a Wendy's Crew member, I primarily close so i tend to clean a lot more than cook but im expected to keep food at certain numbers (an example being maintain 2 crispy chickens from 10 PM to 11 PM) based off of the previous weeks wastes and sales. Time management is often the key to my job and when i train others who are just coming onto the staff I let them know this as often as I can. I take pride that only after two months they had me working with employees who had double my experience at the time to help them understand how to improve their efficiency. Being the known best closer at my store allows a little pride to show in my duties."
good,Decent place to work. Very easy to do. Most day'\s I work on auto-pilot. Takes some time to get used to. I have learned patients and honed my multi-tasking abilities. The higher up management is OK but within the stores themselves there is gross favoritism which can lead to a very uncomfortable and sometimes hostile work place. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers and lazy coworkers. My favorite part of the job is when we have busy shifts where everyone can put aside the animosity towards each other and get through the day.
good,A typical day at work was calm and laid back. I learn food safety skills that I can use the rest of my life. Management was amazing and fun to work under. Co-workers were great and helpful when needed. The hardest part of this compay was clean up could some times be a little stuborn at moments. The most enjoyable part was time would fly working in this company.
good,a typical day at wendy's is fun yet timely u have to know when to do certain thling so that yu dont run out of product and greet the costumer an dget them in and out the store. The hardest part about working at there is dealing with all different attitudes by costumer that  want to throw their food at you and leave the restroom very nasty for you to clean after them.
good,"The managers and co-workers are friendly. It is an encouraging environment to do better every day in terms of making the sandwiches look more presentable as well as increasing the speed of delivery to the customers. "
good,"i liked working here, meet a lot of nice people and enjoyed interacting with the customers"
good,Overall nice entry level job considering if you are in college. Since the hours can be rescheduled.
good,"It was definitely hard work working at Wendy's!  My jobs there varied between food preparation, cooking the foods, making sandwhiches, or fulfilling the role of cashier.  Lines of cars would wrap around the building and a line of people practically out the door, usually at lunch time.  It kept me busy for sure!  It was my first job, so its where I established my excellent work ethic!"
good,Always there when you want a good burger and fries! The people are friendly and courteous. Working there really got my into enjoying the food industry as a start.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consists of preparing product, cleaning and stocking the kitchen and grills, and working as a team to get the customers food to them quick but still keeping the quality. The management at Wendy's is pretty laid back. As long as you get your job done right, you don't have the pressure of getting in trouble. As for the co-workers, everyone seems to enjoy each other's company and get along fairly well. Hardest part of the job is cleaning the grills before closing hours. But the most enjoyable part of the job is around 9:00 P.M. when it's slower and you're able to get caught up on your close, allowing time to fly by pretty quick."
good,"A typical day at my workplace consists of general duties of a crew member. I am to give great customer service while keeping a clean presentable work place. My management are very productive and giving, occasionally you have downs at work but there is always an upside. My workplace has taught me to take the ups with the downs and that is a very challenging thing to do. I enjoy the challenges of working with others and keeping my work neat and in line."
good,"Taking food orders,taking money for food and returning cash. Cleaning lobby area."
good,"take orders and sort them out, clean, work together with other employees as a team"
good,"Very Demanding Job: Most people come on their lunchbreak so we have to move quickly in order to get them out in a timely manner"
good,"The management team I worked with was great! We had a great relationship and worked well together. This job was high impact, high stress, ALL the time. I learned inventory control, how to read and execute daily sales, product, and waste charts, I trained the new employees in the store, so I was responsible for how they felt about their new job. This was my favorite part of my job."
good,The best part was interacting with people everyday. I learned a lot about management. My boss was absolutely wonderful.
good,The company was great and I enjoyed my time there. However there was no work/ life balance.
good,"i loved working their,until my boss started sexual harrassment with me."
good,"Making the customer happy everyday was what the job was all about. I learned a greater base of customer service skills, i learned how to operate a cash register. I also learned how to work the grill. My co-workers and some managers were great to be around and always made the work experience the best."
good,Was great to get to know the customers and give them the best service possible
good,"wendys is a good place to work the staff is really friendly and so are the coustomers. The hardest part of the job would have to be making sure all everything runs smooth, and also having to deal with people when they are having a bad day"
good,At Wendys I would be helping customers with the orders they make. I would also help get the orders together when it rush hour would hit during the day.
good,"I was a dinning room attendant I clean the dinning room,bathrooms, sweep and mop the floor, I also cooked frys. The bad thing I didnt like about the job and was hard was getting the orders ready to give out the drive thru window and somthing would be wrong because i would get into a rush or give the wrong order to the wrong car"
good,"Generally, I answer phones and emails from customers, employees, and vendors and send the messages in the right direction. I will welcome visitors and offer refreshments. I am responsible for ordering all office and break room supplies on a regular basis. I am often called upon to help with other departments, such as HR, Development, and preparing for large regional meetings."
good,"fast paced, cook,  prep food,  a friendly environment"
good,"clean "
good,I love the management team. They teach you on how to maximize the skills that you are good in. 
good,"cook"
good,"My experience at wendys was ok. What ive learned from working at wendys is that, its all about the customer, even if there wrong. Management could have been a little bit better, but at the end of the day, they was just doing there job, because they wanted it done correctly.The hardest part of this job was lunch time, when we had to do a rush, it would get a little crazy. The most thing i enjoyed about being there was the discounts when it was time for lunch."
good,Wendy's was ok. nothing worse than lunch hour. but together we got through it in a timely and profeicent manner
good,"I usually worked on night shifts, from 5 to 11 at night. I would be responsible for a certain job during my shift, such as a grill man or a drive-thru order taker. I would do this until closing time, where then I would help clean up a certain part of the restaurant, such as washing dishes or moping floors. I learned how to communicate with people better than I had before, and learned the value of hard work. There were about five shift managers, each covering different shifts throughout the week. The co-workers were very easy to get along with, and it was an easy place to make new friends. The hardest part of the job was when at certain times during the shift, there would be a lot of people coming in at once to place orders for food, and there would be a rush for food. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, and making new friends. "
good,"This job was very repetitive and fast paced. You had to always be prepared to work late hours as closing took some time, during the weekends, to be exact. You were always on your feet and doign something that the time went by fairly quickly despite the repetitive jobs throughout the day."
good,"During my time at Wendy's, I worked as a cashier on both the front and drive thru. I handled  cash and credit transactions quickly and accurately. I was able to maintain high standards of customer service during high-volume, fast-paced operations. I excelled at what I did. I worked many of the positions at Wendy's, like sandwich maker, fry station, dishwasher etc. The best part of working at Wendy's was the employees."
good,"I took pride in my work in doing a good job."
good,"My typical day was working in the drive thru and on the cashier. I learned how to work under pressure, at a fast pace. My managers were helpful people, provided good hours, but could be a little disrespectful at times. My co workers were hard workers for the most part, fun to be around, and helpful. The hardest part of this job is getting comfortable with moving at a fast pace, and being as precise as possible. Once you get used to the enviroment it becomes very natural and easy going. Just have to be willing to work hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you could make someones day and having the opportunity to meet new people."
good,A typical day always started out a little frustrating but as the day went by it became a lot easier when everyone was finally on board
good,"Also a great place to work; high paced environment, challenging days/nights, loved customer interaction and solving problems."

good,Wendy's is fast-paced being a fast food franchise and i loved working there.
good,"The typical day was fun but at the same time we took care of business. I learned how to be apart of a team and a leader, management and my co- workers was so cool we all got alone, so I didn't have to deal with any drama. The hardest part of the job was the customers."
good,"I had fun with my co-workers, though I feel I was overworked. I was doing three different jobs at once, all the time, and was only getting paid minimum wage. On top of that, I wasn't in any management position to be doing all that work. My manager never asked me if I needed help, nor did my co-workers, but I made the best of it for my family. They are the only reason I lasted so long."
good,a typical day at work was just steady moving. I learned how to greet customers and keep a smile on my face no matter how I was feeling. The hardest part of the job was when we wasn't really busy and there was nothing to do.
good,Wendy's works very well around a student's schedule. Responsibilities are manageable and simple.
good,Working here means you need to learn how to work clean and to properly clean all manner of things along with customer service. Co-workers come and go quickly and management was really good but high expectations. Hardest part was dealing with call offs and having to work short handed. 
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the time I spend getting to know the customers.
good,"Make sandwiches, take orders and handle money. Joke around with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet each customer and take there orders, make there drinks, clean tables, cook fry's (if we are short on staff), wash dishes, and make sure everything looks presentable."
good,A good place to work. A 10 hour a day work shift.  Supervised 25 employees. Became a Training Store Manager.

good,All of my fellow employees at Wendy's were great people and I had a lot of fun working for Wendy's.
good,My problem was other employees that refused to do the work with the rest of the team. we are only as strong as our weakest link.
good,"this was a fast pace job that I like it kept me on toes for the time I was there, I clean the bathroom and th dining room, I learn how the work the fry machine.   "
good,Job is a great teenage job for when you need some on the go money. Not for a career. 
good,"I loved this job because it was fast paces, I met new people every day and also worked with great teamplayers."
good,A typical day is fast pace most of the time and busy. You learn that you must work as a team to get the task completed. You have to work with your co-workers in order to get the job done. The hardest part i would have to say and get the work done correct but as well as fast. The most enjoyable part would have to be interacting with the customers.
good,I Love Working at Wendy's. All the co-workers are nice. They work with you when your sick. Talk to you when your down.
good,The store where I work is fun to work at. It has its busy moments but the crew is able to work well together to get everything done. The managers are nice and easy to talk to and my co-workers are really great to be around. Unfortunately there are times when I find the stock room understocked and have run out of perishable and nonperishable items more than once because the company miscalculated on what needed to be ordered.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fast paced, and usually short handed. I've learned EVERY position, even some manager skills. I usually work without help for several hours."
good,start by stocking store a lot of good people good management
good,I dealt with customers through out the days. I learned how to resolve complaints and settle disputes without having to get upset and that customer service is the main focus. The management team and the co-workers was very helpful and assisted me when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was handling customers when it's a rush like dealing with 30 people coming in at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and putting a smile on their face.
good,"This restaurant operates like a well-oiled machine. Every day, the managers tell you what they expect you to do, and what they would like you to accomplish on that day's shift, and some point during that work week. The hardest part of the job is making sure you're doing everything as fast as possible whilst still ensuring everything is top quality. The co-workers are easy enough to get along with. This particular Wendy's gets a lot of business, so a typical day at work is usually focused on everyone keeping a smile on their faces and making every customer happy."
good,Typical day was decent. Some co-workers were iffy. Hardest part was being busy and enjoyable would be learning new things.
good,"Excellent opportunity to learn Customer Service and learn about your co-workers. Plus, you have to build a relationship with your managers, so they can do a favor for you if you ask them."
good,monitoring mostly teen-aged staff and meeting company standards for quick service and quality. Learned a lot about quick service operation. the hardest part was creating a stable crew and loss prevention.
good,It was always a fast pace work environment but the people i worked with were pretty nice to work with. I also enjoyed the customers.
good,"Worked at a dynamic pace as a Cashier. I worked with multi cultural co workers and customers. I greeted every customer, while notifying the customers of sales, new items, and deals. Asking the customers orders, while making sure the customers orders were accurate were my main focus. I gained experience and knowledge on the cash register, and handled the customers payments. I also had to make sure that I cleaned, sanitized, restocked condiments dispenser, and clean all the tables."
good,"working at Wendy's taught me to manage and satisfy customers. the hardest part of the day was closing the store, and making sure it was up to stander for the following day."
good,this job is for a person that can really move for a long time. Handling the customers and becoming a part of a family where the highlights of my stay at this job.
good,"I loved working at wendy's, i was a shift manger which consists of assisting the crew in their jobs. Maintaining operations and cash control. Handling guests complains and fixing them."
good,Challenging because i deal with a new costumer every day People skills and how to deal with problems Management is good they are friendly They are also friendly and enjoyable to work with The hardest part of my day would be when i just get there and have to clean up someones mess that they should of cleaned up The most enjoyable part of my day would be knowing that i did something good for someone
good,People are nice. I learn how to deal with coworker and how to take to manager about my expectation.
good,"small job to get your feet wet in the food industry, good to grow and learn in this comapny."
good,As my live in caregiver employer:
good,"It was my 1st job had it for 3 1/2 years. most typical day at work was when i had to keep up the pace, i kept trying to keep up but it keep pulling away from me. management, it was kind of rough some were nice, some was cranky. Co-workers, all of them were hard workers and giving great service to customers. the hardest part of my job, was when i had to get the grill spotless clean when theres so much build-up. My most enjoyable part of my job, is when i was being nice and friendly to customers and helping out what they want."
good,It's really fun for it to be a first job. It could also help you start off your career and better it.
good,"take and make orders, the most enjoyable part is counting money."
good,"Enjoyed hosting birthday parties for the kids who had an birthday party , there was always something to do."
good,A typical day wendy's was fast-paced. I learned how to multi-task. Management was good. I worked with alot of different people I learn to take the good with the bad. The hardest part was frying burgers on an open fire. Enjoyable satisfying the customer.
good,"good job great co-workers, but no room for growth. perfect for a first job"
good,"I would do my job duties, opening or closing, i learned the right way to work with food and how to clean product, and how to make things. management was good and co workers would listen to me when i asked them to do something. hardest part of my job was trying to train new people the right way to do things after others showed them the wrong way, and the most enjoyable part about my job was getting to know new people and make new friends."
good,I have gained a lot of confidence and people skills over the course of the last 5 years working at Wendy's. I have also learned time management as I have to come in every morning to help set up the store. As a Crew Leader one of my jobs is answering phones and taking messages for the managers before they get there. Also making sure everything gets done on time is one of my duties as well. I will do whatever I can to make sure that the customers are happy and things are running effeciently.
good,"I like helping people and seeing happy satisfied customers. I don't like complaints and rude, unsatisfied customers. I liked learning new ways of making sandwiches and different forms of cooking with salads and chili and potatoes. I don't like working with lazy people and those workers who complain to much and slack off. Hard work does pay off and honest work is honest pay. The hardest part of the job is drive thru sandwiches and sometimes coordinating. Lack of communication there along with overworked and underpaid workers. There weren't any benefits or health insurance only if you were a manager. A regular employee has to suck it up and deal with out of pocket expenses unless they somehow can afford their own health insurance through a private insurance that they can afford. Employees would get sent home due to business being slow or just scheduling too many people on in one day so money and job was never a guarantee. Never make a career in fast food. The job is there so you can get by and be what you want to do in life.Everyone was just having fun and just making the best time that they have and just trying to get along and make the best of work in a day."
good,"Worked eight to ten hour shifts, most times without a break. Co-workers and half of the management made the day bearable. Learned to adapt to the flow of customers throughout the day."
good,A day for me there was taking peoples orders for a while and mostly cleaning the tables and bathrooms. Co-workers were rude and not professional. Overall i didn't like it.
good,"A typical day at work is always different, you deal with different situations all day long. My co-workers and management aren't always as very productive like I am. The Hardest part of my day is trying to make sure that my team is ready for whatever comes our way. And the most enjoyable part of my day is seeing the customers smile !"
good,I was required to open the restaurant early morning and continue onto the lunch rush.
good,They will give you as many hours as you would like to work and overtime from time to time.
good,"A typical day at work usually started with me coming in ten minutes early, stocking my station, and then signing in. It would usually be busy for the first hour or two, and start slowing down by 8 o' clock. My co-workers were a lot of fun and it was like a pseudo-family enviroment. I enjoyed being around them and they made working at Wendy's a lot of fun. The managers were also easy-going, but they were definately professional and valued their jobs. There was always a level of respect that was constantly there. The hardest part of my job was the really stressful days and when there were customers that weren't good at speaking english. The most enjoyable part of the job was definately the people I worked with and how they never failed to make my day."
good,"Very busy atmosphere, customer service focus, lot of systems in place to run a million dollar+ business. I learn that everyone in their position was important and a great piece of the puzzle. The hardest part of my job was wake up calls in the early morning hours of the alarm going off. The most enjoyable part of my jod is knowning that i encourage someone to do better and they listen."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking food orders, preparing food and drinks, and also taking and giving back money"
good,It was a good high school job. I learned how to communicate with the costumer face to face and how to handle complains and difficult situations.
good,I enjoy working at Wendys because the atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly. All the coworkers were very nice when i was first hired.
good,"I have learned to deal with all customers with respect, even when they are being difficult. I also learned how to deal with different personalities and behavoirs without taking things personally. Typical day at work would be coming in and producing fast but friendly service. Serving quality food and making sure each customer have a pleasant experience so they would return. Being aware of food cost, labor, paper cost, inputting inventory in the system daily. Making sure crew members are upto date with WeLearn certifications. Also, making sure I am up to date with all my personal Welearn certifications and making sure that the restaraunt is always inspection ready. The best part of the job was dealing with the people(co-workers and customers). I love people and the interaction with different people is enjoyable."
good,I loved this job . My manager was a very good boss. If i ever needed help with anything he helped as much as he could.
good,"My typical day at work got boring once i got transferred, i would like in interact with others and work in a suitable environment."
good,A typical day at work involves me learning alot of new things. My co- workers are great and we get along really well. One of the hardest parts of my Job is the lack of respect that is shown towards higher authority in the business. The lack of working done on the part of the crew members. the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. They are sweet nice and always have a nice word to say or they show kindness towards ones that treat them right.
good,A typical work day for me is to open or close the store balance registers and manage staff
good,"A typical day at work includes taking customers' orders and money and serving a smile. I learned to use the cash register, make sandwiches, and coordinate orders in drivethrough all done at a fast pace. The management always made sure the jobs were done right while taking good care of employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to multitask different job duties at once and trying to provide good customer service. The most enjoyable part of the jobb was dealing with the customers."
good,"I go in to work check all grounds before going in restaurant , then go in check all what needs tobe check on my list because we have to keep a log for safety issuse on the restaurant and for the safety of others,What i've learn there is good leaderships skills, responsibilitys,"
good,"One of my most favorite jobs. I enjoyed being able to see, meet and interact with many different people."
good,Great benefits. This company set me off to being very independent. You always must put the customers first.
good,"Work here was fun. I worked with people my age and got along well with everyone. I learned here how fast food works. Its a very fast paced work enviroment that got easier the more I worked with my teamates and built a routine. Management was great, they often helped out and answered any question I had for them. The hardest part of the job was during lunch hour. Work became really fast paced but exciting. Everyone worked in routine but one little mistake could turn into a big one."
good,"My typical day at work is from 5 p.m to 1:00-1:30 a.m. I would start out making the sandwiches for the main area around 9:30 p.m. I would then close my station so I can hop over to work on drive-thru orders. At the end of the night I would be cleaning the stations, floors, countertops, trash barrels, bathrooms, and the front area and also vacuum."
good,wendys was a fairly enjoyable place to work.
good,great benefits if u stay with the company the manager really took pride in store
good,Steady pace
good,Working at Wendy's was a good experience. I started while a Sophomore in High School and continued until my last year of college. The only reason I did not return was because there were no positions available due to slow season. I would recommend it for young people just starting out or if you are looking for a job in your career field it would be a good place to earn money until you find the right position for you.
good,Environment was very face paced. Required good people skills and team work.
good,"The job was really easy going, I knew how to operate evertthing in, and out of the kitchen."
good,I helped assist managment with training new hires and supervised all crew members on my shift. I aslo prepared food and helped on register. I learned how to supervise staff and make schedules. My managment team was great with helping you reach your goals. The hardest part of this job was te call ins on a consisting basis. The most enjoyable was the fast paste enviroment which made the time go by fast.
good,worked in various areas of the resturant. cleaned up as neeed
good,"The Wendy's i worked at was full of negativity and misunderstandings, management sucked, and the work place wasn't so good."
good,Wendys was a very good job to have. It helped me get ready for the real world.
good,A very fast paced restaraunt. Loved the customers that loved our good food.
good,"I learned each and every area of Wendy's from regular associate up to management. I have to say that this area a lot of people feel is beneath them or too easy for them to do. I would have to disagree. I think those who make this their career deserves appreciation. This job teaches so much to a person. You learn humility, by customers who feel they can talk to you in any manner; you learn respect, not only from your co-workers but also from some customers; and you learn confidence in yourself. More people should respect and thank those that work and/or make careers in the restaurant business."
good,"""Welcome to Wendys! How may I help you? Would that complete you order? Thank you it will be my privilage to serve you at the window!"" now thats a typical day for myself at Wendys. This was my first job where I put my people skills to use, customer service, well mannered and everything else. The management at my Wendy's was great we had alot of different people all the time. The others that worked their were always comedy. Even after high school I went to college and came home holidays and breaks still to work and was always welcomed with open arms. The customers in drive thru were regulars and a bowl of laughters. I loved this fast food restauraunt. Thanks Wendys Oak Grove."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be to take care of customers and make sure they are happy. Working there made me learn marketing skills, counting down drawers, making sure co-workers are ok, and making sure everything was well-kept and cleaned. The hardest part of the job was making sure your co-workers were doing what they are supposed to do, but the most enjoyable would be that you get to meet a lot of new and interesting poeple daily."
good,"Received great, individual, one on one, thorough training. Fast paced atmosphere and great networking. Meet lots of people from all over the place. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers during rush time. Management was great."
good,Did not like the job because the pay was bad for the workload. The job did not offer enough hours but the job was not hard to adapt to.
good,"In a typical day at work I had to make sure about the food safety. Also, organized the co-workers in each position. Manage the food quality and the sevice time. Hard part of the job was when some co-workers call out, and I have to cover there position. The most enjoyable part was when the team accomplished everything that had to be done."
good,"Prepare food, prep food, answer the phone, run the drive thru, run fry station, make sandwiches, maintain staff,"
good,"Fast paced, there is never a dull moment and I am pleased to be apart of a good team."
good,"A typical day at work is great, teamwork is great, and the managers are cool. We try our best to satisfy every customer with a smile. I have learned almost every position in less than two months and the managers are very helpful. The co-workers are very nice and help where help is needed. The hardest part of the job is to keep smiling while customers, who came with an attitude, to smile even though you haven't done anything out of line. The most enjoyable part is the rush. When we have a rush the teamwork is great and the adrenaline is high."
good,"I Received payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issued receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Counted money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts were correct and that there was adequate change as well as maintained clean and orderly checkout areas.

good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be working the drive-thru, filling the condiments, cleaning table for the customers. At Wendy's ive learned how to better serve customers. Wendy's management team was a great team. The co-workers always came together as a team. We always understood what teamwork was. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do the drive-thru. The drive-thru was a little complicated for me because Wendy's was the first job that I worked the drive-thru. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the front register."
good,"Delegate all duties and responsibilities of a Cashier/Fast Food Cook Responding appropriately to all customer needs and Any other tasks as or required to better assist all customers. Maintaining solid product knowledge and awareness of all advertisements, promotions and all other aspects of the restaurant. Assist in processing and replenishing merchandise and monitoring floor stock."

A typical day is never dull working with and serving different personalities. While working in a faced paced productive enviornment, I take pride in being timely and efficient. I especially took pride in the products and services."
good,"Look at Wendy's as a start in the work place, but to have some experience under my belt and to understand how the work place can really be. At the end if the day it was a good environment to work in."
good,"Very hectic and sometimes not managed up to par. I learned a lot about personal responsibility and how to solve problems on my own terms. Many of the co workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very uncontrollable customers. The most enjoyable part would be working, learning, and teaching with the employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at wendys it was my first job, very fast pace something that i dont mind and i enjoyed the people i worked with."
good,Wendy's is a great company to work for if you want to move up in the business. Managers make great money there. But you have to be able to handle a fast past pace environment.
good,"Easy to get along with staff. Good hours, and pay. Free lunches after a shift,"
good,Start making sandwiches and salads. Learn front cash register and drive up window procedures. Management staff is always available. Co- workers always willing to assist with additional training where needed. Difficult customers is always a part of sales. Seeing regular customers come into the store is always a pleasure
good,I enjoyed working with the managers and learning how to make different food items. It was close by college and I also made friends.
good,"Greeted customers in the restaurant or drive thru, took and rang up orders"
good,It was my first job. I learned a lot about my co workers. The management was great
good,My days were short but busy. I leaned my customer service skills. The management were friendly and supportive. My co-workers held the same quality. The hardest part was food prep. The most enjoyable part was greeting the customers.
good,I enjoy working here. The other employees are fun to work with and almost every day is fast paced and busy. I'm a sandwich maker and i really enjoy doing it.
good,"Fast food, same job everyday. Nothing new, hardly talked with fellow coworkers. Had issues with way things were ran at the store I worked at. Went to management and problmes still persisted. Quit after several weeks of no changes."
good,"Wendys has been a great endeavor for me. All levels of the upper management are young and energy filled. The people at store level are for the most part, hard workers however in this business everything is performance based. With that being said, the majority of the employees for this franchise are content with where they are. I would love the opportunity to progress in my development, but there isn't any open positions at the next level. I would like to seek opportunities else where."
good,"This job was very exciting, I was always looking forward to going to work. I also enjoyed using my own choreography, because I really love dance. My favorite part of the job was the recital at the end of the year when everyone got to watch my students perform along with the other dance classes."
good,a typical day of work would be to set the goals for the day and accomplish them. the most enjoyable part was being able to talk to different individuals on the phone and get to know them a little bit. the coworkers were very nice.
good,"i enjoy the enviornment. The work place was great and fun, however became difficult at many times. Rushes were always the hardest to work through because drive and front were slammed full of people."
good,Good overall experience with decent pay and flexible scheduling.
good,wendys is a great place to work with a lot of interesting people also learned alot about the fast food industry
good,I started working when i was in high school until 1998 it was a very good job i liked it very much
good,Fast food is a really busy carreer field. It requires quick learning and alot of patience with people.
good,everyone i worked with knew their job and were very helpful and friendly. kept the whole of the restaurant clean and well maintained. it was fun and a learning experience.
good,"This store had a decent staff while I worked there. I did not advance though, and the job was also offering no benefits. I have a strong work ethic, things started going sour and my opinion was neglected and I could no longer continue working for this company. I parted on good terms, and am very much still rehire-able within the company, although desire is slim."
good,You can never go wrong working at wendy's. The satisfaction of the custmer is my joy.
good,"I enjoyed it, everyone that works there was a hard worker, I enjoyed working drive thru.The hardest part of the job would be that sometimes customers would be  a little difficult"
good,"The work I always enjoyed and took pride in, however with such a high employee turnover rate, some of my colleagues were less than stellar.I always enjoyed putting out high quality food."
good,"I enjoyed working there, great people. Always there when you need them. Customers were great. I love helping others and getting customers there food in time and hot"
good,"Things don’t always seem right but it’s an extra paycheck."
good,Its a very comfortable enviorment but also could be a little challenging because you are dealing with someones food so u have to be cautious and sanitary but also in a timely fashion.
good,"It really depends on the management you work with which almost defines workplace culture. Nonetheless stringent rules, the workers and managers were great enough to help new beginners to work with and were forgiving enough despite making mistakes. It’s an excellent starting point but can be stressful at long-term dealing with customers. Colleagues were great to work with and the most enjoyable part of job but dealing with stress from customers will be always the hardest part of job."
good,"It was an okay job for my first one. The schedule was flexible and my coworkers were overall cool people. They really try to show they care, surprising you with a cake on your birthday or ordering a pizza for the team after a really long rush."
good,"Was pushed out of my store, and attempted to help other manager at different store. Up until i left to move stores, all was good. Went down hill very quickly though"
good,"Theres always that everyday rush, it gets frustrated sometimes if the orders are not properly rung in the system. But if you have an organized staff, everything will go to plan."
good,Everyone was really nice work wasn't hard good benefits for a fast food place they were great on the hours they never sent people home before the times they were suppose to
good,I got lots of hours here and was treated rather well. its a great place for a first job. it offers opportunity's to grow and gain experience. whether your day will be good or not definitely depends on what manager is working.
good,"I was treated fairly, I made some life long friends here. The management was amazing and the employees were happy with it. Thats where i really learned to love working, and love counting money."
good,"I only worked there for two weeks, because I had to focus on school. While working at Wendy's I flipped burgers and fried fries. That's pretty much all I did."
good,It was a great Frist job it started out rocky for me because I was bullied by a manager at the beginning but she ended up quiting after that happened I liked going to work it was a good routine to have and once you get the hang of it it's fast and easy
good,I was a student and it worked out nearly perfectly. The most of the assistant managers were very helpful and patient. The general manager is inconsiderate of his employees.
good,"Working at a fast pace, staying energized keeping my body moving,good chemistry and communication one of things I love. One of things I enjoyed was free food their and it was 2 minutes away from my house."
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's could vary depending on how much you knew, and where you were stationed. The most enjoyable part of the job was how the staff got along well which made work go by faster."
good,I worked hard and learned fast. I did a bit of everything. I preferred night shift. Because I'm not a morning person but I'd work any position available. Plus overtime if available.
good,"They was wasn’t doing things right , cooking wrong things. They wasn’t washing they hands . Fighting in the store . Wasn’t getting paid right. Getting treated wrong"
good,Wendys was a really fast paced job got really busy at times. The people I worked with were really helpful and always thrived to become better at whatever it was they were doing
good,I think the job overall is a good place to work but only as a job u want to start off with. The 12 o'clock rushes be crazy but we get threw it thought.
good,Its a fast food joint. Not much to be said about it. The management did look out for its workers and there is advancement opportunities but they are very competitive.
good,My Wendy’s location was great. Everyone there was like a family and all worked together. Hours are flexible and they will work with you if you need a certain schedule.
good,I loved to work at Wendy’s great people somewhat trust worthy is was just I wasn’t getting paid good enough for the work I was doing plus more but the over all I enjoyed working at Wendy’s
good,while I was working there the management was not as proactive as they could have been. The other employees were very respectful and friendly. They were very flexible with hours as well.
good,Making sure everybody has everything correct and stocked. I learned how to manage  working with difficult people. It is an workplace filled with love sometimes hate but mostly love. The hardest part of this job was making sure angry customers are satisfied.
good,"Every day is very repetitive, but also ever changing because of seeing new customers and creating better experiences. I learned how to take lead and get crew to actually be alive and happy at work, even when they were having a bad day."
good,"I mean it’s a fast food place, it’s pretty decent and it’s not terrible and you establish a good relationship with your fellow colleagues it’s stressful obviously but it’s a good start if you need a job."
good,"The job is simply a job. Work in rich neighborhood. So you deal with stuck up people or the college kids. Late a night, all rich high school kids come at the last minute to destroy the place. Have fun!"
good,I love working at Wendy's. friendly and understanding coworkers. Upper Management are great people to work with who have lot of experience. I personally learned a lot and developed my self as who I am today
good,I ran the shift starting at 4 am we put everything together and started prep for the day. Everyone had to work together. Worked at the Airport location this is a very fast paced environment at times when planes were boarding near by. I loved my 4am shift we were like family.
good,"It is a good company to work for with advancements for managerial positions easily available if you're willing to put in the work that is required. Personally I had 2 different General Managers that I worked for. The first was an incredibly understanding and hard working person who made sure the store was in top notch shape for not only customers, but the employees as well. The other was similar in many aspects though this individual took pictures of me while I was eating"
good,Typically I would start the day prepping salads and other things for the day at 6am. Then after receive an hour break around 10am and then work until 330 or 4. As a supervisor we received a free meal a day and crew would receive 50% off. Overall not a bad job but you must know your rights as an employee or some management may try to take advantage of your lack of experience.
good,I worked there back in 2013. obviously things have changed over time. We have 4 managers and only one was able to meet everyone's needs while the others called off or had attitudes.
good,"Trained on things you are needed to know "
good,Alot of lessons slot of up and down but never fails to show you something new either it's the customers or the workers and short staff you got to work with what you got
good,"Wendy's is OK if you like to work for fast food chains. They're food really is fresh, they usually have decent Managers but unprofessional Co workers. You get to accumulate sick time for days u may need off and you still get paid. You get lunch and other incentives as well depending on what store you work for."
good,Wendy was my first jobs my experience there was a little bit different i didn't like how the supervisor talked to other coworkers i felt lke she was a little bit disrespectful due to her title
good,"Good work environment met a lot of great people some being employees and some being customers. Management wasn't the best, some were to young and not mature enough for that kind of role."
good,Great job lived the smell and grills when they heated up while cooking the hamburger patties or the chilli. I love the work environment its resptful and talkative it's like family and it's a relaxed and comfortable work environment.
good,"very busy, but i enjoy the fast pace environment. and the people are great.  The place is cool but the managers can get a bit overwhelmed with there responsibilities."
good,Overall Wendy’s was a quick pace fun company to work for. Very family oriented and with hard work very reasonable advancement.  friendly management and hard working staff
good,"Face pace friendly environment, decent pay and hours. I would recommend working here if you like working at a fast pace and work well with others. Friendly managers."
good,"The job tasks are very simple, but it can be a hard job when you have multiple tasks to do at once. Training varies depending on the management team. If you enjoy a fast paced environment, it can definitely be a fun job to have"
good,"Working specifically at the Wendy's I worked at was, in the end, not what I expected. Nonetheless, I was happy to have the coworkers I had and the experience was useful to have."
good,"For this to be my first place of business it was a great experience, even though tough at times but all in all a great job to begin your life in the work force"
good,"The Wendy's in Artesia had really relaxed management, the training was not very good, but it was not too hard to figure things out. The other workers are pretty nice."
good,Wendy’s is my first actual independent job. Here I learned team work and people skills. I learned to work under pressure and hard spots. I promoted here fast. Also I learned time management
good,Working at Wendy’s helped me to interact more with people and communication. Experienced people different attitudes everyday. The hours i work did not intervene with taking care of children.
good,"What more could you expect it is fast food. The stores I worked at were decent because the people that made up the staff. As a crew member I worked in the small town of Morrilton and things ran smoothly for the most part. I recieved opportunity for advancement and I  took it became an assistant manager at one of the Conway locations I enjoyed the crew I worked with. Leading the shifts was nothing out of control or hard to handle as long as you know your crew and their strengths base your night on the crews strengths. I will admit it wasn't a breeze always have a very small few who just don't want to be there, don't  want to comply, or just having a bad day. I just had to remind myself to take it one day at a time. Unfortunately i couldn't come to an agreement with the general manager nor the district manager to move me from closing shifts to either morning or day shift, to be with my autistic child."
good,Wendy’s was a fast paced friendly environment that was fun to work in. Having many opportunities to learn new things everyday is interesting but also knowing what to except was great.
good,"Great place to work. Managers work with you to make sure you know your job. It clean. Fast paced. Great atmosphere. Half off all food items, raises every 6-1 year."
good,I use to get shifts on weekends which is always busy. Always started my work at 10:00 AM. Making sandwiches and getting good with employees. The good thing I learned at work is the time- Management. Its bit hard but good to do work at proper time.
good,"Working for wendys was an awesome opportunity. The staff and general manager wers awesome. However, they seriously lack in team leader training. I would have never left if team leaders gad been properly trained for situations."
good,"Fast food workplace, tends to get busy and require you to stay busy. Manager was respectable and will help in times of need. stay vigilant when working here."
good,i worked a lot and it was pretyy cool guys idk what else to say except it was awesome i got free food a lot i mean half off but yea lol uhhhh yea it was dope man
good,Lots of cleaning and small jobs. Not hard to learn different work positions. Point of sale system is easy and helpful. Gain customer service experience.
good,"Very busy place to work if you like that, good people to work with and decent management. It was a good place to learn how to work with money and janitorial services."
good,"It’s a good place to work at and sometimes you can be short handed on employees, but you still manage to get the job done if you just pace yourself and stay calm."
good,"*management was fair"
good,I’m happy here. They have been very flexible with my availability. Easy place to work. Weeded out the bad eggs. Very understanding. Management is mostly fair minded.
good,"I worked first shift, made sure all dinning room condiments were stocked, tables and floors cleaned and customer ready.  I usually worked the front counter, loved to see my everyday regulars and talk to them about there day!"
good,You would learn how to be active when needed too. Always gotta stay focus.Hardest part of the job is when you mess up or a coworker mess up the food order and costumers complain. But overall the job is great cause youll be able to make friends along the way
good,While I was working at Wendy's the coworkers are very friendly and all ways help you through tough times with the customers. Also working here you will always be active no matter what time of the day it is.
good,It’s a good starter job. Mainly for high school kids or people in college. Many chances to advance. Definitely be ready to work hard as fast food is demanding
good,"It’s not a bad job just need better hours and better pay "
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work, except for the managers at my location were not good at there job. The managers played favorites. The best part of the job was working with the customers"
good,Wendys has a great working environment  have worked with multiple characters  and personality traits and  found  it great experience  working and learning to communicate with  others not hard just work and maintain its easy and simple
good,"My review is they had a good management, staff was always present and also good in training. It was the snvironment of the workplace what made it fun and easier for everyone. Each one of the employers doing their task thoroughly and prep meals at their time."
good,"The managers are fun to work with, great positive vibe. Everyone is friendly, It did take a month to get regular breaks. The breaks are to short, sometimes it takes about 10 minutes to order because we have to wait behind customers, and we have to wait 5 minutes for our food."
good,a typical day would include a busy schedule. i learned how to keep calm and help people find what they needed  help with. the hardest part was trying to stay clean and managed with rushes coming back to back.
good,"It's a good job, very fast paced and energetic. I learned a lot will working there, mainly because it's my first job but dealing with customers and handling money. Just staying on my feet, keep it moving and keeping the customers happy. The hardest part was dealing with an unhappy customer and the best is being around a bunch of good crew members will working there."
good,i washed dishes cleaned up prepared for closing . made fries and nuggets and started to learn table. which is sandwhich making .helped cleaned lobby and parking lot .
good,"The part I loved about working at Wendy's was the environment, everyone tried to be positive, helped out if needed and we got things done as per request. Everyone contributed as a team"
good,I stared back when I was in high school and they tought me alot. I left for 5 1/2 years and came back. They seen potential in me and within three months made me a shift manager. I worked hard and they kept training me. They worked with my schedule when I had events with my daughters and they cared. We are a family there and I will miss them every day.
good,"It’s a good work place to start at, but I needed something more for myself. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a place to start working at but not to stay forever."
good,"As an Assistant manager I was making around $28,000 yearly gross. It was a good company to work for, but as soon as I found a company offering more money I put my notice in."
good,It's a job for people who need work. if you want a reliable paycheck show up on time and do the job no more or less. the customer interaction isn't bad and honestly i respect how corporate functions and their training videos are very well done. with that said if you want to make a career out of it you can just try to work for a corporate location because the franchisees can either be great to work for and allow you to advance or be ran terribly and have bad management.
good,the company was fun to start a job at with friendly coworkers while higher management could be a pain at times. Good for a student looking for a part time.
good,Interesting place of work. Wendy's has taught me to deal with extremely disrespectful customers in a respectful manner. The workplace culture made my experience okay.
good,I love the hours. The crew team was helpful even though we didn't have many workers. Customers are hit and miss. Even if you go over the top they still complain about something. I got tips from regular customers.
good,"I had a very good experience in wendys . It was my first job in fast food area & I can honestly say I loved the experience. I got to learn new things about fast food making , the grill , sandwich making , maintenance etc."
good,"Working at Wendy's was my very first job, When I first started, the job  description was pretty straight forward, however, as I worked more and more it became harder. I started working on the night shift once I graduated high school. I usually work  13 hours a day and it was tiring. The mangers that I worked under moved up the better position within the company, so work load became heavier. Some nights I found myself running drive thru and making my own sandwiches."
good,Se Trabaja Bien sea Un Poco Fuerte Pero Uno Sabrá Como Puede Aser Las Cosas Bien
good,"Working at Wendy’s was challenging yet competitive. It was very fast paced, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Management was strict yet fair, and schedules were flexible. Pay raises come slow and off-time and pay isn’t high enough, though."
good,"Overall i liked it, been there so long i knew how to do almost everything and i became the go to girl even from my manager, you can make any job enjoyble is just on how you look at it, i liked my job and i liked the environment. I was there when we change from corporate to franchise and had to learn everything on both ways. Only reason i stopped working was that i went in labor at work, couldnt keep on going."
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Wendy's. The family friendly atmosphere made going into work less like a chore. Like most places, it is full of cliques but overall everyone gets along. The food quality is outstanding compared to other restaurants I've seen. They really do cut everything fresh in the morning and do not freeze their beef."
good,"The work at Wendys isn't just for anybody you have to be on time,fast paced,do everything right,don't get nervous,and make sure your job is always done. I am really calm in stressful situations."
good,Good job to have when you are in high school and trying to make a couple bucks. The coworkers were fun. The customers were not but all you can really do is smile and wave
good,"Wendys is a family vibe type of job . Managers are great and flexible , really works with you . I worked with them for two years as my part time job it was great the time i spent there."
good,I had the opportunity to meet so many people. I was able to advance rather quickly in the company. I achieved Sales Mamager of the year in the Nashville Market.
good,It's a great job to start your first job. They teach you the skills to becoming successful in the food industry. They help you with communication skills.
good,"Fast paced work environment, great place to practice customer care, a good learning experience to help build the ability to work along side a team with the same goal to service customers as quickly and correctly as possible"
good,Ive worked with Wendys for about 3 and a half years now and ive defiantely learned all the positions within the store and they even promoted me to a shift manager. But it is hard to find coworkers who actually care for their job and want to stay busy.
good,"i would come in at 5 or 8 depending on the day and work girl and the back half of the store and have dishes done by 10 and leave either at 11 or close. i liked Wendy's it was a nice place to work, it had good management and nice team members."
good,Job was interesting while i was there. Definitely learned alot of teamwork very fast pace enviroment. Make sure your customers are happy when they leave.
good,Management was pretty understanding. Pay wasn't the best. Could get stressful during rushes and is very dependent on teamwork. Benefits are horrible (I don't remember receiving any that didn't cut my check in half) but you get a week vacation every year.
good,"Great for a first job, but lacks advancement and benefits. Fast paced and great opportunity to learn job skills. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day and dealing with some people."
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's is very fast paced. I have learned to multitask much more than I usually do. Work management at Wendy's is sometimes firm. However, the work culture is friendly among work members. The hardest part of working of Wendy's is keeping the timer down in drive-thru when we have customers coming through that have no clue what to order and take a long time to place their orders. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's is when our time is reasonable and we are able to balance our pace and collaboration and a team."
good,Very fast paced serving job where you greet high volumes of customers on a daily basis and prepare large quantity of food. Great for learning basic service skills and learning to work with a team.
good,"A normal day of work was quite simple, just come in start your daily cleaning and restocking, then start at whatever station your suppose to be  assigned to."
good,The team at Wendy's was fantastic and will help you if you need it on the job. Everyone strives for the common goal of getting through the day and getting out as close to on time as possible if you are on the closing crew.
good,"Enjoyed getting to work with the public. It could be stressful at times, but overall a great experience. Good managers and a great crew. Alot of focus on teamwork and cleanliness. Would definitely recommend this job to someone who is just looking for some extra spending money but would not recommend it as a career unless you intend on going into a management position."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's as my co-workers and Manager all completed their respective jobs in a timely, pleasant, and professional manner. Great working environment, challenging Menu with many variations of hot and cold food items. Fast paced work as orders had to be timely, especially for Drive-thru service."
good,Wendys is a best place to work at. you get to meet with lovely people each day. you also get the oppotunity to learn new things and you can become anything you want while working at Wendy's.
good,"Fast-paced environment with a team atmosphere and productive management. I enjoy working with the public and being helpful, but sometimes it can be extremely busy and without teamwork it would be very stressful. I do receive a discount on my food while at work. The management always worked with my school schedule."
good,"High work pace, was challenging to say the least my manager was willing to accommodate us if we were having trouble with a certain job and allowed us to our our preferred job."
good,Some if the crew members are not friendly .otherwise its good place to work.needs to give more hours to crew members.they dont have work but they hiring people a lot.
good,Fast paced but fun some long hours but flexible with your shift and hours if need be could pick up hours if available. couldn't keep steady assistant managers
good,Wendy’s is a great first job for those learning the responsibilities of being an adult. The management could use some work as they don’t treat their lower managers and employees as well as they could.
good,It's fast food so don't expect much. You'll work mainly one poistion and pick up one or two more well enough to run other people 30 minute breaks. Days are predictable
good,"there was plenty of stations to be placed at on the job, it was very easy but fast paced. you also as a team had to work together to make sure things got done in a timely fashion."
good,In my opinion I think that Wendy’s is a great first time job for anyone looking. The offer many opportunities to young individuals beginning in the workforce.
good,Working at Wendy's was a nice experience. I learned a lot. There is a definitely opportunity for growth if you take it seriously. The flexibility is great.
good,"I had a good time working here, interacting with regular customers and new ones alike. The staff was always nice and the management did a good job. The only disappointment is that they only offer full-time to managers and those positions can be hard to come by."
good,The business was okay but the way some of the companies look at educational needs is nothing to be ignored. With so many possibilities never ever sell yourself short.
good,The only thing that makes the job worthwhile is having friends to be there with. But if you don’t make friends fast you will automatically become bored of routine.
good,"Working at wendys was by far one of the most stressful and fast paced jobs I've had to experience. Although typical as it was a fast food job, if you become friendly with your co-workers, it soon becomes very enjoyable and you all work as a team to get things done and on time."
good,Overall had a decent time. As time when on it got worse and worse. Didn’t enjoy myself. And it could be easily improved with stronger management. The workers were fun and didn’t seem to mind but we all didn’t want to be there
good,"Wendys is a fun and friendly environment. I was able to advance pretty quickly once I graduated from high school. Being my first job, as an associate, I was taught responsibilities and a strong work ethic. I appreciated the time they took to help me be the best I could be."
good,"This is your usual high school job to get your feet wet into the real world as a kid. Working after school and if you like it, there is definitely room for growth. Only at 16 years old, I was doing grill, drive-through, front register, sandwiches, fry station, salads...etc. You name it. I didn't stay because I had bigger plans but this place has a special place in my heart. (You WILL gain weight working here)."
good,The environment is clean and staff is nice.orders are hot and fresh and served fresh. The staff is respectful and very inviting. Will refer this company to friends and family.
good,"I loved it, and learning the importance of procedures as well as their purposes gave me the upper hand in coaching my crew to safely and efficiently exectute each shift"
good,"My working experience with Wendy's is great except that they give you your weekly schedules and you expect that it is fix but it was not, they tell you to go home early instead of 8 hours it becomes 5 to 6 hour  more or less.No fix time.   And if it is very busy you cannot eat on time because some manager's would not let you take your break during peak hours. But I love working together with the team.regardless of scheduling."
good,"learning speed of service and how to properly rotate food product according to company policies, and to treat our guests properly by handing fresh food"
good,"Good for a first job wouldn't recommend it as temporary one . You will be working yourself for little pay . Also poor working conditions fryers , grills and timers broke"
good,It was ok some of the management took the power way to far sometimes but some of them were really good at there job the manager I had he was great wish I could work for him again he taught u alot and showed alot he took time out to b a friend and a great boss
good,"Here i learned to stay stress-free during busy days, how to address customers, and how to provide quick, quality service. The managers can be a bit intense, but really help you when needed."
good,"everyday at work, was always a good day. same sweet customers,postive vibes,great service .nothing but laughs. i miss it,and the customers  that rememberd me."
good,Wendy's was my first job and it was a decent experience and I can now sympathize with those working in the fast food industry. Working there for a long time they days kind of all blended together. The average work day was mainly cleaning and prepping for lunch or dinner unless I closed which meant I cleaned everything. The most enjoyable part was mainly the people I worked with. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers or people not showing up to work.
good,I like the job personally it is all about how you feel about certain things when it comes to the fast food industry. It has amazing people to work with and great managers.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's, nonstop work from the time you start till the end of your shift. They usually don't give us breaks, but if we ask then they'll give it to us, you just don't get paid for it. The good part about working there is that I get to see some of my friends. But besides that, my co-workers are so rude. They make me want to quit Wendy's. But I have to say if I worked with nicer people than I would recommend the place because this job keeps you busy."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is a 8 hour fast paced work day, I learned what it's like to receive income, and being responsible and being punctual. The management there is okay one time when I was there I wasn't payed for the 1st month cause it was a mix up. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the place was dead we got to watch tv until people came. Overall Wendy's isn't a bad place to get started for work."
good,"I liked it but didn't like my pay and wanted to look for a better opportunity.  I enjoyed the communication with all the managers,  and they helped me with anything i needed."
good,"Work days at Wendy's were always busy either cleaning up after of preparing for a rush of customers, and then rolling through the cycle again. I learned that not everyone is cut out to be a manager, and those who are need to learn how to communicate properly to everyone on your staff. The culture was laid back and everyone was friendly to one another. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an immature shift leader, and the most enjoyable part was working day shift and moving the whole food process like a well-oiled machine"
good,"A typical day would be a 6 hour shift, standing the entire time. There would be interaction with customers and co workers. I learned how to use a cashier system and have better time management. The most enjoyable part was being around people who were committed to getting the job done and having regulars who I could get to know and interact with as well as meeting new people. The management was ok, most of the supervisors were very helpful and made sure that you knew what you were doing and doing it the right way."
good,"I was a starting Assistant Manager, then a Co-Manager, then a General Manager. I had fun, I had to know how to measure profit/loss of our restaurant, while providing great food in a clean atmosphere with smiling employees. I'm too old to do this now, but I thoroughly enjoyed this time period of my life!!"
good,"When I worked at Wendy's I did a lot of cleaning like wiping down counters, tables, chairs, windows, taking out the trash, doing dishes, and lots more other tasks that improved the location."
good,"A normal day at work involved keeping the shelves stocked, making sure people kept on track, and talking to customers. Often, if a customer was angry, a manager would step in and take over. I made a lot of friends working here and enjoyed it."
good,Nice place to work but no enough people to work .it is to hard to work that lots of things to work for  a single person . people not stay long for that reason .
good,"Wasn’t horrible for food, but the tell you what you want to hear instead of what they’re actually going to do. They will work you as much as you allow them and will hire new employees above their seasoned employees."
good,It’s a good place to work at if ur in school still but if your not in school it’s not a good place to work at or for a long period time after that you would have to find a new job
good,Hectic at times but very fun at others. Lunch rush is very fast vs dinner is more slower and more of a cleaning time. All task get done during the night sift
good,"I learned time management to get things done in a timely manner.  How to utilize people in there strong areas to make the shift run smooth and not difficult."
good,"If you have a great team the day goes by smooth but if not it’s hard to keep up with guests. Keep composure with costumers, if you can’t handle them, find a manager that can."
good,Wendy's is a good place for your first job. Scheduled varied from week to week but I usually had the at least 20 hours at the least and nearly 35 at the most. Pay rate increases the higher the position you have. Overall was a nice job with good management.
good,Sometimes it's too busy sometimes you have nothing to do. All depends on your location. Managers can be cool and let you eat for free or they will give you a discount
good,"It was a very nice working environment that I worked for, I gain a lot of customer service as my first job. My coworkers and managers made it a fun and safe workplace for all of us."
good,I really enjoy my time there for the most part.  I like the fast paced style.  Ive worked at many different locations.  Some are better than others.  I'm really looking to get out of food service.  Nothing personal against Wendys
good,The job overall wasn't that bad to work at. I actually enjoyed it. Only worked there for a few months but it was great for starting out and getting more work experience and it paid pretty good too. Only flaw was the amount of hours I was working was get the top and couldn't do it anymore.
good,It was okay to work there I only really liked it because the co workers always came in on time and we didn’t have to wait for other people came and we had a lot of remembrance times at Wendys and I was only there for 4 or 5 months
good,It is a great place for people to learn the basics of customer service and how to actually deal with people difficult or simple ive worked here almost a year and would still be very happy and interested in my job if it weren't for a robbery that had recently took place during my shift
good,"Working at Wendy's was great. This was my first job and the co-workers/management was nice. I would recommend this as your first job. However, there sometime would be a language barrier as to where I could understand the spanish speaking staff and sometimes other workers would have to trabslate to me."
good,"I absolutely LOVE working for the franchise that I work for in the Vancouver/Portland area. This company is one that I do not want to leave. It is better than a company, it is a growing and successful company."
good,"A typical day at work is claim relaxed, I learned how to take temperature of raw meat , management was good for the most part. The workplace culture was good , hardest part of the job was when the consumers was Impatient while we were trying their order and the most enjoyable part of the job was when I was makin the consumers happy ."
good,"Working for wendys  was a good experience , I made some life long friends and learned a lot about the fast food business. The atmosphere was mostly fun and happy and the crew I worked with was great. Most of the managers were good people but some were very difficult to get along with. Over all I enjoyed my time with the company."
good,I loved working for Wendys and the customers I was serving it  helped me open up and get to learn new things and I got to work in a team it pushed me to do better
good,I like the hours. I loved my positions. I loved my pay.  Great teamwork. Great quality food. Some of the staff were friendly. Customers were comfortable.
good,Have open availability long shifts short staffed at times be prepared for lots of call outs and people walking off of shift most managers help with night closing duties
good,"Ran a crew of 7 plus employees."
good,I have a Wendy's to thank for exposing me to the world of customer and food services. I enjoyed my job until responsibilities beyond my job title were placed on me and management was lacking.
good,A typical day at work would consist of me opening the store and getting all the food prepped and ready to go so that the food would be ready to cook when the first order would come through. Then I would hop on drive thru sandwiches and get the sandwiches out in a fast pace but not too fast where the food looked sloppy and not appealing to eat.
good,"I had no problem with this job or any of my coworkers. I loved going to work, my manager and co-worker was helpful, nice, and friendly always. I have no complain on this job."
good,While I worked at Wendy's i was paid $7.50( hourly) for two years. The hardest part was dealing with customer complaints and bad management/ work ethics.
good,"Wendy’s has great people to get along with it is a very multitasking place u have to be on your stuff when working  There, work your hardest and you’ll receive a good reaction including more hours"
good,"The pay, quality of life and staffing needs to improve.  Better medical insurance especially vision... Better accountability for managers... But overall a good company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendys because they recognize when they have good employees. They value their managers and while it is only fast food, I actually made decent money working there."
good,This is fine for a part time job. It is exactly what you would expect from a fast food restaurant.  Nothing horrible about it.  Good for a second job to make a little extra monry.
good,really cool place and all but you can get tired of the same atmosphere really quick the general manager barely keeps promises every manager is really kind they can get bossy from time to time it depends on the stress they are going through.
good,Decent environment fast paced and great customer service. Food cooked to order and very few complaints. Hard worker and always busy. Management needs a little help
good,Watch over daily restaurant operations place employees in proper places do job function while running shift keep help in positions handled money  and any complaints
good,"It wasn’t a friendly work environment, nobody would work together, people were disrespectful, didn’t give me good hours, manager didn’t know how to run the company,"
good,I had a great time at this job but there was no Advancements. There is a drought on giving management positions at this location. They don't want to work really and to much gossiping.
good,A good first job for teenagers seeking an outlet for more experience with responsibilty or a way to earn their own money. Also a good way to learn how to work with others in an environment where team work is vital.
good,"Wendys is a good place to work, but it’s not a job to you would want to stay at long term. It has good managers with good hours if you’re looking for them."
good,"A good place to work, great discounts . Management was ok. However, they would make you work shifts that you were uncomfortable with. One of the night shift managers were rude"
good,The co workers were real nice. Everyone worked together. The managers were easy to talk too. I would definitely go back if I had the chance. I recommend Wendy’s to anybody.
good,I love suggesting to the customers that they should try certain foods and drinks.  Or just making them laugh not knowing if they were having a bad day.
good,"Wendy's in general is cool to have as a first job. But after a while the money doesn't add up cause let's say you have bills to pay, you end up wanting more money. So you end up leaving cause they don't pay good enough"
good,Working at Wendy's is fun is easy you do the same thing just about every day and it's family-based everyone gets along with everyone and we all help each other out
good,"First job when I turned 16 and great place to meet people daily. Also a nice place jump on different positions and learn different things. Management is great, they try to get to know you"
good,Personally I liked working there. I thought it was fun. There was a lot of times when the costumers get under your skin but for the most part as long as you manage your station the managers and supervisor don't bother you.
good,"My first job, it was a great stepping stone to get into the working world. I learned a lot of what it was to be patient and be courteous as well as handling my responsibilities such as (closing the store, cleaning the kitchen, taking orders, handling cash and being accountable for my bank."
good,The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. If you keep your personal life personal there definitely be no problems or misunderstandings. Also work smart not fast.
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced and filled with lots of customers. I learned customer service. The management was great! the hardest part of the job was keeping up sandwiches.
good,I worked mainly as a grill guy. It was fun. Had a rhythm down to where things would go smoothly. Trained a couple people too and that was fun. Hardest part was during rush times or during events.
good,Wendy’s was a fun team to be a part of at times. Some days you would walk in and it would be a relax day not to busy but other days it was chaos. As a cashier you were the first thing the customer saw. You were to create a comfortable eating environment by keeping the lobby clean at all times and usually closing it by yourself. You would be in charge of taking the orders and making sure they got out to the customer. Management was again overall good.
good,Wendy’s was can amazing experience for me and I loved most of what they had to offer to me. I have gained a lot of experience in the little time I was there. Wendy’s gave me an opportunity to expand my horizon in the work force and become a better employee to my next employer
good,It starts off slow then around 11 picks up to a moderate pace from 12 to  3 or 4 begins to slow. At around 6 or 7 it will pick back up slowing at 8 or 9  then is slow tell close
good,"I would recommend working in fast food to any young adult, It's fast paced and good for character building. I started as a crew member and quickly moved to shift manager. Just work smarter, not harder be sanitary, and keep a positive attitude."
good,"This business was an awesome place to work at! Working with family and close friends, and being able to learn a lot of skills that will help me in my future career paths. Work/life balance was amazing and easy to manage."
good,"Very fast paste "
good,"Wendys in Bolivar is a great place to work. My employees, managers, and customers are friendly and easy to work with. I had a great time working with everyone and everyone became family."
good,Learned a lot of good skills. Flexible work hours. Work is intense and stressful at times during rushes. Crew members are easy to work with. Good structure.
good,A typical day at Wendy's was stressful because of all the customers who come in at once. I learned to move at a fast pace. Working the grill is the worst and working in the back is the best in my opinion.
good,Don't really have any problems as of now need more air if anything but . As of now I really don't see any big problems that come with the job I like my co-workers and the managers cool so yeah.
good,Good place to work at and improve your customer service skills. A lot of different diverse group of people and very helpful and skilled people to communicate with to complete a task.
good,"Greet customers, take orders, take money, smile, and keep the kitchen and front end clean. Properly cook food, open the till and prep in the morning, make that chilli."
good,"Great motivating managers, clean organized restaurant. Devoted employees with customer satisfaction in mind. Overall not a bad place to work if you are a student."
good,Was very hard working. Had three hours too complete my work. Made me more aware of my work and how to manage my time. Made me get up earlier to get there after school and football games.
good,Wendy's can be a very fun place to work if you do what you're supposed to do and if you make it enjoyable. I definitely would recommend this job to someone because you get paid fairly and the management is great.
good,You will learn how to multitask in a stressed environment such as lunch rush. With a good work drive and a sense of responsibility you can advance to other positions in the kitchen.
good,"Everybody there was friendly to me, a couple shift managers asked me to work on their clock because they knew they could count on me to show up and do my job. I was always busy doing something."
good,Working at Wendy’s was overall a good experience to have. I enjoyed the environment and the people I was working with. I would recommend working at Wendy’s.
good,OK place to work if you need a job for a while. Very low chance of getting a rise or advancing though. The upper management office takes forever if ever to do anything.
good,It's been a while since I've been employed with Wendys. When I was employed with Wendys it was a very work friendly environment. The managers where very understanding and easy to get along with. The managers where very involved in employees lives trying to advance them as much as possible.
good,"Fast paced, could be stressful. Easy job but the pay was comfortable for high school students and their lifestyles.  It was a little difficult making ends meet with the pay due to not being able to go over 30 hours per week."
good,All the associate's cared not only about the customers but also fellow crew members and made sure that everyone was in a good mood. Associate made it fun working at Wendy's.
good,I always went far beyond my job to create a good working environment. never had any issues with customers or the associates i worked. my managers loved me and I always wore a smile.
good,"A typical day depends on your shift time. A morning shift starts with food prep until the store opens. After opening you cook and serve food. Depending on your position your duties change. The constant among all positions is that it's fast-paced and generally not enjoyable. "
good,It's a good services of a crew and have a quality product that they serve to their good costumer. The management/s provide good care for the costumer.
good,"I liked to communicate with the costumers and greeting them. This company had great employees and I’ve learned a lot bout food service. I loved to work at Wendy’s because I like to multitask and more. I worked on Fries, Sandwiches, and drive thru."
good,"My first job when I was in high school...it was a great starter job to give people a feel for work life. There isn’t much room to advance that much, but a great starter job none the less"
good,This was a wonderful job and an wonderful experience to provide customer service and keeping to customer happy there where some ups an down but I mean what job doesn’t have that kinda just have to roll with the punches and keep it moving
good,Great environment but chances of career advancement are slim. The people are easy to get along with especially if you're dependable. If you're looking for something short term it's the right place for you.
good,"""If there's time to lean, there's time to clean!"" busy all day and expected to clean too.  Most of the managers were new so they weren't very responsible/reliant.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed making sandwiches."
good,"It’s a good work place and a good environment to work in , decent benefits, and jus an overall good job place to work in. If wasn’t for moving I would’ve stayed long terms."
good,I think all the shift managers are under paid with all the work and and abuse we take from the big bosses and the customers we really don't spend time with our families due to how my GM makes our schedule
good,I worked as a customer service representative at the Gateway plaza.  The training was a good experience for future customer service roles I have taken.
good,"good place to work more for younger people, high school kids and such. I do like it there and the management but fast food industry is not for me. The hardest part of this job is learning all the daily tasks and the most enjoyable is the employees and management"
good,Everything about Wendy's is basically what you expect. The thing about the one I worked at was basically poor management because of people that stepped up that shouldn't have.
good,"Hardest part of the job is when someone calls out and most of the time you can’t get someone to cover so you work shorthanded and also the hours there is no consistency so you close one day and back as a mid the next, and open the day after that. The people that I work with are great and have a good sense of humor and good work ethic."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy's for the year that I worked there.  The other staff were mostly great to work with, and the work itself could be fun too.  It was really great when everyone was working together as a team.  For my position, I was on the Drive-through, and did dishes mainly.  However, depending on the needs of the business I also learned and performed just about every other task to be able to fill in for others when needed.  There was a high turnover rate, but there was also a core set of dependable employees who were fun to work with, and we all took pride in our work making our Wendy's the best in our area.  I enjoyed working there over all, and wouldn't have left were it not that my pay capped out at about $1/hr over minimum wage, and it wasn't really helping me to pay off debts that I wanted to get paid off."
good,"I have always tried my best to keep the guest happy and make sure what they have ordered is correct, and always advertise our logo “Fresh Never Frozen”"
good,"learning the strategy of working together with team members . Running the floor etc , workplace culture was relaxing and enjoyable to work in. Pretty small area but definitely worth the position"
good,"Fast paced work environment. Busy, with a lot of responsibilities. Can be stressful, with long work days. Clean and quality standards. Lots of training."
good,It is a Very fast pace environment when it is lunch or dinner rush. Management is very easy to talk to. You need to be able to pick up on new things quickly.
good,"My manager was pretty amazing that owners were super nice. The food is way better at Wendy's than any other fast food restaurant in cleanliness, and better ways to cook the food. If my location didn't close down I probably would've been there longer. Best co-workers I've had. Fast paced could've paid better."
good,"hamburgers and fries. Chicken nuggets and frosty for sale from 10 to midnight.Learning as team member;Pursuing quality product, speed of service, and customer service.Management must be more aware of customer concerns, food safety , and supervising employee activity while serving food and drinks.The hardest part of the job is lack of interest . The most enjoyable is the sense of achievement you might feel after a long, and straining day in a hot,damp, and cramped kitchen."
good,Es buen trabajo lo malo de ahí es que no tienen buena administracion y no saben valorar aloss en empleado
good,"Great job, friendly people, but very few room to succeed. Management was great and fairly easy job to maintain as long as you do what you are told. I loved it."
good,"Of course its fast food and this is my first I had ever had. I liked it because it is very fast paced invorment and makes the time fly by but I liked it because it made me feel as if I was always doing something. It got stresful at times but it balanced it self out, I think this is a good place if you like fast paced work places!"
good,Working at Wendy's was great. The employees were nice and would help me if I needed the extra help. Majority of the day went by extremely fast and I enjoyed working there.
good,great place for a first time job or for a student that needs a part time job.  Flexible with the hours due to school and after school activities. Different shifts as well
good,"some of the management was poor due to the fact that some of them sat in the office the whole time when we are short staffed and when we are not. It made a day at Wendy's hard because we kept having to wait for management to step up or go find them. Most of the employees here actually acted more like management than our actual management. As well as, some of them did not do anything about some employees."
good,the work place at wendys was very well and fun but it is just not what i am looking for at this point in my life. i would like to move on to a better job at this point in my carer.
good,to work for a company like this is just something temporary. I dont't believe that this should be anyone's career choice for life. Just a stepping stone in life
good,Good place to work but not recommended to try to make a career out of it . Can get stressful because of the fast pace environment and dealing with customers problem
good,"attitude from customers all day"
good,I only worked for a few days. I couldnt get use to the grease smell and the slippery floors so with knowledge of this. They politely laid me off and i was ok with that
good,"It's fun to work at,sometimes stressful, sometimes good managenent. I get discounts for food, everyone is very nice. I'm always busy always have something to do."
good,"have to be a hard worker person, be able to communicate well with the staffs and just be a good employee. overall, wendy's is a good company to work with"
good,"I worked at every Wendy's in Battle Creek one in Kalamazoo and the one on Michigan Ave and Venoy and I have had fun and bad times that each one of them however Wendy's will always have an issue because their managers are underpaid and overworked so they don't care about the quality of the food that gets presented to customers which is why you have such unhappy reviews sometimes but all around it was a great place to work,  make sure that even if you are unsatisfied with the workplace your food comes out up to par because the customers come first unless they are rude then you can express yourself freely I always say"
good,"Typical workday consists of drive through window, preparing sandwiches and providing customers with the best service possible. I learned how to juggle several different tasks but still get them done correctly and precisely."
good,For my first job this was perfect for me. It was right in town and it was super flexible. I was able to participate in all of my high school activities and it was easy to trade shifts with people.
good,"Depends on what you work. In the morning, you would have to prep for the whole day, which only took 3-4 people. I served meat, served fries, operated the order taking computer and front desk, and make sandwiches.  Dealing with mad customers is by far the worst part of this job."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The job itself was fun and enjoyable, but there was a lot of stuff at my particular store that would stress me out. The store manager was not at all great, we were always seemingly short-staffed, and a lot of the other employees didn't seem to care all too much about getting their part of the job done even though everyone plays a critical role in the restaurant business, as we are a big team."
good,A typical day at work at Wendy's is usually slow starting off you usually restock items so that everything is ready for when customers come in. Employees that work here are nice and easy to get a long with.
good,"Managers can be rude. Owners of our franchise are morons and cheap skates. Pay is poor, healthcare is too expensive for what it will actually cover. New owners do not want to pay us employees who have been loyal for years to the brand what we deserve."
good,"Management was great, all seemed like friends instead of a boss. Very fast-pace, you stay busy. The hardest part of the job is when there are a ton of customers, and few crew members."
good,"not much to word it , it was fun and enjoyable to work at food and beverage branch . their also friendly worker that may help you anytime if you got problem .."
good,cashier. greeting customers. Cleaning bathrooms and dining area. teamwork. making food and drinks. handling money and etc. being fast on your feet. nice to customers
good,A typical day at work would be me on the drive-thru window taking orders and making sure the customers had everything they ordered. The managers helped to make sure that all the employees were able to keep up with the amount of people were coming in to get food. They never left us to fail.
good,"My job title changed day to day.  The assistant manager would leave and put me in command.  I was on drive thru most of my time at the South Tryon location.  This was a fast paced job, that got stressful but I was able to handle it."
good,"Working with Wendy's was an overall good experience having to work with food and cash and cleaning, learning new jobs around the place as a crew member"
good,"It's a fun place to work when the right people are there, and too stressful with some people there. You learn a lot of skills while working the companies main purpose is to prepare us for a real job"
good,"when I started it was really fun, but later as people left for better jobs it got worse. when i left it was getting better. now it seems like it is better and the pay is better."
good,"Customers service is number one, considering Wendy's you'll need to be self motivated and willing to work late if necessary. It is an ideal job for someone who is also attending school."
good,"Fast-paced environment and stressful if not use to this kind of line of work. Management could have been better, but overall it was welcoming. I left because I found I was allergic to the fry oil and the hives became uncomfortable to the point of not letting me work. Other than my crazy predicament, it was a nice first job when you are a teen."
good,Wendy can be a life changing job. You work on a quick past but they don’t make you work in one area you choices. It’s very good to learn different things they pay good but I just don’t like how everybody can be paid different people that did less work then me or barely even cake to work was getting paid not then I was the managers pick and choose how much they want you to get paid that wasn’t fair to me
good,"I learnt how to start closing do post rush postions run the fryers, clean the fryers, work at the grill make sandwhichs, cashier and dishes and how to be quick and yet efficient with most task once I learned them"
good,"A typical work day consisted of fast paced, energy draining, and non stop going work day. The hardset part of the day would have to be not sitting down or getting a break on a long 9 hour shift. What I've learned is to have a great work ethic no matter what the job was. The most enjoyable part of a day was ending a shift knowing that i did the best I could possibly do."
good,This is a job for a high school student. If your lucky you'll get a team that you'll be cool with and get through the work day faster. Good luck to you.
good,"Checking all the store stocks back-up sales and inventory."
good,If you are looking for a full time job with 40 or more hours you best be looking else where. At wendys they only offer 28 hours per week. But the staff are all friendly and managers are willing to work with the employees.
good,"I would be one of the first few people to come in and the last to leave. The pace wasn't as hectic as the company said it would be. It would be a conflict of if they wanted speed or accuracy. Management was fair at times but they didn't know when or who to promote. The culture would be insane at some times but when it counted the most we could work together. The hardest part was trying to keep everyone on the same page. You could know how to effectively run the shift smooth but once someone gets upset, it could affect the whole store and we couldn't regroup. The most enjoyable part, I would say was the experience. Even though it was a crazy place to work. It would also be great days when nothing when wrong and some of the managers would work with you."
good,"Good place to work at, loved serving people and making sure they had their meal in an orderly time, loved the managers and got along with them pretty good, always made sure to tale care of employees"
good,"Wendy's is a fast paced work environment, variety of jobs that you can move up or down in to. The works very on the store as with management. Pay isn't the best for this company."
good,Management is great all around. Employees are mostly fun to work will. But when it’s busy it’s very stressful if you can’t work fast and keep up with everything.
good,This place is ok to work if you  are young besides that this place  sucks and I would not recommend anyone to work there  the pay is not good and they work  you
good,"Mon travail consiste à nettoyer les salles de bain, de voir à ce que les tablettes près de la caisse soient garnies en conséquence des commandes. Nettoyer comptoir de service et salle à manger (tables, chaises pour bébé, portes vitrées...) et ensuite faire la caisse."
good,"I was their best grill closer, so I got full days and worked often. Walking in I was always greeted with a smile and always went straight to work. Hardest part of the job was dealing with other employees who didn't do their job very well so i was often handling multiple positions at once, which requires doubling times you wash your hands and adds up to more waste from switching out gloves so often. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day when it was just me and my closing crew, we always had fun and got all the work finish at a reasonable time."
good,It was a fast paced friendly environment where I met lots of people daily and served them. There was a bit of a turnover in the few months I worked there.
good,The managers and crew are always cheerful and quick to assist were needed. Easily recognize quality and care in what they do. Smiling and friendly no matter how rushed they are.
good,My time at Wendy's was fun for me. I got pregnant and had the baby and I didn't go back stay home to raise my first born but if I had that same crew again I will go back!
good,"Lots of out if work drama. Better than the previous job though."
good,"Ser crew en wendys fué un trabajo entretenido, pero mal pagado."
good,"I actually liked working for Wendy's, if my pay was up to par I wouldn't have quit , it was a good judge free job, my management team was incredible and I enjoyed working there for the most part"
good,"work was ethic some days, I learned alot of manager work. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers you can never get through to them once the mistake being made....other than that the job was fun depends on the coworkers you work with"
good,"typically we get out into our position, keep everything stocked and organized. when its busy during a rush things usually go smoothly unless someone is new or not good at their position. time goes by fast. management is typically nice"
good,"Whenever I let management know the days I am open during breaks, they made sure to give me as many hours as I desired. They cared about my well-being and made sure I was always doing well."
good,"Working at Wendy's was alright, the management was okay, turnover rate was pretty high so there was a lack of people working during the day and we borrowed a lot of people when we were short-handed during the night. There wasn't very much opportunity for advancement, but that's my problem."
good,i enjoyed working with the Wendy's corp. i learned a lot working for this company i now have food service experience as well as cashiering experience. i wish management could have been more understanding of my school needs. the hardest part of the job was getting time off to take care of personal matters. the part i like the most was the team work.
good,it is your basic fast food restaurant atmosphere. hard work with minimum pay but as far as shift flexibility and the fact that theres no employement history needed it is a perfect first job or for someone who is in school as I was when I worked there
good,"A typical day would involve (if the morning shift) prepping the veggies and fruits for salads,  preparing certain meets and doing a once over of the entire kitchen.  Then preparing sandwiches until lunch or manning the grill"
good,Wendys is great for people in high school or college looking for part time work. Your experience there is based on you. They promote from within so there is plenty room to grow if you plan on being there for a while
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's, but you have to be fast-paced. When you get busy you have to make sure you are prepared. I learned to be able to have patience with the customers."
good,"I've been with the company since 2005 on and off. I've always loved the company, but driving 45 minutes each way became to much for me and was cutting into my family time."
good,"simple shifts ramping up at lunch rush, cooling off for recovery in time for the dinner rush"
good,This job has plenty of opportunities but its just that there is somewhat of a cut throat environment to be around because if they see u making advancement quicker than they are the will be somewhat of kind of jealous. I would rather push a person to do better though instead of knocking them down.
good,"Its a nice place to work at to make money, and everyone is like family. Can be stressful and the workload can be a lot. managers are understanding. the hardest part of the job is when youre actually a good worker, u end up doing everyone elses job."
good,It was a good place to work at when I was younger. It was laid back. Just have to find people who want to work or need a job. I worked at a older Wendy's the building was probably over 29years old so it needs a rebuild bad!
good,Wendy's will be a place to get started and work through high school and college. It is a fast paced job only because it is fast food. I do not regret working at Wendy's.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's because of the customers and great management. They were very helpful training me on the grill and moving me to different stations so I could be skilled in every way possible !
good,"Working at Wendy's wasn't half bad the people were great the management was great nobody had any problems with anyone. Relaxed pace every now and again, everyone came together in crunch time."
good,It's not a 5 star place to work at but it's not as bad as most people say it is. It is a fast food place so yes you will be under pressure when rush hour comes. The people I met usually made it worth it. Friendly people always making situation worth being there.
good,They needed better managers and to recognize the employees that work the hardest. Overall the company is a great company with great food. Also I've worked in other restaurants the definitely deep clean and are very  sanatary.
good,"The job is stressful at times, when employees tend to call out from work and you have to do your job, plus that of the people who didn't show up to work. Even though the store is very busy at times, the customers are very nice and enjoyable to talk to. I would prefer my off days to be consecutive, but they are always split, which leaves me very little time to accomplish personal things at home. Other than that, the company isn't bad to work for. I will say that you must have a lot of energy and a can do attitude if you want to succeed there."
good,always had fun with everyone you work with we would always play when we can.  Will always keep you moving and always be ready to do more than one thing at a time.
good,"It was relaxed there good people to work with, no drama. Very good an dedicated managers. They hire friendly and working people. I got along great w about 2of the 4 managers we had."
good,"As cashier it is your job to take care of the dining room to make it look nice and tidy, and take orders from the customers and giving them a good experience."
good,"Overall, a typical day at work would be long hours and I learned the operations of managing a restuarant.  The hardest part of this job was having to work hours when crew staff would not come to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was achieving recording breaking sales."
good,"Stock Control."
good,"a fast paced job where team work is required by employees , as a member I learned how to perform multiple tasks to make sure the customer was satisfied with their meals"
good,Wendy's hours are flexible depending if your going to school or something else and for me I think Wendy's is a good way start as your first job before applying to anywhere else.
good,Al ser un local fast food no dejaban de exigir cosas que nadie podía cumplir por problemas internos o falta de utensilios o mercadería.
good,I worked at a Wendy's on a military base. It was always busy. Most of the customers were nice but we would always get a few who weren't. The managers were good to me and worked with me and my schedule. I found I do not like working in fast food but would do it if it were necessary.
good,"The work is fun, get good work ethics, very fast work environment, learned to use some different things. Schedule not as flexible as it could be for some people."
good,Fast food place.  You need to count on your staff to perform to the best of their ability in order to make the system work. Always felt like there was never enough help or time to accomplish goals.  However training was excellent.  .
good,You really have to be able to be on your feet a lot with a short break throughout the day. Good for kids just getting out of high school or a great first job.
good,.its a good place to work but its startingbto go down hill its needs better mangement and rhe gm is a joke he dosent take things they way he should take them but other then that its a good place to work
good,Work environment was decent. The service was commendable. The learning experience was fast past but easy to understand. The hardest part was remembering the menu.
good,You gotta find your ways around the easy way because if not it's hard. Morning shift and night shift would be the best shifts I worked you get a chill feel
good,"Work was stressful. often times had to deal with rude cutters and management often sided with customers. However, the job was not hard and the people were great. It lead to long lasting friendships."
good,"Good discounts, geat management! Easy to learn. Great for a first job. Good amount of hours! "
good,The hardest part of the job was when you were done doing or work and wanted to punch out and go home but you couldn't cause you had to help someone else
good,As a teenager I enjoyed working for Wendys for two years but I feel like it's time for me to gain more experience somewhere else and to extend my opportunities better.
good,"Good place to work, employees get 50% discount and managers get 100% discount on meals, but you have to eat at the workplace you cant take the food home with discount."
good,We all looked at each other as family. I would have been more prone to stay had the advancement opportunities been more available. I got tired of waiting for it to happen after close to 9 years.
good,"Started off pretty slow far as hours, but over time  I began receiving more. Not a bad place to work at all. Some days too many workers were booked, other days not enough, but I have nothing bad to say I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"It like meeting new people like learning different skills with working for fast food ,it could be great place to work. I learn a lot different things work at Wendy's. How never know when some watch your great work how see things help you move up faster in a company."
good,"Usually had fun while working there met alot of really good people and learned alot of new things, the shifts ran a little long working 10 hours per shift"
good,Fast paced place to work for minimum pay. Not a place to work to support a family but was a great place to work while I was young and figuring out life
good,The job is a good one and the people I work with are fun and know how to get along. Most of management will help and are there for us as for others are not and it can be difficult at times.
good,typical day at work was having customers in and out in a timely matter. I learned customer service since this was my first job. hardest part of the job was keeping up. most enjoyable was management and employees
good,"I really enjoyed working there, but they normally do not hire felons. Also being on time is very necessary for this job. You have to be able to talk with cutomers with ease, and work on your feet all day."
good,Wendy is not a bad place to work you get great benefits you meet different kind of people all the time the pay is not good enough you do lots of  work..
good,"Wendy's is a fun, nice place, but is a closed fast paced environment and can cause a lot of stress. A lot of people don't like working there and try looking for new jobs in the meantime."
good,It's fast food so you can expect to work with people who didn't come to work to work. You as a team member can and may have to work at any station they need with or without training in that area.
good,"In my senior year of high school, the school itself, have a job coaching program that takes you to a job site for half of the school day. The second site I went to is Wendy's. I did cleaning and more while I was at the site."
good,"Good first job, a lot of drama and management was okay. I wouldn't go back to fast food though, but great if you need customer service skills and want to gain experience I guess"
good,Learned a lot. Flipped patties. Talked to guests. Wiped tables. Good managers. Fun co-workers. Good environment. Nice people. Learned how to work under pressure without flipping out.
good,"All I can say about this job is that the Manager that I had at the time was very rude, and it made it difficult for all the employees to work, but I managed."
good,When I worked here it was a summer job for the work I was doing I was not getting paid enough and they were not really sure what station I was supposed to work so they worked me everywhere
good,stable job management is good people hired aren't always the best can be lazy and not motivated job and company are good its just people hired to work there regular crew members aren't always the best.
good,My typical day at work was usually walking in and I usually was on drive thru collecting money but as it slowed down I would help in every part of the store. There was nothing hard about my job because I knew how to do everything. My favorite part was getting the lunch rush out the way.
good,"Work fast pace, treat employees right , fun place to work , food is great co workers was dependable, listen to my concerns,  was always understanding,"
good,Friendly goal oriented staff. Managers were attentive to customers and helpful to employees. Staff got the goals completed for the late nights. All worked together as a team.
good,For a maintenance worker it could be hard especially if you have so much to do in so little time. Since i was the only Maintenance man i was getting a lot of overtime. The pay could be a bit more since i was doing the same if not more than the managers there.
good,Better than other fast food experiences I have incurred. I only left due to full time work at new job I currently work. We had had fun while working and had a relaxed atmosphere but we got the job done.
good,My first two years was stressful but as the job changed so did the employees. It became overwhelming when all employees wasn't doing their job while expecting others to put up thier slack.
good,Wendy's is a quick paced environment. Working here was enjoyable and the fellow employees were fun to be around. It was like a large group of friends working together towards a common goal.
good,"This job is a high school job where you can learn valuable skills such as, multitasking, punctuality, customer service, and management with currency. This job always had me thinking on my toes. I would take drive thru orders while making drinks and bagging food and occasionally help making burgers all at the same time. Management was really understanding with my work schedule  when I attended school and had after school activities."
good,"It was my first summer in USA. Great experience. Team work, a lot of fun, management. I learn how to make hamburgers, fries, practice my English. Clean table."
good,"All of the work is standard for a clothing retail store, however the hours were less than acceptable. Employees were great, as was pay. I only got 18 hours a week before I resigned for that reason, and only saw my hours begin to shrink."
good,It was a fast paced job.  It kept me busy and I got many hours.  The customers were nice and knew me and always ask how I was doing.  Their food is great.
good,"Managers are great, flexible, and understanding. Duties are typical for the line of work, with efficiency being a top priority. Most people who come in are polite and low maintenance, and the worst frequent thing is just scrubbing grease off of things. Not too bad, which is why I still come back to work during college breaks."
good,It was fun working here. This location has a 4 star rating for my overall working experience here. I worked here for about 2-3 months and had to stop working here because I went back to school
good,"This was a great summer job for me. Worked with people at my level, easy work. I learned to make and serve all orders, use the grill properly, open and close the store and how to handle customers. Great base"
good,"i had a good experince at wendy's for the first couple years. but after awhile it wasn't up to par and i needed something new, the building itself needs to be maintainted. i was no longer able to stay there anylonger, i didnt have to much complaints about the staff, but just the supervisors, gotta work more as a team then individuals, if they responded and care more of there workers things would of been ok, the salary isnt s good as i wanted but hours were ok and flexible enough. i couldnt personally see myself going back to wendy's but i did enjoy the most of what i had to offer there and hopefully from what i have learned in the store i will be able to bring to my next job if not hope to learn more"
good,freindly fast the food is greast ok pay rate an good hours you clean stock help customer an be on time on at work make sure the guest is happy an the food is fresh
good,"Wendy's may not be made for just anyone to work at, but it is a job & it will get things paid. The only problem I had with working there is making only minimum wage & also not getting many hours."
good,The mangers show favoritism. They are rude. Barely give hours to new employees. Their attitudes are very rude. The mangers also give food away. This is only at the wendys on Washington rd in Augusta Ga.
good,great place to work at if you are getting your foot in the door with jobs.its a stepping stone for those are looking for a quick fast pace job to stay on there feet.
good,Wendy's is a great place to work. I genuinely enjoyed the people I worked with. Management is well picked and does a decent job in ensuring the employees have everything they need to do their job well.
good,"Wendys can be a great place to work I've worked there for about 3 1/2 years and it has good days and bad days. Recently I have gotten my hours cut and the only reason they gave me was because I'm sarcastic. I find it very childish that this particular person who does schedule has alote of favoritism.i am a hard worker who comes in when asked stays late and does more then my own job, am I sarcastic yes but not to costumers or anyone in particular."
good,"Decent place to work except for the long hours and late nights. Fast paced, staffing problems in some areas makes the position very challenging.  But if was easy they wouldn't call it work."
good,"I have been employed at Wendys for 2.5 years, and until recently have had no complaints. "
good,wendy's is a pacing job you will have to pace yourself to work at a fast food restaurant. also you have to learn how to communicate if u want to work at wendy's
good,"Fast work pace, you learne dhow to multi-task, management is pretty understanding and willing to work with you as long as your a hard worker.the team members help you to be great"
good,"Works great around your day to day life, but unfair pay. I made the same as another girl, I've worked there 2-2 1/2 years longer than her, faster than her and know more than she did. Every one, such as the night shift manager, bagger and sand which maker agreed I should have been making more."
good,A lot of work for so little pay and benefics. That is my experiencie during two years working for the Company. And for some reasons I want another job.However I ended up working at Wendys because I came from Miami to live in Jacksonville.
good,"Work was easy, hours were flexible, anyone could work there, which sometimes was a bad thing, because you would get people in there that were awful at their jobs."
good,Working at Wendy's was also a great experience for myself why because working at Wendy's was my first time working in a fast food company. Working with them was fun having things to do Everytime I got the chance to work a register for the very first time which was a very great experience. I've learned a lot working with Wendy's having to experience everything the worker did for the very first time working at Wendy's was my very first job I've had so therefore I enjoyed working with Wendy's.
good,"This job has good hours but sometimes the managers or the employees are not very friendly. Some are and some aren't. Although it's not about making friends, not that you can't have friends, but sometimes work comes first and then you can socialise afterwards."
good,"My job consisted of working within a restaurant with the employees. It requires managing the employees performance to attain budgets and rolling with any changes that occur. I gained a lot of experience in managing employees, managing budgets, and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is staffing a restaurant, and the most enjoyable part is getting to know the people you work for and with."
good,I learned a lot about the fast food industry as a whole. You have to be cohesive as possible with other employees to get through the day.  Which at times we had trouble with. Management was very unorganized however they were great people that helped as much as they could.
good,what you do will change everyday since there are so many things that need to be done. I did learn to have to balance school and work and how to stand up for myself while being respectful. the people I worked with were amazing but management needed work.
good,It was a true learning experience. It taught me a lot of different things and helped me to develop a lot of different skills. it also taught me about true leadership and building yourself up when you work for a company.
good,when i worked at wendys  it was a decent place to work but not for a long term job it was okay but i had to find something that paid better and the mangers were not very understanding about the fact at that time i was working 2 other jobs just to make it by to pay my rent and my other bills i ended up quitting because of managers that did not listen to what i was trying to tell them .
good,"I enjoyed working here while I was in high school.  I developed customer service skills, management skills and working as a team.  I discovered that hard work and being responsible allowed me to advance to a shift manager."
good,A typical day at work was good it keeps you on your toes because you never know how busy you'll get during the rush times. Also the days typically went by fast and everything was quick paced while it was busy. The management at Wendy's was good. They always helped me out if I needed it and finding coverage wasn't really an issue.The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the less mature people who worked there. The most enjoyable was seeing some of the regular elderly people who came in around the same time every day or a couple times a week.
good,"I enjoyed my time working with this company, the only complaint I had was that I did not receive my raises until I asked and was told I didn't achieve TT g eee position if crew leader because I wasn't loud enough."
good,"A typical day for me was I worked at the night shift so I started during the dinner rush. It was intense but because everyone has work there for a while, we didn't stumble on a lot of problems. After the rush it was mostly prep for the next day, cleaning and taking care of orders during the night until we closed at 1 am. The biggest problem in the work was the management and some workers where divide because of where they came from. So there was a lot of drama which one reason why I left. But even this problem I still learned a lot and I am grateful for time i spent there. What I learn is communication and preparation is key for success. The most physical challenge in this job was to stay up and work hard around 1-2 am. But after some nights working I was able to overcome this part."
good,"Wendys was my first over the table job, it was very simple, a run down of the equipment and clock in, great for young folks still in school, great part time job, I enjoyed it but felt more could be asked of me than wendys required. I joined the military now I am looking for a new team to invest and advance in!"
good,It's a good place to work but you will want to get paid more. Managers do their job good but needs more people to speed up the service. Sometimes we get free food when it's not very busy and the staff is very fun to work with.
good,"My normal day at work would include meeting new customers and greeting our daily customers. My most common responsibilities were Front cashier position and Front Sandwich-maker. Must be fast-paced or you will be left scrambled, and keep an orderly and organized work station. Customer service is the most important part of any job, especially when dealing with food, so keep a smile and make sure your customers and guests feel at home."
good,Very face paced work place. Came in as opening manager and would get the store up and open for lunch. Would normally run a position during lunch. Once lunch is over would do management aspect.
good,"Wendy's was my first job ever it started off as the best job ever,but like all jobs there's likes and dislikes. Overall the company is great and even better for newbies."
good,I learned that you can not depend on management as much. You basically teach yourself and no one does training. I learned that people will take advantage of you.
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I was very nice and very respectful to all of the customers. I learned how to work drive thru and to be a cashier.All of my managers were okay.
good,The Wendy's culture is an admirable notion but it is rarely followed. The company is cheap and underpays its valuable employees. Although there is room for advancement the company has tendency to take advantage of those that advance.
good,"While working at Wendys i got to experience multiple job titles within the store. I had to start out on fries and prove I was willing to learn to move up. I then went to sandwiches, then front cashier, and then to drive-thru. On the drive-thru window the cash register did not tell you how much change to give back so i really got to practice my simple math skills. This employer offers room for growth which you usually do not see in many fast food restaurants. The management was very kind and willing to work with you to help get the job done. I really enjoyed the communication aspect of my job and showing improvement to receive pins and other rewards. I can not think of any reason this job was difficult."
good,"When you begin working there they train you with the easiest job in there to see how you do. Then they move you to other positions to see where your strong area is and also to learn the other positions just in case someone calls out and they have an easy replacement. They have friendly managers and co-workers who are great with teamwork which they are also about. The hardest part of the job is when you get a rush of people and everything starts moving in a fast pace and people may get confused sometimes frustrated, but the managers move in and make everything moves smoothly. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy."
good,"I learned much about management. Different type of skills."
good,"Clean,  friendly and productive. They are very good at working as a team and keeping communication with each other to ensure complete customer satisfaction."
good,Must have patience to handle customers and orders. Gets extremely busy and kind of hectic must be polite and positive attitude
good,Fast paced environment. Company gives a fair budget for GM's to work for and a solid bonus program for those GM's that can manage their budgets effectively.
good,I closed at wendy's so when i got there then i did my job as a cashier. At 8:00pm I would begin to close down the dinning room. I cleaned and assisted with the drive through. After I locked the doors I would re-clean and make sure everything was perfect. Then help other areas until it was time for me to leave.
good,"motivating and fun and an overall good work atmosphere,I have learned patients,the hardest part of the job is to get a crew that will actually work and not worry about their cell phone."
good,The food was great very little customer complaints it was a great working and learning environment just didn't get many hours wasn't always busy
good,I've been in fast food over 4 years I work hard and I'm a  team player I have work from McDonald in high school to Wendy  form the grill to make hamburger ....
good,"This is a very fast pace work place you have to be able to keep up and make sure that you can do multiple things at once EX: fries and chicken nuggets with fryers. The workplace is frequently cleaned and polished the break room is 3 feet by 5 feet  it's really small so if you're clotrphbiobic I would avoid it unless it's to but your stuff on a hook. All in all its a good work place the pay is $8.25 an hour I would try to get on the day shift or if your a night owl the the night shift is for you, the pay is the same and the night shift starts at 5 in the afternoon and ends at 2 in the morning. So if you like the sound of this job then go for it."
good,"My time at Wendy's was great while it lasted but due to an incident involving my personal life, I had to resign and attend to the issue. I still go to the same Wendy's to this very day."
good,the job was very great it was just the employee's with the rude and disrespectful comments. and the way i was told to do things were very not true and off subject
good,This was my first job and I quickly advanced in my abilities as a worker. There was always something to get done and time always went by very fast because I was never not working on a task. The managers were always willing to work with me in my schedule and were very nice
good,"Job wasn't overly horrible. They gave you straight stable shifts if that was what you desired, they didn't have an issue with long holidays or shift changes. However the General Manager and owner are very rude to any person they cross paths with."
good,"it was ok, poor customer service. a typical day at work was stressful. Managers yelled at us all the time. People got sent home for no reason, no patience."
good,my typical day from the second i got there i was already running back and forth. this location was always super busy from 5 p.m to 10 p.m.. the shift supervisors are all so kind. i learned how to take orders make sandwich boost my confidence and assure better customer service.
good,"Great job security, but a lack of advancement at the particular location I worked at. Employee discounts and when sales were excelling GM would give rewards."
good,"Decent job but honestly not worth the stress. Crew is usually all over the place,  management never communicated with each other. Raises are close to impossible"
good,"Was honestly a great experience for me. I learned a lot on the job and made new friends. Gained culinary experience, and cashier experience."
good,"Working for Wendy's was okay, in my opinion. I mainly did most of the work because I closed every night for the cook position. The cook does most of the work at the end of the night. I didn't get much help."
good,"In my opinion, managers are not very understanding when it comes to serious at-home issues, due to the fact it disrupts your how many hours you work. I have had a couple emergencies and they still took away my hours. I had court ordered community service and they weren't very understanding about that either."
good,"One was expected to complete fully with every aspect of their position throughout their scheduled time, we always had to have a friendly and happy smile offering great costumer service. As front cashier I was expected to greet every costumer loud and friendly with appropriate greeting."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy but a well ran shift. I've learned how to properly cook bacon, and chili. The management is very lenient and nice. Our co-workers are very upbeat and courteous. The hardest part of the job is deck scrubbing the floors every night and scrubbing the bacon racks. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers."
good,"I had a lot of fun working here as the coworkers, managers, and guests all made it enjoyable to work there everyday. Open or close it never got boring or tiresome."
good,"The only part that I did not enjoy was that this was fast food. My managers were excellent and took great care of their workers that deserved recognition. I only wish all managers preceding my Wendys experience were as amazing and caring as them, they never made false promises."
good,"Overall Wendy's was the best job I have ever had. My co-workers were really nice along with my Boss. "
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's because you learn about policy and procedures of safety guide lines for food .I was able to build excellent customer service skills.
good,it doesnt feel like home the employees all want to leave and its not a family oriented environment. you want to run home after your shift is over and youll want to stay in bed knowing you have to go back to a place like wendys to ree up on acne
good,I am a great person to work with. I am a fast learner and willing to learn new things. I learned most of the postions at wendys fast. I have only been there a few weeks. So far it is my first tine working as fast food and its not as bad as i thought it would be i actually like and enjoy working at wendys
good,"Looking to work full time, with good hours and pay as well.this job has neither.i have only been there for a month but overall it is what it is a fast food restaurant."
good,long days and understaffed shifts but all in all a nice place to work. Minimum wage and no benefits at that time. Management was fairly good but there needs to be more room for advancement.
good,nice fun I like this job I learned how to work the cashier and drive window.evrebody was nice no hard part.i made empoylamet of the month and got a
good,"Not bad for a high school job. But, most managers are rude and you don't get much positive attitudes. Pay is horrible. Coworkers are a positive. Next to no opportunities to advance in pay."
good,I would open the store up at 7am and get everything prepared throughout the store. It would take us up to 3 hours to finish everything.
good,"Most people were there were good to work with, overall it was alright except for the commute from Victor to Missoula. If I were to work there again it be only if I had too.Management varied greatly, Disliked the varied work techniques greatly."
good,Wendy's was a productive job because I learned that hardest at a fast food restaurant is doing drive thru. And what i learned at Wendy's is that you have to move fast to get the job done.
good,Schedule inventory. Food vendor orders open store Customer service cleaning telephone calls interviews background checks meetings help others refunds cash control
good,"Wendy's is fun if you like a fast pace environment, but you must always keep your cool and realize that it is a family restaurant. always be mindful of the customers request and fulfill it to the best of your ability"
good,"A typical day at work would be, assisting and satisfying customers and inputting orders. Also along with keeping all areas clean and constantly standing up and moving."
good,"Didn't enjoy it much. Very stressful few fun workers at the time. A lot of sneaky workers, not my enjoyment ever. Alright hours per week for current high school students."
good,A good first job. But in my case 2nd job. Really busy never get bored. Tons of stuff to be doing. Its a great company and work place. Everyone is friendly towards eachother.
good,I like to work withthe customers and cleaning the lobby gm was store was rude mean and unprofessional to crewmembers the break was short
good,It's all good. Had a few bad apples that was running off the good ones. You have to pay for your lunch. You change stations everyday. The don't give you enough time to catch on to the Burger process.
good,"I would come in and greet my coworkers, then sign in. Then work would begin and I would deal with my customers. The best part of my day is the first 10 minutes when I loved my job the most."
good,"At first i thought i was going to fail to meet the Wendy's requirements, but as a day or two past by a get my head in the game and do my job. co-workers are very helpful supportive. Wendy's is a good work environment to be in because you can be yourself put the smile on that makes you feel like yourself. the hardest part of the job was when i have to close and customers keep coming and coming. My Most Enjoyable part of the job is being around positive individual."
good,"Working at Wendy's taught me the importance of team work, self stability and quality in work. Co workers are friendly but sometimes need a helping hand, so I did my job and also others at times. My favorite part of the job would be the night shift. I got to show how enduring and capable i am to work 12 hour shifts and my supervisors liked having me close the store. Management for the most part was very flexible and understanding although i didn't receive the longer hours i asked for they worked around my schooling."
good,Well the co workers  were cool but my manager was not nice and she treated me like I was nothing  instead of her telling me your messing up she put me somewhere where my job title isn't
good,"I am a very hard working person, and I really enjoyed working there, I learned a lot, and also made me become a team manager. I  am willing to try new things,"
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Miller Place Wendy's."
good,"It was an alright job.  I showed up, work the night shifts on weekends and was paid fairly for my work.  Not the best job, but not the worst."
good,My co-workers were great always kept a positive attitude. Our managers were very nice and patient while I learned the job. I enjoyed meeting all kinds of people.
good,"Come in and clock in with your finger print."
good,nice and flexible place to work especially for college students or a younger person looking for a good place to start working after school or on the weekends.
good,"Wendy's helped me understand the ins and outs of having a job."
good,Wendy's in general is a good place to work at 4 you know someone that needs the money the one that I work sat started me at $8 an hour and I live in Idaho where the minimum wage requirement is $7.25 so that's really good especially for a fast food joint only thing that I found unfortunate was in order to get any breaks you had to have A9 hour shift the people there were awesome coworkers are great my boss was fantastic they gave me lots of support there and they were great people
good,Can't really complain about wendys other than that there are not many advancement opportunities. I love my coworkers and the hours are exactly what I'm asking for!
good,"The job is very fast pace.  a Friendly environment. Good employees."
good,"I start off throwing out the trash, then I wash my hands and put on gloves to make hamburgers. Then I wash the dishes and close the store at night."
good,The work environment if very fun and family oriented. All of the employees get along as they should. Management is good. I learned a lot in the years that I've worked there. Built close bonds with almost everyone and some I even consider family. Most of the customers are very nice and make the day go by much easier.
good,"hot and smelly from the fryer and grill"
good,"I appreciate the fact that Wendy's is willing to work with my availability. Unfortunately, our location struggles to find long term and reliable employees. As a M-F opener, I always see the closers' negligence. I feel that I am a valuable employee and as a member of the crew that actually does their job, neither them or I are compensated fairly for what we are expected to do."
good,"I had a few issues with management  because im trans gendered , other than that  it was ok.  Wendy's could have had better hours and better pay."
good,The work environment of Wendy's is good and workmates are so nice. In this job i have learn a lot about teamwork.
good,"a great place to begin your work experience. you learn how to manage duties  such as cleaning, cooking,  customer service. co-workers are very friendly and helpful"
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of cleaning. I learned how to make specific food items and how to count my drawer at the end of the day. I also learned how to work better with other people.
good,Wendy's is a good place to work at but not always the best place to carry out with a carrier. but over all it is a great working environment and its a great work place for team work.
good,"Wendy's was a great job when I was just starting to work at the age of 16. I loved working with all of my co-workers and enjoyed making my customers satisfied with the service they received. As time went on with no raises, or benefits, I had to make the choice to find something that could offer me more."
good,"Some days were great and went by fast and without a hitch. Other days seemed to drag on and things would constantly break. I noticed these things would only happen when certain managers were on duty. "
good,"Everyday at the restaurant would be quick and fast. The customers would walk in on a regular basis, handling the dining room and drive thru would get challenging but achievable with a hard working team. The management was on point with delivering quality service and reducing production cost. The co-workers were helpful and believed in team work."
good,"Friendly managers who cater to your needs"
good,I enjoy working here as the people do care about the quality and service of the food and satisfaction of the customer. The management has given us plenty of opportunity and training if we wish to move up.
good,"Very flexible with hours, often accommodated my needs as a student athlete. Though there was a general lack of authority, I learned how to push myself to achieve a high quality in my work."
good,"Overall, I loved all my coworkers. My GM was nice but mean as well. The environment was awesome. The customers were great. There are however some things that were bad about the place. For example, The workers don't always stay on task."
good,I like working there mainly because of the awesome crew and a few of the managers are really good. Sometimes the only thing is the scheduling and that's really my only con with working here is sometimes you get a manager who won't listen to your requests and put you on the schedule and you end up having to call off.
good,"Wendy's was my first job.  It was a great place to start.  I started off working the grill and then in time learned all the positions.  The management helped me along the way with everything.  A normal day was starting wok at 7:00-8:00am to help open the store and prepare everything for the day, providing great costumer service if I was assigned the cash register or providing great product if I was assigned to work the grill or sandwich line."
good,My overall experience at Wendy's was great until I got transferred to my final location. The general manager was fairly new at it and she was very deceitful.
good,A typical day for being a griller at Wendy's is to grill meat for burgers. I learned the Wendy's way to grill and clean. The coworkers were okay and pretty friendly. There was no problem working here just the fact that I only made $7.25. The most enjoyable part was getting to know how to work everything properly.
good,A typical day of work was pretty easy going with the regular rush. Due to my friendly co-workers the rush was no problem and non-stressful. The hardest part of the job was when setting out orders on the trays and trying to remember what sandwich was what. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smiles of the customers when satisfied with their orders.
good,"just didn't get enough hours, great co-workers, great training, most enjoyable part is bonding with customers, great managers that makes sure job is done correctly."
good,"It was a good place to relearn the work force, the hardest part was the lunch rush at Wendy's. My co workers there were kind and nice. the most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be a day of success, communication, multi tasking and helping my other crew members occasionally some training, I have learned how to be a better person by my time at this job and learning the importance of being great at giving customers the best experience they can receive. The management for the most part is pretty good and easy to get along with except for a few that are less than productive. my co workers are a great group of people to work with. The hardest part of my job is the multi tasking but it just makes me strive harder for success."
good,"Management was great, co-workers were very friendly. Fast pace, good hours, great food, great customers, typical skills cleaning the grills was the hardest. Enjoyed interacting with people."
good,My boss and co-workers were the best. I loved how when we got real busy our GM would jump in and help us. He didn't care that he had a higher rank then us. To him it was all about customer satisfaction! and I loved that about him and it made so much fun to work there.
good,Majority of my day would be spend standing at the counter waiting for a customer. There is a specific individual that deals with the commercial accounts so I couldn't really help there. Straighten up some shelves. Organize a planogram. When a customer does come in you may have to fight for them. You have sales goals you have to meet.
good,"Busy workplace, Learned how to operate a grill, time management, co-workers were friendly and helpful, working fast, enjoyed making customers happy"
good,I worked at wendys for two years and was happy until our current management came in. I was promised a promotion but never saw any plan put into action until I had already put in my two week notice.
good,was a good work place good cleanliness and some good people not to fast paced because its a smaller town but was still steady most of the time.
good,"-typical day of work is to serve every customer accurately while showing friendliness."
good,this job was a learning experience that helped me to learn how to deal with customers at a business level. I met a lot of great people and great customers too
good,hard to get a break when its busy. had learned alot of customer service skills. management was okay for what the store is. hard part was lunch time of course. fun part is the food its good.
good,"A typical day at work would mostly be taking and prepping orders. "
good,"My job at Wendy's was simply to help get me through college. The hours were flexible for my schedule, which was extremely helpful for me during the college semesters. A large part of the schedule flexibility was thanks to the managers who were very gracious and worked with my less than ideal needs. I found that this job was hardest during extremes: if the restaurant was extremely busy it could become difficult to keep up and if the restaurant was slow it could become boring quickly. I found that the most enjoyable part of the job was when my team worked almost flawlessly during rush periods."
good,"This was a great, fast paced company with great employees and managers. I learned a lot at this job that has helped me with others."
good,"great fast pace environment to work for, their are lots of friendly team member that help out each other who are in need. customers are always friendly"
good,great work place with supportive management. I most enjoyed the part of the job that involved socializing with customers also working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"I worked there from the age of 17 to 20. I worked quite a few hours and I think it helped me in my customer service skills . I got experience in handling the pressure of a ""lunch rush"", and learned how to take the good with the bad. It was a lot of manual labor and I stayed on my feel almost 100% of the time."
good,"it was a good restaurant it was just the managers . didn't like how they worked with other people in myself  . i like the fact that we always stayed busy . everybody worked together as a team , nobody was ever on they own. i loved that we make our costumers happy every time they would come in. if they was upset when they came in i know one thing when they left they left with a smile on they face.."
good,"Wendy's was  laid back job. The Manager work around my schedule. They gave more hours a when need it . A good community  where the place is located ,"
good,Fast pace working environment. Critical thinking skills were required and great customer service skills. Wendy's was very busy mainly on weekends but was great because it prepared me to work right and quickly.
good,"fun, energetic place to work at with great co workers. know the register very well and try to show others shortcuts if i can. try to help out in other  areas when possible or when its slow. try and get all of my other stocking and cleaning done before night crew shows up."
good,"It was a fun place to work, the co-workers and managers are awesome. It's kept clean and well organized. It is a great learning experience in many areas like communication and fast pace working."
good,"I enjoy what I do at Wendy's. I have been allowed a unique opportunity to learn new things such as effective time management, organization and team building techniques. Being a cashier I work with money daily, this allows me to sharpen my cash handling skills. Assisting with the restaurant's day to day operations allows me to see first hand how effectiveness and efficiency of essential core strengths are the keys to running any successful business."
good,"and building cleaners keep many types of buildings clean, orderly, and in good condition. Janitors and building cleaners typically do the following: Gather and empty trash and trash bins. Clean building floors by sweeping, mopping, or vacuuming them."
good,"I always work in morning shift because i take care of my baby after duty. I've learned about how to make sandwiches , salads and to do the back up for all the condiments that we used. How to take order , how to deal with the customer, etc,. The management always motivate , support us and make us to develop . All my co-workers are easy to be with and their friendly as well. If you have a problem they give you advice as a friend. The hardest part of the job when there's a misunderstanding between co-workers while working because it can affect all the operations. The most enjoyable part of the job when all the people around you always happy, enjoying their job even though were tired and sometimes were teasing each other to having fun."
good,when everyone works together it is great but when only one person is doing all the work that is a different story the manager has a lot to deal with each day and I admire him
good,Everyday was the same thing being on the line and getting food to the customers. A lot of focus is required like 110%. the ability to multitask is a must.
good,"Energetic and fun . always a pleasure when working with management and co-workers no matter how intense the day may be."
good,"It was a long time ago, but it was a fun place to work. I liked the fast pace of the food industry. Management was supportive of my devolopment, but there just wasn't enough hours to go around so I had to leave."
good,"prep, cleaning, dishes, work drive-thru.  The GM was awesome.  Most of the coworkers were awesome.  hardest part of the job staying focused when in down time. The most real enjoyable part of the job PAYDAY!"
good,i have been doing the same thing for the past 2 years and i'm done with wendy's the pay i get is not worth the time i'm spending there.
good,"Its a very exciting place to be, with promotional opportunities. The most enjoyable part about my job is proving excellency through the wendys company and making sure our guest feel right at home. The hardest part is when we run out of things and the guest becomes upset."
good,Its the right type of job for anyone but if you want to move up and find a career and make a little more money I don't think this job would fit you.
good,"everyday is about the same, just learning every position you can to help out if needed. the co-workers were awesome and the management was great. they were funny and made things fun but also knew when to tighten the reigns when needed."
good,"This is a fast food restaurant. You punch in orders, prep food, collect money and clean restaurant in your assigned area."
good,"It was good until new management came in.Then everything for me went down hill.Sometimes it was very slow, the time went fast when we were busy."
good,"Wendys is a good first job but im looking for something more to what im will major in. wendys have taught me many things , like handle money and serving customer but i need something that i willing to wanna come to work everyday."
good,"it is a good job that i do enjoy but mostly love the fun enviroment that me and my fellow crew members have created, its the perfect job for someone first getting into the work force"
good,good job for starting out. minimum wage job. flexible schedule. can be really hot in the summer and really cold in the winter. sometimes you get stuck working other peoples shifts. the worst part is it seems the better employees get stuck doing everything because they don't wanna train the worse employees on how to do their job
good,"Working at Wendy's, it was a good first job. Being a crew member taught me how to handle cash payments and card transactions. I interacted with customers and it gave me public experience as well as customer service experience. The management was on point with training and made sure all employees were working under corporate rules."
good,"Productive days, everyone is nice and helping of each other. Our management team does a very fine job of keeping everything under control. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the with orders as they rapidly come in, but most of the time it's not that difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work knowing that everyone is working for the same goal and will be respectful of you each day."
good,"Keeps you on your feet however, overall good place to work people are friendly and don't mind assisting where assistance is needed."
good,"Overall a good job, the franchise just need to try to treat their middle management with a little more respect and courtesy."
good,"good environment to work in, utilize multitasking skills. I have a great repertoire with the regular customers. it is fast paced and requires attention to detail."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  They became friends and almost family.  I learned how to move at a faster pace. A typical day at work involved a lot of cleaning and a lot of water.  Mopping the floors and doing the dishes and cleaning the oven and Henny Penny, it seemed I was always drenched from head to toe.  The worst part of the job was one manager was very OCD and not understanding at all.  Off the job she was a wonderful person but nobody could stand her on the job and several employees walked off the job after she pushed them too far.  Also, once you are hired in if your life takes you in a direction that you need to change shifts it is very hard to impossible to change shifts."
good,The Wendys fast food restaurants provided a great environment to build hard working skills as well customer service skills. The staff were always happy and pleasant to be around as well as helpful. The management really motivated the staff to do work the best they can and was a great example of how i want to see myself as an employee.
good,The job is fairly easy and the employees are wonderful when you all get along and put aside the stressers. Managers and employees usually get their work done in a reasonable time and make it a great place to work at.
good,The Wendy's Co. allows room for quick growth and small evaluation based raises. This company also has a wonderful management team!
good,Good customer service is a great thing to have.  I'm also working with a great team and learning how to relate to others personalities and cultures.
good,"fast paced job. You really have to be able to multitask. Object of a day at work is , work hard , keep your station cleaned and organized, stocked, and rush ready.  Make sure your able to communicate. be able to speak to customers and able to help and assist them. Also make sure you smile and are always friendly."
good,"Every Morning at 10 am we arrived to an empty restaurant and greeted the staff on duty with a ""Good Morning"". As an employee of Wendys' Canada it gave me confidence, work ethic and most importantly satisfaction that when my shift was over the customers for that day were pleased with our service. We had a manager with us every shift who gave us the energy and motivation to do our work promptly but efficiently. She was our leader. We all were a team who worked together to provide the customer with there orders. We all had our own job for that day; (examples: cashier, line cooks, restaurant cleanup. ). The hardest part of the job was making sure that if a customer asks ""no pickles in my cheeseburger"" we wanted to be 100% he/she got ""no pickles"". So at Wendys communication was an integral part of our shift. At the end of the day if the customer is happy with there quality of food and service. Then we did our job."
good,I enjoyed working with the crew I had to supervise. we got the job done no matter how big the task an everyone enjoyed working together an helping each other
good,"A typical day would be, for me to go to my position and start on what is needing to be done. What I learned is, to work hard and do your job a 110%. The management at Wendy's are good and know what they are doing. My co-workers were nice and always pleasant to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was the general manager, was rude and made unprofessional comments about the employees. The most enjoyable part was that I made some really good friends and strong relationships with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking care of the patient out of his or her home, I would come and stay at the patients home for the day. I made breakfast, lunch, and dinner, did dishes and cleaning throughout the house. I bathed the patient, changed bedding and laundry. I learned how to administer medications and change catheters bags. The hardest part of the job would be to move the patient around by myself when they could not help you.I enjoyed getting to know the patient and just spend free time with them watching their favorite shows or going through their old pictures and stories."
good,"- I worked in drive through."
good,"A day at Wendy's was pretty good, I mostly did closing. The shift managers I closed with ended up being some of my really good friends. We got along just great. The best part of the job was seeing my friends/co-workers that I didn't get to see very often. The hardest part was working around my schedule, and dealing with some really bad customers. Management was good for the most part the GM at the time didn't take in account any co-workers complaints or concerns. I learned how to deal with disgruntled customers and basic food service requirements."
good,"This job was great while I was saving for college. The manager was great about scheduling me around my school schedule. Though closes were awful, those were the best times because you truly get to bond with your coworkers."
good,"I have learned many things while working at Wendy's, answering phone calls, setting up drawers, counting drops, calculating reports, managing the store and good customer service."
good,"This was my first job and I was very nervous about starting. After I began and was able to get used to the routines of working in the fast food atmosphere, this job became easy yet fun for me. I enjoyed working in this facility. The management worked with the employees, rather than, in the office and there was advancement."
good,"My typical day at work would be about me meeting customers with different personalities and being able to put a smile on they're face as they leave. "
good,"I love my job of helping others, i havent learned much considering all i have done is cash register. The management is okay i guess. Co-workers are amazing we are all like a family. The hardest part of the job? well i don't think anything is hard. The most enjoyable part is making sure others have everything needed and seeing that they are satisfied. I love to help others."
good,"I worked here when i was in high school so it wasn't too serious of a job. I really can't complain, i made a little side money while sometimes enjoying myself at work."
good,Great Place to get started to learn skills needed for customer service
good,"The company had three shift, and i had worked all of them. mostly they would schedule me to work third shift which is 4pm to 12am. There was never a slow day no matter if it Thanksgiving or Christmas eve. I also did a lot of over time, because my manager thought i was one of the most reliable work that will help even on my day off. The job wasn't easy neither was it hard. Working there you really had to have a lot of patients because the customers will come and not know what they want, or will order something and then change their minds and re-order. i can say that I had a very nice and friendly General Manager. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers, they made the time go by fast and it was a lot of fun working there."
good,I enjoyed Wendy's the time I worked there. I was always energetic and ready to welcome customers. The only reason why I give three stars is because I would of like to make more money and have more hours. Overall Wendy's is a great place to work for.
good,"horrible training"
good,"I've learned a lot from working as a crew member in Wendy's fast food restaurant. Many people however, think that working at any fast food restaurant is an easy task. It is very easy. That is if you have enough people employed at the same time and they all do their job. A typical day at work for me would consist of poor communication. Although there may be plenty of workers present on a daily basis it makes it very difficult for me to get my job done if I have to constantly take charge of the group and tell them to do their job. I am a drive-thru operator. My job is to take orders and prepare the beverages for our guests. Sadly, many times I am caught in the middle of doing other peoples job. This would include coordinating, and preparing my own fry station orders. Such as French fries, chicken nuggets and crispy chicken for the sandwich station. Don't get me wrong I enjoy my job and I always get it done the right way but when you're constantly having to correct your co-works and do their job for them it can get very irritating. I expect my co-workers to know what they are doing and get it done on time and neatly. My most enjoyable parts of work are seeing the smiles on our guests faces and getting to work along side the managers. I enjoy working along side the managers because I am exposed to how difficult or how easy running a fast food restaurant may be. I definitely enjoy seeing my guests smile. I feel accomplished and it gives me motivation for getting my job done."
good,"A day at Wendy's was never perdictable, you would never know what to expect coming to work,but I learned alot of things working at Wendy's,how to deal with different attitudes with the customers and co-workers,multi task,and working in and as team My co-workers were the most out going,easiest people to work with. They made my job alot easier.The hardest part of my job was the start of it all, being new to the work place, and learning everything in a matter of time."
good,"Good fun environment, teaches you to be organized and neat, you learn a lot of skills you can use in the real world."
good,"1.  Getting ready for the rushes with have "
good,"I worked the lunch shift as a cashier or sandwich maker. The lunch hours were pretty busy, so it was fast paced. I helped stock store when business was not so fast. I enjoyed the employees."
good,"Typical day at work being organized, going over budgets, have meetings with my managers "
good,when I clock in I would check the positioning chart to see where the employees I have on my shift would be. get the registers in. and start the day.
good,"Working at Wendy's was perfect for a first time job. It taught me communication skills, time management and how to balance work and personal life."
good,work was ok. like fast pace .got along with co-workers ..management was fine.just got hecktice ..at time at lunch rush.just went though the ordeal of the day!!
good,"Prepping food, training new people. Learn loss prevention, accounting, training, operations, inventory, and ordering supplies."
good,"nice group of people to work for, just not enough pay to help with the bills"
good,I loved working at Wendy's until managers start leaving and the new ones came. Things started to change in a bad way.
good,A Great Experience . amazing co workers . flexible hours. i enjoyed my year and a half there at wendys . only reason i left was due to school.
good,"I've been working with this company for 3 years now and I've come across a few managers who didn't make it fun, but currently I have an awesome General manager and her team of managers. All the crew members were nice and welcoming, it did not take long for me to get used to working, and so far I've made some good friends to which I love working and hang out from time to time."
good,"Cooking and preparing food, work on the cash register, taking orders, drive through work and dishwashing"
good,"A typical day was filled with placing orders and doing my best to assure customer satisfaction.  Had great interactions with both customers and coworkers.  I learned a lot of use full job skills including customer service, proper procedures, and food preparation.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with rushes. The most enjoyable part was being around good friends and meeting new people each day."
good,"I loved working at wendy's. They just couldnt provide me with enough hours, a promotion , or a pay raise. Other than that i have no complaints."
good,"I would cook burgers"
good,A typical day at work was taking orders at front and coordinate the drive thru. I learned how to multi task taking orders and money at the same time.  My co-workers were at lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was satisfying the customer. The part I loved the most was meeting different customers after each order.
good,"A great job for teenager"
good,"not very clean, fast pased while handing food blu buj byfdusgvc bc  hdsua bdsua byswAVH X"
good,It was a pretty easy job. The coworkers were all very nice and the management was very nice. You always had something to do so you were never just sitting there. It can be a lot of work for a very little pay.
good,"I was asked to become a manager, but I didn't want the responsibility. This particular Wendy's is franchised own and I didn't want to be a pawn to their corrupt company. Sorry. I loved the people I worked with and the customers I served everyday. My regular day would consist of working upfront at the registers. I would take customers orders and most of the time I would hand the orders out. I would also stock products we needed. Sometimes, I would work in the morning and prep salads and clean my area before I was allowed a break. Making some 50 salads, making bacon and cleaning up my mess and others' messes would take me longer than I was allowed and often times I would be late going to break and not clocking back in before we open for business."
good,"A typical day at work was a great day at work, make coffee, meet new people, clean up, and most important of all is make sure that the customers are happy. I've learned that not everyone is always happy and not everything will run smoothly but if you keep a smile and a positive attitude you'll be alright. Being a team leader was a little challenging which was fun having to change drawers really fast and making sure your team is in position and everything is stocked but it was all well in the long run. The hardest part of my job is when someone calls off and finding someone last minute and things are backed up. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be getting together with my team taking care of business but also having a little fun also making other people happy."
good,It is a clean store but could use better owners that were not so cheap.
good,Started at the bottom and worked my way up to a manager and wish I had never left. It was a great learning tool in how to work in a fast pace environment
good,This is a good part time job. Seem like they dont give anyone there full 40 hrs. But helped me out when I was in high school with that lil extra pocket money.
good,the people were nice and cared about there employees bosses looked out for you
good,"I learned how to deliver food fresh and neat. Also, I learned how to work under pressure when work is busy. My co-workers are very helpful and friendly. We work together as a team. The enjoyable part about working at Wendy is that the customers enjoy the food we deliver."
good,Wendy's was a fun high school job for me to get to interact with many different people.
good,"lots of prep"
good,"you're working at a fast pace ,helping others,learning new things,getting to know others,and getting paid every two weeks"
good,The people are good people and the expectations of the people is not too much to ask for. Overall a good place to work.
good,I mainly worked as a grill cook at this restaurant I did not work there to long I was offered a job at outback steakhouse. While I worked at this store I was the grill cook and did some minor cleaning.
good,"At first, having a job for the first time, and interacting with co-workers and customers is great and very fun. After two years of employment, you have skills other employees may not have. Many of the managers let slack fall on you so they do not think they have to help or contribute to the team. Many co-workers choose not to get along with everybody and decide to express this in front of employees. Wendy's is a great place to begin and develop your first set of skills."
good,"My time there was spent with one good manager, whom made working there fun and even thought we would have to put in serious work it was worth every minute of it."
good,it was fun working for wendy's i've learn a lot such as team work be on time and the co-workers are so friendly
good,You are to expect a lot of different customers on a day to day work schedule. I've learned that the customers are the most important thing about the company. The manager that I worked for was a hard worker and expected a lot of effort from you as well. The people I worked with most of the time were positive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part was the communications that you learn with talking to co workers.
good,It was a good place to work the turn over rate eas high but when u work with young teens that to be expected i stated out as a sandwichmaker worked my way though all the jobs and ended up at a shift manager
good,typically work stayed busy for the whole shift. i enjoyed my fellow co workers we all worked well with each other and the management created a positive responsible comfortable work environment.
good,"When I first started working for Wendy's, I started out as a cashier. When I wasn't waiting on customers, cleaning the dining room, or cleaning the restrooms, I was busy learning things from other employees. After about a year of learning, I was promoted to Shift Manager. The General Manager of the restaurant, my boss, was a very nice guy. When he left the restaurant to pursue his own passions of owning his own company, a new General Manager took his place. However, me and the new General Manager didn't seem to see eye to eye on anything. This was the ultimate reason why I decided to quit working at Wendy's."
good,"A typical day started early. Co-workers and staff were mainly young and needed alot of training and supervision. "
good,"a typical day involved first doing a layout of where each employee would be located, check the daily check book, check sales and labor, get everyone pumped and rush ready, stay productive, if slow start detail cleaning, and the end of the night do target and service times, hardest part of the job was if you had to work short handed or had a few employees who were not as fast at multi tasking. I learned a lot, seeing as i had to learn it a whole different way after leaving burger king. employees were awesome, they did well at getting their job done and correct. most enjoyable was serving customers and watching them leave happy."
good,"I deal with the public on a daily basis, which is fine because I am a people person.  I get along well with my higher ups and the ones that I supervise by being a shift leader.  I run a great shift.  The hardest part of my job would be when I am short handed and I have to do my part of the job and the person job that is absent."
good,"Ive learned how to work under pressure."
good,"Training was given from the start and advancement was available.  Great environment interacting with the customers. Hardest part was the hours, too many late nights."
good,I did like this job a lot but didn't like how I worked so hard for little pay.
good,Working at Wendy's I have experienced a lot of skills and being able to work around different people. I have learned how to let others help and not try to do everything on my own and to know its ok to ask for help sometimes when I need it. My Co-workers their are some I enjoy working with on a daily basis and their are others I could do without but I still don't let that get in the way of my work.
good,"When I worked here the management was poor and unorganized. Other than that I loved the people I worked with. This was my first job I ever had, and so it was stressful from time to time, but it allowed me to grow and learn customer service. I was promoted to Assistant Manager, and appointed to night shift. The only reason I left was because of conflicting schedules between work and school."
good,"Working at Wendy's was not so bad. You meet so many new people each day. You learn quite a bit in the fast food business. I learned so many skills in regards to giving great customer service. You learn to work as a team and how to manage many areas of the store. The hardest part of the job would have to be working Drive thru and literally multi-tasking while taking someone else's order at the same time, you pretty much are doing a million things at once, it's almost impossible to get orders right. That will explain why so many times people end up with missing items or with the wrong order. The great thing you'll experience while working at Wendy's is the meeting new people, learning about new product and mixing up existing product to create you own ultimate meal. The possibilities are endless! Management can be great and helpful, it also depends on who is part of management."
good,"I get there about 10:30am. I would stock drive-thru with napkins, straws, utensils, etc. I would take customers orders, prepare drinks, make fries, etc. "
good,"A typical work day is coming in to prepare products and produce for the entire day. Serving the customers from 10:30am to Midnight. i learned how to work in a team environment and gain skills that can be useful in the world or even the next job. Coming in to a friendly work environment makes the day seem a lot easier and smoother. Whether they are new employees or current being around co-workers, even if the day is long is fun, makes the day go by even faster. The managers on the job whether they are there all day of just for one shift makes sure that their crew is always ready, makes the customer happy and well satisfied and makes sure that each crew member has a nice filled successful day. The hardest part of the job is when a crew member and/or manager doesn't come in for work, or they are slacking on the job, but we always find a way through to have an achieving day."
good,I learned many things while working at wendys. I learned multiple different positions and procedures. On how what to do and what not to do when closing a store. The managment and crew were all varieties of friendly. BUt the best part was the selection of customers. You have two kinds of customers. The ones who make your day and the ones you make their day. We had both.
good,"They've been good about keeping a spot open for me in the summer, which was a lifesaver during my time in college."
good,"Everyday was busy and hardworking. Learned how to cook beef patties, sanitize and make sandwiches. Managers were alright. The co-workers were cool. the hardest part was working the lunch rush hour crowd. The boat cruises were good."
good,Job sucked because of the hours given and most hours was given to the female workers and its about 10 to 15 min break most likely the only break that day you would get
good,"Wendys was a good job to have, if you do your job correct you can advance quickly."
good,"The only thing I didn't like about working at Wendy's was the pay, other than that I also loved working there as well."
good,"Come in and do store preparation, make salads, baked potatoes and set up the front line. Cook burgers and french fries and serve them to customers. Management was pretty good, and worked with everyone to make shifts work. Coworkers were alright, but usually younger. The hardest part of the job was the communication breakdown between the customers, the ordertaker and the cooks. If one person misheard or misread an order, that's an upset customer. There really weren't many enjoyable parts, other than banter between coworkers during downtimes."
good,"The staff was fun and pleasant. The work was fast paced and content. A typical day was clocking in checking the assignment sheet and starting the shift. I learned what hospitatlity was really like in a fast food environment. The hardest part of the job was closing down for the evening. The most enjoyable part was laughing, interacting with co workers and customers."
good,"a day at wendys was fast paced, ive learned great customer service the management was good they did what they had to do to get the job done, my coworkers were friendly an fun to be around the was no hard part the whole job was enjoyable"
good,Wendy's have a great team of managers with there company. There all about team work in productivity. They are willing to get down and dirty with the rest of the crew members.
good,"Everyone has to be a team player or work will get behind. It's hard work but you learn to be organized, clean and responsible."
good,"Good place to work if you like your days to go by fast.  I learned how to handle customer's issues and help them have a better experience at Wendy's.  Co-workers were all great, very helpful and fun to work with.  Hardest part of the job was nothing at all.  Most enjoyable? It's inside the University of Texas campus :)"
good,At Wendy's the managers are so unskilled. They would not check the off-hours for the employees.
good,"Inputting ingredients and other relevant information online for easy access to other chains and interested customers.Prepare, cook, and grill various meats to desired specifications to ensure consistency of product.Cleaning the equipment, floor, and all areas of the kitchen to maintain a safe and sanitary workspace encouraging and promoting cleanliness."
good,I served customers and made sure that their needs were satisfied. I kept the workplace safe and clean. Co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. The job itself wasn't hard at all so I got rather bored during the day especially when it was quiet. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting the free drink you could make yourself during the day.
good,"I helped customers, cash handling, helped train new employees, and maintained a fun and clean work environment."
good,"I like to work at Wendy's because I always have something to do. I never get bored are tired of my work. Its a fun place to be at. I have different age groups that I work with. There really isn't nothing hard about my job. I've learned how to work together, reasonability, group effort and more."
good,"My work experiance at Wendy's centered around customer service, food prep, and cleaning up."
good,My supervisor giving me every 3 hour shift to work and sometime if I have schedule they will tell me I don't need to work it's just wasting my time and my money to get on the bus to get to work every time I have schedule
good,The hardest part was they never had a set management they wud come from all over northwest ohio
good,Lets see Pick N Save was a pretty good job. The people there I worked with were nice and the customers were friendly to on there good days! I learned alot of people shop there and come there alot in a wees time and that everyone needs to eat. The hardest part of my job there was working part time I had bills to pay and they wasnt giving me full time. The most enjoyable part of my job there was talking to the people that came thur my lines you'll be suprised at wat people have to talk about. 
good,the company on the whole is a good company. they do pay well . the management is very supportive .
good,"Very Demanding customers who will try to break your spirit. I've learned to pace myself when It comes to meeting the demand of a customer. Remember, they're only there for a couple of minutes ,while you're there for hours at a time; you have to remain calm.  Everyone works in a team and the more support you give the more support you will receive in return, the day goes by much smoother when you help a co-worker in need. The hardest part of the job is sometimes being short-staffed; you end up having to do the job of 3 people at once. The most enjoyable part of the day is closing ,knowing that you've done the best to your ability and have satisfied all of your customers."
good,Working at Wendy's was fun mainly because I got along with pretty much all the team members. I mainly worked on the weekends and Monday nights because I attend school during the week and on those days I would get to experience a lot of different customers. One of the hardest parts of the job was trying to maintain cleanliness in the store when we were so busy. One of my favorite parts of the job is that I would get free lunches because I always did above and beyond my job requirements such as transporting products to different stores and also being the only team member clocked in other than the general manager when labor was high.
good,"A typical day at work: is keeping the place clean while there is no rush hour."
good,I mostly had good days at work because I love greeting customer and making them feel welcome in our establishment. The management wasn't the best but I cant complain about that because no work is perfect but overall it was a good experience. 
good,"My co-workers were a tight knit group that had been working together for a long period of time. They were not very welcoming to new employees and were likely to put any tasks that they did not want to do or like. Management was very understanding, except the assistant management. She was very immature for her position, she had favorite employees that could get away with anything while hard on everyone else."
good,"graveyard, general housekeeping, good management,"
good,"Typical day was controlled chaos, always busy even when there was no customers. "
good,I think this place should have security cameras. The management wasn't firm enough. But I did like working there because I made a lot of friends and the customers were nice. 
good,"Full work days."
good,"Wendy's gave me a lot of opportunities. As long as you are willing to work hard and improve, your possibility of advancement is limitless. But they expect a lot of work for little pay, and I had a problem with the district manager lying to me to try and get ""the truth"" when if she had just asked me straight I would have no problem telling her. I don't appreciate being lied to, and that really ruined my relationship with wendys."
good,"Placing customers orders, making sandwiches, which I loved to do, I was real good with handling the cash register  "
good,"I love working at wendys, customers are hard to work with anywhere you go, but over all its a great place to be and it isn't dreadful"
good,Work at Wendy's was never a dull moment I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and the manager was pretty cool.
good,Well I wouldn't really consider working at that certain Wendy's. One day a worker pulled out a head of lettuce and there was a dead frog on it. What our manager did was take the frog off and just cut that section off that the frog was on and told us to serve it anyways.
good,"Working at wendy's as a manager can be good or bad, it depends on which store your working for, they're all suppose to run the same but of course they don't. I was transfered from a store i had been at for almost 2 yrs that was awesome! the managment team worked great together, communication was excellent! and we were always on the same page. we ran our crew the same and that made less stress because the crew knew what we all expected from them, instead of one manager letting crew do things one way and another manager telling them they can't do it that way. we had a much happier crew and less call in's and almost all of our crew would stay late if we needed em to or come in early or on their days off! even though running a fast food restaraunt can be frustrating we always made it threw the day and we had eachother to vent to if we needed to. If there was an issue we worked on the solution together like a managment team should."
good,"Days are different I prefer days that are busy"
good,"I worked as a cashier who also occasionally did sandwiches. I also cleaned whether it was in dining room or back of the store. I learned how to do things right and how to learn things fast. I liked my managers and coworkers but there was occasional drama, as do all workplaces. The hardest part was the hours but I enjoyed getting to learn all the positions."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was: get to the store on time to open, make sure all employees will be in that day. Make sure all prep. is ready before the doors open.Secure deposits from previous day and verify. Well I am Management, upper level management was fine, no complaints. Co-workers was great. Hardest part of job was, the retention of lower level management. Best part of working with Wendy's, the training of regular employees who work their way up to management positions."
good,"It was okay, I worked their while in high school.It was min wage, but it wa s okay for school."
good,"great place to work very enjoyable.. great managers not to serious... team work! typicall day include cleaning,stocking,taking orders, making food, bagging food.. hardest part is unhappy customers..."
good,"I worked the night shifts from 4pm to 12am. A day at work started with changing drawers, making sure everything was stocked for the dinner rush, making sure dishes were caught up until the evening, ensuring the lobby was clean and maintained. The coworkers were the best I have ever worked with, including the management. It was a very relaxed environment with little internal stress. The hardest part of the job was the customer service aspect, dealing with complaints etc.. The best part of the job was being part of a team that worked hard together no matter how busy it got."
good,"When i first started Wendy's International i was ecstatic, i had fun learning the register, and learning how to take orders and bag food etc. i have been at Wendy's for almost a year now, i was told i was the best youngest worker to learn the register and bagging and drive thru as fast as i did. i wouldn't say i was better then other workers. my co-workers were nice people, sum i knew some i got along with very well. my managers were cool. my favorite manager was the general manager who hired me, he was super funny and cool. i hardest part about my job is closing the drive thru with only a few workers because then when it got busy we all would rush to get the food ready make sure its under two minutes. most enjoyable part of my job is the pay checks. it was always exciting because when i would work 25-30 hours a week my checks were nearly 300 dollars. and with me being the only person working between me and my girlfriend plus a baby, those 300 dollars really help, now i don't work as much as i used to, i don't get as many hours as i used to, my checks aren't as big as they used to be. and with a toddler kid , money is the biggest thing. but i do appreciate Wendy's for accepting me into there workplace giving me a chance to prove myself as a good worker and be apart of there team. i couldn't thank them enouh."
good,"I like the work environment however the pay was not good, wendys is a decent company"
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendys. We were always competing with other stores to meet requirements, this made he day go by fast."
good,I like wendys and being a crew chief but I feel stuck its not enough money to maintain myself.
good,"a typical day at work would be very busy there certain times. ive learned how to work well under pressure. Management is very strict, must do what you are told or what should be done. Hardest part of the job would be drive-threw because its very busy. Most enjoyable part of this job would be working with other emplyees."
good,Wendy's was a pretty good place to work. I learned how to cope with all sorts of people. The management was good. Co-workers were ok.
good,"Wendys is a good place to work, but I wish they were more for the employees getting rewarded for their hard work. The employees and managers that I work with are good people to work with. The hardest part of my job is when there arent enough people to work a shift and then I would have to pick up the slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiles and thank yous I get from my customers when they get good service from me."
good,I always had good day at work
good,a typical work day would start with cleaning stocking and then as soon the costumers come its costumers first.
good,"Hot, Fast, and lots of moving around"
good,"I really liked this job, but at the time I had just gained custody of my kids and I needed help watching them. A typical day at work was great, we had friendly people there. I learned how to work in a crowded area together with other employers. The management was great they worked with us all. The hardest part was going home, I like to work and serve people. The most enjoyable part was that it was a fast food restaurant which means food, I could eat on break..."
good,i like to work fast paced jobs the crew and my managers are the best at what they do we try to promote a family feeling enviornment the hardest part of the job is finding something challenging the most enjoyable part of the job is training new employees
good,I was a cashier and a sandwhich maker. I learned how to multi-task on things. The managers were fun but also didnt play around with you. The co-workers were okay no one never let something get in the way of everybody doing their part. The most hardest part was rush hour i use to hate when so many people came in all at one time. I really enjoyed the times when it got close to closing everybody had fun!
good,A very busy day Monday thru Friday but Saturday thru Sunday not so busy. I haved learned a lot of things from this company.The management there was excellent.Co-wokers were very helpful. Hardest part of the job was to take orders at the drive thru window and collect the payment.Most enjoyable part of the job was just having fun.
good,"I enjoyed it because of the people I was able to work with. I did learn how to be a better ""people person"""
good,Longstanding company with great reputation in the community.
good,"As a team player, the most enjoyable part of the job was moving to the money. Meaning, offering assistance when and where needed."
good,"Results oriented management level food and beverage/food service professional with extensive experience in leadership, human resource management and employee/union negotiation.

good,I loved wendys but the people there didn't help much and was very disrespectful.
good,"A typical day at work was great for me. I learned alot while I have been working there. I learned how to work register's, I also learned how to be a sandwhich maker. I learned how to work the backroom dishwasher and also maintain dishes the way they were suppose to be. I basically worked in every position at this job except the management position. The management at this job was fair. My co- workers were great. The hardest part of this job was when it was time for inspection. It was the best part to me because I like cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customer's with an positive attitude. I really enjoyed this job but managment should have been more professional."
good,I learned how to manage employees. Management was alright. Co-workers were always easy to get along with and fun to work with. The hardest part typically was dealing with customer complaints or customers that were upset.
good,I really enjoyed going to work at Wendy's. I took a lot of pride in the fact that we prepared everything daily. The management was great too. They were all very easy to work with and made me feel extremely comfortable when it comes to having something to discuss with them. I liked every aspect of this job.
good,"After being there for a while and working night shift, I was expected to be their slave. I worked sandwiches, fryer, grill and order coordinater. and sometimes i did all f this and worked cash register. fun, fun.... NOT!"
good,I really enjoyed my time at wendys and learned alot of patience working there. I learned alot about good customer service and how to react to unexpected situations. My managers were amazing and the crew members complimented the managers. The toughest part of the job at the time was the shift I worked. After my shift was over I would often make it home at 4:30 am. Aside from the time that I worked I would reccomend many people to work here.
good,"Have to be prepared to serve customers at all times. Learned a lot about suggestive selling, and how the customer is put first before anything. Have to be a teamplayer and communicate with the crew members."
good,"A typical day Wendy's was fast paced, with lots of teamwork and positive communication. I was responsible for making sandwiches, making orders, collecting money, and provide the best customer always."
good,"worked the grill filled orders on demand i learned to listen in two different directions i would work both the dinning room and window orders from one grill great managers still friends with them now most of the people i worked with then still in contact with today we all went to school together grat people, saticfying the customer people sometimes just are not happy. the Happy customer is the most enjoyable part of working there"
good,"I would assists with general tasks such as getting food prepared, counting registers, getting grill ready. I learned a lot about the fast food industry and management in a fast paced environment. My co-workers were mixed in age differences but gelled very well. The hardest part of the job actually at first was closing by my self until I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I played a part in being the #2 store in the district."
good,"A typical day at Wendys is constent set up for the next rush. With a good team, the work is hard, fast, but fun. What I have learned is the crew is the back bone of the entire operation. As a manager you must be firm, but fair, be able to utilize problem solving skills in a moments notice. Treat your employee with respect. Lead by example and respect will be returned. You have to remember when morale is low, so is productivity. In management at Wendys requires fifty hours a week, co-workers then become like a second family. Hardest part of the job was fifty plus hours a week, with a family its hard. I love customer service, little things you do for someone could make their whole day. Kindness is contiguous, that the motto of a good customer service rep."
good,This was my first job. It set me on the path toward a career in the restaurant field. I left because upper management did not want to promote me any further.
good,It was a decent working experience. Very fast paced. I learned a lot on how to deal with various kinds of people. It is hard to work with some customers and high drama stances with co-workers. It is enjoyable when serving very nice people and they apreciate what you are doing.
good,I was responsible for taking orders from customers and maintaining the dining area
good,while working here i have learned that they are going to be people who wont reason with you and the best thing to do is accept being wrong.I am the main order taker in drive Thur. the most fun about my job now is that i get to see and work with many of my friends that i went to school with .
good,"I cooked burgers, bagged orders, drop fries, put potatoes in the oven, and helped cleaned."
good,"great plac e to work, fun energetic employees. only downfall i see with them is they dont offer benefits, bt i worked there when it first opened back up they might offer them now"
good,this is a good place to use as a starter job. not somewhere i would be for permanent employment
good,"Could need a little more improvement but it's a pretty fun place to work for, specially if you are in school."
good,"Overall there wasn’t much to complain about, management is competent and fair, coworkers are fun to work with and easy going. A comfortable work experience overall."
good,I had lots of fun learning new things every day at work. I had good friends and I felt like working with my family. I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,Its a simple job if you're looking for easy money they won't start you off more than 9$ but its easy and its not as disgusting as some fast food I've worked at its chill.
good,Wendy's CAN be a fun place to work key word CAN. It really depends on the crew you have. I've had shifts where I thoroughly love my job and others where I want to be anywhere else Wendy's is a very on and off Job so if you can handle that then by asll means go for it
good,"I gained valuable interpersonal skills and had a good relationship with my coworkers and managers, but I am looking for opportunities to grow further."
good,"It's a fun, learning experience. Gives you good customer service skills. They teach how to maintain good restaurant health. How to open and close a fast food restaurant. How to work the drive thru and take orders"
good,"The company has great policies and for the most part they adhere to them, but when they’re are things they really slack on when it comes to the freshness of the food, keeping it to sell instead of getting rid of it and making fresh. They’ll reset timers instead doing the right thing."
good,It’s a good place to work and they have really good management on the morning side. Unfortunately the night side management isn’t as good. It’s very poorly put together.
good,"It was a pretty nice first job, i learnt a lot of useful tips and tricks, the staff was amazing. We all worked together as a team, never any drama. Wendys felt like a home ."
good,"It was a very fun job and i got along with everyone. the cleaning and the organizing can be hard and confusing at time but once you get the hang of it, it becomes natural"
good,"It was a good crew, half of the managers were not management material though. Some people did slack, so we ended up putting people that actually worked together on a shift. But we suggested new people needed hire and some managers needed to go."
good,It is a good full time job especially if you get promoted  to a shift supervisor till some age . It was helpful for me coz that helped in PR application. And also your job stays secured for as long as you want to work . And you can also continue it part time after getting a full time field job.
good,"Overall an ok experience the coworkers had my back and made me feel welcomed and worth working with, the managers played favorites when it came to hours and scheduling one of the key reasons why I left the job"
good,I love my job. We encourage and acknowledge our people. It makes me feel good to be a boss at work knowing I'm really bossy in my every day life. I would love to take on other challenging tasks.
good,"Wendy's is fairly decent place. You will not feel like you are getting paid enough for your time. The managers can be cool. The working is mostly business, but through it all you can enjoy it."
good,"Did not give raise in 6 years, numbers do not lie.  No bonuses and health insurance was very expensive.   Upper management was inexperienced and did not help stores in need of training."
good,"Pay was decent and the staff was friendly, easy to learn and plenty of training I recommend working here and only left for personal reasons nothing to do with the company"
good,My review about this was ok when I made a year at this job but when I kept on working there and everytime I got paid my check was always low and I worked everyday this job was also fun and it was a good team working job but the reason why I quite my job is because they wasn't paying me the right amount of money.Anf I learned it's alway communication when working as a team.
good,Working here requires multi tasking and attentiveness. Being alert at all times is a required trait and being able to handle stressful situations like fast paced work and customer. Work was okey but they did't pay well on my branch.
good,"Once they got me trained on things, I was able to perform my job well and I loved the opportunity it gave me to meet people on campus and work with people I got along with well."
good,Even when the day was difficult most of the people I worked with dealt with it and made sure we were all doing good at work. Never a dull moment in customer service though.
good,It was an okay first job. I kept my self busy cleaning the trays and cleaning the bathrooms. I was bored easily while doing my job. Fellow employees were pretty nice to me since I’m autistic except for one employee.
good,Sucky job sorry need better management.  Need more employment and better employees..  Need better customer service...  Work pace better have the building very clean..
good,"It was good you always had to be fast paced but hey its job should always be fone right and fast and it was family, and employee friendly and it was a good clean environment"
good,The hardest part of the job would probably be when customers are yelling at you right as you about to clock in. The best thing to do in that situation is to breathe and solve the problem .
good,"I love working for Wendy's, I recommend young adults to apply. Gravitate to the business and  treat others, how you'd want to be treated. My only mistake as a Wendy's employee is that I treated some staff like friends. When in reality it's all business."
good,"Working there build my knowledge to do things more, improving the language, communication skills and preparing food. I love meeting new people and working with them."
good,Working at  Wendy's provided me job experience and skills I needed.  It help improved my personal skills and confidence. The job was rewarding and gave me an opportunity to learn.
good,"Service was very good, always on top of getting food out to people while it is still warm. Very tidy and clean, bathrooms were clean and not gross. overall the food was very good and the place always stayed clean."
good,Its not a bad place to work people nust need to learn to follow directions and listen to management and do what they ate asked to do. Alot of favoritism there as well.
good,"Wendys taught me a lot for my first job, it may have not been ideal but it helped me become the hard worker I am and obtain my Customer Service manners"
good,Good place to work but need to train people who have no experience better. Management is ok depending on what store you work at. They need to do a better job of find replacements for people who call in.
good,Learned to have patience in working with a company like this. Field is a revolving door and looking for a retirement career. Family like workplace is important to me.
good,I work on Saturday and Sunday as a Crew Worker/ Cashier I work from 10 am to 6 pm. Each weekend there's something new I learn about my work areas such as the grill and the fryer. I really enjoy working with my Crew Members/
good,"Once you're on the clock it was a very fast-paced environment."
good,I learn how to deal with customers and I learn . I learn how to work with group or how coordinate a team. The whole members are very friendly or cooperative.The hardest part of my job is when people discriminate with us or do not understand our feelings.
good,"The Wendy's I worked at had a General Manager that was newer to the store. She was friendly to only a select few employees then was passive aggressive to the rest. She was all excited to have me on board and started me on full time hours. A few weeks into starting I got an illness. I had to call off a few days and brought in a doctors note. After that, my full time hours became 15-28 hours a week. The assistant manager and shift leader bragged about me and loved working with me but she ignored that and continued to cut my hours. Working with the General Manager was MISERABLE. Not only because how passive aggressive she was but she was also a ticking time bomb! Just the slightest incline in business would stress her out to the max and she would be running around the store yelling at staff and trying to do everyone's job for them at once. When I was first starting to get ill, I had to go home for throwing up and I was screamed at by the GM. On my second to last day, the Wendy's inspector came to our store. When the GM found out that the inspector was at her store for the inspection that morning, she started balling and frantically calling all of her managers. This job was not stressful other than when working with her. The assistant manager is amazing. She is strict on procedures and food safety. She communicates very well with her staff, especially during rush. Overall, she is the best manager at the store. The shift supervisor works with her partner and does all of his work for him and allows him to slack. She messes around most of the shift and tries to push most of the work"
good,The Wendy’s I worked at was pretty decent when compared to the stereotypical fast food restaurant. I rarely had to work more than the scheduled hours and I was asked if I could instead told I had too on the rare occasions I did.
good,It was very fun and I enjoyed my coworkers. At times it became stressful and difficult but I still managed to get through it. I worked my best everyday.
good,"Great coworkers, but very overwhelming. Learned to work with pressure and steed. The hardest part of the job was learning the menu to make the sandwiches."
good,"It’s sometimes difficult, always hot, and has rush hours like you wouldn’t believe. But, Wendy’s is honestly a pretty good place to work! The employees tend to be friendly, and you advance more quickly the harder you work."
good,It was fun and exciting. Very fast paced but patient. The manager was willing to work on my skills toward me being a cook. The customers were very demanding.
good,I had a great team there. The pay was about right for fast food. But the environment was amazing. The people relaxed. Schedule flexible. You work. A lot. But in the end I met great people.
good,The atmosphere and most of the people are alright to work with. Some of the management could use some help. People that work hardest get paid the least unfortunately. But it's a nice environment. I do truly like my job there. Just could use some changes.
good,"Worked on the food on the grill."
good,cashier is an easy job and also the drive thru is an easy place. you also get free meals during the day you work. dishes are easy to clean there but you will get wet
good,It is a very fast paced and enjoyable place to work the customers (where i worked at) were very respectable and caused no trouble at all for me. I enjoyed my time at Wendy's.
good,the president of the company that I worked for was the best everyone should have a boss or owner of that caliber it creates a good work environment for you and the staff
good,Stable job no structure. Too many people could just leave or call off. Training was off and on mostly thrown on a station without no remorse if you failed. There was few exceptions the main manager we called her flower. She was kind and gave me hours. Honestly all and all I loved my crew members. Except one manager I think she was assistant. Very power hungry.
good,it was a great environment to work in schedule was flexible. Management was good the pay was okay. Over all the place was nice and well cleaned. very happy with the place.
good,It was a very good company. I learned alot and also taught alot. There were up's and down's;however I'll say mostly up's due to my good response with my staff.
good,My typical of work was I would get there at 7 I would start by unloading the delivery truck then I would do inside and outside maintenance then I would do some prep work and finally I would finish my day with cooking.
good,"After a year of working as a part-time employee. A manager saw my potential and recommended me for the manager, training program. I accepted the challenge because they saw something in me. I completed the training successfully and am working as a shift-supervisor for Wendy's at a full-time positions."
good,Working here was good and I’m glad I got the opportunity. The only issue I had with the company was a lack of workers and short breaks/none at all. I was in school and working full time so sometimes I would not have enough time to do school.
good,Unfortunately the Wendys I worked at ended up closing their doors about a month ago. It was fun to work there and I enjoyed getting to know everyone I worked with. I did have a problem getting more hours even though I asked repeatedly.
good,"The management in this company is extremely understandable and helpful. If any issues come up, the management makes it very easy to sort out the problem and get you the help that you need to make your job easier and enjoyable."
good,"It was a good experience, I had a good manager, my team was awesome! I loved to get to work and see my co workers and be excited to learn and serve our customers! I also love when we had a new sandwich, cause the request for the new sandwich went insanely good, our specials are awesome!"
good,Great Staff. Great environment. GM very understanding about giving time off for appointments. Managers are not on a power trip. Great team work. Managers work as hard as crew..
good,"Loved the people. Loved the environment. Strongly dislike DM and franchisee. Fast paced and there can be lots of pressure. Hours were awesome, super flexible. Pay is competitive."
good,"I personally did like it there, work wise. It was very dramatic though and people didn’t really care as much. And that’s what really bothered me either than that the experience wasn’t too bad."
good,overall its a good job to have if your diversity skills are strong. you'll definitely expand your networking abilities. most importantly you can learn alot about food preservance.
good,"It started off fine and I liked working there, but one of the managers made me want to leave. The company is fine enough and I'll miss certain workers, but because of this one manager, I can't stay there anymore."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's they helped me a lot because everything is new to me well a lot of stuff is new to me but I was looking at the register a little bit I was in the back room mostly catching up on bacon and dropping chicken and stuff like that
good,Wendys is somewhat of a good place to work. If the upper management takes care of store then it runs smoothly otherwise like my store will be problems with the lack of training and the lack of dedication from store manager
good,Can be very fast paced and stressful at times to work there especially during rush hours. On slow days we just clean and clean. We must keep ourselves busy at all times.
good,"My coworkers are great, my managers are super agreeable and fair but they don't tolerate slackers, willing to work with your schedule if given enough time in advance, really the only negative I can say is having to deal with the occasional disgruntled  customer."
good,"Good hours, good pay, good management. I enjoyed the customer satisfaction. Very clean and orderly in manner. Up to code on everything. Writen summary of responsibilities."
good,"Handle complaints, keep store running as productively as possible, make sure all procedures are followed, count inventory and cash. Building relations with customers is the more enjoyable part"
good,"it taught me how to handle upset customers the right way, handle peoples money and provide customer care. working in a busy environment helped me work with a team better."
good,It was great i jad a good experience learned new things met. Nice and fun teaching people an i would refer any to work there.the mangers are so understanding and they work around your personal life
good,"A typical day at work was rarely stressful even if we were shorthanded"
good,"I worked for Wendy's for 3 years. I worked 2 years as a crew member and 1 year as a shift manager. I was a full time college student while I worked there and they helped me work the hours I wanted. The crew was great, management was ok...."
good,"While it was easy for me, many people complained about the fast paced nature of the Wendy’s work environment. You must be quick to learn or quick on your feet because your one mistake can mess everybody else up."
good,Wendy's pause a good place to work for I had a really good time working there. It's fast-paced the can be stressful at some points but other than that it's pretty easy.
good,I have had a lot of good experiences at Wendy’s. It really helped me into the real world. Everyone treats each other like they’re family which is something I know doesn’t happen in many places.
good,Wendys was my first job after 3 months i had been asked to be a manager put alot of responsibility on me worked hard and learn as much as i could great company nice people.
good,"Was a fun, socially articulated work culture, that was relaxed but driven to provide the service the company is dedicated to. I worked there part time which was just enough income, along with savings, to financially keep me afloat till I started work for Benchmark Human Services. I have no qualms with the company or its staff at the facility I worked at but I would not work there long term. Not enough pay, hours, or benefits to support a 6 member family with all the payments for living that are included."
good,It's a good job the only reason I'm not working there now Cause my asthma got triggered from working outside in the pollen. But awesome job I love it fr
good,I would  clock in and start to clean the restaurant and then count my register and check to make sure there were fresh fries and fresh nuggets . I would help  and assist the customers by refilling their drinks
good,The hardest part of this job was that most of the time the workforce would be overcrowded so therefore they would send people home due to it being very full.
good,"Productive, with a Disney like manner. We strive to make sure the customer is satisfied with the meal, The accuracy and the staff. The hardest part might be for some others to maintain a smile on the loudspeaker and bring customers back for more."
good,Must learn fast wendys has great managers such good food my mangers lets us try a pieace of new sandwiches we get i have great coworkers very big on teamwork
good,A typical day consisted of good work attitude and everyone was willing to help any way that they can. What I learned was how certain franchises follow the deals that are made public but some don't. The management was good and they always tried to work around everyone's schedules. They treat you like family. The hardest part about this job was when the dinner rushes came through and they only have can only take one order at a time in drive through. The most enjoyable part of this job was when we make it through the rushes and haven't messed up on any orders.
good,"The people I worked with at Wendy's were always nice to me and patient! I enjoyed the work environment that was fast-paced and required teamwork too. I would just recommend that it pay a little more, though, and someone that was hired just before I left yelled in the back of the storage room and made the work environment unsettling and uncomfortable. Overall, I think Wendy's is a pretty good place to work, and depending on the people who work there, it can be really great!"
good,"I only worked there for 3 months so I cannot give an accurate review of working there, but, for the short time I worked there I enjoyed it and got along with everybody I worked with."
good,"It was always busy. I learned how to manage people and control a shift. We accepted all cultures. Hardest part of the job was the long hours. Most enjoyable part, was directing my people and meeting all goals I set for the day."
good,I Liked It For A Little While But It Was My First Job Temporary Because I Was Still In School So I Needed That To Graduate High School. But After A While I Got Tired Of The Fast Food Business.
good,I was a cashier when I started my first job and it was stressful but the work environment was fun to be around and I enjoyed going to work because the people all treated you like family.
good,"The hardest part of the job is when people call out and we're short, because sometimes there are 3 crew members and 1 manager working and it can get stressful sometimes. This usually happens in night shift because less people are scheduled then."
good,The manager is well aware of his or her job they keep everyone in order but need to be more wise on assistant managermanagers when the manager leaves and assitant takes over the order breaks down and team member is lost and confused about there job i love working with the manager more because im learning the right way and i gain more exsperiance on how he or she handle situation
good,A little bit of unorganized setting but when the crew works together everything runs flawlessly. When it gets too busy people tend to get stressed and loose sight of staying in task.
good,"As my first job, I learned and experienced a lot working here. People who work here are very helpful and nice.It gets very busy but I learned how to work in a good timely manner. I enjoyed my time here! The only thing that wasn't good is that I was getting paid student wage and the smell of grease that sticks with you after work."
good,"Not a particularly difficult job, but can easily get stressful. Pay is alright, but working longtime here won't get you much unless you go for a manager position. However, the manager position seems to result in an even more stressful job with shifts regularly being adjusted last minute and somewhat unreasonable demands from higher ups."
good,Altgough I didnt work there long I did appreciate the general pace and environment of the restaurant. Reliable managers who motivated the team and clear and easy to understand responsibilities. It was easy to build my team work and customer service skills. As well as time management
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere while working at Wendy's. I really enjoyed working along side with the management and crew members. Unfortunately due to having to relocating my employment with Wendy's was cut short.
good,"Working at Wendy's is great and exciting, but sometimes stressful and tasking. One thing I learned in my recent days at Wendy's is that customer satisfaction is key and priority and also for everything you do always put a smile on your face. The hardest part of this job is the aspect of multi-tasking which is important but sometimes stressful."
good,I love my job there. It's fast paced but everyone is super friendly. The job requires minimal lifting. Ability to do run register and make food is the easiest part. Manager and coworkers are amazing.
good,"I enjoyed my job requirements at Wendy’s I was responsible for cleaning the lobby, serving customers and serving food. My coworkers were friendly. Customers could be a bit disrespectful as expected"
good,Go in review numbers and outcome of previous days sales and production set up the plan for the day review schedules and make adjustments accordingly have a huddle for the day or talk about the days activities and what we are working on as the goal for the store guide and coach through out the day help customers being attentive and aware of all surroundings creating the atmosphere to which everyone is having fun and working to achieve set goals
good,"Face paced, everyday offering a different challenge, interactions with the public and team members. Demanding hours and that can be extended. Must be flexible."
good,working at wendys is a great job to start off with. the hours are flexible but you  probably wont get very many. a typical day is pretty laid back. i would recommend to any teenager in my family
good,Daily routine is making sure that the work station is ready for your shift if not make sure you get organized. Just watch and listen for the orders that are being called out. pretty easy job
good,Overall it’s not a bad job however you are overworked and the job pays minimum-wage job would be excellent if it had more staff or better pay to justify the work
good,"Work long hours but good pay, they would pay you.  They help train you real well.  Enjoy the company.  You learn a lot about the company.   Good to be in management, trained well."
good,"People easy to get along with. The managers are cool, nice, and layed back. The customers are friendly as well. Some of the jobs are pretty easy to get down."
good,"Working at Wendy’s is a wonderful experience, they try to make everyone feel as if they are welcomed. Which is a lovely experience especially when you have regulars that come in and they treat you like family."
good,Fast food job it's quick easy and can be fun .. being young it keep me with money in my pocket . Hardest part it's scrubbing the floor at the end . Nice job
good,It's a good place to work as a temporary job. Not too fast paced and the routines are well and a good place for someone to work while going to school. Great first job for teenagers!
good,i loved working there with the crew that i had it was a good experience.I learned how to work fast but efficent.The hardest part of the job was learning the job and how to multi-task.
good,Wendys overall was a good place to work there was plenty to do and plenty of customers came in to enjoy themselves. My only problem with the place is the stuck up management that has been there for to long and dont listen to anyone who want to help make things beteere rather they tell you your an idiot for not doing it there way exactly.
good,"always have collaborative efforts put towards completing the tasks needed."
good,A typical day at work consists of working a somewhat to very busy shift with little to no breaks during the week. Management will schedule your break only if there is another worker to relieve your position. If not you are damned or out of luck. I enjoy being a cashier and overall have at many places over the years so Wendy’s is a good fit pretty much. It just gets stressful sometimes during your shift. Management can put too much pressure on its workers at times.
good,.This job is easy. They cross-train you as quick as they can. The managers were easy to work with. The work environment is amazing. The other employees are easy to work with.
good,Wendy's was my first job as a teenager. It was a great starter job because they were accommodating with my school hours. I worked there for 3 years and eventually moved up into shift supervising and I loved it.  They teach you how to do the job and everything was easy. i recommend that everyone works in a fast food joint at least once in their lives.
good,"People are great, management needs work. When they promote you they don’t teach you how to become a manager or if you do something wrong they yell and don’t help correct. Also, it’s a reoccurring they promote people based on how long they have been there for"
good,The management at Wendy's would help if we were in a rush or if we were busy they would help us push the orders out instead of just sitting in their office and not doing anything.
good,Love seeing new people everyday. Management is great. Pay is not good but a fun first job for many teenagers looking for a good job with extra cash benefits.
good,"they are bad about when employees get sick, unless they are in the hospital they get mad if you cant come in. i felt guilted when i had pneumonia for 2 weeks, specifically from the store manager"
good,it was a great way to learn how the peoples voice mattered. The time i spent there gave me a chance to in prove my skills as a manager and how to handle with a upset customer so they can leave happier then when they came in.
good,It's was an over all great experience I worked under a great general manager who was a prime example of great costumer service and leadership who taught me everything I need to know
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work for. The management could use a little work communication wise, but overall they tried their best. I had problems with communication between other managers, and felt invisible sometimes when I tried to voice my opinions. It was a very fun place to work at though, and overall the management team and staff had positive attitudes."
good,"Working here was definitely a wonderful experience, but there were times the manager and I butted heads. She got a little too personal sometimes. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone that can but their tongue when you should."
good,"A typical day is great with a structured plan that helps to deliver a great customer experience."
good,Wendys was an amazing and easy job. Fast paced but easy going. Do your work and do it fast so the customers are happy. The members on the team were all easy going and fun.
good,"• Show up to work and depending on what position i was on that day I'd either be doing the grill, maning the fryers, making sandwiches for front or drive-thru, or take customers orders on front or drive-thru register"
good,I really enjoyed my job and it was one of the fun job I ever worked. The only problem was I want to say Management they show favoritism. And most likely will take forever to become a manager
good,"This is a fast food job. However, a lot of the managers are very friendly. The work was very fast paced and it would switch and never felt boring. However, I also feel like I was forgetting a lot of tasks as well due to the changes while I was working there."
good,This place is really busy and requires alot of work. It pays the minimum wage just like other fast food chsains. The managment is nice and sweet. However the only problem is that it gets really busy and night shift staff is really hard to deal with.
good,"it just needs better management, some supervisors were really good, and some just joked around too much ; but then get angry later about how busy we are. after awhile i was working a lot of hours, but my checks were extremely low ; not matching up. it happened to a few of us. found out our hours were getting changed after we left for the day, few of us quit and got better jobs.all co-workers got along. although i didn't get along with one or two of my managers, with them work wasn't getting done, and a few of us co-workers were getting bothered by it. another reason why we quit."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure the store was operationally ready for opening/closing. This would include assigning staff specific stations, extra duties (like a cleaning task) and making sure it was completed before they left.  Taking temperatures at various work stations and making sure all areas of the store were organized.  What I learned was how to do food orders, how to schedule according to peak hours and make build to's. The manager was very knowledgeable, she had been with Wendy's for about 6 years and was a very hard worker.  The hardest part of the job was working the fry station because it was very hot with the heat lamps and next to the fryers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,You are always in a faced paced environment and dealing with new people on a daily basis. you have to use some problem solving and be able to be patient with customers all throughout your shift.
good,They had great management and we kept then store clean home made fresh ingredients everyday for people to eat.  I also enjoyed the lot her worker there they had smiles on there faces and came to work on their schedule days
good,"the management was great but the constant changing schedule was a stress when it came to doing anything outside of work and making plans the most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the people and the help i got from them it really ,made me understand team work"
good,"A basic daily routine including rush, lunch and dinner times. Very friendly co-workers and management. A very safe and clean environment and work area."
good,"There was lack of advancement due to job duties, advancement opportunities given to someone who didn't want to do their job and only wanted to dictate to others. Work great around schedules to meet your outside life easier."
good,It can be a fun and a great job with alright pay. You start at $7.75 and get quickly put to $8.00 in a few months. Being a manger at this job pays you enough to live on your own.
good,Working at Wendy's was a great way to learn many social skills. It brings out the ability work  as a team. For me it taught me to always make sure the customers are taken care of. A really positive experience. I just wish I gave more.
good,"Decent job, co workers are nice"
good,wendys is a great first job for a young adult. helped me build and learn a lot of great things. very workable with scheduling. pay not to bad for the managers either
good,It was a good place to work at. i learned a lot at Wendy’s and it was pretty easy. Wendy’s is a fun and relaxed place to work at every good co workers
good,A typical day at Wendy's can be stressful since it is difficult to keep things moving when they are under staffed. Call ins from other employees is also an on going issue.
good,Wendy's is the cleanest fast food place I ever worked for. The managers I had on the night shift were awesome. It's a good first job for anyone to go and work.
good,"Typical Fast Food joint. I think your experience working here will vary upon location, because your coworkers and bosses will ""make or break"" your enjoyment of working here. I don't recommend working here if you are intending on creating a living for yourself. This job was suitable for me as a young adult."
good,"I liked working at Wendy’s for the most part. I believe I had more good days than bad in the beginning. It’s inevitable to have bad days but towards the end, my work environment got a little hostile. Not every Wendy’s location is the same either. Wendy’s is a good place to work overall."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's and liked how fast pace it was. The management was very hands on and helpful. I also liked my hours and how flexible they were.
good,"Have to deal with different personalities. Mostly teenagers who don't care much about the job, nor know how to behave professionally. Very frequent training and retraining.for managers and crew alike."
good,productive fast paced place to work.  I enjoyed learning new things.  management was great as far as teaching you your job and answering questions. They kept your spirits lifted up at all times.
good,"If you want to have a good time in a fast paced environment, this is the job for you. As long as you can work the hours required, cover shifts if needed, perform all duties expected of your position you can definitely thrive in this business. Especially if you dont really care about the pay. All responsibilities are one in the same of an actual restaurant so youre getting paid minimum wage for work that other people would pay more money for. it definitely has its pros and cons but the people are nice."
good,"I wnjoyed working there, it taught me responsibility and how to rely on myself and get my job done . It was a great first job  and I would work there again."
good,"I worked there for a small amount of time but ended up learning a lot of new skills. Costumer service is always first, it's a first step in a food industry."
good,"Theres not much to a fast food joint, service with a smile and try not to mess up the order. I was good enough to work every position but you would usually be put where you would be best at. for example, if you were good with people, you would probably work register. management over complicated stuff a lot, and there was a lack of management, but one of the two managers was a good friend, thats the best thing about the job, the friendships you build with your coworkers, and the half off food isn't bad, a good first job"
good,It's a good first or second job and teaches great work ethic. not a job I'd necessarily want to spend the rest of my life at but certainly great for teaching hard work.
good,I enjoyed my time working here they do need to focus a little more on the store level rather than just the bottom line. Other then that I enjoyed my time working here.
good,A typical day at work was prep work or taking over another position.  I learned customer service and quick math.  Working well with others and when and how to have fun at work.  Management was good and fair.  Atmosphere was good and easy to get a long with co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was the big rushes of customers and keeping them satisfied.
good,I was able to learn quite a bit. I did not like the fact that it seemed to have too much personal drama and unnecessary co-worker confrontation. And when it was addressed it continued to happen.
good,"Wendy's was fast pace, you were always doing something. If there were no costumers you were cleaning. I worked the evening shifts do to school, I would work from about 3pm-12am or so. Management changed while there and my hours got cut to like one to two days a week."
good,"I worked here briefly as outdoor maintenence and i have nothing negative to say. I would work an 8 or 9 hour shift starting at 4:00 in the morning and it was never a negative experience. managers were nice and crew were even nicer. "
good,"For the most part it was what would be expected when working in fast food. The staff was not very helpful in my training process, also they were not very professional."
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn something new, lead team, help and satisfy customers .Gained lots of experience from people, and learn to work in pressure"
good,I came to work everyday and followed my tasks and took orders for customers. I neatly put there food together on there trays. It was an easy task to do at Wendy’s not hard at all just sometimes the customers would be very rude but it’s always good to be positive.
good,"It was good for the time , Very busy during lunch time . Sometimes it was hard to keep everyone up beat . Management  team at the time was great  train most that are Managers still there now . I learn a lot working for  Wendy's no disappointment ."
good,"The staff was very helpful and welcoming. They made sure you fully understand your duties. Crew members and managers are hit with a rush and everything thing is very fast paced, but you are walked through every step of the way and adapt."
good,Need to be able to get off on time. Hire those who want to work not those who want the money. When hiring give them proper training so the next shift does not have to come in. Always have a back up plan for when other employers can not stay for over time or to fill in. Everyone needs to come in and do their job and stop looking for the next shift to do it. This would be a great place over all and going up on pay.
good,"Everybody is really nice, everyone is always smiling and happy to work. The managers are very nice, but there is one manager that is rude, not all the time."
good,"Wendys give me the opportunity of having my first job were I learned so much , practiced many skills that have help me today in my daily life work experience."
good,Very eye opening on how a restaurant is run and it gave me the opportunity to display a lot of responsibility. It taught me how to multi-task and work efficiently in the working environment.
good,It was a great job while my first boss was there but when she left every thing went down hill. That is why I ended up leaving. It was a great 3 year run.
good,It was a good job but I needed more money and they wouldn’t give it to me so unfortunately I had to leave. Work around you’re scheduled laid back job.
good,This job is a great first job. although they employees/ managers did not treat me fairly like that everyone else was treated. so i did not really like working there.
good,"Wendys was about as fun as a fast food place can be, at times it was more stressful than fun, but the easygoing managers and the cowokers made it easy to laugh and de-stress from time to time."
good,Wendys started off as a great place to work and over the last 6 months its had a lot off rough times. They have gone through a few General Managers and have lost a lot of customers and employees due to management that think because they have the power they are going to fire anyone they want with out really  any reason. I understand we are in a fire at will state but to let go and discriminate against some of the best employees doesn't make it right when they are the ones helping improve the stores and customer satisfaction. I was recently an Assistant Manager for over 8 months now and it was great until we stopped management from hiring with out training employees correctly. Wendy's is not going to improve if they keep just throwing employees into any position with out the proper training they are going to continue to lose out on sales and customers.
good,Wendys is a great place to work when you are staffed. The hardest part is knowing when to say something and when not too. The most enjoyable part is when everyone works together and they have a positive attitude.Staffing has been the biggest issue in the past four years.
good,"Working at Wendy's was unlike any job I ever had. It was fast paced at times, and calm at others, but pretty much everyone got along and worked well together to make things work. I thought it was pretty cool that we were able to get a discount on food while we were working, since most of the time I was working night shift."
good,I had a good experience there. I was working there to supplement my income while work was slow with my business. I would recommend Wendy's to anyone looking for a job.
good,I really liked the fast paced environment and probably would've stayed longer if it was better managed. The environment is very stressful and there were many shifts I wanted to die but stayed because of the people. YOU NEED A GOOD MANAGER FOR THIS TO FUNCTION.
good,"For a first job, it was fairly easy. The management was very easy going, meaning they will work around your schedule. You can adjust how many hours you want and how many days you want to work."
good,It was a quick paced to work but also it was fun. The people were nice and fun to work with. I enjoyed working at Wendy's. I got a change to meet a lot of nice people
good,"A fast paced, busy, customer oriented place to work.  Team work is a must.  Everyone is always learning something new.  There are a lot of returning customers.  Employees are very friendly and helpful."
good,Working For this company you have to have good customer service have to know how to deal & Speak with people .You Also Have To Be Clean & sanitized and your hyegien has to be up to par
good,"I worked as a Shift Manager which means they would train you to do what you have to do but other words , you will have to know how to do everything as in working at the business window, working in the back as a fryer, cleaning up in customer areas around floors and tables, and being at cash register, overall it was a pretty good place to work, co-workers get along fine , and average of the place being clean was at 98%."
good,A typical day at work was slightly busy. I learned how to be a cashier and the pick-up window. The managent was too harsh. The hardest part of the job is being consistent with the pick-up window. The culture is you jave to be fast and quck. The most enjoyable part of the job was eating meals and breaks.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consist of cleaning, prepping food, managing time wisely, assisting guest. I learned how to multitask, communicate with guest, identify and assist unsatisfied guest. Management was proficient. The hardest part of the day was during the rush hours. The most enjoyable time of the day was making sure the next shift was prepared."
good,"Some of the regulars where pretty cool same with the managers, it’s the only company that would hire 15 year old in my area so it was nice as far as that gos."
good,"No telling how long I would have stayed if I hadn't been forced to leave by outside forces. They loved me. Unless, I did something really stupid. They were not going to get rid of me. Flexible hours. Most of the people I worked with were good. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have stayed that long. Easy work, sometimes fast paced. Finally grasped how to count backwards (make change)."
good,I had this job longer than I intended because I enjoyed working with the people I had to on a regular basis. The work was fast paced and kept me busy.
good,Good position to learn if no employment experience.  Must have advanced education in order to advance to higher levels of management positions.  Must enjoy working in food industry.
good,"You come in, work for a bit and leave. Managers are cool and you get free food. Decent people to work with too, if you have any issues the people around you will help you figure it out."
good,"Enjoyed working at Wendy's, good people, and good pay. Building was incredibly clean, and management was really helpful and understanding with life problems."
good,"Working at wendy's canada was a Great journey and a great addition to my work and learning experiences. I met wonderful people and learned great skills from working there, like customer service and Safety skills."
good,Wendys is a fun work environment to be in at all times because there are hard working crew members and management to help out when needed. I would definitely recommend wendy to a friend.
good,This is a fast paced employment.  The upper management was not concerned with the lower management. They left it to the individual store managers to fix any and all problems.
good,For the most part I enjoyed my work and the people were easy to get along with. The schedule was pretty steady. The menu was simple and easy to learn.
good,They care about their employees like if they are family. Very clean place to eat at. Can get very cold inside the food place but is very enjoyable. They'll most of the time even take the food out to you.
good,"Working at Wendys was a challenge. Wendys was always full and mostly understaffed. Working at Wendys you need to work fast, be able to multitask. Definetley stressful"
good,I liked my job at wendys but i was never treated very fairly and was assigned to cover a shift even after doing a 12 hour shift of my own. I was never acknowledged for my work and the district managers hated their male managers.
good,At Wendys everybody plays their role in order to complete the orders in a timely fashion. It’s very quick pase you have to beat the clock when it comes to serving food to a hungry customer .
good,"I have worked off and on at Wendys for probably a total of three years and this last time was probably one of the worst. The GM lets employees literally do anything and everything that they want there. Most employees turn down the opportunity for management there because they know even if they talk to their GM about fixing things he never will. The work environment was fast paced and management worked around me and my kids schedule. Literally could do anything you wanted in that store and not be terminated, like smoking illicit drugs out by the dumpster or having relations with other employees in or around the immediate physical store i.e. the bathrooms or outside by the dumpster. Honestly its disgusting what goes on around there."
good,"I love Working at Wendy's. The customers are fantastic and everyone who works there is there to help each other. It is hard work so there is no shying away from that, but as long as you work you will be rewarded,"
good,yeah its stressful but at times it can be fun especially if you have great crew members and or managers. At the end of the day its a job and no matter what you have to do your job.
good,The days work takes a bit of adjustment. Fairly simple however with the work being mostly hands on and the hardest part of it all would just be to go about your day able to communicate with customers and co-workers alike in a greeting manner. Sort of all around job in which usually brought out a little bit of excitement in your day.
good,Worked for the company for a long time like the job itself just a lot that is asked if you and not rewarded for and long hours that you have to put in
good,"Easy hours, upper management could do better in recent times. Nothing being done about bad General Managers and hours are getting worse and longer. Not a bad job, just need a change."
good,"It's your basic fast food place. Sometimes it can be fun to work there. It's a busy company. It can be a lot of work, but it's not too bad. The hardest part is when the store is short handed and it's busy."
good,This company offers great benefits unfortunately the company I work for I did not agree with the management or the way they do things I would recommend working there as it is a great company and they do have a good mission statement
good,"working at wendy’s was a good summer job for me, and the people there were awesome. the customers were great and so was the management, i would recommend the job to anybody."
good,The work at Wendy's is your classic fast food job. If you are okay with being in your feet and maybe getting a little dirty than the job is not too bad.
good,I like this job just wished it paid more. The hours are ok but working till almost 1 am sucks when you have to come back in the morning. I like how fast pace it is because my day goes by quick.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wendys and the training I received and the opportunity to advance. They were good with work/life scheduling,needed more team building"
good,"It’s a good starter job, nothing I would want to stick with. Fast pace but short handed. Stressful and frustrating. Half off discounts, but when you work there so long do you really want the food?"
good,wendys was a great place to work the most enjoyable part of my job was the people that i worked with. it was a every multicultural environment. being a manger has it pros and cons but is still was a great experience. also it was an opportunity to new skills and ways to handle certain situations.
good,the typical day at wendys was very productive nonstop work place. everything  was fast paced. it was a fun place to work because it was always something to do.
good,"fast pace, long days, ability to grow. great team work environment. hardest part is keeping all customers happy, greatest part is making a family of coworkers and serving customers."
good,"Running around usually, must have good listening skills, strange hours sometimes, I did enjoy the work most days, I would do cooking, on grill or fryer, usually a good team"
good,"Quick paced during rush hour and lunch time. "
good,"•Hardest part of the job is working as a closer "
good,My experience at wendys was very taughtful. The job showed alot about customer service and time management. The management at wendys was very respected to there employees. The hardest part about wendys was dealing with ummanered customers.
good,"I work as a crew member for 3.5 years and it was a decent job through high school and some of college.  Pay rate was lower than I'd like to ever go back to, we had good managers and bad ones.  High turnover rate, but if you are a good employee and show up ready to work, that can work in your favor almost as a form of job security. Other employees did at times take advantage of the fact workers couldn't be kept very long, using that as reason to slack off since being there and alive was better than having nobody in that position at all so that made it harder on the rest of us some days. Overall, not a bad place to work and there is opportunity for advancement within the company."
good,"Wendys was my first job right out of high school. As a starter job it wasn't that bad. Its a great job for high school students, but i wouldnt recommend making a career out of it. They started payin every week, but if you're not management then you won't be able to live comfortably on your own."
good,"typical day at Wendys would be fast paced working real fast to get customers what they need. meeting new people had to be the most enjoyable for me , you get a great laugh here and there from people it really helps you finish the day"
good,"Really depends on the management, If you work with good management, your crew is happy and wants to do their best. Don't be afraid to talk to the management if you have any ideas on how they can improve themselves if you find something wrong about how they do things."
good,"It helped me build my communication skills"
good,Don't mind working here but the staff and crew members are messy and dramafied. It's quick paced so you ate always busy based on the area that the Wendy's in located at.
good,wendys was a fun place to start your first job i would recommend for teens more than adults its a great starter place they helped me with school and worked with my schedule very well
good,"only one issue, the employees were kinda clueless to be completely honest corporate/upper management  wouldn't allow us floor management the time or staff to properly train they're employees so they couldn't better themselves. So the positions the employees worked were the only ones they could work because they wouldn't cross train."
good,"Working at Wendy’s isn’t bad, the employees are polite and make you feel comfortable to be around. If it wouldn’t be for the customers and the way they keep us busy then it would be a boring place to work."
good,It was OK didn't really feel like i fit in nobody really helped me they just put me on an online training program and i learned my self with hardly any help
good,Overall my experience at Wendys was great. The managers where awesome. I loved working with my crew we all worked really well together while still being able to have fun and get things done
good,"It's a good transitional place to work, surprising giving the fact that I worked their for almost 3 years. The business would benefit from hiring more individuals over the age of 25. They tend to be easier to work with over all than teenagers."
good,i go in and i start on my dishes when a customer come i take care of them then go back to my dishes i clean many items for the next day and i help the cook when i can till close
good,"good place to work"
good,"Friendly and orderly pace to work. Meet great customers and train new employees, watching employees growth and helping them to understand the processes and how to treat customers was very interesting"
good,Working at Wendys was really fun especially the managers. They work with your school life. They give out free uniforms and apron for work. I would recommend Wendys as a first job.
good,"I find out were the manager has me for the shift"
good,I actually enjoyed going to work because I had some awesome co- workers. They enjoyed working with me as well. We would stick together every time we got busy and get through the rushes so we would stay on top of the drive thru time.
good,"It was fast paced, which I liked because I was constantly busy. The people I worked with were excellent coworkers and they made working their fun. The customers where also kind and understanding."
good,"Honestly, when I joined Wendy's I was juggling to get along with staff but as the time went by I've earned respect and everyone has started  believing in me. They've started to believe in my management skills, my leadership and my confidence. So, just within few months I've become an indispensable and irreplaceable employee of Wendy's culture. I've always seen that workplace as a craft to make me who I am today."
good,It was really fast paced making the hours go by fast. I learned to work with others and how to work the register. The management was very fair and worked with me in any situation. The culture was great everybody helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was working during my pregnancy. The most enjoyable part was getting along with my co workers.
good,"you have to pay attention to every detail like which order goes where, what food items goes on the sandwiches, making sure you give the right amount of change and making sure your uniform is right condition"
good,At Wendy's you always have to stay on your feet and be productive. You have to have good communication skills. You have to know how to work well with others.
good,"Customers bring down my positive attitude often, but my managers are great and the food here is incredible for fast food. My employee discount is well worth it."
good,I worked here in my teenage years and learned many things. They taught me how to present myself to customers and always try to correct problems without any confrontations. This is also where I learned the value of getting my work done and doing it correctly in a timely fashion.
good,overall a positive experience. It is a lot of long hours but you are paid fairly well. The shifts are mandatory and doesnt leave to much for single parent or young children at home.
good,"I would work all positions, such as the drive thru, front cash, burger making and fryer. Hardest part of the job was washing dishes and having to take payment in the drive thru during winter as your hands got wet and cold very fast."
good,"As far as a fast food job goes, it was an okay job. You had to work quick to serve customers who found themselves hangry. It's a job most often looked down on as beneath oneself, but it's an opportunity to get out and learn something new. If you apply you can move up, or move on. There is high turnover in the fast food market, but we had quite a few who spent years working in that store, and that goes to show what a good boss can do for a place."
good,Wendys as a whole is a good fast food joint and nice place to work. They are reasonable with the work schedule and requesting days off is relatively easy just expect to have less hours as a result.
good,It is a great way to work during her school or any type of education will work with your schedule will provide you a decent amount of hours always flexible and always there for their employees.
good,My review from working at Wendy’s is too always keep cool no matter how much pressure you’ll be faced to deal with. At times it could get fought but as long as everyone works together and stays focused ussaully everything goes smooth.
good,I worked as a manager for over 2 years and Wendy's is a great job for those in need as long as they are willing to learn and work. My role in management has taught me a lot about being a leader and I am grateful for my time there.
good,"I think Wendy's is a great place for high school students or if you are down on your luck and its the only place that is hiring at the time to pay your bills it is better than nothing at all for anyone willing to work but, I wish employers would have set schedules and not have everyone bouncing around on different shifts. It makes it hard to have a life when they do that"
good,Wendys is a good place to work but could be improve.But overall its a good job woth good management and employees.The only con would be not giving enough hours.
good,Wendys is a great job to start off with. It really taught me how to multi- task and communicate with others. It also helped me practice my math and memory skills.
good,"Great first job to have. Managers really take the time to train all there staff. Friendly work environment. They teach you how to work the grill, cash register and order screen."
good,Working at Wendy's is never boring.  The crew is very close almost like a family.  Hard work is expected but the happiness of the employees is also important to the Wendy's family.
good,Being around other people is always a fun and new thing to experience. Being able to do different things at the job is fun to getting to do more than one thing.
good,"It's fun meeting new friends at work! "
good,"Fast paced"
good,"I like wendys. A typical day would be waking at 645a going to work. Break at 915a Back to work by 10a through about 5p. Between the hours of 11a and 3p is rush hour. I learned to be more organized. Management is fine. The enviornment is great. The hardest part of the job would be not bumping into anybody every 15 seconds. The most enjoyable part is that i made a few good friends and we all help eachother get through the day with laughter, generosity and helping when they arent busy."
good,"Assisting customers daily with food orders, cleaning dinning area, cooking and on cashier."
good,"A typical day would be just getting through lunch rush, after that it was smooth sailing. I learned how to be efficient with customer and employee relationship skills. Management was always complaining, managers never lasted long. The cutler was very nice, Got to meet lots of people and learn alot of new things. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with people not showing up to work and having to cover there shift because your manager made you or they would fire you. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all the customers, You do get the occasional bad customer but more nice friendly people."
good,"Working at Wendy's is as easy as it is fast. The rushes come and seem to almost never go, but it makes the work day go faster. If you want to learn other positions, the option is always there for you to advance to other areas and the managers gladly will work around it so you can learn your new position better."
good,"After stock condiments, cups, napkins, lids, straws, and bags.  Then checking to make sure you have fresh coffee and tea made.  This was in a fast paste part of the city so I constantly had to clean up nasty bathrooms 2-4 times a day.  The management allow all the employee's to control them as if they scared of them.  Hated down times when I wasn't on the register because it made the day go slow.  Then I hate when someone complained about the restroom because I knew I would have to go clean it.  I enjoyed interacting with some of the customers because it was my first real job and I was learning how a business is ran."
good,Good place to work if you are looking for flexible schedules. Managers always worked with my busy schedule from school and sports. Great first job for high school students.
good,Fast pace good job for kids in high school. Work 10 hours or less. Really good working with the hours you need. Great if you need days off. A really good place to work in fast food.
good,"It  was a decent job....not very much pressure at all. It wasn't stressful as far as the managers go. They were pretty laid back. If you had an issue come up with your schedule, they would work with you."
good,The people at Wendy's (workers and customers) are great. I built a lot of great friendships throughout my years working at Wendy's. Training new hires was pretty fun.
good,"Fast and fun workplace, for a first job it is great. Somewhat of a good company to move up in if you have the right management, dedication, and direction."
good,"Working at wendys was a great job , and its not that i even wanted to leave Wendys. I just simply was not making enough at 8$ a hour and part time. I decided to get a 2nd job which was at Camerett Logistics, and when i told my manager at Wendys that i could still work and close for him but i couldn't be there until 1:30 to 2am . After discussing it all , the solution was for me to just work out my week and not come back at all. so i choose the better paying job in that situation"
good,"What i have learned from this job, is how to multi-task between different positions on the work floor. And also how to deal in customer service, and customer referral."
good,"Working at Wendy's, was always very quick. Always keeping the drive thru moving during midday and into the evening was something I specialized in after at least a month or two."
good,"first job while in school, still got plenty of hours but not high rate of pay, 7.25, was able to go to school and work and still sleep, typically worked from about 5 to 11 or 12. pretty laidback managers but still did the work, managers didnt sit there doing nothing while  telling us what to do,"
good,I like the manager she was a great lady that I got to work with . I love the crew members that I got work with. Even thou some would come in high as a kite to work. But even then it was fun to work with wendys
good,Typically on a normal day working on a daily cleaning task with a coworker is much effective and easier. Also communicating is a task thats essential and it gets things done more easier.
good,"Good environment.  I've learn about the process of the establishment. The management is great welcoming. The workplace is ok, just a lot that goes on  and people all over the place. They hardest part about the job is having to do everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people ."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a fast pace job that never was boring. I worked the overnight shift and was responsible for the heavy duty cleaning. All in all it was a great company to work for.
good,"It was definitely a job that kept you busy all the time. I was called in more times than not on my days off. I felt overworked by the time I left for my new job. They were however very accommodating with my schedule that I needed, between school and after school activities."
good,I always work on the same days so I know who I work with and I always dread going to work on Tuesdays because one of the mangers is really mean and creepy towards me and others. He sometimes go out of his way just to touch my shoulder. I don't think it is meant in a harmful way but it is still creepy. A couple other managers are rude and spread rumors or are just plain out rude. Some employees are rude as well. Also some of the boys there WILL NOT wear deodorant and it gives me the worst headaches ever.
good,This job is great when you are in high school. Some managers will work with your schedule if you are invoked in school activities. the hardest part of this job was rush hour you have to maintain a good pace and be prepared if customers change orders
good,"Very flexible , but I think that they should pay more than minimum wage. There is opportunity to grow, out just have to show that you are capable and they will reward the potential."
good,"Kept busy at all times, employess are pushed to do their best and eep customers happy. Crew members work well with eachother and are able to me the freshness standards"
good,I've met amazing people working there. Everyone knows how to have fun and made it like a second home. Management is usually great. People are nice it is a lot of fun. Definitely good for a first job.
good,You might have to do more things your position requires however it is satisfying by the end of the day. The hardest part is balancing all the work(between the fryer and grill).
good,fast pace in operation of store and enjoyable work experience with other managers and employees.  Learned a lot about the operation of a fast food company.  The hardest part of the job was the work hours shifting from one shift to another shift  (swing shifts)
good,"A typical day at work is very fast-paced and in some ways very rewarding. What is great about working at Wendy's were the hours. The hours were very flexible considering that at the time of my employment at Wendy's, I was in high school."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Amazing Job atmosphere that provides essential job skills. You can pursue your education while working here. Internship is possible college students because only part time work is available.
good,Really enjoyed working their management helped so much and went above their their duty to make sure everyone got along and the shifts work was smooth I would work their again if I would get hired back on as full time worker
good,I worked 50 plus hours a week for this company. I had a great staff and management was wonderful. The job title itself was tremendous amount of work. From running a restaurant to making sure your employees and customers are happy.
good,Working as a crew member was low pay and no hours. Once Management long hours and good pay. Great room for advancement if you are willing to work and learn hard. Corp. takes care of Management.
good,Good crew and management most the time a little bit of drama here and there just like with any work place. Pretty simple to advance if you put in the work and time
good,Wendy's is a great company overall that provides Excellent customer service and food! The people who are employed are able to work flexible hours to also obtain a college education.
good,"It's a fine place to work just don't expect a loyal ""family"" atmosphere or anything, over the years working there I had this thought that since I was working there so long that there would be more loyalty coming from my managers but there wasnt. Just work there don't try to make real connections"
good,"There is no I, in team... Work goes more smoothly when everyne works together. Most enjoyable is the customers. I learned everything, I'm a fast learner."
good,"My typical day at work, is when its lunch hour and it's so busy. I learned that you don't only have too have fast and speedy service. you also have to have excellent customer service, for your customers and management team the hardest part of the job is the rush hours and the most easiest thing about the job is just getting the job done."
good,It was a easy place to work nor was it too demanding of me as a high school student. Enjoyed the general manager and overall workplace environment. I enjoyed my time there.
good,I liked it a lot. My mangers didn't treat me well. The team members were extremely welcoming and will help more than the mangers. The benefits are also well since their food is good.
good,Wendy's is a competitive company to work for as well as being enjoyable. You must be willing to give the job your all. The owner rewards hard work and dedication.
good,"Wendys was a good starting job that helped teach me time and money management. There was a good balance between work, school, and home life. The overall work environment was fast, but good for teaching time management."
good,Im not sure about the managment now. Wasnt perfect then because the boss was mean and showed favoritism. Was having relations with an employee and giving lota of hours to minors. It should be much better now i hear the gm was fired and replaced.
good,"Fast-paced work environment"
good,"A typical day is me getting to work 5 or 10 min earlier to make sure were I work is stocked up and clean. After making sure my area is good I go see if my team members need my help .I have learn how to be passion with the customers and to always have a smile. The management is good ,  as well as the workplace culture  the hardest part of the job was it was not hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got the chance to meet new people and I had a chance to grow a little ."
good,Wendys was my first job so at first it seemed stressful and sometimes hard to overcome problems. I picked up very quickly and begin to grow in the skills they sat out for me to learn. A typical day was very fast paced and all about quality and speed. The workplace was i would say fun at times but also very serious. I dont think there was anything hard about working here. i enjoyed working with the people that i got to work with.
good,"Great place to form higher opuutunity in general buisness, District managers are fair, in the Flagstaff AZ area. The general manager could probably use a little more time and less stress. Team members were awesome. In my experience I higher education my position pretty quickly so I would say the company gives you opportunities to excel."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Fair PTO, fair equality. I like the fact that the DVP gave us permission to fail. Anything that we could come up with to build sales we were allowed to do so even if we did fail. I like the flexibility of the work hours if needed be. And I love the fact that customers was definitely a first priority. Depending on which store you were located at the training wasn't always there everybody didn't put that as a priority including the DM's. As a GM I built a culture of friendliness in my store smiles were part of your uniform and I made sure that the employees were rewarded for a great job well done."
good,Wendy's is a loving environment and a fun place to work you get days off. Everyone gets treated the same no special treatment. The mangement is good. Its easy to talk to them about problems you are having
good,Typical day last 10 hours. I learned how to manage a multi-million dollar restaurant. Workplace culture was outstanding. The hardest part of the job was guest.
good,"I enjoy my contact with the customers, and have come to know some of the regulars.  "
good,But they do not know how to deal with bad store managers.  I would have loved to continue working there... But I guess hostile GMs are just the par for the course.
good,"Just stay on task, don't get distracted. You want the best quality and focus. It was hard for me because they would talk about black people with me around. Their not racist but just certain things would trigger me, and I'd get aggravated."
good,I ran drive thru I enjoyed it but always switched hours and that I didn't like but didn't like the job and the people I worked with.running the drive thru and taking orders was quit a challenge for me but I'm not interested in that job
good,"As soon as you clock in, you are on and do not stop, I have learned how to talk to customers and make sure that they feel welcomed inside the store. Management is excellent, very easy going and still strict enough. The hardest part is how fast it can be without any breaks. The most enjoyable part is being with a team and being able to talk to co-workers without feeling like you are crossing lines."
good,I enjoyed working at wendy's there is always new people to meet and work with. And the management wasn't bad either. over all pretty okay place to work.
good,"It was a Fast paced job, with the drive thru time, but there was a  good environment. There were very late nights, however, but the work was not to hard and the pay was sufficient."
good,"I enjoyed the job other than the managment over time. The GM became rude, insensitive to my needs and played favorites. I had to leave because of these issues and I had to care for my mother."
good,"Lo que aprendí de esta experiencia es que siempre debes estar dispuesto a asumir cualquier reto laboral que tengas, así sientas que no tienes habilidades, siempre tienes que asumir nuevos retos en el ámbito laboral"
good,"- You learn how to communicate with people when they're angry."
good,",When I come in I'm expected to wash my hands first then look at that chart we're I'm supposed too be then I clock in and get immediately too work no playing around"
good,"- Awesome first job experience "
good,I would recommend someone to work there if they are wiling to deal withvsome stress. Also it is fun but very hard but it probably would have been fun if I was working with food.
good,"Being a cashier at wendy's was great. I met great new people. I cooked,clean and stocked. Some of the employees was just rude and mean. I tryed hard tow work with the staff but they just was to messy. But wendy's have the best fast food to me."
good,"This place is an awesome place to work, sometimes stressful but that’s the “fast food” business. If you have anxiety however it’s not for you! You must keep up!! Tip: always clean or stock when slow!! Get what you need done before you help anyone else."
good,Wendys is an enjoyable place to work. The people are friendly and easy to get along with. There is many opportunities for advancement. Also the schedule is very flexible.
good,"At Wendy's, you always have something to do. You will never not be doing something and it makes the work shifts go by a lot faster. Be prepared for lunch and dinner rushes."
good,"I would go to work Monday-Thursday. I would work everyday from 4pm-2am. No, my job was NOT hard. as long as you pay attention, you catch on pretty quick."
good,"Fun, and friendly environment. Fast paced and great people. Friendly customers. Working together to achieve a overall weekly goal. Cooperative and fun management."
good,I enjoyed working at the location. What I didn't like is how certain employees were showed favoritism. I disliked how the manager never had ENOUGH time for certain employees and how she could easily just deduct money from workers checks.
good,Wendys is a good place to work. You stay very busy and the days go by quickly. You have a good share of paperwork and computer work to do on each shift. Inventory has to be done at the beginning and end of each shift. Managing and positioning employees .
good,I always had  a good days at work due to the crew. I build a family there that I still communicate till this very day. I absolutely love when jobs makes you feel more like a crew member.
good,"It's a very simple place to work. Clock in, do your job, clock out."
good,"I love the location,  just not the manager.  Shows a lot of favoritism to workers.  I love the hours,  and co workers.  Hate I had to leave but I believe I'll find something better."
good,sometime the hours are good depends on the shift you work on. Manager sometimes get intense but overall they be cool with you. get discount only up to three items (different not the same).
good,"my experience with wendys was great. I was taught a lot and the food quality is great. never did I have to worry about if my job was going to be terminated. management always looked to hire up within the company, much room for advancement."
good,"I'd say a day at Wendy's could really be stressful.At my Wendy's we have lack of employees no help at all, The employees their at time can be very mean even sometimes the manager can be mean when everything is not going her way.At Wendy's I've learn how to be friendly and greet customer, The work culture is good but you just have to get along with everyone in order for you to like it.The hardest part is the just dealing with the customer, An the enjoyable part is being able to go home once your shift is over."
good,"All of the crew members are nice people who help each other. We maintain a balanced shift to ensure nobody is more or less than anybody else. Most of the customers are regulars so its easy to build bonds with them for great customer service. Management also looks out for you and give incentives for doing a job well. All in all its a great store to work, especially for younger people."
good,"Worked my heart out for the company and put my all into advancing as far as I did to team lead. It was a great work environment and management. "
good,I learned what a work family was all about and how to work in a high-paced environment. I learned customer service qualities and met a variety of new people.
good,When i work here everyone was nice an work together as a team manager were easy going hour were around my scheduled but the paid was not enough to live on
good,its really good place to work. Their management was nice and well maintained. i have learned to communicate with lots of different types of people. its was really at time when its an rush hour although for my first job i really liked it.
good,Wendy's was my first job giving me a sense of what it means to be professional and get a real grasp of responsibility and attention to detail.  it provided with me some of my more useful skills I hone today.
good,I started as a crew member doing drive thru or front counter because I was one of the few in the place at night who spoke passable English. I worked doing dishes when I didn't have customers and learned different store positions like grill and sandwich board. I got trained to work any position needed and went to crew lead. I didn't want to advance and basically kept the job as a paycheck to survive on.
good,"Working with Wendy's was a great job at the time. They had benefits that just wasn't open to me at the time.The hours were perfect for me at the time. I didn't really have any problems with the job, employees, or the management. It felt like a family that each others back and I wouldn't mind working there again!"
good,"It's fast food - it's not going to be the best, even if it's not necessarily the worst. The main problem that I personally had with Wendy's was the amount of work I contributed and the pay that came of it. Some people slack off and get paid more; some people work hard and get paid less."
good,i was a teenager in high school just wanted to have my own money so i could have fun with my friends it was good to get out of the house sometimes with out asking my mom for money
good,"It really helped me get my dishes done without having to be there all night when I used to close and be back cash- I learned how to multitask better here- with order taking and cashing out and helping make fries-bag orders- and doing dishes/ keeping pop machine clean, it was deafeningly challenging but helpful for the field."
good,"I worked at Wendy's through speedway. Speedway provides excellent benefits. Double time on holidays, and I could request days off if I needed. Overall good"
good,"Wendy's is a place were you work at very fast, and very stressful when rushes set in, and very fast pace, not the greatest place to work at, but makes a good starter"
good,"Pay was better than most fast food places. Was moved from crew to management in 3 months. Upper management wanted to advance its crew members frequently, which helped shifts run more smoothly because staff was properly trained and had the desire to do their best."
good,Overall I personally really like my job here only because my postion is opening maintenance. And half my 8 hours is outside. The other half is on grill.
good,"It's a good first job, some of the managers werenot the friendliest but it was fine. Some of the other crew members weren't the friendliest but I mean it's fine."
good,Well it's located in a hospital so we never slow down that's good for the work day but besides that it's a great business and job.i l enjoy being a supervisor at Wendy's
good,It was like a family. Great team the work flow was amazing. Everything was well thought out & put together. If they paid more I would go back. Loved it
good,"metas de acenso , buena paga , horario flexible para estudiar"
good,having your ace's in place to have a productive day communicate and follow up respect and fun environment coaching team members to do the right thing recognizing a great job
good,"FAst pace ,meet different people with lots of different personality fun place to work taking an fixing orders greeting and meeting new people very day"
good,"It wasn't the worst job in the world, though the management made me stay until 4 in the morning to just do dishes; the crew would occasionally help, but not often."
good,"The day varied:"
good,"Its a trying job at times very demanding fast pace. The night crew is some of the best. They are loyal, hard working, determaine co- workers. We are a team and we stick together."
good,I enjoyed working with the people i worked with. The customers were always nice to talk to. I always had something to do never bored. The tasks i was asked to do were easy.
good,I really like working for Wendy's but they dont offer many hours so I have little room for advancement. I would like to continue working there but I also need more hours
good,Most the time working for Wendys is a good experience but some days we get pushed really hard and have to do multiple positions and are short handed but for the most part the managers really seem to care about the employees and ask us about our personal lives and make sure we having a good day they know us by name and work with us if we need time or need to change our schedule
good,I enjoyed working for the company. My manager went out of his way to help me with hours as well as training. Camaraderie between employees during any shift was always a great team environment. I would recommend anyone starting out in the work field to try this company.
good,I learned good skills working at this company. Although I had to work long hours it taught me how to manage myself and balance a career. Overall it has improved my skills and benefited me in the long run.
good,"Just about the same as another fast food joint. Its quick paced, and requires your full attention, especially during lunch rush. Overall a great first job."
good,i learned how to be patience with employees.  Training our employee for better outcome. work place culture is very strong due to all the training with their manager. once the new franchise when in change everything
good,"Nice fast paced fast food restaurant, great staff, super clean.  They took the time to teach me everything.  Awesome supervisor very nice. Flexibility with schedules."
good,a good fast paced learning job for high school students or a part time job for extra money.. the job was ok I was actually in higschool I got all the hours
good,"I wouldn't work there again.  It might be a kind of job for a teenager or someone who needs a job, to pay rent or who's struggling with things. I  wouldn't work there again because it wasn't my kind of thing. I'm in my 30s I want to do something that would make me happy."
good,"yuu your self need to be able to be willing to put effort in oder to keep up with fast pace, stay away from drama and just do your job. you will only succeed if you try."
good,"a typical day at work was prepping the food, getting the store ready to open. I learned 99% of the time the customer was ALWAYS right. If you make the customer happy, the more enjoyable your job was. For the most part, the management was awesome. The hardest part of the job was making the customers happy. The most enjoyable part also, was making the customers happy."
good,i nice place to work if you enjoy fast paced environments and competitive work  atmosphere sometime the work load get very intense but it helps the day go by a lot faster
good,It was demanding but that didnt stop me. The employees were rude and snarky and didnt have an ounce of respect for each other or superior. Nontheless I did my job and tried my hardest of what was expected of me
good,Perfect job to start at. Multiple positions you can work at to learn for future jobs. Don't recommend to make a career working in fast food. Fun place to work at.
good,"I had a lot of fun while working at Wendy's and I enjoyed myself a lot with the crew members and some of the managers, which was great. The only thing that I really did not like was the fact that when I would request a day off with 3 weeks in advance of the day that I was requesting I would not get the day off, but if another crew member requested a day off with 3 days in advance they would get it off. I guess you could say I didn't enjoy how the store manager was sometimes."
good,"I grew up with this company, even paid my bills on time. Bought my very first car working here. The people always have a good time. Great company to work for. -Tyshara M."
good,very fast paced service always stay busy i met ome of the best people at wendys while i worked there and i absolutley love there food my favorite is chicken nuggets and there fries.
good,Worked at both Wendy's in my town and loved both of them management was great! There was always opportunity for growth. Very laid back company. Management and corporate where both very appreciative of there employees. Benifits weren't that great but it was something even if you weren't full time you could opt in. Pay was decent.  Would definitely recommend working here!
good,"Wendys was my first job. I got use to working any shifts and love my co-workers, we were a big family when it came to make the best store in the area. I had to leave wendys because when i apply i was a full time worker but with new management i became a part time employee and weekly the gave me less than 25 hours to work."
good,"The environment is one of a fun yet professional. For the most part, the employees are fun and hardworking. Working here has given me an opportunity to better myself career wise."
good,"This is a great place to work for a kid transitioning between high school and college. Flexible hour and great management. Pay isn't excellent, but the work isn't hard."
good,Is a great work where you can talk to the coworkers and everyone is going to treat you well. Their nos mad names or anything everyone is family where we can have fun with each other and work as a team.
good,"Management was good and taught you what they needed, work was normally busy each day besides around opening and the middle of the day, it was normally a very nice workplace"
good,"If you enjoy making/working with food, Wendy's is definitely the place. You learn many nutritional facts and if you know them then you're in a much better position to help out a customer."
good,"The hours are good, which allow you have gained a lot of information and training in one day. I've learned how to work as a team player, which has lead me to improve my personal skills such as my communication skills, customer service skills, and my food handling abilities."
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work, but they did not pay enough money. The people were nice. And i got some good experience. I would work it as a second job."
good,"My location had a really Fast work environment, and i had amazing managers, wasnt really worth the minimum wage pay and i didnt have much hours. good place for a first job"
good,This is a great place to work at!! The management are very nice and want to make their store look great and keep it clean. Never had any problems with any of the management or other workers.
good,"I love working at wendys but one of the managers there is not the best to work with. She puts everyone down, and she never has a good attitude unless its with a customer.But besides working with her i really like working at wendys."
good,"We would cut the vegetables and get meats and potatoes ready for day. Make salads before opening the store and stock everything. It is fast paced you have certain time limits to complete tasks. I learned how to cut and prepare lettuce, make the different salads and cut tomatoes. The hardest part is when we would be packed and nobody works together to get people thru the lines. I enjoy the regular customers and the employees I work with."
good,"When I first started out at Wendy's, I had some helpful coworkers, and the managers knew how to follow the rules as well as how to cut back and have some fun every so often. Good first experience."
good,I loved it the customers always make u smile. The bosses don't do enough and expect the asst manager to their job 4 them. Maybe it was just my boss I dk
good,Wendy's was fast paced. No down time. Great management and advancement opportunities. Your hours are based on how much you would like to work and if you actually show up when you're scheduled
good,"The days are usually expected to to fast paced, your always working and moving. I learned a lot about food borne illnesses and how to deal with angry customers. The management here is nice and well put together. The hardest part of the job I think would be closing the store. The most enjoyable part would also be closing the store."
good,"This job was casual and fun the majority of the time, although at times it would get very busy. Saturdays were the busiest, and orders came in faster than they could go out sometimes. It was a stressful environment, but nothing I couldn't handle."
good,Wendys was okay at the beginning and i did everything they asked of me but once they saw that i was a hard worker the assistant managers started taking advantage of me and made me do other peoples jobs.
good,"-Accustomed to work in fast paced environment."
good,The management was great and truly cared for their employees. The only reason I left is because the pay per hour and the hours I was receiving could not support my bills.
good,"Great job with great people. Good team environment. Fast paced, always something to do. Management encourages team atmosphere. Mant different jobs and positions in a day."
good,"Daily I work with friendly older coworkers and we assist each other as possible, as I can as well to help complete orders and have the customers come and go. I learned how to use a cash register and how to operate a fry/nuggets basket, as well as to make sandwiches and how to do orders in a drive thru window. The hardest part of the job is when there are long lines of customers and sometimes you or your teammates get something wrong with the initial order, which kinda messes up the flow. But enjoyable to talk and work with older female coworkers who are nice to me, as well as managers who like my work of organization and tidiness. I also got to see kitchen and food safety practiced firsthand and am practicing communication skills by taking customer orders and seeing the inventory of a Fast Food Restaurant chain."
good,Wendys in hope mills is the worst Wendys so far In Fayetteville. The managers suck and have nasty attitudes . It's was a hassle working there. And too many customers that complain.
good,"It's a fun place to work at when I would get there I would start working on the grill. The managers do like to have an energetic feeling when working there. I learned how to clean up the grill's, do dishes, cook the meat, and restock."
good,Wendys isn't everyone's dream job but it is a good place to start out if you need to gain some skills and experience that will help you later on with other jobs.
good,productive place to work at starting out and great customer service. This isn't a job that I would like to stay at or manage. Just a start food is not the atmosphere that I would like to work. There could be better communication and team work.
good,I worked at Wendy's for almost 3 years and it had its ups and downs. I enjoyed the actual job and working with customers but they hire a lot of people lacking common sense. Management is hit or miss.
good,My time with Wendys taught me about many different aspects of management and overall was a great learning experience. I was able to work my way up to the store manager position and work with some good people.
good,"My experience with working with the company was very pleasant. I learn alot from the company, how the people in the company aim the please every customers."
good,"I must say I have to think hard about my time at Wendy's, as any normal job you will experience good & bad days. When I first started working for Wendy's in the beginning it was challenging, but I quickly learned every job there in store. From running register and making food, to doing ""truck."""
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wendy's manger were on point , we worked as a team. I wish they had some kind of benefits,  but at the end of he day l like the people I worked with we had a great time."
good,Not bad hours are for the most part fair . Compensation could be better. But benefit package is competitive. Management could have the backs of salaried GM's a little more.
good,Its a job you have to try to get along well with others I have get along with everyone sometimes people have their issues but its still a job that have to be done
good,"I, personally, had made my way up to a higher position because I was available whenever and work was my highest priority. The management was very good, very determined. Minus the fact that it was always full of drama, I enjoyed my job here and I would recommend."
good,"On a typical day at work we would just take orders when needed, and if there were no costumers there, then we would just sit there and wait or we'll be cleaning our stations."
good,"i actually enjoyed my time here, despite the latte hours.  I enjoyed choosing the right crew for my stores, and getting them Sparkle Certified.  I met some of my favorite people on both sides of the counter that I still keep in touch with to this day.  "
good,I found working at Wendy's was a learning experiance  that was very demanding at times but also very satisfying work and I felt I learned a lot and grew in my knowledge as a manager
good,I worked as the dine in cashier. As a cashier I had to do everything. Management helped when I needed it. But the other workers wouldn't do their jobs.
good,Busy and crowded we were always serving because we were located on base with very hungry marines coming off the field but we always had a short staff sometimes.
good,Working for Wendy's Hamburgers was great and uncomplicated. There were a lot of duties but working with people who cared was the most important part of the job.
good,"The job itself is so easy and fun if you close at night. They really do care about their costumers. We really did not get benefits sadly. I grew out of it, but fun job for teens."
good,Its a great place top be at. Employees and management is very nice and they will help you if you are in need. Willing to work with your schedule and make things more easier for you.
good,"Wendy's Hamburgers is really a good company. they know how to teach a lot of learnings to their people... but somehow, one thing that people don't want to them is that the salary that they are giving out.  specifically incentives. they inconsistently giving incentives to their people."
good,"Working at Wendy's is pretty easy, and is also a great place to apply to if you have never held a job. Usually on your first day you'll spend most of your time on a computer taking tests for training purposes. The day goes by pretty quick due to large amount of customers that come in."
good,Wendy's is a good place .. Good and fresh burgers. I learned by working in fast paced restaurant. The salads are fresh. New mozzarella salad has arrive at Wendy's.
good,Every work day varies. Learned to deal with unruly customers. Management wasn't that bad. Hardest part was dealing with customer request. Easy part was learning about the job.
good,"constant cooking burgers ,and keeping the cooler full ,good management ,good culture, hardest thing to do is run the drive through and other stations at once"
good,I really liked working for Wendy's. The management was good. i just didn't want to work fast food anymore. but i would rate it overall 4 stars. and recommend some friends
good,"The amount of hours an supervisor gets a week is consistent although the work shifts hours are sporadic. At this job I learned how to communicate with many different type of employees. Good or bad it was always a learning curve to be able to interact with so many different employees. The culture at this workplace was very respectable, everything that is done is to please the customers. The hardest part of the job is during rush hours, being able to keep all the employees under control and working as a single unit. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I learned how to be a leader and was able to interact with many different employees."
good,"The environment is very busy and sometimes it can be stressful, but I learned so much from this restaurant. They taught me how to be fast,pay attention, and interact with the customers. There is not any part of this job that is hard because I learned how to do mostly everything there. The most enjoyable part of the job would be cleaning up the dining room and being a cashier."
good,"work was never too much, just right. "
good,The typical work day was decently easy with rush hours being the most entertaining. Overall working at Wendy's helped me overcome a lot of my shyness.
good,it was a good work environment with staff that was ready to help and train if needed. very productive although the time management could have been improved I never felt like they weren't trying their best.
good,"This place was all about business, they made sure the team work to their best. It was a fast pace job and some people might not be able to take it. They wanted to prove they were the best in the city."
good,Most of the management was great to work for.  Benefits were great.  Training program was easy to work with.  Management overall worked with you on requests
good,Management did not like to help employees during the rush hour. The most enjoyable part of working with the company was the people that you meet. I learned how to become a shift leader. A typical day at work was always busy.
good,currently working. Have worked in the restaurant field for 27 years. Keeps you busy. never have the same day twice.  The hardest part of this type of business is the staff.
good,boring job mainly take orders pay isnt that good wouldnt work here again managed poorly no option to rise up in company stagnant jb food isnt that good either
good,Management  were not on the same page.  Things would get told to the general manager to tell us and they wouldn't. I loved my regular customers. My co workers were very respectful didn't have to sit and  make sure they got what they needed to get done.
good,"Overall it's a good place to work or even good place just to get something to eat. You have to shave but, the main problem I had was was receiving my taxes."
good,Loved working here besides being sexually harassed by previous employers. Too much favoritism and back stabbing. Unless you're a favorite you don't get your hours or the time off you need.
good,"Working at the Wendy's Company can be tiring, yet rewarding. Possibly the best fast food there is, I enjoyed the large discounts I earned on staff meals. Management was supportive, and provided me with flexible hours, and greeting customers was extremely enjoyable. A very face-paced workplace meant the need to be quick on one's feet, and the ability to multitask was mandatory."
good,"There really isn't a way to describe a typical day at work because the environment is always changing, Its either really busy or really dead. You can never really predict whats going to happen. Personally I like the fast pace, I take orders quickly and try and get them out as quick as possible so I can do my close. I am a closer there. I really like the people I work with at night because its more relaxed environment, less stressful then during the day especially when your all caught up on your close and joking around with co workers and having fun goofing off for a short period of time makes the nights more enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed my time working at wendy's partly because I was able to switch locations halfway through to go to a brand new restaurant and get paid extra to train new team members.
good,I feel that the hard work I put in I should get a raise as an experience grill cook. I'm willing to learn and give my all. I have many talents and very diverse in the kitchen.
good,"Great place to work, but they do have a high turn over rate. The management is great depending on the location you are applying to. They are very clean."
good,This is a great place for someone who needs a part time job. I would not recommend this job to anyone that tends to go full time as it is not worth the hassle. Otherwise it is you basic starter job.
good,"I have work at this Wendy's location for 2 years on night shift. The environment is great other then the under staffing on night shift. They will work you on your schedule, I played volleyball and powder puff football for my high school  and still maintained my hours."
good,"The time working for the company it was good"
good,It was real good with working there I like the hours it was kind of small food was good it wasn't no real room for advancement but it got me through it and it was a job
good,"rush hour was always busy"
good,"Good job but shifts never change, I always work weekends which is a downer. Some managers take it seriously others dont same goes for employees. Other than that everything is great."
good,Worked there and was promoted twice in 2 years and declined my 3rd promotion the third year. You can learn a lot about personal growth from the job itself and management. I worked for a franchise company that bought out the Wendy's in this area and the franchise company was 100x better than corporate company.
good,"Cashier"
good,Everyone who worked at the Wendy's restaurant took their jobs very seriously but the employees were all very close like a giant family which made it into a comfortable safe work environment.
good,Management when i worked there was not as helpful as they could have been especially to a new comer. Staff was not as helpful either with the exception of one it kind of felt like i was lost throughout the day little training but i picked up fast still it was not the best environment for me personally as not only do i not eat the food i just did not like the environment
good,its not a bad company to work for but you need to be willing to work not slack off..... this company is willing to work around a school which worked out great for me going to college to better myself
good,I enjoyed working for the company and advancing in management. Training was also very fun and productive. The staff was very helpful and always available for questions if i had any.
good,Would bag groceries for customers and give them help out to their car if needed. Would help assist on the cash register when needed. Pushed carts for one hour of shift every time I worked. Management was young and friendly. Good overall first job!
good,"El ambiente laboral era bastante bueno, el horario estaba muy bien y fue bastante satisfactorio."
good,"Good work condition, crew member are well trained, and all around good place to make some money. If you're looking for some money this is where to start. Not a hard job at all."
good,"Working in fast food is never a desirable job, but if you're going to work in fast food, Wendy's is probably one of the best places. It's definitely not a fun job, but they provide extensive video training and make sure you know what you are doing before they throw you into a position. I unfortunately worked at a Wendy's where I had a very bad experience with a manager, but overall they are a good place to work and probably one of the cleanest fast food places."
good,"I worked there for about a year going to school and I worked part time because I was going to school .the pay was little of course just 200 to 300 dollar pay checks. Cool, nice ride customers that come and go. But it was fun working there I was able to be in high school and work . They just worked around my schedule.but it's just cleaning ,stocking up products leaning how to do your own section or another. Getting the customers what they need fast but as best as possible."
good,"I liked Wendy's or the most part, it was just like a typical fast food restaurant job. I had to learn how to use a cashier and deal with a lot of customers using fast pace skill and a lot of energy."
good,Nice place of business.  Has a Family environment. Managers and crew are great. Just need better pay for crew and managers. Also needs better benefits for crew an managers.
good,"Working at Wendy's typically makes for a busy day. I learned there are many different ways to make a hamburger delicious. Management is strict but in a good way. The hardest part of the job is keeping customers satisfied,but the most enjoyable is being able to make someone smile."
good,"The best thing about working at Wendy's is meeting new people everyday,giving them a Wendy's experience that makes them feel part of the family."
good,"management is not good at all. Crew members are focused more on home life at work than their workplace. The work is easy but sometimes can get aggravating when others aren't doing their job, making it hard to do yours."
good,"As a manager, it was a good place to work, with the exception of the work ethic of many young teenagers these days.  It's hard to find a hardworking teenager.  Dealt with a lot of kids calling in sick at last minute, or just not showing up to work."
good,getting to meet new customers everyday is always a fun thing especially when they become regulars and become more of a friend. the staff and managers were awesome. the hardest part well I don't really remember it was a long time ago.
good,"The job requires you to be very quick when doing your tasks. Little opportunity to promote. Management can vary, feels like being in a high school environment."
good,"Though there for a long period of time, I didn't feel satisfied at the job. It felt like the same thing everyday and I always felt frustrated. Some managers I felt comfortable to work with but some others just made me feel inferior. Workplace culture was very multicultural. Hardest part was definitely preparing big orders when we didn't have enough of what we needed. I'd say the most enjoyable part of my time there was that I made some friends along the way."
good,They are very friendly and easy to get along with but the training is OK but they will help you in anyway possible! they need to find some other people to train you to be honest.
good,Fresh Product Never Frozen. Learning each Position in order to Train.Qualified Crew. Communication With Crew and Management Open Door policy.
good,Enjoyed working here for the first couple of months. But later seen that a lot of biased choices were going on in the company. A lot of the people who worked in there were kin to each other. Whenever I had an issue with another employee and reported it to the manager multiple times nothing would happen. Because the co worker was some how related to another manager in the workplace. Plus most of the time I was supposed to get off at 8:00 and wouldn't end up leaving till 9:40. And I wouldn't get overtime. And other people would have ended up getting off way before me and at first it was okay. But then it started happening week after week month after month. And the management didn't care. So when I ended up putting my two weeks in she said I can just leave and not work my two weeks and was very billergernet towards me.
good,"It was a great experience. I learned a lot working there. The management was understanding and cooperative. A typical day at work was busy. We all worked very well with each other. Rarely any issues between the staff, itself. I learned how to socialize properly with the community. The management was understanding and encouraged us to work harder each day. One of the hardest part of the job was whenever a customer was extremely rude to you and continued to argue with you and you need to hold your tongue (which I did). The enjoyable part of the job was the many different stories customers were comfortable enough to tell you (especially the regulars.)"
good,"The typical day at Wendy's it got very busy around 11-4 . I Learned how to make nuggets right and how to Cook burgers . There where a couple good mangers there . I liked most of the coworkers and the hardest part of the job was cleaning the grills , the most enjoyable part of the job was grill"
good,Like any Fast Food place; the job is easy but can be stressful at times. They try and accommodate your availability as well as still be fully staffed. Not always possible of course. But they do try.
good,"The start of my shift was upbeat and fast paced, I learned about dealing with a large crew in a small spaced area. I got along well with my managers and co-workers and honestly did not find nothing about the position hard."
good,"Was a decent experience, worked part time for roughly 3 years,"
good,the average day was consistently busy with frequent issues having to be solved. taught me how to multitask while on the go and making sure the needs of both my crew and customers were taken care of
good,"This is actually a decent place to work and I was lucky enough to have an awesome district manager who looked out for his people. The balance was not good because we were already on a 50 hour work week. I think management clocks in and out now, but if they are still salaried, it kind of sucked because sometimes the work week is way longer than 50."
good,Steady work flow and constant interaction with several personalities. Constantly interacting with customers and building social relationships. Overall a good first step into the work environment.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The only complaint is the spit days off and the extreme demand for your time if you are management.
good,This was my very first job. I have been here for about a year and a half now and still never got my year raise. There are people there that have been there less then i have but have got their raises or have been offered manger positions.
good,"This Job is a good starter job and you meet a variety of people. On the other hand though there are some very ""Different"" people and management gives a lot of leeway."
good,"Wendy's was a enjoyable place to work at employees were nice as well as mangers. Clean environment, solid workers. If thee chance was given to me working there again we be an option, but it is not"
good,I was a manager. I would open and close the store. My team and I had regular customers and we would have their order ready before they order. They were nice and liked that we were fast and customer friendly.
good,"Hard Work, Nice People, Great Menu and products, Great tools for customer satisfaction measurement, tough job force in this area,reasonable benefits."
good,It was fast paced which can be good or bad depending on the type of person you are. I learned how to work with other people and how to communicate better with others. I liked some of the people but I did not show emotion or aggravated feelings if I was upset with others.
good,"they give schedules on time, they work well with you, while you are at work people stress you out more than anything ive ever had to deal with they make you feel pressured and the owners are kindof disrespectful"
good,I love the people I work for and with. The company's willingness to work with me on my schedule isnt as good as I would like.
good,"was a great place to work, the best job i ever had the people that worked there were great and the general manager there was the best i ever had hes my top reference we really got along well, mostly because i was an excellent employee."
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. Its a great job for high school students who are trying to get into the restaurant business. I was once a manager their which was honestly very stressful, plus they pay you liitle to complete a lot of job duties."
good,"It’s pretty slow in the morning, and it picks up around four. Lunch is really rapid, but it normally slows down. Then, it was just back to normal."
good,worked there for over 4 years and i learned and developped my skills. the team is very nice and close to each other. it is a fun place to work for and they care about the quality of their product and service. they help each crew to be as efficient as they can be and help them to be the best they could be.
good,"Its a good Company to work. the communication thru the managers can use alil work."
good,"i  had a difficult time here beause of a on the job injury. besides that i  had a peaceful time here. it was a really fast pace, but managable. Another reason why i left was because i lived very fare from the building."
good,"great employees, everyone gets along well. they all helped out when i was new and taught me new things. management is great, friendly and takes charge of any situation."
good,employees see how the food is prepared and make items off of a menu of the restaurant and give customers food in timely mannor
good,"Great beginner job, good for young adults and very flexible work schedules.  My supervisors we cool outgoing and understanding. It was pretty simple to do most of the work but sometimes the work could get tedious. I enjoyed working with the team and the shift I was on. For the most part, everyone was family."
good,good crew and management team we all work together to provide a safe fun place to work to excel in great customer service .just want my pay to reflect all i do for the company
good,This was my first job so i think it was a great job to start off at you learn how to become fast with cash and yu will get customers services experience.
good,"I enjoyed woring with friendly staff, management could have been better. Very flexible, work when you can or want too. Fast paced enviornment, and you have room to grow."
good,It's an ok place to work if u can get along with a manager that tells u to pick the pace up when it's busy. That's all I have to say
good,"I love working with people, I love teaching people as much as I know, I live learning as .much as I can!!! I love hospitality, overall treating people with warm welcoming and departure!!!! Cleaning, organizing, helping, being a leader!!!!"
good,"Everything was productive and i had to learn alot of  responsibility , managers were nice especially my co workers, i enjoy my jobs"
good,A fast-paced environment have to be on time for work coworkers are very friendly most of the managers are good just have to learn how to keep up with their time goals
good,"A very high paced working environment dealing with Company development, market planning, and developing and maintaining Franchisee relationships.  The most difficult part of the job was finding new locations for Company development within the NY DMA.  the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Wendy's Franchisees and assisting successful business people become more successful."
good,This was my first real job out of high school and it taught me a lot. This job taught me great customer skills and how to work well with others. The managers are very helpful and will not leave you to do a job you know nothing about.
good,I was in charge of taking the customers orders and making sure their food got to them in a timely matter. the most enjoyable part of this job is working with people
good,"The company focus is on  the employees, customers (franchisees), partners and the bottom line performance. "
good,"I have a great knowledge of networking, management, accounting.I love accounting and is familiar to basic concept very well"
good,"I learned a copious amount of information while being employed at Wendys. I learned how to manage and utilize my time efficiently. I have also became an extremely hard worker. It was a very busy and fast-paced workplace,but it keeps you focused on the tasks at hand. Very good management. Must be a team player."
good,I came in look at what I would be doing that day. I had a different task almost everyday. I did my task until it was time for me to get off. My co-workers were nice and the hardest part about working there were rude customers.
good,"they gave as many hours as you wanted, if you was willing to work hard they had a job for you. the management was acceptionable and understanding. i would suggest to younger people because it can get a little crazy."
good,"Everyday is different."
good,"The work day is set in a fast paced environment. It can be fun and also challenging at times. You will have good and bad days. I have learned to manage all different kinds of people, young,old and different races. How to multi task also. The hardest part of my day is when I am short staffed. training the employees and seeing there growth and development."
good,"As a crew member at Wendy's, you do a bit of everything. Cook the burgers, fry french fries and nuggets, wash the dishes, take out the trash, etc. But my position was mainly working the cash register. I was also in charge of making sure the dining room remained clean and stocked. At Wendy's, the old saying goes, ""If you work with the managers, they will work with you"". This was very true for me. The same can be said about my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was getting things done in a timely manner. I liked giving the customers their food, or a frosty, or make them laugh as I ring up their order."
good,I ran cashier helped with the cooks if they needed it i ran the friers did dishes i was also a crew leader in which i was getting experience for management an training i did paperwork and counted drawers ang safe money the bank...i really injoyed my time at Wendy's
good,"Overall nice place to work. Had a good experience while working there. My managers were very cool and helpful. I've learned how to make tea, and also new sandwiches."
good,"Wendys is the fastest Fast food chain in the industry. Wendys has been good to me over the years, but it is time for bigger and better things. My family needs more of my time and more money."
good,"on a normal shift you sweep , mop , take out garbage. During Peak Shifts You Serve and engage in conversation with guests to the store as you help them order food. Hardest part is dealing with confused or mislead guests. Easiest part about the work would be doing dishes or closing the store."
good,work was okay just someday when the costumers were out of hand. too many people were hired and there wasn't many hours to give to new people so it'll be useless to apply at times. employees would sometimes do what they want or throw a fit.
good,"I loved working here.  The boss was wonderful and great with the schedule -- meaning was very flexible and when we worked together she was really nice. best GM ive ever had, 'the 'district manager was not a nice person though"
good,"The job itself isn`t hard and it is a flexible work place, they give good hours and are willing to help people who need to change their schedules on the fly. It is a good first time employee type of environment."
good,"Fast and fun"
good,I enjoyed working at Dunkin Donuts.A typical day at work for me would be to work the front register and drive through window. I would also prepare customers coffee and food items. I would also make sure there was extra coffee and made sure it was always made fresh. I would also help with putting out all of the donuts making sure that they were fresh for the time frame. I would also take care of all o the trash cans and sweep and mop all areas.
good,"working for this industry has taught me a lot about quality and customer service. how to perform daily tasks such as cash management, customers and sales. working with Wendy's was a very big achievement for me. i loved working so long at one place."
good,"Good crew, customers are sweet and curtious, mangament are always there to answer your questions, the only thing that was the hardest was seeing the customers leave and do not come back until the next day."
good,"On a typical day, this job allowed me to interact with some amazing people, and do a service that brought smiles to faces. That would be the most enjoyable part. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with stressful customers, and managers who perform their duties poorly. Most of management were hard working, and on top of things. But, like everywhere, there were those who felt they did not need to do their jobs fully. I learned that despite those people, it is important to always strive to do your best. Not only does your best make you look like a good worker, but it makes your company look good when customers are happy."
good,"The job was a pretty decent job for a high schooler. The company gave us 28 hours a week and most of us made around $8.00 an hour. The only problems I had were the managers were just terrible, they treated their employees like crud and they had their favorites that they gave special privileges to. Some workers were aloud to be lazy and not do there job while on the clock but when others would do so they would get screamed at and written up. The managers really did not care about a person's education as much as the job. One time I came in late for something I had to do after school and the head manager told me that my job was more important than my education and I needed to focus only on my job. I was not going to let my job be my main focus considering I was at the top of my class. I was ranked 18 out of 350. My school work was more important than that job because my school work would ultimately determine my career and where I got to study."
good,"management listened to you in time of need. free drinks, food is good but a bit expensive. friendly co-workers great atmosphere, always doing something."
good,"It was ok to work there, It had plenty of ups and downs, they forget your school schedule alot, and it does get hard to make an actual schedule with them, management was ok, i enjoyed most my co-workers. The hardest part was the rush hour some customers could be really mean but you learn to tolerate and persevere through it, enjoyable part was the co-workers i had they made it enjoyable"
good,"At Wendy's I am being treated well by my managers and colleagues. The working environment is friendly and relaxed. I learnt many new areas such as sandwich cook, customer service at Wendy's."
good,"Working at Wendys for 3 years had a lot of fun. You will get to know different kinds of people from the customers and co workers. "
good,"At Wendy's it was a very fun and productive place, typically it was always a fast paste day and you really had to be on your feet to be able to move to different stations when needed. Management was always pretty helpful and always had a lot of patience with us. I think working at Wendy's the most valuable lesson that I learned was dealing with irate customers and how to present my self in a situation like that. Overall the most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-works we always found a way to help each other enjoy another day at work we became just like family and I think it is very important to have a connection like that with your co-workers."
good,"Fun place to work, Long crazy closing shift but it was a fun lace to be. The only draw back would be it was hard to move up. There were not that many Wendy's opening up so unless someone was leaving you couldn't move up"
good,"Delivers revenues and profits by developing, marketing, financing, and providing appealing restaurant service; managing staff – May work with IT Integrators to resolve issues encountered in producing reports or providing support to data stewards or data collectors  to ensure that tools and data structures provide the functionality required to perform day to day functions and data quality tasks Standard report creation"
good,Great place to start a job but not a career goal wise. but overall a nice place to work and start flexible hours and decent wages.
good,"i would usually have a four to five hour shift. I learned who the friendly employees were and who the not so friendly employees were. The management let certain people get away with things, but if another person did the same thing they would get into trouble for it. i think the customers were the most enjoyable part of my job. getting to interact with so many different people."
good,"on a typical day it was very busy, the co-workers were really nice and helpful, this job taught me to be better at team worker."
good,Work schedule worked well with me going to school. They also gave me good hours. Management was not were it should be. The work wasnt really challenging. Got a lot of experience handling raw meats.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty stressful at times. Wendy's is ALWAYS busy no matter what day or what time of day it is. For the most part, everyone gets along just fine and everyone has a good time together. We get the job done but have fun doing it. The management is pretty great. The company will work around any schedule you may have whether it be sports, school, or another job. The employees are great too. They always pull together and work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job, I would say, would be how busy we stay. Sometimes being understaffed, employees have to work multiple positions. We have to make sure we get the orders right and out in a timely manner, keep a smile on our faces and overall, keep the customers' happy all at the same time. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers' leave happy and interacting with you and the fact the managers can joke around with you but be serious at the same time and get the job done. Overall, Wendy's is a great place to work at but you have to be fast and get things done the right way."
good,"Wendy's has a great staff that is very fun, I love working with the customers and learning about the regular ones. They always try to keep an up beat happy place to work."
good,"A good place to get experience from. The management is good and very flexible with hours since I'm still a student. There are times that it is very stressful due to its fast food aspect but overall, it's a good starter job."
good,As a management team member you are always busy. The days are long. You are expected to be in the restaurant 45-50 hours a week. Motivating crew members is the most difficult part of the job.
good,"I enjoyed the environment in the mornings, easy to open, easy to prep, everyone is a team player. There were no hard parts except picking up slack from lazy employees and dealing with the complaining."
good,"Everyday at work was a little different I learned a lot about Wendys Culture of business and it was relatively fun, the only down side is the fact that while you work you are judged by customers and treated lowly by them when you make mistakes and its literally just food.. fast food. kind of ridiculous if you ask me,"
good,"Every day is different for me, sometimes is good and sometimes not so good. I've learned that not everyone is going to like you, but it is okay because at the end of the day you are yourself. Also, patience which is something very much needed at my job. The hardest part I think is watching people come and go and having to start over again with the training and adjustments. Watching people smile and complimenting you is probably the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was very routine, and fast pace.  From working at Wendy's I learned to always listen carefully to the request of the customer and that teamwork is ultimately the key to success.  The management at Wendy's I must admit did not always see eye to eye with the employees, but overall they were fair to each employee.  My co-workers at Wendy's were not always on the same page as I was when it came to doing their job effectively, some people liked to horse-play or lollygag.  The hardest part of the job at Wendy's was not getting stressed even if there was a really bad rush.  And the most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was feeling like you were a really important part of something."
good,"being a crew member at Wendy's was pretty fun, I made sandwiches, cooked on the grill, took orders etc., the manager that hired me was nice, and the evening shift co workers was fun and nice as well, I never worked the morning shift but I heard the morning co workers was all about drama, but Wendy's its self is a good organization to for, it isn't a career job but its something you can do while you're in school and need a little change."
good,"Depending on time of day If it was lunch time there was a rush hour starting from 11:30pm to maybe 1pm up to 2pm. If it was towards dinner time it wouldn't be busy at all it would just stay constant. I learned a lot, I got actually got better and faster at counting money learned how to do sandwiches and do grill."
good,A typical day at work for me at Wendyś would have to be coming in restocking after the morning crew. Taking peoples orders ensuring great and fast customer service. I learned how to make sandwiches and prepare food. The management was efficient. My coworkers were hard working always on top of everything. The hardest thing about the job would have to be is that sometimes the food would run out. The most enjoyable thing at work was being around a great group of people.
good,"The hardest part of the work day was before we opened at 10am."
good,"A typical day consisted of working in one or two of the various store positions. I was trained on and knew how to work every position in the store. The managers there were all understanding and fun to work with. My co-workers all made me feel welcome and like a member of a family. The hardest part of the job were the long hours, but the fantastic environment more than made up for it."
good,Working at Wendy's the hrs. were always 6 hrs. long and usually ill start out in the window doing the speaker and finishing preparing sandwiches. I worked there for over a year so I was kind of advanced and got slung around because of my skills.
good,"Working here was not particularly bad, the management was just horrible to its employees and did not care to much about anyone but themselves and mistreated employees"
good,"Enjoyed working with customers, crew and management. If you are a hard worker, dedicated and reliable you can advance fairly quickly. I was a housewife and mother, Wendy's always tried to make my schedule flexible to my needs and theirs."
good,Wendys is a great beginners job. it offers room for advancement if your willing to earn it. while it get a little frustrating at time the people are great and you learn customer service which is great in any line of work you will do in the future
good,working at waffle house and wendys i was required to keep the store and restrooms squeaky clean and presentable for customers to use comfortably.
good,"As a training store manager i was in charge of recruiting, training, management, budget compliance, and overall operation of the restaurant to ensure excellent customer service, high quality foods, crew development, food safety, store cleanliness, and maximum profitability"
good,Wendy's was a good place to work. Fast food just wasn't for me. The employees were great it was the managers who mad the job so stressful and not a happy place to work.
good,I enjoyed all the friendly vibes I received from my management and coworkers. The customers were vibrant so I got to really fit in around the store as well as making new friends and receiving gifts and compliments from customers.
good,Fun and positive work envioroment with a fun and supportive staff. Management was understanding and nice. The hardest part is dealing with unruly customers and pay isn't that great. The most enjoyable is learning new things and meeting new people including staff and customers.
good,"Working at wendys gave me a new work "
good,"Good learning opportunities on a basic level. Learned how to work equipment, prepare product, customer service and so much more."
good,enjoyed working here the crew members was nice and friendly and so was the mangers .I enjoyed my job and meeting new people while I was there.
good,"It was a decent job, it was pretty decent job but its pretty easy to deal with and not diffcult unless you have bad management or bad co workers. The hardest part of the job would be a rush during cashier jobs, because you can be overwhelmed with people stressing about food."
good,"c'est un travail qui faut être vite sur les pieds, car la caissière doit nettoyé la salle de mangé, servir les clients, aller chercher la nourriture et le mettre dans un sac."
good,"The job is not hard, some people are really rude there and don't appreciate your effort. but the co-workers are amazing ."
good,"Management awesome, staff awesome, always had a great time, worked around schedule constantly, looked forward to going to work."
good,"Working at wendy's enhanced my multi-tasking skills due to the high demand and short time in making food, and order taking. My co-workers were great and fun to work with."
good,A typical day working at wendy's would buy busy answering the head set to take orders. The hardest part is going fast so we can keep our time down. I have learned to multitask and take orders and pay out the next car to. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people i like.
good,"Most of my time there was rather enjoyable it was odd I never thought i would enjoy working there but i look back on all of my days there with fondness. Now i am not saying the work is easy and we had time to slack, but even while working hard i had a great time. The co workers (for the most part) are good natured good humored and concerned for one another. Over my 3 years there i actually felt like they were another family. albeit one that worked me hard and were not afraid to push me around if i slacked off."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendys, it was a fun friendly work environment. I learned a lot in the time that I was there and the management team as well as the co-workers felt more like family. The job wasnt so hard with the help of the managers and coworkers making sure you knew exactly what you were doing before you did it, as well as allowing you try out new things."
good,"Wendy's was a horrible place to work at. "
good,"This job was very fun to work in. The employees an managers were great, always working together an still making a way to have a good time doing it. This job is where i learn self control an patients for others an difficult things."
good,"The team was really strong and we all worked together, the day crew and night crew worked to keep the stores quality up. We call helped each other to make our work place fun."
good,"I worked here for years, mainly because of the people I worked with. My boss was great, albeit unfair at times regarding favoritism."
good,This Job is good for anyone that is good with serving and satisfying people. This job doesn't have benefits but it does have an flexible schedule. I enjoy this job for the most part
good,The atmosphere was great and I enjoyed my co-workers. The owners were great ladies but tended to let things slide with the teenagers and allowed a lot of insubordination.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the guest interaction and development and training of managers and crew. "
good,"friendly, but some employees were better suited for different areas of the workplace. Messed up orders every now and then"
good,A typical day at work is standing at the cash register and making peoples food. The hardest part about my job is that you have to do two or more things at once to get the job done. The enjoyable part about my job is when you see the customers smile because of you.
good,It was a great place to work. The only reason I'm looking for a new job is because the corrupte company sold to a new one an now they are dropping our hours. I am a single mother who loves to work an will work. I need job securty though I need hours an money to raise my children right. Wendy's is a great place still they just can't give me the hours or money I need to raise my 4 kids alone.
good,"Wendy's: I have learned so much at Wendy's, most of all customer service. I've learned how to train people and correct mistakes as soon as I see them. I've learned that with a positive attitude and patience, anyone can learn anything. We were short staffed the whole summer and really got our butts kicked, but we all learned a great deal of teamwork, and we all grew stronger and faster."
good,"Being a fast food worerk is a very hard job. Its not just flipping burgers all day! it involves listening to all types of people all day and making sure you get your job done and working as a team! The hardest part is keeping it together and working it out when people rush and mess up orders and this burger got sent out in the wrong bag or that car didn't fet the frosty they ordered! Everyday brings a new arrival of crazy, busy and hectic chaos. No day is the same as the one before."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. A typical day at Wendy's would include great customer service, critical thinking and staying on your feet. Co workers were extremely friendly."
good,"shift supervisor  ,enjoyed the people i worked with tremendously open store set up daily work plan, serviced customer needs planned breaks ,set up stations for expected business needs   I enjoyed it"
good,"My days are kept simple, get to work early or on time, wash my hands, greeted everyone, and do my job. When my manager would need me to do anything extra i would have no problem, including staying past my hours. Talking while on the job was kept to a minimum although i did find fun in everything i did. I keep cool with everyone i work with and could say they consider me a friend. The only hard part of my job is closing collect because of the mass amount of dishes i had to wash. Although in between washing dishes I would talk to customers which made it easier and helped improve my customer service."
good,"Pleasant working environment with team players, co-workers are pleasant, most enjoyable part of job meeting customers"
good,It is a nice place to work with very friendly coworkers.The pay was good considering the job.The only con I really had was it is super hot in the back.
good,"A typical day was spent manning multiple stations and cleaning.  The saying in management was ""If you have time to lean you have time to clean."" "
good,Good starting position but push forward after you get experience. Once you get the experience you need move on to bigger and better things.
good,I learned urgency and the need to listen closely to directions from taking customer orders. Handling multiple responsibilities around work environment.
good,"A positive place to work with good opportunities for growth. Great training provided through computer assistance. There is a very unique and universal training approach at Wendy's that is easy to follow, and everyone is trained the same way every person, every store. They waste nothing. Every part of each and every vegetable is used for one thing or another with almost zero waste."
good,Wendys had an enjoyable atmosphere with strong positive management that encouraged team work and good people skills. There was a lot of room for advancement. The hardest part of the job was meeting the speed requirements expected. Over all my employment with Wendys was challenging and fun.
good,I'd say that this place has a great atmosphere as far as a job goes. The people are all generally friendly even though it is a pretty fast paced job. You can meet some interesting people here and it's a good first time job experience if you've never worked before.
good,"Learned how to prepare food and interact with customers."
good,The coworkers here are nice and fun. The managers are understanding and do their jobs very well. My experience at wendys overall was good and enjoyable. The only problem was the hours and scheduling. But thats because the staff was full.
good,"Ok job. walked into work, usually very hot. Coworkers were nice, managers were ok. learned a lot about fast food. Most enjoyable part was seeing friends walk in, and making friends there."
good,how to prep food and how long it take for food to cook. love the crew members always have a smile. busy if a typical day.management is cool the keep you on your toes. the heat. its nothing enjoyable working fast food wen ur not in high school anymore.
good,Working at Wendy's helped me proceed my skills in customer service. It helped me get to know money better and how to make our customers enjoy their visit. I've learned a lot working at Wendy's. The hardest part of the job was when I had to complete approximately ten orders all by myself because we was short on staff. After having to handle that situation I've became better at my job. The most enjoyable part about working at Wendy's was to make sure that every customer that came in with a smile left with a smile.
good,Great company to work for but hard to manage when you cant pay more than minimum wage. Hours are ok and pay is fair Love the product we serve compared to others
good,"I have learned a lot from Wendys. they trained me very well and was able to move up in the company very fast. I gained new skills such as cashiering, grill and sandwich making, and management tasks. it was a fast pace work environment which I like."
good,"I loved my manager at Wendy's, Carlette. She was always great with me and very understanding ( I was pregnant at the time ) she would let me sit when needed and always gave me the time I needed for doctors appointments. It's a great place to work just some of my co-workers weren't too friendly."
good,"The day would start simple, barely any costumers. After 3:00 it would get very busy and we would have a little break for the busyness in between and during that break we would clean as much as we could. I learned how to multi task and how to communicate better with people. The managers were always very busy and would always ask us politely to do something or even help if we had our stations done. Co-worker would try to help as much as they could depending on how busy things got. the hardest part of the job was when it was very busy and we were trying to take costumers order mostly when their order was big and trying to make sure the other costumers got their order fast and trying to clean. the most enjoyable part was cleaning h=everything at the end of the night."
good,I enjoyed working here very much. I got to spend time with my co-workers outside of work sometimes and that was great. The management was fair and treated us fairly. There wasn't really any hard parts of this job it was all fairly easy. A typical day of work consisted of taking orders and getting/giving money. I always did something new every day it was always an adventure.
good,i enjoyed working here and being on the cashier. it would get boring though and i constantly checked the clock. the people were nice and i liked the atmosphere
good,"This was my first time working at a fast food restaurant so I learned a lot about the fast food industry. "
good,"I use to love to come to work and see my emplooyes exited to work with me didn't matter how bussy was."
good,got there turned on the grill and got preperations on the food cooked sometimes did dishes. I learned there every day opperations. manengent was good. I loved working with my co workers. keeping up was the hardest part. a good hard day.
good,My typical work day was very organized with wonderful coworkers that had a positive attitude. The management was very understanding of anything that could possibly go wrong. During my time at this job I learned different ways to talk to people and solve problems by looking at the situation in different ways. I would say the hardest part of this job was learning how to multi-task because it is not a skill that is taught most of the time.
good,"Worked here for six years while going to high school and college. Got along with coworkers and managers. Job was sometimes stressful, but fun at times too."
good,"good work ethics, fast pace, friendly environment, they tried to give me as many hours a week as possible even tho it is a fast food restaurant where the hours are limited even for the managers."
good,I had some good times here working with all of the people and some days were really busy and I was through with work before I knew it some days were so slow that it just dragged on by slowly
good,My day at Wendy's was never the same always something new and exciting. The food is great and my co-workers were even better. Management was always polite to staff and costumers. Didn't really have a hard part of the day and I just enjoyed the experience.
good,"I had great managers and associates, of course working in fast food can get aggravating, but there was also enjoyable times."
good,A day would start out with a huddle. You would be getting all of your employees together and on the same p-age. You then set up your shift and monitor all activity. You make sure all food safety and quality regulations are being followed and correct anything you see unfit. Making sure your shift runs well you would get it ready for the next manager and hand off the shift after a brief overview of the day with them.
good,"It was fairly easy, but could get pretty nerve wrecking at times. The management was good, and all of the coworkers got a long."
good,"I used to like to work at Wendy's because I learned great customer services. I learned on how to work as a team and build relationships with my employees.I also learned how to work under pressure and in a fast steady pace.The management in Wendy's wasn't really that bad.At my Wendy's it was always busy, we barely had slow days.I was really concentrated on my work for our customers can be satisfied on my services."
good,"Since I have recently begun working for Wendy's and therefore I wont be able to write that much. But it is surely a fun place to start, make connections with the locals and know about Canadian way of living and working. It is a fast food restaurant and the jobs are usually rotated one very day basis. What I liked so far is that the management is willing to teach everything to everyone."
good,"Working at Wendy's as a fry cook I am one of the most important part of the job, everyone orders french fries you would think. On weekdays will mainly be a lot of costumers, and there are certain times were we most expect costumers and we call it a ""Rush"" were the drive thru is rapidly flowing, and costumers steady approaching up front. It can be frustrating with a lot of pressure, and if you do one thing wrong during the rush, you would see how a little frustrating the manager would be. But being prepared is very important for that part, even though mistakes could be made, there's always a way to fix it. But it isn't difficult being quick with my hands and feet, I am prepared daily for a rush. There were times were I did made mistakes during a rush, but over weeks I've gotten it under some control. Sometimes you would have to be aware of other people's mistakes, therefore, they wouldn't know who made the mistake, and it could be blamed on you. Despite of that, I work at a good job, I work very well with employees and I am good with greeting new costumers because I love meeting new people and showing them how good I am at my job. We would get a lot of compliments for the things we do."
good,"Extensive paid training.  Worked with many different people and built lasting friendships.  Great place to work if one can work early, afternoon and late shifts."
good,"After clocking in, I would report to the manager on duty and find out my assigned job duties for the current shift. I learned how to properly cook and prepare food at the right temperature and also at what temperature all different types of food should be stored at. The management team did an excellent job at training empolyees of the establishment as well as congratulating employees when it was due. My co-workers all worked together well as a team and was able to pull together and accomplish any task given to us at that point in time. The hardest part of the job would had have to have been upsetting the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that we satisfied the customers and was able to deliver great customer service."
good,"I absolutely loved working there. Typical day of work would be coming in and getting ready, Finding out what position I would be on that day, and taking over someones position to allow them to go home. In my free time I would clean, or help another member of the team out. "
good,"Working at Wendy's can be a enjoyable experience if you let it. A normal day at work involves getting ready for the lunch/dinner rushes  working like crazy to make sure each customer gets taken care of then immediately afterwards once things slow down getting things cleaned up and ready for the next influx of customers."
good,fast food was a good experience for sales department. the customers was rude at some points
good,Well it was a good experience for me at work I had the most difficult job overall the day at work could range depending upon the manager on duty some co workers lacked drive and commitment the most enjoyable part was the people you never know what to expect customer and employees
good,Being a crew member so far is a learning experiecne.  There's always something to work on and learn. It's a fast-paced environment.  The hardest part of the job would be not eating all the food while you're working. The most enjoyable is the discount off of the food.
good,good place to work for good hours and management was fair I enjoyed my time working there
good,This place is hectic but fun to work for. Everyone was laid back and informal.
good,"taking orders cash drawers counted scheduling "
good,"This job was empowering and rewarding most of the time and very stressful. I worked very long work days and often took work home in order to meet deadline. Management was ruthless, uncaring and unappreciative of personal sacrifices to achieve company goals."
good,It was my 1st job I learned responsibility what to do and not to do it was like a family that works together to get what they need to get done done so the customers are happy
good,"I assisted the owner by performing light care tasks with supervision. I engaged and interacted with the children. I learned about the joy of caring for and teaching young children. I observed and learned to respond appropriately to the individualityand needs of the children. The hardest part of that job was going home. The most enjoyable part was my discovery of my passion for caring for, interacting with and teaching children."
good,"My days at Wendy's were a lot more pleasant than my days working at Burger King.  The speed of service was a lot smoother, plus there were more people working in one shift so that way one person isn't working harder than the next.  I learned how to work with a team, even if we don't particularly get along that well.  The hardest part of this job was having to deal with the attitudes of certain individuals.  I don't like when workers bring their problems into the workplace.  We didn't contribute to any of your problems so why take out your attitude on us?  The most enjoyable part of the job was building bonds with certain people. Wendy's was the place where I met all my best friends."
good,the mandating our duty hours the gave us 6 and sometime 4 hours in a day. enjoyable work because of my co. employee a friendly atmosphere and stress way when they got lot of guest. and i ove to deals and talking tog uest what the need on and it was good of me when i satisfy them.
good,"I came in the store, looked at the overall appearance, clocked in, "
good,"Teamwork"
good,"Fast moving environment, new products constantly filtered in"
good,"Every day was the same but different. Everyone worked hard and helped each other. "
good,Great day busy fast paced tema worked I enjoyed making the customers happy worst part rude customers
good,This was a great first start for me. The store manager always put his employees feelings into consideration.
good,"Some days are busier than others, you talk and interact with a lot of different people on a daily basis."
good,I love meeting new people and being able to help train others to become managers. The hardest part of the job is not allowing personal feelings to make business decisions.
good,"had to work at a fast pace,fun meeting people,great deals for customers etc."
good,"Learned to communicate, lead and work as a team. Learned to adapt with my co-workers to finish everything."
good,"I love to come to work!  Being there made it seem like without us, who would make your  fast food, no matter how little pay or bad managers, it made all the matter to the everyday customers.  We had holiday events in which the crew would participate as a whole store, managers too.  We had our good day, and our bad ones, but if it wasn't for Jimmy's Johns, we would still be making our customers happy!"
good,The employees care about the customers & genuinely want to help them. The management in tireless & always values serving the customer as it's first priority.
good,Good job easy but hours was cut more than half. Good management clean environment just not dependable.
good,"It wasn't that bad of a workplace environment. The coworkers were usually very friendly, easy to work with, and very helpful. I was at first put on the fryer cooking the french fries and chicken nuggets, I went on to learn how to cook the meat for sandwiches, and then learned how to take orders through the front register and for drive thru. It was an easy enough job on a regular basis, as long as there weren't customers who had troubles with their meals or the customers themselves weren't troublemakers. One of the parts of the job I did not enjoy were the management. Personality wise, the management was very friendly and easy to work with, just as a manager should. What was bad about them, was that higher management was constantly switching around managers from my restaurant and the others in my area. It made it hard to work with them as well as I could have, and it was usually very unexpected. I also had a hard time working out my scheduling, as I am a minor and shouldn't be working me for more than 20 hours a week.The manager I had when I left the company was scheduling me almost 40 hours a week every week, even during the school year. We also would get short-handed often, making it hard to ask for specific times. It was a good job for a first job as a student, but management was a pain to work with."
good,"During the day I made sandwiches and worked on the cash register. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment with supportive co-workers. The hardest part was keeping everything flowing as fast as I would like it to flow, but you could always share a laugh at the end of the day."
good,"Working in a quick service environment is extremely fast paced.  Multi tasking is a job requirement that somehow is always understated on the job description.  During the interview process I always made a point of putting that fact into the conversation multiple times."
good,My day would start 8-10 i worked lunch rush it could end  3-5 i work as order taker/grill guy Love working with my little co-woker family i've worked with the same people for 1 and half years and my most enjoyable part was getting everything done with good time and cleaning up
good,"Wendy's at night can vary day to day. One arrives and get's there assignment which can be working the grill, the sandwich line, taking orders, or coordinating (handing out the food). The managers make sure that you are adequately trained and up to speed on the station you are assigned. Working at the Payson Wendy's is okay. The employee's there don't really care about working there but they still make an effort to make the store run efficiently."
good,"It was the same routine everyday, I learned a lot about food safety,I moved up to management and became serv safe certified. I really enjoyed my co-workers and the customers."
good,Typical fast-food workplace. Nice co-workers. Wonderful management.
good,"It was fast food, the job was pretty standard. Lots of hard work and dealing with customers issues. The people i worked with were always fun people to be around the management less so but i would assume it's because they've been there for a long time."
good,I learned how to move very fast during lunch rush. The management was good and co-workers were a team player the hardest part of the job was closing the store the most enjoyable part of the job is going on lunch break.
good,Overall a great experience. Nice but strict managers a well kept environment.
good,I worked at Wendy's for a long time for being in school. The crew was  horrible (minor wise) the older the crew got the more serious the job was taken and the better the customers felt with coming in and ordering. Most f the business we got was after 7 when all our minors left. The drugs that came and went are horrible. There is still a ton of drug running going on with the companies crew members.
good,wendys taught me how to move swiftly & effectively. Fast food was a good start for me it taught me how to value the help of others & show me what team work really means.
good,"Wendy's is a good place to start out when you have little or no work experience.You can learn new things about yourself and others on this job; however, it's not something I would want to do long-term. "
good,"A typical day is just trying to get the food out the window in the time needed, making sure the order is correct and ready to be served. As long as you keep a smile on your face and be polite your customers will be happy."
good,Working in the fast food industry requires speed regardless were your working on the job. My co workers were fun to be around they were like a family. I learned something new daily customer service skills my speed overall being in a small area of space accomplishing tasks
good,A typical day at work was just like any fast-food place. The hardest part of the job was handling scheduling when associates call off. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that really enjoy their job.
good,"I starting working at Wendy's last June and loved working there. Starting out everything was new because it was my first job but my coworkers were very nice and encouraging. My manger worked with me and my busy schedule as a high school student. As an employee there I learned the grill, fry and sandwich positions. The hardest part about working there was lunch time when we would get really busy and that meant all employees had to work very fast to satisfy all customers in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was the new coworkers I made friends with and serving customers to make sure they were satisfied."
good,Good money for a younger person or a person looking for some extra income. Staff extremely nice and fun. Get your share of customers.
good,"As a shift supervisor I managed a crew of employees to prepare food and provide excellent customer service every day. I worked my way up an advancement ladder from a cashier to a shift supervisor. Upper management were extremely helpful and encouraging. The employees at Wendy's were very much like my family away from home. We had great teamwork. My favorite part of the job was my Wendy's family. The hardest part of my job was working around the grease all day, it was hot, and I smelled like grease which required a straight shot home to a hot shower."
good,the rush when you have when you have speed great customer service meeting new people and team work the hardest part keeping your anger under control from crazy people in the world when it come to customer service and what enjoy the most is benefits and keeping customer's happy
good,"Cook food, help customers, clean and close up."
good,"If you work in one of their stores that the gm isn't mirco-managing, then it can be fun, and lead to some opporunites in management."
good,"Busy, fun place to work"
good,fast paced environment with food made to order. the best part of this job was dealing with the public and teaching people. sometimes it would be a challenge to be at work more than at home.
good,the easy part of the job was just putting a smile on the customers face.
good,"I loved working at Wendy's.  I worked hard that is why I got promoted to a General Manager.  They taught me how to manage a crew and how to get things done on time.  My co-workers were great, I had a few that always had a smile on there face no matter what.  The hardest part of the job was when I was promoted, I had to learn new things that was the hard part learning these things on my own.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and the customers.  The customers would be so happy and excited to get good service."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing food, taking food orders and minor custodial work"
good,"Enjoyed working for Wendy's. My typical day at work depended on when and where I was scheduled. If in the mornings, I would prepare the day's menu. Stock what was needed to get through busy times and replenish as needed. If I was at the counter making sure the cash register is correct in the amount that it was issued at all times, take orders, and clean the lobby area. If in drive thru; I would take orders, make drinks, clean dishes, and help where I can to keep the timer at a minimum. Management kept employee moral up by always helping when and where they were needed, and kept up with training of themselves and others. The hardest part of the job was ""Children's Night"" where the kids menu was only $.99. When everyone was ordering 10-20 meals per car in drive thru. The most enjoyable was satisfying the customers. Having their meals correct, ready, and waiting before they can pay and seeing smiles on their faces as they drive off."
good,I really enjoyed working here. It was a fun place to work and I got plenty of hours. The only thing that was bad about it is if you were a good worker then they worked you to death! I was in school working every day going in from the time I got out of school until twelve at night. I started to get wore out and I said something to my boss and they started treating me bad because I couldn't keep up anymore.
good,Very busy and fast pace. I learned how to keep my station stocked at all times and how to operate a register. Management was overwhelming to work for. My co-workers were very polite and helpful when I needed help. My hardest part of my job was waiting on customers when your being trained on the register. They seem to not have patients when their hungry. Being with my co-workers.
good,constantly pushing sales while cutting the costs to run the business in order to maximize profits. constant training and coaching to maximize employee productivity and effectiveness.
good,For the most part days at work are not all that hard but it is a semi-fast paced job. This job taught me how to work with people a lot better than when I usually worked with people. The management team is fairly nice and usually do not give employee's and problems what so ever and do not yell or give any employee's a hard time for no reason what so ever. The co-workers are nice and easy to get a long with and are enjoyable to work with. The only part's of the job that can be hard and getting through a rush or being told to do multiple things while trying to keep a low service time during a rush. The most enjoyable part is probably closing time where it isn't all that busy and we have time to relax and get things done without interruptions.
good,I liked my coworkers and the fast paced work environment. There wasn't much of a chance of job advancement and I left for another job opportunity.
good,"I was a manager. My daily duties were helping customers with orders, and helping my team create a great and amazing environment."
good,i like it here wish i made more money for what i do.. but its fun  and very fast paced glad i have experience to work here
good,not the best job. a lot of favoritism and poor management. only had me working one day a week for 3-5 hours.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in being greeted by everyone and making sure your stations was fully stocked for the lunch rush and getting your tasks done before a specific time. i learned how to work at a very fast pace and how to work as a team player, as well as being able to work independently. The management was very helpful and knowledgeable about all there products and procedures and the companies standards. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the high volume of people that we would had to take orders for because we would get held back and couldn't always meet the customers needs as expected too. The most enjoyable part was working with great employees and management that was as their to help no matter what the situation was."
good,"cook hamburgers, make french fries, chicken, and chicken nuggets, clean grills, deep fryers and restaurant"
good,"Working at Wendy's I learned how to multitask , how to handle a unsatisfied customer , turning frowns upset down I also learned how to up sale and making customers feel right at home. Working at Wendy's was sometimes overwhelming. But I have mastered how to work well under pressure ,it has made me a hard worker . Working there was not just my workplace. It had became my second home for me.Over the course of time working for Wendy's  my co workers , and I became a family we all worked well as team. We all had excellent communication , making sure our work day ran smoothly .Also making sure our customers were getting the best of the best fast food experience."
good,"Enjoyed my managers and coworkers, and it was a very fast paced enviornment."
good,Worked here while in high school and learned a lot of people skills and teamwork skills that I still use today.  This job was a great stepping stone for me getting experience in the fast food industry.
good,"It's a fast food place - what more can I say? You clock in, feed the customers, clean up at the end of the night, and go home. Lather, rinse, repeat."
good,"Enjoyed working here, really fun. But too much work to be making only $7.25. A good starting job."
good,This job requires lots and lots of teamwork. The hardest part of the job was standing in the heat by the kitchen area.
good,"A typical day at work involves: customer service, counting and managing money, and maintaing a clean environment for everyone."
good,"I learned how to be a lead, since I had to show new people. My co-workers were just fun to work with.we would all help each other to get the job done."
good,I love working in the Restaurant Business. The days are all different and constantly filled with new challenges. My experience has allowed me to solve most any problem that arises and my age allows me to have well thought out and sound decisions.
good,"I did learn some management tips"
good,"My hours were just perfect so, I couldn't complain. It was a fun experience, but I personally was not a fan of working at a fast food place."
good,Wendy's was my first job and i learned that you always have to be on time and do your task and never get off task.
good,"Even though the job provided a low rate of pay, I enjoyed the people I worked with. I also loved the training and emphasis that Wendy's had regarding making a quality product, great customer service, and food safe handling."
good,I enjoyed my almost 2 years working at both Wendy's and TJ Maxx respectively. Both locations helped me balance my work and school schedules.
good,A typical day at work would include the team working together to accomplish awesome service in a good environment.
good,Overall was a ok job. Co workers and all the managers were great accept for one who had personal problems as well as favoritism towards certain female employees.
good,"Fun environment! Higher management was great to work for and advancement was there if you wanted it. I enjoyed running the restaurant, working with food/labor costs and budgets. The only real downside I had with the company is being the General Manager the store is ""your life"""
good,"Different shifts"
good,"it was a nice job "
good,"During my shift is easy it is towards the end that is hard. I learned how to better my peoples skills and make friends. Management was like family loving but strict. My co-workers made it easy to enjoy work, they were all paitent when I was in the process of learning new things. The hardest part of the job was wetting, scrubbing, sweeping, and mopping the floor, and getting off at two in the morning having to go to school the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck!"
good,Overall Wendy's is a good start job when you coming from high school and going to college.
good,"I worked for Wendy's for a good while and I enjoyed my job,,I learned so much about customer service, financials, technology, profit and loss spreadsheets,, how to control cost and labor.   I learned how to do schedules and hired and trained employees."
good,I got to work in a place where I learned new things and worked around people who make the work enviorment comfortable
good,"Typical day at work involves making sandwiches, cooking meat on the grill or chicken in the fryer, in addition to taking orders from customers. Hardest par of the job is being short handed when their is a rush. The most enjoyable is the co-workers."
good,"It was an ok job. I wanted it to be a little flexible, i've learned great leadership skills and how to work in a fast but steady pace."
good,"-taking orders/making sandwiches"
good,"This was my first job and the friends I made there are still some of my friends today. We celebrated each others graduations and new beginnings. The management was close to their crew, yet they still knew where to draw the line and manage us. When my mom passed they were right there by my side cooking food, comforting me, they even took up money to help my pay for costs. They granted me the time off I needed without and hesitations or confrontations. I would recommend this job to anyone and I would go back to it myself just for the enjoyment of it."
good,"The hours were great which made the pay great. The crew was fun, management was fun at times but there were times when it could have been better. I learned how to multitask and gained more experience in working with different ranges of customers. The hardest part of the job was trying not to get confused with the orders, especially on days when it was really busy, customers would be coming through the drive through as well as to the front register which made it overwhelming at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers as well as my managers,they always took the edge off of the day which made me feel more comfortable in the work place. Everyone had a decent personality and no one was rude or obnoxious."
good,"Making decision on a spur of the moment. Fast paced, up and down all day long."
good,"On a typical day, I ran planned and ran shifts, doubled as a crew member... (sometimes tripled) I did schedules, food orders, inventory, and basic cash handling and record keeping."
good,on a tipical day at work i would be at the cash register. With time i learned the prices of the food items. My co workers were all great people and everyone got along.
good,nice steady pace environment. You take on new things everyday learning a new task. management is always watching to make sure you don't mess up the hardest part was always making sure each customer left happy. my favorite part Was making the frosty's 
good,I loved working with the customers but most of my co workers couldn't keep home life and work separated. I learned a lot of new things about working in the food industries. theres plenty of space for advancements and achieving goal. 
good,"Fast food is a high stress, fast paced, and very competitive field. There are a lot of perks if you become manager but there are lots of pressures as well."
good,I wasn't as fast as they needed me to be in two months of working there and with very few hours.
good,"It was a great job for me to start me off. It was normally fast paced with many orders being made for lunch and dinner times. I would work drive-thru and up front on the regeristers taking orders. It was a simple taske and I was able to easily adjust to other positions if they needed. I learned how to stay positive thoughout the day and stay focused on my goals on maintaining cleanliness and order in my position. My co-workers have never been a problem for me while working. They were fun and just as hard working. They also taught me how to communicate partially in Spanish. My management was also very great! They were direct with what they wanted/needed and not cruel to me in the slightest. They were respectful and I appreciated having them as my management. The hardest part of my job is actually trying to close the store on time every night.  There was always a midnight rush and sometimes we were overstaffed mid-day which made it a hassel at night.  I had to work harder to get the store closed on time. However, while the closing was hard at time it really didn't bother me much. It was a very simple job and I loved working there due to the fact that I never had a boring day."
good,"A typical day starts off with pre-rush stocking and preparing foods for when the first guests come in.  The management at my current place of employment is wonderful, fair, and involved.  Most of the coworkers get along well and work as a team."

good,"i would come in and get right to work, i was already in my uniform so i didnt have to change. my co-worker were very frindly people i enjoyed working with all of them everyday. as far as the manager goes i didnt like sometimes how she would run the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to arrive and immediately get started with taking orders and filling those orders. I learned how to be more efficient in taking my orders. I really like all of my managers except for one because she was a bit hypocritical. I was friends with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the lunch rush, trying to be fast and to keep up was really difficult.

Management are very helpful. co-worker are fun people to work with they pull together and it the work done. hardest part of the job is when you short of employees. most enjoyable part is working with the people that i did work with.
good,"For myself, a typical day at work consists of being on cash, whether it be on drive thru or on at the counter inside of the restaurant. Regardless of which cash register I am in charge of it is very fast paced and requires lots of multitasking."
good,Was my first job experince and I really learned alot about values and customer service.
good,This was a fast pace position but I was never bored and I could have learned something everyday. I learned how to work as a team with other employees. The hardest part of the job was that it was really fast but that would keep me from doing nothing. I enjoyed working as a team with the other employees.
good,"great people, jobs were divided equally and mangements honest and fair."
good,Fun atmosphere
good,Management was awesome and mostly easy going. They were flexible and would work around your schedule when needed. There was a good atmosphere there that didn't make you completely hate your job.
good,"Good job for a 16 year old just joining the work force. Co workers were great. Learned food prep, cash register, dish washing. Can get really busy, may be stressful for some."
good,"I loved it when I worked here. I love to interact with people in a day to day basis. I learned a lot of time management and also more customer-worker relationships. Management wasn't to tight. They were as flexible as needed. A lot of drama between the co-workers, but I'm 22 going on 23, I don't need that and don't look for it or add to it."
good,"Got to be on the go , fufilling orders learning how to cope with customers and co-workers are always there too help , hardest is when there is alot of customers , enjoyable the foood discounts"
good,"Was a new and delightful experience other then the late nights, Managers were good at working together with the workers. co-workers were funny and easy to get along with. it was hard learning all the aspects of the company."
good,"I was given many opportunities to advance and stretch myself. The adoption benefits are #1 but other benefits are substandard. I would still be with the company had they not moved the headquarters back to their original home in Dublin, OH."
good,"Wendy's is awesome. The people are great, managment is wonderful."
good,A good part-time job. very flexible hours could be fit around your schedule. Not as unenjoyable as I expected. don't expect a huge paycheck though- minimum wage.
good,I just started but the people seem really helpful. So far iv'e learned how to make the signet sandwich's and the amazing fries. I was complimented on my vacuuming skills and asked to cover someone else's shift.
good,this job started my life at becoming the person i am today and tought me alot about working with people and making a good name for my self and i loved it
good,Wendy's is one of my most memorable jobs. fantastic experience always something to be learned. The other employees are always willing to help and the manager is patient and always showing great customer service.
good,wendys is a nice place to work at they help you as much as possible. but at the same time you work with alot of teenagers so there is alot of drama.
good,"fun place to work geared more toward younger people, but overall good."
good,This is a minnium wage partime job that wokks well with students.
good,"It was my first job so everything was a learning experience. Working at a fast food restaurant was a good place to start. I learned how to get things done under pressure and how to satisfy my customers with the products I made. When I was Front-line prep, I had to prepare the restaurant before opening. From cleaning the oven, cutting tomatoes, preparing sandwich stations, and cleaning the Frostee machines and make the Frostees. Once customers came from the doors, I would make sandwiches, salads, potatoes for them. Since work was in my area, many people from school would work there. It was a surprise to see them working at the same place as me. Though, the place was over-staffed so getting shifts was the hardest part. Eventually, I had to leave due to the lack of shifts."
good,"going to work with a smile, dedicated co-workers. management team didn't always agree."
good,learning new things and working with all kind of people im an people person willing to do all i can do im an honest and hard worker
good,I learned how to do all the positions in the closing process and how to run a shift with a few people. I am also bond-able because I was put in charge of the late night tills and making sure that they were balanced for the morning crew. The hardest part of the job was when we received a lot of customers in line and had to push out fresh product for their eating pleasure.
good,"A typical day at work would include greeting all your co-workers & management, counting your register or preparing your station for your shift. I learned at Wendy's International that their is a wide range of people and cultures in this world and it's up to you to learn how to deal and communicate with such people. One thing i can say about management is that none are the same. Each run there shifts very differently and again you have to learn how to deal and work with them. As far as my co-workers go not everyone got along but if your smart enough you won't get caught up in the hype and learn to go to work and do what is expected and that is work and try your best to give the best customer service you ever had to give. The hardest part of the job would be having to work with people who really did not want to be there and simply just got through day complaining. Meeting new people and networking would definantly have to be the most enjoyable part of the day. If i had to do it all over again i definantly would but not for as long as i did."
good,"Great environment, great people, good quality food. Awesome management, works with your hours. Always meeting new people who come through the doors."
good,making food meeting new people happy to be at work bouns money we made
good,"It is very busy day most days, I learn how to interact with customers and employees better. Some of the manager was understanding and willing to work with you, most of the co-workers was fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was to make sure people did all the stocking they was suppose to do. The best part of the job was meeting new people."
good,good work envirnment employees were good to work with and hours wasnt that bad
good,"I was young n jus becoming independant, enjoyed my cashier job at Wendy's Restaurant, loved the lunch breaks n working with friends"
good,"cleaned, re-stock, helped co-workers"
good,I love the togetherness that they had. The only thing I didn't like was I did get enough hrs to make enough money to support my children.
good,show up on time try to achive day goals. I learned how to deal with customes. the management is good at my location. my co workers are good to work with. the hardest part is working days and nights in the same week.the most enjoyable part is meeting people.
good,taking customers orders
good,"I was basically everywhere in this place. Cashier, drive thru, salads, sandwich maker. It was fun. Coworkers were friendly. Liked my managers. Hardest part was dealing with mean customers. Enjoyable part was being with my friends/coworkers. I left their because I was offered the job at Russell Stover."
good,I liked this job actually. I mean i was young and jus starting to enjoy responsibility but then again i wasnt all that ready when i was employeed here. Would deffinately love another shot.
good,Offer a great costumer
good,"productive place,fun place to work,great working with others."
good,"We had a team, the same people worked together almost every night, and the same customers came in every day. I loved my manager, but not the assistant manager! My co-workers were awesome! We always made work fun! The hardest part of the job was doing inventory, the most enjoyable part was working with such good people!"
good,"The positions i worked where the sandwich station, grill front and back window, and i also ran the front lobby. At this job i learned how to complete many tasks at one while doing it quick and neat. The co- workers and managers where allot of fun to work with and they all where great workers."
good,"i enjoyed working at wendys, typical day getting up preping the food throughout the day more cooking cleaning,"
good,was a shift manager and was trying to move up higher to management but had to move out of state
good,"I worked Mon,Tue, Thu, Sat, and Sun. I learned many things how to respect customers what to do to help them and make friends also."
good,Overall there isn't much to say for it was exactly what to expect from there. Easy to work with everyone for it was based off a family feeling when working there as if I had them as my home away from home. Definitely what more work places need.
good,"Cooking and taking orders. Management was great, co workers where friendly and I enjoyed working the drive thru."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wendy's and have no complaints about the job or company. I only left cause I received a job that paid more.
good,This was my first job and I enjoyed it. The management however need to be reviewed more offen then they were during my time.
good,Running a restaurant affords for daily changing situations. I learned a lot of all aspects of running a restaurant. A fun and busy atmosphere to be a part of. Counceling or termination are a part of the job that was necessary but not pleasant.
good,Wendy's has a very good set of moral codes that all employees are taught at the start of work. It made the work place a nice and busy place to be.
good,"Its one of those jobs that are simple and yet too simple. I enjoyed the good days but when the bad days came around, days seemed longer. Great job to start off."
good,the review for this company is average it is a corporate business so there is alot of demand that goes with that and attitude which could have been displayed a different way for a fast food resturant
good,I only worked part time but Wendys was a very respectable place. If i needed time off they let me have it and I was pregnant and if I was having difficulties they made my job easier and let me go home if needed and wasnt busy.
good,"A fast food restaurant, flexible hours, good pay raise rate, friendly environment"
good,"I really enjoyed my career, but there was no room for advancement and the benefits were not great."
good,"Management there is really sweet and kind and they pay well for a fast food can they also try to match your desired hours and availability, you get meal discounts and sometimes free food."
good,The only place  ive every work in the restaurant business and it paid better than most labour jobs ive had. 13 dollars  an hour. I would take  that back in a heartbeat
good,"The store that I work at has it's up and downs daily, I love working for the company but the store I have tried to clean up some of the things that go on but most times they are out of my control. I have taken the necessary steps to advanced and create a better work atmosphere but as employees come in the store falls. I am all for positivism and giving second chances but this store is at a loss anymore. I want to enjoy coming to work and serving others. I want to feel appreciated and make others happy with my skills and my attitude. It what I have in life and want to go further in this career."
good,The company isn't bad itself you have to see it for your self as far as corporate areas and franchise locations. The most important is keeping orders fresh and given with love
good,The food and the location are great. This is a great community spot for kids and their parents. It is also a hot spot for tourist and school busses. The people that work there are very diverse. There are many nationalities included. I think that I would of been happier in a management position but alas only little people positions were available.
good,Good working environment. Always had stuff done on time and customers were always happy when they left. Managers were always kind and helpful  and if you needed a day off they gave you
good,Most hours up for grabs I take them but OT is also given which is always a plus. I feel I belong and am appreciated for the efforts I put in and all my time towards the job is valued.
good,"Great place to work especially for a starter job. Consistency is key when working, also time management. A great deal of patience is needed with it being fast food."
good,"The fact that everyone could get along, and there was hardly any drama there. It was constantly busy so therefore the hours I was working would go by faster"
good,"This was my 1st real job. It was pretty good working there. "
good,"I normally came in at 11pm to 7am by making sure areas in the kitchen and out in the dining areas were cleaned and stocked up, trash being taken out, etc."
good,Wendy’s has taught me a lot about customer service. I am more on the shy side but after working there I am a lot better about talking with guest and starting a conversation rather than just taking their orders. I used to be slow at counting change but my money skills has gotten a lot better.
good,The owner genuinely cares for his employees and their needs within reason. If you need help with rent or bills or even just groceries the owner is willing to help as long as you pay him back.
good,Working fast food is stressful but I worked with a lot of great people so it wasn't as bad. I loved my favorite manager especially and we really felt like a family.
good,I was a cook and i also worked on the register taking people orders. I refilled the soda machines and walked around and made sure everything was always clean
good,"Easy work but need to , pay every two weeks, hours very I didn't like that but it was easy great place to start off for a side job maybe... I wouldn't go back to the one I worked at"
good,Good place to work to start good people to work around easy to learn new things you can definitely depend on ur managers there and every one there is there for each other
good,I all it was a satisfying experience. I learned some things that carried over into other aspects of life. It was also a very steady source of income !
good,"-I have learned that people are always going to be rude even if  you are ---kind and trying to help them."
good,"I was a contractor so I had to ""hit the ground running"".  I only had 40 hours per week to work where full-time colleagues had the ability to work from home (remotely)."
good,Enjoy working for Wendy’s been working for mentor Wendy’s for 2 months now hopefully continue to work for Wendy’s my managers are great and so are my crew members
good,It showed me costumer service work experience. Teamwork is vital to this job and we all work to satisfy every costumer. The management team helps every employee and understands their needs.
good,When working at Wendy's you have to maintain the job an foucs on the job .. make sure you doing your job well in make sure the customer is happy .. also working well with your team members at all times helping one another out
good,This was my first job in high school. I work all the way through high school. Great place to work during school. Flexible and reliable. They put customers first
good,"I enjoy going into work most of the time. I feel that I'm needed. The company works around my schedule. The manager's make sure that you are trained for the position you are working. If you need help, other staff are very helpful."
good,"Great place to start work at, to gain experience for future possibilities. Take this as a stepping stone to build your character in the work force. Not recommended as a career."
good,Working here taught me a lot about fast foods an customer service. Being here an working with college kids can teach you patience something I didn’t have before working there
good,"A typical day can be very fast paced especially in the morning times around 11am to 2pm sometimes even till 3pm. Management is very kind as you get your work done, the most enjoyable part is when a customer thanks you or gives you a nice review."
good,It would be a nice starting job and this job has a lot of customer interaction. A typical day of work there is stocking when you don't have customers and helping out with what other crew members need done.
good,"Lunch and dinner rushes were the very exhausting and extremely fast paced. Having good coworkers who help out and pick up the slack is so important! "
good,It was ok working there it's just the ppl. Good company to work for if that's what you are willing to do. Besides Wendy's is a company. The managers are great respectful
good,"I worked for this employer for 5 years, I worked more than was needed and put the company first, before my own child.  I missed out on huge milestones with my son and always had to choose to stay employed or him.  Due to being a single mother, I had to choose staying employed.  When the time came for me to choose my son, I felt a slight hostility towards me for having to quit so suddenly due to serious circumstances having to do with my son."
good,i wouldnt recomend staying in there for too long there will always be better jobs and opportunities for everyone fast food is fun at a point until you are the problem solver for everything you do within your work place
good,"The job itself had many stressful days, as will any job, but overall it's a great way to learn customer service, as well as team work, multitasking, and moving in a fast paced manner. The pay isn't great for someone with bills to pay, but there are some opportunities for raises, depending on your management of course."
good,"Their management was not up to par, some was not experience in that field of work even the gm really didnt know how to run the store and she barely worked her shift or comeon the floor to hep when needed, attuitde was bad"
good,If your looking for fast pace you have it here. 2million dollar store. The company is fair and the job is rewarding. This wendys is considered the BEAST. It is yet the beast can be concord.
good,"I ran the register, cook and customer services. Time went by really fast. Restock freezer, unloading of the truck. Great summer job for teens. Got a chance to really learn a few things."
good,"good, need more faster when you work in Wendy's. when you work in Wendy's all crew as a team and family. its hard some times specially when busy time.. but \enjoy"
good,I liked working here and I did a lot of training and helping management in order to achieve goals set out by Store and District managers.  I loved that they entrusted me to help in grooming new hires into becoming valuable crew members
good,Wendy's was overall a good company to work for albeit the pay was not what I had expected as a shift supervisor. That to me is the only downside for the job.
good,"Good experience, good people, easy to talk to management, hours are easy to come by if you show your interested in them and show you want to be there to help the company"
good,The management process for wendy's is really complicated so it's hard for them to keep managers and promote from within. The managers that are hired rarely care about the other employees
good,"Wendy's was a pretty unprofessional place to work, great for a first job or if you're desperate enough for a job. Most managers were unprofessional and immature."
good,"Unfortunately the store I worked in didn’t give ft to crew members. Fun place to work, great place for someone looking for first job or as a second job."
good,"At Wendy's there was never a dull moment, it was frustrating and challenging at the same time. There was  always something to keep your self busy! If this is what you may want in life this is the job for you!"
good,Worked for many different locations for many years. Good complany culture and decent benefits. 50 hours/week work can be tiring if shifts aren't fairly regular. Always had good co-workers though.
good,When you are their working of course it’s a job but remember you are all a team. Try not to start your day with your attention on negativity it will affect your entire day. If you’re experiencing problems at home be open and honest with your manager. Also if you have any issues with staff always report to your boss. If matters are taken into your own hands things could play out differently then you expect there will be people working all ages
good,"Most days it was busy but it was okay to handle. I learned a lot about customer service daily. Mangers usually knew what to do and were very helpful and nice. The culture was positive, everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was probably a rush and most enjoyable was the people i worked with and completing what i had to do."
good,"I believe that their standards are extremely high, as they should be in a restaurant. It is a very clean place to work and you are able to stay busy all the time."
good,"Fui cajero durante 2 meses, tuve que renunciar por temas de estudio pero mi jefa no quería que me fuera por la buena atención que brindo"
good,This company definitely teaches you how to be very good at customer service and I would definitely recommend this job as a start to learn how to handle customers in every aspect
good,Nice enviorment to work in but as far as the pay its not enough for u to make a career out of it most definitely lol but the overall exsperience its worth it
good,"A typical day at work is okay, nothing too exciting. During the morning is I  prepare the produce that we need for the day. During lunch is when it gets busy. I learned to multitask more and working with others. The management was great, the managers rated me highly."
good,"The environment is really small to get around but if you get past it the employees are very nice and team work us key. It is fast paste at time during rush hours but everyone has a part to get food ready, paid and out to costumers. Best part of the job is meeting wonderful people everyday."
good,"Working at Wendy's was great as a whole. I loved my team members and my managers, they were always helpful, understanding, and considerate. I learned how to be calm and respectful when it came to customers and their attitudes. We made the work place fun, it was hard some days but the motivation and love never stopped."
good,"Great starter job for everyone, I would 100% recommend this to anyone, sometimes the people will take it out of you, but your coworkers make it worth while working there."
good,I feel like some Wendy’s will be helpful to you but others won’t be . A lot of people don’t take their job serious. I would recommend if your just trying to make money.
good,"if you are a student and you just needed a little money wendy's in Texas will be a good place to work out, they're  really fair when it comes to paying you"
good,"I was fired for unfair reasons and didnt give me a fair reason why i was getting fired. I felt uncomfortable my laat month there."
good,I was grill cook rush hour i have to work the fryer for fried food and the grill at the same time cooking meet as customers order and making sure its all fresh and run to the back freezer and pack more food in front freezer so when we run out
good,I had never worked fast food before. Working here was fun and very fast which i got very used to. I enjoyed working the drive throught window. The staff was very friendly and excepted me right into the family.
good,"I thought working at Wendy’s would be difficult but it wasn’t. I had a great work experience, i made friends out of my coworkers. The managers although determined to ensure we maintained our roles and kept up to expectations were really cool. I achieved my goal of opening up and talking to people and getting a great experience out of my first job."
good,"First job and very pleasant and friendly place to work for."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's included:Washing dishes while i work on the first cash register. When i hear the signal that the customer is ready to pay for their food;i put washing dishes on hold until i collect the customers money,then continue washing dishes. Clean store an take out trash as needed. Clean floors at end of shift. An i also worked on the grill at times for extra hours,cooking burgers."
good,"Our store managers all really held up the wendy’s Values of customer always comes first, and providing good experience for them. Customer service was a priority here and I really take pride in that. Overall I enjoy the work culture, people are nice and supportive and you all work together to get things done. Very interactive and fast paced job. I never pegged myself as being good under pressure but working here has shown me just how capable and calm I am and so if you have doubts, just try it anyways you never know. The managers and workers are all supportive. I do have complaints though, the training is not great, they mostly let you learn yourself and I got written up before as a result of not knowing what to do. They also are not well organized, and getting quality time to communicate with the managers is rare. Trying to call in on the phone is impossible to reach them."
good,"great place to learn how to work, but sadly if you are hired as a parttime employee they will schedule you 39 and a half hours a week, so you still count as a parttime but in reality you are actually working full time, but you don't get any benefits, the individual employees are absolutely a blast to work with though."
good,"I would not recommend settling in and making it your career, but Wendy's is a great place to learn a good work ethic and gain experience with cash and with working as a team."
good,"it can get very stressful from the customers to co-workers not showing up. But, the people that do work with you make it more fun. It also depends if you learned how to do all positions at wendys or not if you go fast-paced. yes all fast food restaurants are fast-paced but i find it more fast-paced when you know everything. The reason i say this is because you get moved constantly since certain people only know how to do certain things. That means if you are at the spot they know you are gonna get moved somewhere else."
good,At this job I would prepare the food. Before being trained on make product I did not think I was going to get the hang of it. After learning how to do other things besides make product was great as well.
good,"Typical day is prep produce for salads. Make salads.Prep Bacon. Make cookies. Prep sauces,other produce,burgers & chicken for opening. Stock your work station. Clean."
good,The job got stressful sometimes (which is to be expected at any job) but it was overall a fun and positive place to work. My co-workers were friendly to me and I got along well with management.
good,it was a fun place to work for. people there were nice and fun to hang with on the down time you had. always kept busy there. the management was great.
good,It’s a great work environment great people and pretty solid work and the management is pretty good and is helpful with work and life itself honestly the people you work with make the job worth it
good,"Nice place to work and enjoy the crew there. great hours, very flexible with the hours. give me time to enjoy my family, the atmosphere is nice to work."
good,"Overall a great experience, management was very micromanaging, but that was expected when starting out. Overall position was straight-forward, and allowed for a pleasant interaction between coworkers and customers."
good,"Wendy's helped me get by in high school, but it became increasingly difficult for me to find rides there and back. I got along pretty well with the other employees there and the managers were alright too. The work experience is very fast paced but it gets easier when you get the hang of everything."
good,"It's my first job and the locals around aren't too toxic."
good,"good work environment, responsibility, teamwork, good work system, clean and organized areas, good customer service, friendly and friendly staff to any questions from customers."
good,"Better than working for McDonald’s/unemployed . Worse than an office job. ‘Nuff said."
good,"Working at Wendy’s has been quite  extraordinary. The place has taught me so much in a little time. New communication skills were earned even in the first week of working, this has most definitely helped me make me into the person I am today."
good,Bad management. Some of the managers need better training. Need to employ better employees. Fun work environment. Half off meals for employees. The breaks were fine.
good,"I really like it as my first job in United States of America, I learned a lot and   I was there just for a short period of time. Great experience of work."
good,"Like any branch of a company, the culture could differ. I was lucky to work on a Wendy's where mostly everyone was friendly towards myself. However, the benefits of working at Wendy's aren't so great.  Most of the benefits are given to full-timers, but I don't know what they are. For a part-timer, the main benefits are the salary and the food discount. However, the discount is only during your shift. In my opinion, it's a good place to start, but not survive."
good,"It was my first job so of course I loved it at the moment. But, afterwhile I wanted to have something different and more engaging. I would have still been employed but the general manager and I didn't quite get along."
good,"I would take customers order, ensure the food is prepared correctly and organize the store. I occosionally was responsible for tracking inventory of the store."
good,"I was able to build customer service skills. I learned how to effectively work in a team. I developed skills in quick, but efficient service. Practiced food safety on a day to day basis."
good,"Working at Wendy's was fun, to be a first time experience. I enjoyed the people there I worked with and the mangers. Everybody was cool and fun to work with. This location was always busy so there was no free time, nothing but fast pace work."
good,The only reason why I am looking to leave is due to wanting to try something new. I was always offered to move up if I wanted to. I just feel that my time here has come to an end and I'm ready to start a new journey
good,The coworkers made it more fun but there were days when it was super busy and then some where it was dead. Something new happened every day. I miss working there and I would recommend it for a person
good,"This is a short term job. After 1.5 years of work it got very annoying and tedious. The first few months were very fun though. Although, after a while, coworkers leave and find better jobs which makes the work environment more boring."
good,Exceptional guest service. I'd say perfect for those just starting up or those who are fast food veterans. even for a smaller store we managed to maintain the facility as best we could so it would be approved by the guests!
good,The job isn't really that hard if anything it's the customers that make it a pain in the butt. I was there for 5years moved up the latter very quickly since I can pick up one skills easily. They help coach you through tough situations and depending on your team they will understand life struggles. Just have to have awesome multitasking and communication skills to work here plus a good attitude.
good,"Wendy’s is a good first job to start off with, but I would like new experiences although my co workers are very nice and make the place fun to work at."
good,The environment for the most part is friendly. Everyone is like family. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting positive responses from customers.
good,I enjoyed everyone that worked there until some of the new people hired were toxic and unpleasant towards me. I couldn't work a place that hired the kind of people that would toss around nasty comments and allow that to continue.
good,I liked it I lived in Oklahoma only for a short time then moved back home to California I liked working there cause I got to meet all sorts of people sometimes it was entertaining my co workers made it fun also my managers were friendly and all around a good environment
good,"it can be difficult, but working at Wendy's definitely taught me a log about working. Managers are strict when necessary but usually pretty understanding. The only true cons is benefits and lack of paid time off/overtime. you earn your paid time off hours every few hours you work."
good,"This was my first job, and when i started the management was very poor. I left after around a year, and then came back a few months later after realizing the management had changed. The culture, now, is good and welcoming to new employees. They train well and as your skills progress with them, the more difficult positions they place you on. It isn't a very difficult job, but as a starting job it was good experience"
good,My day at work consisted of me cooking and making sandwiches also helping other co workers with whatever they needed help with also my job consisted of me also to maintain a clean work station.
good,"I want to preface this by saying, this is not a full time job that you will have to pay bills. Minimum wage is not a living wage, but as a starting job it's about as good as you can get. The people working with you are all in the same boat, and are willing to help you out when you need it. We all have our share of bad customers, bad work days, and times where everything doesn't feel right. But we stick by each other, and when times get tough we buckle down and try to weather it together. It's a good way to know what you don't want to do for the rest of your life, but you at the very least you know that the people around you are not gonna let you sink all on your own."
good,"Quick pace , sometimes crowded , multi-tasking is a mandatory practice, always follow the directions of the manager and finally be on time for work.$$"
good,It was a fun job the people were great the work wasn't too hard. the pay was lacking but it was a fast food job so i can't really complain. The night manager was amazing super funny girl.
good,"One of the jobs I actually enjoyed going into and leaving with a smile at every shift. I learned many things when I first started, everyone around there just spreads positive vibes."
good,Wendy's was my first real job. It was fun to work at and I got to work with people my own age. It taught me a lot about customer service. I would for sure recommend it to someone.
good,"This is great for your first job, easy to learn, non competitive, almost guaranteed hours. You don’t advance much unless a lot of employees quit. A lot of managers don’t follow proper code."
good,"Wendy's is a good place to work if it's one of your first jobs, the people are nice and the hours are very flexible. The pay is good for a beginning job but I wouldn't be able to live off of it. You usually get stuck on one position the whole time."
good,I would get like two days off which was ok to me . Sometimes we would be able to work as a team and other times there would be conflict and sometimes the people who worked with me did not know anything really about food service the health and safety and sanitation . For example you can't wear fake nails in food service but I see it all the time .
good,"It was competitive and kinda stressful, but we had great team work and helped each other out if we needed help. It was busy but we work together and have everything under control while under pressure"
good,if you have good work ethic and you're willing to work hard and be casual/professional with crew and customers then its a good place to work. would recommend it for teens/college students.
good,"I run the store in  morning or evening  shift as per schedule. "
good,For the most part this company ensures great customer service.  Room for advancement is always there and the training is for the most part there.  While in management you do have the opportunity to make sure that contact with hire ups is always there for help and questions.  The hardest part of this job is staffing. This job for the most part is a good job to have and a great career in management.
good,"Of everything that I learned in my position at Wendy's is that the only way to accomplish what you set out to do is to do it without cutting corners.  I acquired, what I would consider to be, amazing management skills and tools for implementing those skills."
good,"It was my first job and I appreciated the experience. At Wendy’s  is where I learned to have great customer service, the ability to multi task, to work in a fast paced environment  and patience. I would definitely recommend this position for a first job."
good,Wendy's is crucial on quickness. Employees should be able to handle extremely pressured situations that can not result in breakdowns. It is very hands on and independent work (sometimes). Teamwork is also highly encouraged
good,"I was still a student and fast food is definitely not for everyone. But it was a nice place to work and  the managers were nice. Could do without all the drama, but that is not something management can handle considering there are a lot of high school workers there."
good,"I liked working there the environment was positive, but rush hours were very stressful and intimidating. I gained a lot of experience there and learned quite a bit."
good,"Friendly and fast paced environment, very clean and sanitaire. co- workers were great. Very good start up job for college student but not for big families. Short hours roughly 25."

good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's, they were all very friendly and would always be a good team. I liked that they would almost always work with your schedule and what you were and were not able to work."
good,Was typically short staffed but the employees always seemed to make it not so stressful. Hardworking people make your job as an manager less stressful
good,"I enjoyed going to work daily because the management had made it a deal to make sure,the store is a great place to be and the guests are also awesome people."
good,A typical day at work would be fun and exciting you will meet alot of new and exciting people sometime this get hecked in there but over all its very easy work
good,While working at Wendy's I learned how to properly deal with certain customers while remaining calm and collected. I also learned a great amount of team work and communication skills that involved leadership and team building.
good,this was the best Wendy that i have ever worked at by far the appease to your needs but desired pay is not there yet plus side though everybody is cool and up beat
good,"Smooth work day, nice work environment. Managers do their jobs great! Smooth shift transitions. Good rotation for work areas. Co-workers all got along well."
good,"Working for the company I had a great experience, when 3 months of being hired I was promoted to manager, taking the manager position I have to run the store my self and also fill in for employees that didn’t show up"
good,Good working environment with the right managers. I can only imagine how fun it’ll be to work their if I had the right staff to work with. The payment is also good too.
good,hardest part was if  someone in management called out you had to work a double.  i enjoyed the people i worked with and not under immediate supervision.
good,It was ok it was my first job so the money was ok for the time being but I needed something better to provide for my family overall a great place to start for your first
good,"Receiving orders, preparing food up to customer standards, while maintaining a clean work space. I've acquired organization, and multitasking skills. Friendly fast-pace environment. Ensuring customer satisfaction in a fast-pace environment. Relationships built with other crew members and unique customer experience. Management was very friendly and flexible."
good,"As soon as you clock in there is a place for you to start at. You are always moving around, handing out orders, or talking to guests. The best part is making friends and gaining experience. The hardest part is dealing with a rush and difficult costumers."
good,Getting used to fast paced environment. Knowing that customers will always come first no Matter the situation. Helps knowing the night life is different from the day.
good,"I am learning lots of things at wendy because it is restaurant job which helps me to enhances the various skills in my personality. for example:  Work in busy hours, Handle pressure of orders , Dealing with customers , listening and speaking skills."
good,"This job will always hold a special place in my heart. It was the first actual job I had. On top of that, I worked with a lot of my friends. So that made it fun. The General Manager was and is, by far, the best manger I have ever had. "
good,Everyone knows each other and we happy greet each other because we know we have long day ahead of us. The coaching at wendys is no walk in the park but our team strives to see us improve.
good,"While it is not an ideal career for most, it is a great place to work in between jobs or if you just need a place to start.  The pay is even and the managers aren't all bad."
good,"It could be stressful when busy or understaffed, but most of the time, it's a pretty good environment to work in and coworkers are easy to get along with."
good,"I took and cooked orders, I learned how to build great customer service skills, cook and clean in a well Manner way. The management was Great everything was well organized and up to par. The workplace culture was a great experience, learning different cooking methods with mixed races. The hardest part of the job was closing, having to clean the kitchen and dining room area while still making orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was building bonds with strangers, coming up with a plan and working as a Team"
good,Would come in ready to work with things for me to do immediately. I learned money management and cohesive communication skills. Hardest part was having no breaks because of tills and clock in procedure.
good,"Great company to work for, if you have the right management managing the company, in my opinion. Hours are available, but don't call in because you have a child who is sick or they will cut your hours from 50 hours to 10 hours."
good,"worked under 1-2 managers with about 5-9 coworkers depending on shift. half off on food, great relationships that become develop within the work place."
good,"This was a relaxed fast food job for me. It was less stressful than other fast food places I have worked. I mainly worked evenings to close and some mornings to open. Typically in fast food, the more experienced the staff or higher in management, the better the hours. I mainly worked drive-through and sandwich station. After I saved enough money to purchase a car for myself, I decided to leave Wendy's and look towards other career options. I enjoyed my time here."
good,I loved my job and I was very upset when I wasn’t noticed that I couldn’t come back to work and I’m loved being around my team members so I would love to try to get my job back
good,"A typical day at work depends on the day of the week. Sundays is more calm, Wed-Sat more quick paced. Can sometimes be very irritating. Managers are very laid back. Most can relate to most of the workers. They also push you to do your job. The culture can be fun at times.The hardest part of the job is working with low staff and people not doing their jobs to fullest. The most enjoyable would be helping the customers and having conversations with the managers and the other crew workers."
good,"Overall wendys was great until management was changed. But mostly it was busy, stressful. The hours were brutal but duable. The employees made things difficult for me."
good,"This job was beneficial in the sense that I was able to pay for my car monthly and provide needs for my baby sisters and my mother. I feel satisfied in how this job has helped me help my family financially, but it is now time to find myself a better job. I do believe that I work way more than what I am being paid for."
good,Intermediate hours depends on how well you work and what you use you time worth. Management was very lenient and could work around your schedule. repetitive work
good,"Atypical day at work , i basically clock in say hi to everyone and then go to the office check the hours we are at then check how many people will be on my shift. then i will count the safe to make sure she money is right. what i learned , i learned a lot from being at wends how to talk to customers how to handle situations. As a manager i would handle money, do paper work, and place people in there shifts. Our workplace culture is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of this job was to have a fast speed. The most enjoyable part was of course eating but being able to have control and manage my shifts."
good,Wendys had a good work environment with friendly and helpful staff which made it an easy work place . Everybody worked together in unison and helped wherever it was needed i liked the coworkers attitudes and work ethics which was a key to a successful  crew .
good,working in Wendy's was very stressful with the customers yelling and fussing at you but I had to just think about the good that would come out of the whole job and that was getting money for myself.
good,Wendy's helped develope my management skills. They helped me learn how to keep up in a fast paced food service restaurant. Wendy' also helped me push myself to work harder when I was short handed.
good,"Working at Wendy’s was definitely an experience , it was fun ,and taught you time management and having to work at a fast pace consistently teaches you to multi task and teaches you patience ."
good,Everybody got alone and worked as a team. We never had problem with people being late. I came to work on time and left on time. We dis our duties before leaving work every day of working.
good,"Working at Wendy's I learned patience and customer service. The management there could have been better. A typical day was fast and slow; loaded with customers on a normal day. The hardest part of the job was learning how to keep pace with taking orders, bagging food, restocking and cleaning. As I went along the weeks I quickly caught on to the swing of things. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn new people and the basics about the company."
good,Good place to worth if you have a work ethic .  Managment does their job upper management needs to step up a little and focus on employees just as much as the customers.  The store is also in desperate need of a remodel
good,I enjoyed working with this company. The employees and managers where great. The bad thing is when I was injured on the job I was asked to resign.n fair
good,Fun working with the people at Wendy’s very relaxed when it isn’t busy. An easy job to attend once you get the hang of it. Not very strict managers but they are going to make you work
good,It was a job for me in high school. I met a lot of great people there. It is not a place for a career. It was a part time job to pay for food and games when I was in school.
good,"Wendy's is fast paced and heated due to the cooking materials going on and as a fast food restaurant you have tons of customers coming in for their meals, as a worker you cook and attend to the customers and the managers were super nice and helpful and didn't breath down your neck and butcher you for any mistakes."
good,I have worked there that long so its was something to help me take care of my children but now it's time to move on. I  can't knock it but you will work
good,"Usually it's pretty busy on my shift everyone is moving fast. One thing I learned is to not let any of the customers ruin my attitude for the people around me, also to be more respectful to my higher ups. The hardest part of my job would be satisfying the customers, because if the customer is unhappy with their order we have to reassure them that we apology , and want to make sure that they leave happy."
good,The management was very good at training. This was a great job for high school students because they made accommodations for school activities and exams
good,I would work at drive through taking orders and handling serving meals and drinks. Some times im scheduled to work at the food station preparing the meals and serving. I would provide great customer service
good,"Working for Wendys was a typical day in fast food."
good,"If Wendy's paid more and granted more employment hours, then really I wouldn't have anything ill to say of it. The Management Crew, as well as the Crew Members, are Fun, Caring, and mean well."
good,"Going into work, I had to make sure all of the the sauces (Honey Mustard, Ranch, BBQ Sauce etc.), SML Lids and Cups were stocked. I mainly worked behind the cash register so I would take orders at the cash register near the dining room. If the dining room wasn't very busy, my manager would sent me to handles the fries and nuggets station."
good,"was always fun working here. Everyone is loving and caring. the hardest part of the job is its very busy all the day, so sometimes you feel exhausted."
good,Working at Wendy's was a good experience because I learn fast learned a lot of things met new people and it was just a good place to work at they gave me free lunches 30 minutes lunch break
good,"Maybe because of our small town but the store is VERY busy and they RARELY EVER give you breaks! The managers are extremely pushy and it doesn’t matter how it benefits the store or production, you MUST do it their way!"
good,To work here you have to be able to do your own work plus others sometimes. You're always moving and listening to what's going on and whats needed. But all the staff were nice to each other and we always worked together. The hardest part about the job was sometimes the manager could be a little rude.
good,30 min de comida regular ambiente de trabajo comunicación con los empleados regular
good,can have some long days but if the right crew is in place the shift will run smoothly. we have slow moments but when we get busy it can get hectic. as a manager it can get a little overwhelming but if you are strong & know your job then it will be just fine.
good,"It was a good learning experience, as well as a good summer job. It teaches you to work fast but efficient. At times it was stressful but that is the way a job often works. I had a good time working there."
good,"This job is very fast-paced. The pay is poor for the amount of work you do."
good,"Wendy’s is a great starter job for anyone, it will teach you teamwork, and develop a good work ethic, pay is substantially grown over the last three years."
good,It was a good place to work. It was a fast paced job keeps you busy. Management was good to work with.  The store just got remodled so it is busier then usally. You need to keep up on the orders which can be stressdful.
good,"Clocking into your position and beginning your duties and tasks to keep your area clean, organized, and well stocked. During meal times (rush) it can become very busy and stressful. Juggling all the tasks required can be challenging but beneficial. You must work quickly and efficiently, keeping an upbeat and happy presence. Patience is everything when it comes to serving customers. The customer is always right and you must do whatever is required to ensure customer satisfaction. I learned how to keep calm and focused in a fast-paced stressful environment, multitasking, and managing my time. Management, for the most part, was excellent. Managers were helpful and experienced. When a mistake was made some managers would jump in to help fix the issue and take time after to help teach what was wrong and how to fix it so that the mistake can be avoided in the future. Others were difficult to work with causing issues that were avoidable and making the work environment extremely difficult.  The workplace culture was not the greatest, there were many who didn't care about their jobs and made it difficult to work with them. Gossip and drama were always around, keeping to yourself and doing your job efficiently is the best way to avoid any conflict. The hardest part is dealing with customers as some feel that those in food service are below them and can be treated in a demeaning and disrespectful fashion, as well as employee drama. The best part is the skills and knowledge I gained in the time that I worked there. I met some people that made an impact and gave me the tools I would need"
good,Lo evaluo como una buena experiencia para alguien que desee comenzar a trabajar por primera vez.
good,I learned to be a responsible employee. I also learned to manage others in a work setting. I grew as time went on and today I am a responsible woman who learns fast on my feet.
good,I learnt how to open and close up the wendys store and how to clean and how to do the preparation for the food and smoothes. how to handle money and the cash register and how to provide customer assistants
good,I have enjoyed working for Wendy's as a crew for going on 4 years but I would like a taste of management for once. I talked to my boss and all she did was give me the run around. I make $9.10 a hour and in the 4 years I got 2 pay raises that not far at all.
good,Not too hectic or demanding of a job if you catch on quickly. Always come ready to work and get your shift over with. Stay on line unless requested to or asked to step off.
good,"Overall the company as a whole is awesome and my experience working there was fun and helped me get by in high school. However the pay and security of the job is very low, majority of the time they're cycling employees through."
good,"my shift starts at 7am and ends at 2pm. You clock in on the terminal/computer with your finger print and you begin your task by cutting open chilly and bean bags to leave cooking for 1 hour at minimum then you're cleaning the fryer and scrubbing it down, some times they leave it as a mess. "
good,"My experience at Wendy’s was okay, they were very unorganized. We didn’t have many workers so we didn’t have as much help. They definitely overworked & underpaid me."
good,"I would like to point out how every position isn’t even. The sandwich and drive thru area’s require more attention and patience, whereas the grill and fry stations are more relaxed and stress free. It’s an overall unfair environment due to the lack of recgonization. If i get paid $9 and i’m a good employee they may put me on sandwiches where it’s more work and more hands on and attention. But there will be another employee who makes the same as me but since they aren’t as good they get it easy and take on grill where all they have to do is slap meat one the grill and that’s it. It should be more balanced out with the work. Someone who is being paid the same as another employee shouldn’t be taken advantage of because of their skill, rather give them a raise so they are awarded for doing great."
good,"Wendys taught me to continue to work fast pace , handle money , and improve my customer service. The hardest part of my job was very fast part was having to do every position when we were low on employees. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wendys was interacting with our customers."
good,The job is great. The hardest part is relying on employees to come to work to allow the shift to run smooth. Get a lot of over time and bonus for monthly and quarterly
good,"It was a great place to work. The management and employees worked as a team and it made the time there enjoyable. I didn't dread going to work. I didn't necessarily enjoy the time from 11 A.M.-8 P.M. or 5 P.M. -2 A.M, but other then that I actually had a good experience there."
good,"Typical day at work was working with 5 to 6 people on a daily basis while trying to handle customers getting them in and out. Regular customers understand how working with little people is hard, however, some of them do not understand and become easily frustrated because they want their food. Some shift managers try and help you out while some one them do a poor management job. Best thing about working here is that you can challenge yourself to be better and be faster to get the customers in and out. Working with friends giving the environment a fun place to work at."
good,"A day starts out as a manager includes setting up your shift for the day so it runs smoothly setting up and communicate all goals for the day . Giving all guests and crew a wow experience for the day . The best part of working at Wendy’s would be meeting new people as well as existing ones that come into our restaurants and put a smile on their face , the hardest part would have to be when employees call in for shifts and having to work a little harder to achieve goals for the day while trying to give all a wow experience"
good,"Great for a job for a few years. I don't think I could have worked much longer. The people and the customers are the reason I stayed so long. The company is great, but its like anything else, good days and bad days."
good,"Overall the job is good place to work, though the compensation is lacking. It is a good place to work if you want flexible house, and the ability to take charge of your own work."
good,"molto istruttivo nella preparazione pietanze,e gestione della cassa"
good,It was great working there i love interacting with people Everyone there was like family Love having personal conversations but not too personal but I always will be a joke in there or a little  laugh
good,Wendy's has been a good place to work. For the past 4 years the effort and quality of work I have put into the company has been recognized and rewarded. I was given the tools and opportunities to learn and grow within the company and I feel that I mattered to Wendy's.
good,"The work days, or nights for me, were typically pretty relaxed and the management there are understanding and reasonable. Its a great place for a first job or for work experience."
good,I started working for Wendy's in 2012 started as a crew member for about 1 1/2 yrs before I was offered a shift manager position. I was a little nervous about it but I realized that I was the best candidate for the job why?because they asked me. I loved what I doing. Shift ran smooth employees doing their job without being told to do so.
good,"I worked for a franchise operating 25 stores in Alabama."
good,It was just a bad management team. The managers were kind of bad but I just showed up and did what I was supposed to do and I worked there for a year and toward the end it was kind of stressful no one did their job and 4 people quit in like 2 weeks span.
good,"A typical day for me would be to get to work, and immediately take orders, start cleaning dishes, and dealing with unruly customers.  The main issue I have working is that some managers wouldn’t allow me to take a break or leave on time, sometimes keeping me up to an hour after my scheduled time.’"
good,Working here was good at the time until something else was available and was not that good benifits it was always busy and customers are rude do not want to work there agian
good,"I enjoyed working here a lot. It wasn't easy at first, but I did learn the hang of the job. Enjoyed the people, the customers, and also the environment."
good,A normal day at Wendy's is hurry up getting on time signing getting a signed to your station get your materials that you need for your shift. Ive learned tat you have to memorize the food order and you have to be fast paced. The management their is get going going they are serious and constantly moving and getting you through the rush hour. The workplace is hot and fun once you get to learn and know the crew members your fun just starts. The hardest part of the job was the faced pace because it takes awhile for you to learn everything and then use your memory to make the sandwich or whatever if you make a mistake you have to restart on everything  .The most enjoyable part is the fun the crew had the jokes that would be shared is fun.
good,"My job was quite easy , it was well organized and wasn’t very fast pace and when you needed help there was always a manager around to show you how to do something and help you out"
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work for the simple fact that the manager made everything into something fun. a typical day would be to come in and prep all the bacon, salads, chili, etc.The culture there was amazing because mostly everyone went to the same school so they all got along and had similar interests."
good,"Good company, subordinate employees are underpaid and often results in high turnover and low moral. Hard to retain good workers. Very stressful due to staffing issues."
good,"Its a ok company....it needs to pay their employees more money so the can maintain a honest living. Also they need to train their management team, so they will have the knowledge to train new employees under company policies."
good,I worked at a smaller store where the other employees were fun to work and get along with so I really enjoyed working with them. Consistency of scheduling could be an issue some times
good,"perfect for a teenager over the summer but do not go into this believing to start a career"
good,"On a typical day we were busy, maintaining a constant fast pace and efficiently getting out all of our orders while keeping customers highly satisfied."
good,Management is wonderful. No benefits for a while. Hours are okay. Only occasional rude customers. Very many nice customers. Some staff can be very rude.
good,This was a fast paced job that really tested your team effort and production speed it was also a great way to progress into management i have already recommend plenty of friends and family to become members
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wendy's because I furthered and advanced my customer service skills, earned money, and met new people. I learned that no matter how you feel or what mood you're in you always have to please your customers."
good,"I really didn't like the fast pace which you had to work in all the time while you were working it really made for mistakes and such to be made it was crazy. You were always rushing around as an assistant manager trying to keep everything going . What with scheduling the people, insuring the food is prepared as per instructed by Wendy's, the counting of and dealings with money, the cleanliness of building, opening up on time, and closing procedures to be followed , Wow what a lot to do and remember each day."
good,I enjoyed working with the people at Wendy's. I also enjoyed waiting on customers and preparing the food. I also helped to clean the restaurant by mopping floors and cleaning tables.
good,It was a good first job experience. The manager was nice and understood my hours and helped me get the hang of this job during the first few weeks. The enviroment was good
good,when i worked at wendys the day i started i knew i would not be staying long. i did not enjoy working fast food. it wasn't my co-workers it was more of the rude costumers.
good,"Good burgers & fries always Will be happy with going to Wendy’s , great team work , good vibes . Easy job and can make a career out of it . Managers & The crew very helpful"
good,Wendy’s is a great loving company. Many crew employees I love working with but it is time for me to leave for a bigger pay for my family. Schedules for work employees are presented well but always end up some calling off on the days they work and some employees would have to stay for overtime sometimes to cover.
good,"It was a good place I chose as my first job but the management was poor so I left, and now I’m looking for one with a good management team, and to be around people who love to work."
good,This was my first job. I got alot of my cooking experience here but decided to try somewhere else to get more pay and benefits. Was a good job for high schoolers but not anything that you wanted to stay at for a long time. Was a good first job.
good,"Fast Food!"
good,"On a typical day, I walked in the building, clocked in, and put my phone and purse down. I went straight to the office after that to count my register and then I started working. The hardest part of the job is to make sure you keep a steady but fast pace while people are yelling at you. The most enjoyable part is getting the job done together. I learned how to get work done while people yelling at you in a fast pace while still staying calm."
good,"come into work, properly dressed, great customers "
good,wendeys is a very fast paced line of work it requires good concentration and the ability to multi task but it is still a confortable work place and teaches good work ethic I would recommend as a good first job
good,I was and still grateful to have the chance to work for a food company. I would have loved to work there a little bit longer. The food choices weren't that healthy. But the customers were great. And some of the team members were very nice and helpful in a way.
good,"My day at work would go good.i learned how to cook the food ...... "
good,"it was a good place to work. "
good,Working with wendy's was standard. the manager did her job and was willin got work with employees to improve them. they were willing to take the time to train and help in the rush hours
good,"Starting off can be rough but as long as you prove you're a hard worker, advancement quickly becomes an option. The general manager is extremely friendly and easy to learn from as well as very helpful, almost all the workers are the same way."
good,"Wendys is a great place to work, especially as a first job. Training is easy to pick up and everyone is patient with you to learn the basics. management is always kind, helpful, and understanding."
good,"Apply and find out for yourself. The company supports your needs and has excellent health, vision and dental benefits. Competitive salary and a wonderful training program that sets you up for success right from the start."
good,"I would recommend for my friends or anyone else that needs a job to work there, the place is very friendly, it’s also very clean too. The food is always fresh also."
good,"I recommend Wendys to anyone fresh out of high school or in high school, great environment and cool incentives. Fast paced but in a fun competitive way."
good,You will come in see if you need to stack up on your area of work make sure you have cups leds sauces are stacked and go count you draw that is the amount right if money also make sure the lobby is clean n bathroom too
good,Its good workplace to do work we learn how to do cashier job how to talked with customers and there some management is also good. The most enjoyable part of the job is the talk with customers and helped there order to them.
good,"Good place to work, fun environment , good staff and we build sale by talking to the guest and making sure its a home environment.Wendys really build on a everthing being quality and fresh."
good,"This was my first job and held on to it for 20 years"
good,"just like any fast food place its a decent job, and flexibility was a huge plus here and work envrionment wasnt too stressful like a lot of fast food restaurants"
good,J'aime mais si on avait été plus payer j'y serais rester une 3ieme années de suite
good,"I loved working at Wendy’s and everything about it. Although the location I happen to be at was a new one, many of the employees were quitting and that left many spots on the schedule free this would have not been a problem if I wasn’t already working a lot of days and consistently filling in for other people who had quit. I felt over worked and after many nights of closing I just couldn’t take it any longer."
good,"Overall Wendy’s is a great starter job, the environment is great the management is fair, and the experience I get from this job is great. The CEO is one of the most generous person I know."
good,At times it could be very very fast paced no time for errors. Overall with the right management team and crew things worked very well. I as ops leader stressed to my crew that we work together to produce the most satisfying experience for our guests.
good,If you don't have any kids or if your young I feel it isn't a bad job.At the end of the day it is Wendy's so you get what you get out of it. I knew it was a means to and end so I jus used it for what it was til I found something better.
good,"I've been there for 16 years.....what can I say!!!  I am not in the bashing mood.  I just think there should be some changes.  The stores in the Shreveport/Bossier area are no longer corporate and some of those perks are gone, but for a manager candidate starting out, it should be fine."
good,This isn’t a career but if it is for your first job it is a good experience. Pay was low but all of the co-workers were nice as well as good management.
good,wendy's would be a great place to work if i didnt have to work so many nights and weekends.i would have liked to work more day shifts and not so many weekends
good,"I had this job when I was 16 and obviously compensation wasn't a very stressed issue. I worked there part time for just over a year and since the pay was competitive I went from minimum wage to over a dollar raise within the first few months. I was lucky to have a good crew so I enjoyed my time there and we worked well together as a team. Managers would come and go and we had a very rocky time with most of them, mostly because of their own attitudes and personal issues. Overall as a first job I enjoyed it alot, you can expect the customers to be very hassling (as it comes with the territory) but it's to be expected."
good,"I was treated with respect and i was never not doing something, it was always something to do. The employees were very inviting ,and kind about the fact that i didn't know what to do. The food wad prepared with concentration on food safety and cleanliness of your workstation."
good,I worked there not very long for the reason being i was still in high school and did not get me next work permit signed but all my coworkers were great and always so helpful.
good,"They were past faced and worked well with each other, getting the job done quickly and efficiently. I didn't receive a lot of hours while I worked there, even after asking for more I was told that they didn't have anymore during my available hours."
good,We come in late they let we of us slide they give us free food and good service and make everything hot and fresh and the let us be ourselves and cool
good,"They can train you in the basics of work as most fast food restaurants are great at doing. I spent most of my time cooking burgers, they always said they were going to train me to make burgers but never got around to it."
good,"A typical day at work was cooking on the grill and making sure everything was made correctly. I learned how to clean oil traps and many other fast food things. The work place culture was pretty relaxed, no one ever got overly flustered when we got busy. The hardest part of the job was cleaning after we closed. The most enjoyable part was getting through a busy rush flawlessly."
good,"Working in an ice-cream store is a fun job, seeing kids faces light up when the get to choose what flavor they want. Working at a cafe, you learns things like how to safely prepare food, what temperatures should be. Keeping the store clean and safe was top priority in our job."
good,"The managers discourage talking with other co-workers' keeping it to minimal.Customers are well taken care of, and so are the workers. The food is enjoyable, wish i can say the same for their fries."
good,"I was not here long, but I enjoyed the environment and my co-workers. The customers can be rude at times, especially if they do not know you. Once that phase is over and they see your personal work ethic, the job gets easier. At first, yes its hard to run the cash window, wash dishes, and warm up the buns in between taking orders."
good,Beautiful people the work is very efficient and the hours were very good I felt very safe and I had fun working here  I’ve learned a lot and i even became a team leader
good,"-small workplace"
good,Its great job for someone who dont want to do much and great for high school students and college students...its fast food their is different position to work... They are very flexible with the schudule and needing days off
good,Everyone was easy to work with and the managers were real understanding. I liked working here except the fact that there was no overtime allowed. The pay was also a little low for the labor
good,"i liked working at wendys. i got alog with everyone i just wish you got paid better. they trained me in every position so i knew what i was doing, they were flexible with hours"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy's, and, while I would have liked more pay, it was fair. My only big issues are that we went through three General Managers during my relativity short time there, and that at the end I was only working one day a week. My immediate management was fair, and knew their jobs very well. My coworkers where kind and helpful. There was a lot of trust."
good,it was a fun and good first job that thought me a lot of skills and ways to think and go around things. I was only part time but in the time i had fun and can look back and say it was a good first job.
good,"Treats you like Family. Great environment was apart of management, it could of been stronger and more reliable but so far great job opportunity . Would recommend"
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendys. It was competitive, enduring, hard working people. The environment was very friendly, always had friendly customers. The food is even better so i could it was over all the best job ive ever had. Management system was interesting and different then i expected."
good,Overall a good place to work for it was at a truck stop so that’s different then a regular Wendy’s I was able to start as a cashier and work my way up to shift manager with great pay and monthly bonuses
good,Wendy's in Pasco has undergone a huge management shift for the better. Solid expectations for high-quality food and clean workplace. Customer satisfaction is top priority.
good,"Great first job, lead to great friends and work experience. Got promoted at an early age which really makes you feel like they notice how hard you work."
good,"It was a great place to work, very friendly staff but a very quick paced job with high stress. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the people you work with and the regulars that come in. The hardest is defiantly keeping up with orders during rush hour and keeping everything in order during this time. I personally liked working here because everyone was so friendly and I liked the location. The only cons is no lunch breaks or any breaks if working less than 6 hours."
good,Its a great first job. Many pluses. Work schedule varies every week.  Great meal discounts. Friendly Employees. Great Managers to work with. Pay check comes weekly.
good,Everyday at work ten hours would feel like four hours. That's how fast it went because we were usually always busy. There was never any boredom and it kept you on your feet.
good,"The environment is very fast-pace. You must be able to multitask and handle multiple orders at once. It has been about five years since I last worked there, however it was a friendly environment and had minimal problems with management or coworkers."
good,"This workplace keeps you on your toes and is full of new, unpredictable experiences.It is important to always pay attention on the job, never neglect your duties."
good,Everything was well except occasionally the manager would get overwhelmed other than so the only reason I quit is because I was relocated too far. Everything else worked out fine.
good,This is a great place to start off. I was able to advance at the pace that I wanted and wasn't forced to take on responsibilities before I felt ready to. It can be fast-paced at times but there are also times where there is a calm flow of customers.
good,"It’s better when busy, time goes by faster. It’s a nice first job to have. I don’t like the cut of hours from time to time. There’s a 50% discount on the food you buy, but you can only use it once a day and only on the days you work."
good,i worked as a cashier register and also prepare customer's food orders and i also work in the drive-thru and i also help on keeping the restaurant clean.
good,"A typical day at work would include a little of everything once you are trained on all stations. I learned what cleaners to use where, the proper way to drop fries and nuggets, the proper way to make sandwiches and how to clean the different areas of the restaurant. The management was awesome. The workplace culture was always excellent. The hardest part about the job was the quick pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was making great relationships with coworkers and putting out my best effort in giving customers a great experience at my Wendy's."
good,My title at Wendys means nothing. I do way more than suppose to which is why I feel like I should work somewhere I can get paid for my work. I am in charge of running the register. I also am the cook sometimes. I am in charge of closing the store down in most areas.
good,"A typical day at work would involve multi-tasking at multiple different stations, which includes working the drive-thru, front counter, back cash, cook, custodian, customer service. The hardest part about the job was low staffing. The most enjoyable part about this job is that my co-workers and I have developed a work relationship that works really well together, and get work done efficiently."
good,I personally did not enjoy my job at Wendy's but that's because it was not for me I don't like small enclosed working areas. It was very very fast paced and I got mixed up a lot. I was also not trained properly
good,I enjoyed it for a while and started to hate it the longer I worked there.My hours began to become to much for me to handle with a new born and if I was sick unless I went to the Doctor every single time I would get written up for missing a day
good,"would like more . needs better cameras , more attentions and renovations care managements. pay was good .  I couldn't get my say in . terminated without telling the actual story . or hearing the other side ."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's may require you to be fast paced and energetic for an extended amount of time. However, Wendy's taught me the basics of customer service and what customer service meant."
good,"Great people where I worked. You form great connections with some people and these at least make the fast food job a little more bearable. Drive-thru sucks in the winter, but better than serving at the front cash. And no, this isnt one of those fake reviews if you were wondering."
good,A typical day at work is serving lunch and dinner. The flow of people are average and the work flow is steady. The crew work together and we manage to keep the cout down. The hardest part of the job would be if a crew member was to call o0ut and leave the other workers doing double the job.
good,"The store in fountain Colorado, has great management  and uphold the rules and regulations required by the company. They care about the employees and customers."
good,"Once you start working here, you begin to be a part of a family, even when you don't know it. I began to remember the customers' faces and names by week two and they were just as happy to see I remembered them."
good,A good company to gain management experience but can be frustrating with the long hours and low pay. Overall a good experience if you are able to be employed as management.
good,I like the atmosphere of the place. I had a great time in the place. I would recommend this job to anybody. I had a wonderful time working with management.
good,It was an OK work environment. It was not always organized which made things somewhat Chaotic. Rules were not always followed or maintained by upper management.
good,Honestly i liked working here but as a manager it wasn't much of a challenge at all. I found myself becoming the go to guy to get everything done on my own.. Not to say I don't mind doing extra work because I love a challenge but I've always been told there is no I in team.. The pay and hours are great.. The one thing we should work on there is working as a team and treating others as family.. There's no better feeling then walking into work and feeling right at home..
good,"Overall, Wendy's was decent. "
good,"Good work environment with the right crew members."
good,In my experience with Wendy's it has been a very flexible and great work environment.  My direct management is great to work for and I am provided tools for advancement.
good,I loved working at Wendy's. It is a great place to work and to further yourself. I was promoted within a year to management because the staff had helped me learn quickly.
good,Wendys is a very busy restruant. Its known for 100s of people a day. keeps on the go all day. you have to have very good communication skills. great way to meet new people.
good,"It is nice place to work.I learn the how to be leader.The hardest part on service time I think it was stress full keep the number under 100 when customer take the time on speaker to order,"
good,"It was a fast paced, multitasking, on your feet job with a small team work environment. Being a team member meaning doing different things throughout your shift."
good,Wendy’s is a very good place to work. Once you come in with a great Attitude and perseverance and willing to work hard then you should always strive in that environment.
good,High paced environment. Skills building. Can be stressful if you are short staffed. Great starter job. I encourage anyone who's starting out to consider fast food. I learnt a lot working with this company. It was easy to make friends. Can move up if a management position is something that you would want. If not it is just a stepping stone.
good,"A lot of movement from everyone and fast working. A lot of costumers go. Good enough hours, Great for 1st job and to gain more experience. but customers can be rude at times."
good,"Wendy's employees are fun full of life and friendly,respectable place to work at.the employees are like family they stick together to make the work place more comfortable.they train those who don't know to much about the job.the environment is amazing and trustworthy."
good,It was a productive workplace. Genuinely nice employees. Every day I came into I was welcomed with a smile. Our GM was great always looking out for his employees. Always brought treats.
good,"It was an enjoyable work environment for the most part. Once you get the hang of regular procedures, the job will come easy. At the Wendy's shop I worked at, there were friendly managers which I think really helped with the work environment."
good,Working at Wendy's is your typical fast-food experience. It's very fast-paced and you must be great at multi-tasking to do well in this career. Working under time pressure is also necessary to excel in.
good,Se aprende a trabajar duro y en equipo. Aprendes un ritmo de trabajo adecuado.
good,"It's been a while since I've been in the Fast Food Service industry, but working for Wendy's was pretty similar to Mc Donald's. As always Management needs some work & regular crew was amazing."
good,This company is a good company to work for. They just need to boost the starting pay rate up. I have been working here for years and the only thing I can say that's downside to working for Wendy's is the pay rate for the work you have to do.
good,"The Wendy's workplace was fast-pace, but the management I had made sure we enjoyed working hard. I was doing morning prep most days and my schedule was 7am-5pm. As people began resigning from the job, work got more strenuous for the rest of us."
good,Great job great people and amazing learning trip. They worked well with employees. Sometimes hecktic but expected. I got to meet some great customers and the smiles everyday help me make it through the day
good,"Wendy’s is a good place to work if you are looking for a fast paced job, or somewhere to get your first job! I love the crew and mangers at the Richmond store!"
good,but you have to be self motivated  you have to be focused on the customer and follow direction and procedures as described on we learn and you senior manager
good,I love  helping the customers. I love running the drive and help my team member out when they need help. when we all work as a team everything go  smoothly. working at Wendy's help you with customer skill .
good,"I was able to be a crew member , and then was promoted to A Shift Supervisor.  So I had the chance to  advance and grow.  I loved every bit of it KENLY 95 is a great place."
good,I can honestly say that the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. I would always get great reviews from them. I loved making sure they came first and were always satisfied!
good,At Wendy's don't expect to get a lot of rest. Unless you are on break you probably will constantly have something to do. As most fast-food places are Wendy's is a fast pace environment especially during lunch hour.
good,Really good place to work if you like working in a fast pace environment. The staff always likes to have fun while working but still gets the job done when they need to
good,I loved working at Wendy's. They worked around my schedule. And when I got pregnant they worked around my Dr appointments and helped me so much while I was pregnant and working. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,I enjoyed working here because they treated you well and helped you learn different positions. The managers were very friendly and are really easy to get along with making work extra fun.
good,"I am always prepared to assist customers in anyway needed. My huddles with my team members are always completed before our day begins. Always make sure its a safe environment not only for customers but for employee's as well,  making sure all customers leave with a great experience.meeting new nice people is a great part of my job. But it can be challenging but I love a challenge keeps me on my toes."
good,A high intensity position that requires fast accurate service of customers to encourage their return as a customer.  The quality of our food was extremely important and this fact needed to be instilled in all employees.  Cleanliness was paramount and the store needed to be maintained in a state of cleanliness that could pass randomly scheduled inspections.
good,"Cooked food "
good,I would recommend this job to any high schoolers out there just looking for a job to make some quick change. This was my very first job when I was in high school and I had some great times and made great friends
good,it was an okay job helped me financially but the pay was not enough worked good hours till it dropped down to less hours. i liked the job but some of the people i worked with i didn't like
good,I wouldn't work there to be my first choice but of you looking for a quick and way to get money its a stressful and fast pace but its good people to work around and also a good location
good,"Really nice work place, awesome team work."
good,Very high paced work environment where there is just as much opportunity to advance as there is to fail. For being a temporary job it's not bad however there is not much longevity.
good,"When I worked there the owners(corporation) at that time had very strict standards as to how the foods were prepared, specifically, drinks, chili and frosty's as well as service time standards-order up in 15 seconds if you were in line inside the restaurant and 30 seconds to your window if you were in the Drive Through! Proud to say that we also made those service times as our store won the Wend'y Olympics for store operations. Beef at that time was always fresh not frozen and the hamburger patties were made daily."
good,"I loved working their it was a nice place."
good,"A typical day of work consists of working any station the manager assigns me to and taking orders and making the food that is ordered."
good,"It was always really busy, but that's alright. I learned a lot while I was working there, like how to make all their sandwiches and how to do all the standard cleaning procedures. I had a couple friends who worked there, which made things easier."
good,"This was my first job when i was 19 and as much as i dreaded the idea of working fast food, it really wasn't that bad. Management will take the time to listen to your problems and try to fix them the best they can and they work with you on your schedule."
good,"The general manager that was there , I really appreciated her.  She was hands on , interactive.. made sure that customer service was priority as well as speed of service.. It was a positive atmosphere.. Sometimes stressful.  We had lunch rushes that seemed overwhelming at times but with everyone working together it was great.  "
good,"I will clock in, wash my hands. Help assist whoever needs help at the moment as I clock in. Then I will go to the front cashier and make sure everything is cleaned and stocked properly. I will take orders throughout the night and then close the dining at about 10 and get off at 10:30."
good,"Wendy's is fast food, its fast paced. and stressful. But I believe every person should work in the food industry at least once to experience REAL customer service. I still eat at this restaurant if that tells you how much I love it!"
good,"Staff can be a bit clique-y, but that can be found at every workplace. Managers are coming and going and though I was told I was going to be cross-trained-- I had to fight my way into learning new stations."
good,"I worked here for about a month and not once did they give me a work schedule, I would call up there but sometimes they were too busy to answer the phone and I got in trouble for not showing up but no one attempted to make a schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working there, only left because i had a falling out with one of the mgrs also needed a job close to my home, other than that everything was good."
good,I loved working at Wendy's and the Wendy's team.  the food is fantastic and the price is even better.  There is no other sandwich like the junior bacon cheese burger and nothing else comes close to the satisfaction of a Frostee.
good,"I work for this company for a while and I feel that if one is trying to gain work experience this could be an ideal work place. As far as a career goes i do not recommend this job. Although it is a fast food restaurant, Wendy's is very family oriented and pushes for great customer service."
good,Working at Wendy's brought out the best in me in being competitive. Our store worked hard to compete for top scores for the month in being productive.
good,It was a good first job as a high school student but I wouldn't make that my full time career. The management staff worked okay together but many times contradicted each other.
good,Busy work environment especially around the fall and winter months. Good management and well organized work atmosphere. Opportunities for advancement.
good,I liked working there at the beginning but after a while I got bored of the job.
good,"Lots of rude customers, don't argue with them"
good,It was a very good work environment I loved my manager he was very helpful and understanding. I didn't have any problem coming to work because it wasn't a bad environment to work in
good,"Overtime I've learned all the different positions in the restaurant and I'm therefore given different positions each shift. The management and workplace culture at the restaurant is good but could be more organized. Overall, I enjoy being challenged with the stress that comes with the job and I also enjoy working with my coworkers. However, the job can get a little to overwhelming at times."
good,"It was nice working there and working with some good coworkers, I learned a lot about customer service and being very productive and being a hard worker. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers and the best part of the job was working with the great managers and coworkers and have great customers."
good,"Fast pased sometimes can be stressful, managers are fun to work with, I would work for them again if they gave me the chance, they are fair on working with employees on their schedules"
good,I enjoyed working at this place of employment because of being able to serve customers and the ability to practice at being a team player.  I enjoyed being empowered to make my own decisions.
good,"Work is work it is nither great or bad but i am more then willing to do what i have to no matter what, i have an 8 month son and a ton of debt so i am a fast lurner and a vary hard worker"
good,"Great work place the mangers work with don't just gove orders the place is up beat i would recommend to anyone good place to work find a better place,to be eat love the food and atmosphere"
good,"The pekin store has amazing management. They are all very understanding and supportive to a wide array of life situations their employees may be experiencing. Kathie Owens is not paid nearly enough for all she does (seemingly unnoticed by the corporation) for the company. The majority of her workers are paid a low wage,get no affordable benefits,no paid holidays,and a yearly raise that starts at a nickel and tops out at a quarter. Needless to say she does not get very many educated,drug free,motivated applicants. Most managers work a minimum of 48 hrs. a week and are forced to work undesirable shifts. Most of her employees who fit the above criteria are not willing to devote the time needed to reach management for such little incentive. Corporate constantly adds new criteria required to meet the standards set to earn bonuses. This is a great place to work if you are in need of flexibilty with your schedule,a feeling of being respected by your immediate higher ups,room to grow as an individual, and you enjoy interactions with people. If you are looking for a respectable pay rate, hours that become more desirable with performance level and experience, benefits, or respect of any sort from the actual owner and corporation, this job is not for you."
good,Working at Wendey's was swell. being hired was friendly and comfortable. the managers showed understanding when i made beginner mistakes. they helped me learn from those mistakes with encouragement and understanding.
good,Fun and fast paced work environment. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Learned how to run a profitable restaurant. Has a good culture where people enjoyed coming to work.
good,"This is an entry level position, with a high turn over rate, Base pay is usually minimum wage. Peak hours are very demanding and fast paced. Great management is crucial for this job!"
good,"Very fast paced, most of the time there wasn't even enough time to restock all of your things so you just got stuck unless some coworkers decided to help."
good,"First when i get to work I restock anything that needs restocking. I make sure the dinning room is clean for all the customers. I take orders for customers and offer them new items we have on menu. I make sure restrooms are clean for customers. I pick up trays and clean them. I help out with drive through when I am done with all my things.I learned to work in a busy environment, Help the elderly carry there food, showing great customer service, being kind to everyone even if they aren't nice to me. Every employee is great and welcoming and are always offering help to one another. Hardest part of the job would be cleaning the restrooms and cleaning the floors. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer makes you laugh or when employees tell a funny joke sometimes."
good,This was my first job so I wasn't expecting that much. The culture and environment were great and made me enjoy my work day. If I needed more hours I would receive them which was appreciated.
good,"The work night was always easy for the crew I worked with because we all worked together and covered each other-when it was needed.Time still managed to go fast most nights.Everyone,except the manager was younger than me,but it didn't bother me."
good,"Shift consisted of being a salad opener, which started at 7 am, and would last until 2:30/3:00 pm, depending on how busy the work day got. Friendly co-workers, and helpful management made the work day enjoyable."
good,"Management was nice, great work flow pace. Family friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was closing overnights while it was busy but the team pulled through."
good,It was a great place to start working at in a small town where there wasn't very many options. The management could have been better but it was overall a good experience.
good,Wendys was fun and good to me met a lot of nice people. Gained a lot of experience the Franchise BOB was a pain made the job very stressful could have cut back on the hours
good,"Like any other fast food, you do the same job each time. Can pick up extra hours from going to other stores, and can get the full 40 hours just by working hard. Great for first jobs to learn basic skills but can be developed by adding extra work into it. Not a bad place to work for your first job. And lazy workers or managers are always in every Wendy's so you learn to handle stress as if it's nothing."
good,"I was really able to get along with the managers and co-workers, and I found my being at Wendy's was very respectful. Even toward the customers. It was one of those type of experiences that ""I could not wait to go back."""
good,"This is my first job in canada"
good,"Being in fast food is like being in school, everything is taught to you and is everything is usually very consistent. The supervisor's are friendly and are more than happy to answer your questions."
good,The people were great and it was a awesome time working there. I enjoyed the managers. It was an easier job which was nice. They were pretty good for days off.
good,Wonderful environment. Loved the people and loved all of the managers. I loved my job there. It was a great atmosphere for everyone and very family like environment.
good,This is great job to have if you're in high school and want to see what it is like to work. It would not recommend staying here for the long run. teaches you good work ethic
good,"Great organization to work with specially if you are in Finance domain."
good,"Very unique culture, close team and great overall managent. I've learned alot about customer service here. The hardest part of this job was staying so late since it closed late at night. The most enjoyable part was how well everyone got along with eachother, it made the work day go by much easier."
good,Very busy at times with lots to do. Great way to meet people and learn. The pro is if you are a manager forget family because you are there for many hours.
good,My experience working at Wendy's taught me balance and patience. It is a very fast paced environment and a lot of the customers were very friendly. I got along with my managers and my coworkers very easily.
good,Very fun place to work I Enjoyed working with the public and helping the customer in any way I could. Can get a little hectic during busy periods but I enjoyed the fast paced work environment.
good,"Enjoyable: Talking to my coworkers"
good,For my first job Wendy's was very good to me. They provided me with plenty of hours and also worked around my school and cheer schedule. they were mindful to my Christian beliefs. the management team and staff were friendly. The customer attitudes varied but the management and co-workers were always there to help. Felt like a family.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wendy's throughout high school. But the pay wasn't enough when you live out on your own. I was cross trained and I trained a lot of new workers coming in. I love being a cashier. Customer service is my overall favorite.
good,"preparing customers order, assisting and helping customer with ther tray foods.. greeting and talking politely, suggesting meals, working fast, neat and clean.. maintaining clealiness of store.. keeping eye and focus on workplace in rush hours .."
good,"You work as fast a pace as possible for ten hours a day. Maintain store at a just opened look at beginning, middle and end of shift. Make sure the next shift and manager is set up for success to run their shift smoothly. I learned to do everything at a high speed pace to ensure efficiency, even when accomplishing tasks at home. I learned to listen to all sides of a problem in order to make best decisions.Management is always best when they are willing to work along side of employees. That way they understand what the job they are asking to be done entails and won't ask someone to do something they themselves wouldn't, couldn't do. The hardest part of the job is to feel like your just as smart and worthy a member of society as the next person. I very much enjoyed working with people everyday. Getting to know new people, and getting to have regular customers that continue their business because of you!"
good,Friday nights at wendys are the worst because its the night where everyone comes from having fun just to eat and the customers be piling up so its very stressful when u have to rush orders around.
good,I was 16 when I started working for Wendy's. I only stayed 6 months but oddly enough it was the best job I've had and I'm in my twenties. Wendy's won't tear you down like most other jobs will.
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great starter job, but for advancement it does not offer to much more than minimum wage unless you become a general manager, then your pay is salary. I loved all the people i worked with, so it made the environment great, but just was not enough to support a child and myself."
good,"Always learning something new."
good,I enjoyed working for Wendy's it was my first place of employment it taught me how to manage money and responsibility. The workplace environment was ok management could have been a little better. But overall I really enjoyed working for them because of some of the customers I have grow bonds with. I had fun working with my coworkers the hours weren't to bad.
good,"Overall a pretty laid back and nice place to work.  Management was good, and the most enjoyable part for me was Grill cooking and communicating with customers."
good,"When I worked there, a manager was awful and mean.  The others were fine.  They schedule workers well.  I got to make sandwiches, salads, and milk shakes.  I worked the fryer."
good,Its has been years but from what i remember it was easy and fun . a little difficult taking care of four kids too. But they were underatanding.  Thnks
good,I had lots of fun working here. its easy and to learn everything quickly. customers are nice as well. wendys the only down fall is not getting paid over 40 hours.
good,Wendcentral delivered a strong unified culture although they were very diverse and located all over the country.  The corporate office was very service oriented and efficient.
good,Wendy's is a fast paste type of job because its a fast food place and you got to work hard fast and quick to get their orders out and its pretty busy all the time so I would say its ok but it does increase and prepare you in the future for other job opportunities.
good,Wendy's was a good place to work. I enjoyed greeting the customers. A typical day would get busy at lunchtime. I liked working as a team with my coworkers.
good,"This was excellent position as I learned to cook, trained new employees, learned the operation of a cash register, and worked one-on-one with customers.  Learned how to multi-task in a fast paced working environment."
good,"overall a good place to work decent benefits friendly,courteous upper management staff, room for advancement as i started as a minimum wage crew member.most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet a lot of new people.."
good,"I had a great time but it's time to move on and look for something better . I learned a lot from this job . I was taught to place orders, scheduling , inventory and much more ."
good,Working at Wendy's taught me more then I actually thought I would have learned. I learned about communication more. working as a team and also being patient.
good,"You meet many people from all walks of life. You learn how to work with all people and maintain a level head. Your days can be stressful, but you get to learn stress management and to get through your day with a level head."

good,"I loved my co-workers and the work was always demanding enough to not be bored but still not overbearing. Managers and owners were very kind, only had one bad manager while I was there.

One once gave those of us on shift some Japanese coins, she had just gotten back from there."

good,"I have worked for wendys my whole working career, going on 7 years in the business I have come to love aspects & hate aspects of wendys. Many people believe that the quick service industry is something to laugh about but in reality we value our customers just as much as a non quick service restaurant, & that's why I've stayed with the company so long."

This place has always been great about recognizing good work and there was always a possibility for advancement."
good,A typical day at work you provide customer service and operate cash register while backing up other crew members  also stay on top of your stocking. You will also monitor  the dining room and performe closing duties. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment  and keep a smile on my face while doing so. Co-workers were nice for the most part.The hardest part of the job was maintaining the set goal of the timer for each order. The most enjoyable was satisfying our customers when we would prepare their food fresh and in a timely manner.

good,The managers at Wendy's were always understanding and kind. They did their job and assisted anyone whom needed help. Truly an ideal trait for the workplace.
good,Started here as a manager trainee and eventually worked my way up to General Manager.  Had a great staff working for me.  We were near a hospital an were one of the busiest restaurants in town at lunch time
good,As GM you are responsible for the whole store and everyone and everything in it.  You have to foster team work and continuous training to stay ahead.  If you can develop a culture of trust between management and staff you will have a successful store.  The hardest part of work in the fast food industry is finding someone to cover a shift if the labor hours are not there.  The most enjoyable part is the family and team atmosphere you get to cultivate from long term employees.
good,"I enjoy working at Wendys, its a great company that really cares about its customer and employers. I really did enjoy working in this type of fast food restaurant."
good,The job was good it was the management and the way they handled the crew where the problems were in most part.You dont party with your crew.There is a time to work and a time to play.When a boss you are suppose to be serious and be too laid back because then you loose respect.They will not take you serious.As a team leader you are to make the company as a team not a circus.
good,"Management usually knew what they were doing and usually did their best to help other employees and customers. A pretty good atmosphere though it gets rather stressful at times. Mostly good co-workers, usually worked well."
good,"Holding up on food such as chicken an hamburger products, from drive through an dine-in."
good,"Un buen lugar de trabajo, pesar de lo pequeño del espacio, se aprende a trabajar en equipo."
good,"A usual day at work start off with prepping and restocking before the store open. When the pace is faster, I was able to learn how to work under pressure and send out orders in a timely manner as well as multi-tasking to ensure the kitchen is run efficiently. When new member join the crew, the manager would assign me to train them because I was knowledgeable about each task that were required to be done. There are some days where crew members would slack off and I had to pick up the pace to make up for it, these days are some of the hardest days to work especially while under staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customer. Most customers are nice and friendly and it's always nice to see them walk out with a smile on their face."
good,wendys is an excellent first job. it teaches you how to deal with customers. Also teaches you  how to work in a fast pace environment and you learn how to multitask.  its hard work but can be fun at the same time.
good,On somedays at work it was ok depends on what manager was in either you leave in with a smile or they come in with a I don't care attitude....I learn alot at Wendy's like how to greet customers more with a smile on my face always let the customaers leave with a happy face....Management was ok they were the best managers i ever had sence i been working....My co-workers were the best i ever had i got along with everybody we never had no down falls everybody always came in with respect and a smile on they face to make the work place fun and a better place....The hardest part was cleaning out the shake machine when it was time to close the store down you had to break the machine down and wash all the pieces....The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with the boss and co-workers.....
good,"Cashier, food prep, sandwich maker, grill worker. I learned to work under pressure in a fast pace environment. Managers were very friendly and flexible. My co-workers were like family to me. I had some of the fondest memories working at Wendy's. The hardest part of the job was leaving it to pursue a career in retail/clothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making customers happy."
good,"On a typical day at wendys i would normally arrive to work 12-20 minutes early with a smile on my face . I'll greet all co-workers and managers , put all my belongings away and wash my hands .  I always started off with sandwiches in the beginning of my work day and when the day got slow i'll help with drive thru . During rush hours i would do fries , sandwiches and present orders . Working at wendys i've learned to mute-task working at a fast paced to meet customers satisfaction and make sure their orders was correct and on time . All of my co workers was outgoing and i also got along with management pretty well . The hardest part of the job was mute-tasking not to mention i was 7 months pregnant but as time went on it was also fun and i got a hang of the job sometimes my managers would ask if i could stay late and on days i wasn't doing anything i would . I enjoyed working with customer services and working on the job but for personal reasons like my newborn being sick i couldn't go back because of the distance from home ."
good,I enjoyed my three years at Wendy's and enjoyed the customers as well as my crewmembers. Relocating and moving away was not easy as I had become accustomed to my schedule.

good,"Worked in every part of restaurant ."
good,"Love the management, very flexible, team is very amazing, rate of pay is horrible but what can you expect working at a fast food. Job requires a lot of multitasking !"
good,"I've learned how to handle different people from various walks of life.On a daily basis i am responsible for maintaining order, customer satisfaction, store inventory and cash handling. This job has taught me more about people and more about how to successfully run a business. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the constant change of the business; but as time goes on I'm learning more and more."
good,I would go into work and get right to work never haveing to be told what to do i knew where i was when i went in cause i was on same thing almost every day
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is providing customer service, preparing food, stocking stations, and cleaning up afterwards. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and keep a smile on my face while doing so. Co-workers were nice for the most part, but there were a few managers that were always starting drama or being rude to new members. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the set goal of the timer for each order. As more people came in, we sometimes wouldn't be able to maintain our goal. The most enjoyable was satisfying our customers when we would prepare their food fresh and in a timely manner."
good,it was good working with them and had no problems with any of the employees and I was always on time to work and never was late always show professionalism and respect to the customers
good,"Love working at this job.i don't usually work at fast food,but I'm glad I did.i met the most wonderful people that I worked with and also got a autograph from Miranda lambert while she and some of her band members ate at our restaurant"
good,"Honestly working at wendys isint bad at all, Besides the disorganzation of my job sometimes. I mostly did cashier so for the most part that was easy you just take orders and make the drinks"
good,Clean work environment. Get to see and greet new people everyday. Employees are respectful and friendly and well help you if asked. Mangerment was very strict and and respectful to his employers.
good,"The Wendy's I worked at was a healthly work enviornment with a supportive and fair management team."
good,I enjoyed worked at Wendy's the overall atmosphere was great we had team meetings in the morning so we could set goals for ourself we was very ordinated around service times which became stressful at times because we felt as though we had to rush the guest.
good,A typical day at Wendy's for me was very smooth and calm. Everyone was nice and always did their job. The management was very helpful in making me learn new things everyday there.
good,"Good management, good coworkers, work was generally easy. i learned how to fix heaters. enjoyed getting to clean out lockers and work alone"
good,"Take orders, cook, prep food, cashier, stock lobby and behind the counter,  clean bathrooms, customer service, etc. I learned to prep many food items, stocking, cashiering, alot more. I loved the management at this job. All three of the managers i knew were so nice to me and had very good work ethics. All my co-workers were friendly, i got along with everyone i met at this job. The hardest part was taking aal the machines down and cleaning them every night, also doing dishes, because im short and i could barely reach the dishes in the sink haha. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, they made working there fun."
good,"I was a cashier and also did store closing tasks at Wendy's. I had to mop floors, clean bathrooms, empty garbage's, stock items, and close the register. I enjoyed the staff and management. The hardest part of this job was stress from meal rushes, but the team always made it through okay. The best part of this job was it worked well around my school hours."
good,It is very nice and accommodating to work at Wendy's as they promote within and offer a fun work environment at the locations i worked at employee events were planed twice a year and the management was good
good,Fast pace job. Has it's down time but usually has a great spirit among workers. Customers are great. Get regulars that become friends. Food was always fresh and prepared as ordered.
good,"Wendys over the years has gone to the all about the buck, instead of takin care of there people like when I first became a manager. its a lot of room for growth at this company"
good,The job itself isnt bad but they could offer a better a pay for all the work that has to be done.  Its alot of work that has to be done for little pay.
good,"My opinion on a typical day at work would be that most of the time we would be busy and all of us workers would do our best to make the customer happy. I have learned a lot by being in management how to manage money, co-workers, and having a clean and safe environment. The hardest part of the job would be closing late at night and then going back in early. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a lot of people."
good,Everyone treats you like family and they will work with your scheduled. I learned how to multitask and teamwork. The mangers are real nice and help out the best they can.
good,Most of the employees were unprofessional and didn't respect others boundaries or specified jobs. The food was all held over twice the amount it was supposed to be and then the burger patties were used the next day for the chilli. The managers even lie to the customers about the holding times.
good,Its a great company to work for. They offer health insurance and 401k. You also get 50% discount on your meal. The enviroment is great with the coworkers
good,"My experience at Wendy's I learned sandwiches , fries , drinks , salads , cashier and multitasking. I've learned team work. My favorite experience there was working with sandwiches and service time. I enjoyed moving fast and doing many things at once. One thing that u didn't like so much was management didn't work as a team , team work is everything in the work force."
good,"My schedule was never stable. But a typical day would be going in at 10 am clocking in getting ready at my station making sure everything was well-put, clean, and organized before I get started. I learned good customer service skills, especially how to have patience not just with customers but with your co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say was being low on staffs & having a rush during a busy hour. The most enjoyable part would be the time you spend working with your co-workers & making sure that the customers are happy and satisfied."
good,this company has allowed me to build my resume for having management skills. moved up very quickly with in the company. i love working for them and i would work with them again
good,"I worked in the drive thru, placing orders and promoting new items for customers to try,"
good,"My time at wendy's was a wonderful work experience. I loved everything about my employment at wendy's/five points-jacksonville, fl"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's will go smoothly. I learned how to work well with others under pressure and learned how to coop with upset customers and make sure they are satisfied. Some managers were easy to get along with but others were difficult. Didn't really get along with at least two of them but we all managed to keep it together. I loved my coworkers individually and as a whole. It was like a family, when one person got in trouble everybody usually took the blame or chimed in to lighten up the situation. Hardest part was not having confidence in myself. Most enjoyable part was meeting and working with different people who came from different backgrounds."
good,"Overall, Wendy's is a wonderful place to work. The staff is caring and friendly and the hours can be adjusted according to your schedule needs. I would recommend for new workers/ students."
good,"The manager expect you to learn everything right on the spot, but other than that when you get used to it the work place can be fun and very achieving."
good,I learned customer service and time management skills. My managers were fairly reasonable and easy going. My co-workers were fun and energetic. The hardest part of the job was not getting any raises or promotions. The best part of my job was the friendships I made.
good,"•Greet customers and provide exceptional customer service"
good,the staff are good and the culture is good as well but the fall is you don't get enough hours to support your family needs.need more improvements for management
good,"I like and dislike Wendy's for many reasons. I have worked many MANY long and hard hours at this company, as a matter of fact sometimes 3 12 hour shifts a week on top of 2 more 5 hour shifts. A typical day at work (depending on if its day-shift or night-shift) consists of me arriving, clocking in, putting on my apron and hat, then asking my manager where to go, or just jumping on whatever position I see needs help. We bust our butts to keep the time down and make sure customers are satisfied, but its hard. We are almost always short-staffed, which makes us reliable workers have to work THAT much harder. I do not think I am paid what I deserve to be paid, I work way harder than $8.50 an hour, especially now that I am a college student. Management is great, I like all of my managers. My co-workers (Usually) are laughable and fun to work with, they work just as hard as I do. The hardest part of the job for me at least is the inconsistent schedule-the long long hours. I can work 40 hours a week, but not when its crammed into 3 12 hour shifts, it sucks. Especially when you have to work all day just to help close the store, which is equally tough. The most enjoyable part is the other employees and access to food."
good,Making daily deposits counting and be responsible of all the money in the store. Make sure we have enough people on shift to run smoothly if not had to problem solve ways to make it better.  Making sure staff was treating customers with respect and getting the orders out in a timely manner.
good,"Very busy, productive workplace with a family oriented environment. Not an ideal workplace for someone who cannot handle rude customers. Very fast-paced and must be attentive at all times. Ideal job for college students, and high students."
good,"I worked at Wendy's for two years, advancing from crew, to crew trainer, to shift supervisor pretty quickly. I somewhat enjoyed working here."
good,A good job for when your needing to start something just to get experience in a Job area. They teach you everything you need to understand to work there.
good,I have learned that you have to work at a fast pace. You also have to come in and do what you have to do to get out of there on time.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my employment with the company very positive and motivating staff"
good,"The typical day for me was to run that register listen to what other co-workers are doing, and go beyond that process. I enjoyed the job,but my hands will not let me do this anymore. Most of the managers at Wendy's Inc. are very nice people in fact most customers remembered me on a daily basis.I did however saved the company a lot of money by stopping a thieve in our building. The coasted our company $5,000. Also one of our Managers was scheming from the company, and I did not even know it until my other boss told me."
good,A typical day at work would be your regular duties in your station and a very busy work place. Co-workers are really nice and you learn a-lot of different skills like multitasking. The best part of the job is when your doing something you enjoy example when I sometimes do drive thru.
good,"*fast paced "
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. However, the job can be overwhelming. The job was fast paced and very demanding to be fast and almost no mistakes. I would do ALOT, ALOT of overtime. The downside of this job was that we didn't have reliable coworkers and I would end up doing more work than I was supposed to. As a student going to college, it became overwhelming."
good,On an average day it is usually pretty busy. The customers for the most part are decent and the coworkers are 100. The hardest part is drive thru back cash that's actually why I quit. The best part of the job is definitely the coworkers.
good,Responsible form eight to ten stores and managing 7 training units. My store trained all managers for the Birmingham area.
good,I usually work very long days almost ten hours every time I step into work. I normally don't stay on one station my manager like to move me around to make up for any weak points. Working here has put my patients at an all time high. Realizing that people won't change there work ethic even if you help them on there task. Other than that my managers are great and when you're lucky to end up on a decent shift it really isn't a to bad place to work.
good,Working for almost 5 years. My 2nd job in a QSR. A great working place during my 5 years stay. A place whereby everyone share knowledge and also a GOOD CEO that really looks after the managers and staffs.
good,"learn a lot in diversity and learned how to work as a team, family oriented work place."
good,"I have grew up at Wendy's, and I learned how to manage, multi-task, and I have learned customer service and rapport. The hardest part of my job is to produce quality food in a timely manner and the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be my co-workers."
good,"Managers at my Wendy's location were very understanding of my pregnancy and, not only did they let me off for each appointment with my OB, but one manager even went and got clothes for my baby every month to help me out. I enjoyed working here, and, if not for the fact that I have moved since I worked here, I would gladly return."
good,"Everyday was a good day, we use to learned very good things, the managements was very excellent like the co-workers, but the hardest part was closing,but the least was leaving clean for everybody"
good,"I've been a cashier for about four months, and have learned very quickly how important the customer is to the entire franchise. My job is to make sure that they are taken care of and overall satisfied with their service. Often times this need to give them what they want led me to conflicts between the rules of the company and the needs of the consumer, so I would often ask a manager before making such decisions. The outcome was never the same."
good,"I have a passion for cooking and food in general, so working in a fast food restaurant is fun for me. the culture was alright but i more so enjoyed just working in a restaurant."
good,Loved the staff and wok environment at Wendy's. Majority of managerial staff was fun to work with even when things got a little stressful they did what they could to keep everyone motivated and working diligently. The hardest part of the job was working on busy days when co-workers called out last minute but we found a way to make it through.
good,i like working there just need more hours. friendly people fast paced good starting out job hoping to find something better
good,"Wendy's always was a good environment at a good location and was busy often. Everyone was motivational and realistic along with the humor in the crew family. Most of the crew made everyone feel welcome and want to grow in the company, Managers made everyone feel equal including themselves but still had the last words. I could honestly say they paid me well. Day in and day out work would fly by so fast because of my associates. Sometimes i would look forward to coming back in to work."
good,"If fast work is your style, then this was worth the first job experience. Family like setting, and long rush hours.  Iv'e learned how to manage my work station, keeping it organized and clean. Iv'e learned how to manage my time and my equipment. The easiest part of the job would be the basic daily chore like work, and keeping my station organized. The hardest part would be the hit from the rush hour, but being able to take the hit is the part of the job, and not so hard anymore (with experience)."
good,"Always hard at work, have to keep up with time serve customers with a smile and to keep store cleanliness and organization."
good,"Clock in, perform duties at at work station, rotate stations if necessary. I learned how to prepare food, gained experience as a cashier and gained customer service skills. Management was great, friendly, and supportive. Pay just was a little too low. The hardest part of the job was working so hard for such little pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was the area of the work place and the scenery."
good,"i enjoyed the people i worked with a fast pace work environment"
good,"The Wendy's company was my first place of work. I learned many things and acquired many skills, making me more confident in the work force."
good,A typical day at work is always fast-paced.  I have learned a lot.  Management offered to teach me things that I was willing to learn about and needed to know for the position I was in.  Co-workers were helpful.  The hardest part of the job was when others didn't show up for work as scheduled and the shift had to work short. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting promoted.
good,"Lots of room for advancement. You learn a variety of different skills. You get a lot of support from higher management. "
good,"Working at Wendy's definitely made me a better workers. It increased my abilities with teamwork, and as an individual. "
good,My coworkers and the managers are all great to work with. The crew is kind of like a giant family. The fast-paced work day is nice because there is always something to do. You're usually not bored. Employees that can't keep up or just don't do their jobs don't last very long which is also nice since everything in the store is timed.
good,Fast paced and energetic work environment. Coworkers are very helpful and management is very lenient and willing to help
good,It is an exciting adventure. You will meet amazing people.  They have high standards and great guidelines to make you successful. Enjoyable environment.
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's involves serving customers and helping customers with any enquiry's regarding ice creams cakes etc. It also requires thorough cleaning of the whole kiosk once closed. Because of my age I have been given the responsibility of closing the shop, this means making sure the store is up to the standards required after cleaning, and also cash handling at the end of the day by sorting out the money and putting it away. My co-workers and I get along, its a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the stress when it gets busy. Although I can deal with it well, its hard working with 4 other people in such a small space. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have a joke with my managers and also my other staff members."
good,"I learned how to keep my emotions at home not at work. My coworkers were great, and very helpful. The hardest part about working for Wendy's is their drive through. One out of the five managers was a joy to work with i loved coming in to work when she was on shift."
good,"What i have to say about wendys management team is that there always on point and willing to teach at any moment. there super friendly, easy to approach."
good,"A typical day a Wendy's requires you to come to work clean and ready to make a delicious meal for our wonderful customers."
good,"Un día típico consisitia de mantener todo limpio, ayudar a colegas en sus labores, mantener a la clientela feliz con su experiencia al llegar y salir del restaurante. Aprendí a como tratar a la gente y como arreglar problemas ambos con colegas y con clientela. Tambien como tener disciplina y enfoque en mi trabajo y mis tareas. En realidad no hubo nada difícil de mi trabajo, después de un tiempo todo se me hizo fácil y cumplía todo con exactitud y precision. Lo que me gusto mas fue el aprender varias cosas nuevas, practicarlas y desarrollar una comunicación muy asertiva con la gente."
good,"the business is a competive environment. As a manger, you are the focal point in what the customer deals with. it can be trying in dealing with rude guest."
good,Everyone worked together to get the daily tasks done. I helped perform the daily tasks including make customers feel welcomed.
good,"Great workplace, once you become an employee you are greeted with a family felt place. Friendly co-workers, approachable managers, fair hours."
good,"It seems as though everyone loves Wendy at night, because from 5 to 12 we are continually busy. I love to be busy because we are making people day by selling them hot and enjoyable food. Although, it can be tiring and you want to sit but can't."
good,"Clean and very sanitized environment very generous to customers. Always willing to satisfy the needs of customers and customer complaints. Professional management and co workers,Flexible pay and hours."
good,"Good Job, Very Busy something longer hours because its was like the only Wendy's close in Douglas but overall it's something I can deal with"
good,"Working at wendys for the last five years i have learned alot there, from being a crew member to becoming a assistant manager for the store. Now ive seen my fair share of people come and go from that place. Not everyone can handle what goes on in a fast food restaurant, but working there has also made me learn a lot of patience. Not just for waiting in line and receiving wrong order when i go to other fast food places. Also to deal with rude customers as i have dealt with many of those in my five year. Last thing to learn a lot of patience for is other people that u work with, let me tell u what there is a lot of people that dont have any motivation to work. A lot of them mainly show up just for their paycheck and that`s it. That was never me though i always came to work and work i did."
good,"I like to interact with my coworkers , and transmit a peaceful energy no matter what. this way i will transmit this happiness and positive energy to my customers."
good,"Days are usually fast and hard working. The thing I love most is the customers, so kind and respectful. Management is good between the four managers everyone gets the job done. The hardest part of the job is trying not to eat the food. My co-workers are hard working and in high spirits. There is a ton of motivation."
good,"at first I had no probs but then when they moved me to do dishes once in awhile the managers would clock me out hours before im actually done with the work. I told my boss but he didn't do nothing about it so I left that job, but I did love the job bc it kept me busy all the time."
good,"Excellent customer service and quality food. Clean work environment. The crew and management performed more like a family, squabbles included. The entire crew and management would rotate tasks as to stop the monotony, we had crew competitions."
good,"Good management at the time, alright hours when I picked up others shifts, and worked doubles. I like back cash best, washed dishes, made chili, stocked freezer, cleaned, cashier, helped grill, kept busy, and didn't have to fully deal with rude customers. Just take their money, give change, and close the window back!"
good,Working at Wendy's was a good job. I learned how to operate everything in the store. The managers was nice and worked with you.
good,"Working at Wendy's located in Katy, Texas has giving me the opportunity to work in a different environment.  It has also shown me  the importance of conducting strategy and organization as well. When having these strategies in action, it helps prepare for our busiest times for when school let out, and parents drop off as well as teacher comes in. Judging from my personal experience the most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's is communicating with the customers, convincing them to try new things, and seeing the result of satisfaction across their face."
good,"A typical day of work usually starts at 5:30 for me and I go to work and get the store ready for the day and if someone doesn't show I have to pick up the slack so we cant fall behind. I have learned to deal with stress and motivate myself to work harder, Management is good and they know what to expect from me nothing but the best but sometimes too much. Co workers rarely show up for all their shifts, the hardest part of my job is when there is no one to help you but yourself and the most enjoyable part is when its not too busy and we have some down time so everyone can catch their second wind."
good,"Working at the store I am in, it is very stressful and you need to learn how to balance it out."
good,My time there was great because I learned to be a better multitasker. I learned how to be more respectful. It helped me be more confident and be more vocal.
good,It was a pleasant experience to work for this company. Its a good place to start for work experience. The pay is fair and management is good.
good,very easy and fun loved working here everyone is nice and respectful made friends and always took care of my co workers because they took care of me they are the best wendy workers in california
good,"On a Typical day, I would go to the active shift leader to find out what my job position for the moment. then before our shift group gets started we form a huddle(when there are no customers to serve) and discuss ways to make our customer service better than the last. The shift leader then asks each crew member to explain how they can help while working the position they were placed. Then It's Time to work! By the end of the night we are making sure everything is prepared, cleaned, and put away for the following day. I learned all the responsibilities for each position by completing a computerized Knowledge and assessment program for ALL crew members and shift managers.I also received training from the managers and other crew members that had been working there longer than others. This was really great for me because I was able to learn all of the responsibilities of each position and all the proper procedures to maintain a clean and safe environment not, to mention I was one of the best workers with a large improvement in my work ethics and   excellent customer service skills! In the beginning management was a little crazy because of the many different one coming in and out, but by the end of the franchise transition, I think it had improved a lot better. Store manager was very good at her job and she was always finding ways to improve the store."
good,Opened or closed the store. Placed employees accordingly. Talked with customers. Dealt with complaints and concerns.
good,A typical day at work is clocking on and getting straight to work making sure everything fresh and stocked. I learn a lot from nuggets and fries to grill to burgers and etc. The management could be better but its okay. My co- workers are very outgoing people and we work as a team. The hardest par tof my job is when rush hour comes and everybody wants to come in at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I see how happy we make the customers.
good,During my employment at Wendys the days went by quickly. It was a very fun work environment and everybody go along well. Management was awesome if you had any questions or problems you could go to them and it would be fixed or resolved quickly.
good,"fast paced, good co-workers, great customers most of the time, life is what you make of it. Would like to work there again."
good,Busy place watch your hours and your grades if in school. If busy don't expect break. Co-workers are okay stay friendly you might need them in the end.
good,"Get to work , check with my manager what position i am at and what register i had. Once everything was in check i would begin taking orders,depending on what time of the day it was the restaurant will get packed and then you will have to be on your toes. When my shift was just about over i would clean/restock my station and depending if  i closed upfront i would clean the bathrooms/dinning room."
good,"Going to work can be fun or stressful like at any job,"
good,"On a typical day at work i would have to greet and take customers' orders, provide remedies to any complaints a customer may have, and prepare the food for the customer.  I learned how to properly resolve any issues a customer may have at the restaurant.  The management staff was hardworking and serious when they needed to be and also knew how to make the workplace fun when it was called for as well.  My co-workers were fun and knew how to do their position they were assigned to.  The harderst part had to be the keeping up with orders during the rushes at some times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that i am constantly doing a different job on a day by day basis and never know what position i am assigned to that day."
good,walking into work was a joy each day. i enjoyed the people i worked with. if it wasnt for me relocating that is probably where i would be. everyone was welcome and their were lots of smiling faces.
good,"As a part time front till cashier at Wendy's I generally work 9-15 hours each week. I am paid student salary ($10.30/hour). The duties included in this job are typical cleaning jobs such as bathrooms and dining area as well as one ot two bigger cleaning jobs each week; getting drinks, bagging food, and working with the public. Management was good most of the time, all of the managers are really good people. The coworkers were all friendly and inviting for me as well. For every shift employees are given at 50% discount when spending less than $10. The hardest part of the job was cleaning. The cleaning is endless, making it a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job, for myself at least, was working with the public. I enjoy helping others and I believe in good service. This job has helped improve many transferable skills such as communication, teamwork, numeracy, and listening skills."
good,"Have working here for my first job while going to school, it was perfect. They worked with my scheldule. Very friendly co-workers."
good,"The typical day at work was either stressful and tiring or it could of been a good day and still tiring. I say this because, we are always busy and you are required to be actively moving at all times. The management at Wendy's were great. There were some great co-workers and there were some bad ones as well. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a good line time (speed of service) because not everyone moved at the pace you move or at your speed many people were slow. I learned a lot working at Wendy's such as learning how to work well with the customers and co-workers, and also learning how to be fast and precise. The most enjoyable part of my day was making customers happy and leaving with a smile."
good,brings me joy every day to work there. I had a great experience working with my coworkers. I learned new things while I was there also
good,"The Hardest part of the job was that we were sometimes understaffed, which meant that we had twice the normal amount of work to do along with tending to the customers and keeping them happy as well as maintaining the accuracy of their orders."
good,Like helping the customers and hearing different stories.Easy to take orders of customers and deliver to them. Exspecially like the drive thru window.
good,the benefits as a manager is good. 2 weeks of vacation 3 days of personal and 48 hrs of sick. you can get 401k and medical and dental..
good,I enjoy meeting new people and learning different things. It is also fun working as a team and getting the job done together.
good,I work in wendys every time I have no class in school. I've learned a lot especially to my experienced the standard in the store. they managed strictly so that there's no mistakes or complaints to the wendys. the hardest part of the job is when the customers always complaining but we did our best to give his/her needs and wants. the most enjoyable part of the job is the company of each of us.
good,a typical day at work is taking care of customer's order. Cooking fries and chicken nuggets all day and serving customer's food.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's and I had to learn about the strict system of rules and how they applied to myself as well as the other employees. I worked various shifts and had to learn how to close as well as open as a manager. Overall the job was not difficult, but I did end up leaving for a better opportunity."
good,"a typical day at work involves me getting everything ready to close which includes cleaning and making everything look nice, I've learned a lot about the food safety guidelines and how to put up a lot of truck management is great always keeping us on our feet and busy, coworkers are always a pleasure to be around and always help each other out the hardest part of the job is getting out at 3am the most enjoyable part is seeing everything accomplished"
good,"My typical work shift best described in one word, presumption. Working as the single cook/grill in the fast food industry, let alone Wendy's was simple enough. I had to maintain enough food to serve at all times, while not over stocking food and wasting it. The real hard part was managing and taking educated guesses on the expected orders. The more experienced co-workers would understand the responsibilities of working as a grill, so they would help on the side, such helping re stock. Even though most 9 hour shifts were slow but went by as a blur, I enjoyed entertaining the thought that Wendy's could not function and live up to their existence without me that day."
good,I enjoy coming to work and interacting with the customers. I enjoy the new challenges that I'm face with because they help me grow. I don't always enjoy my hours because it's hard to make a class schedule around them.
good,I loved the staff and did not like the team managers.  I was lost my car and was able to still keep my job cause the manager changed my hours.
good,Great place to work. I really enjoy training crew and managers. Wendys always puts quality first. We train our people from day one to just be nice
good,"liked working here until they started promoting jerks to supervisor positions. not cool at all"
good,A typical day at work for me would start at11am i would start by stocking up my work area and count my register to make sure all money was accounted for at the end of my shift.Most of my day consisted of placing orders and counting as well as receiving money for their purchase. i learned how to understand all types of people and how to  listen effectively. The most enjoyable part was to fulfill the clients needs. Also interatcting and meeting different people.
good,"My typical day at work is fun and filled with positive energy. Learing alot of new things from management, cowokers and even cutomers in which is always fun and enjoyable."
good,"Typical day was busy"
good,"When I First Started I Loved The Job, Very Easy, and Reliable Money. I Still Like The Job But I Cant See Myself Still Doing It Anymore. Its Unorganized & Wanted To Much Of My Time For So Low Of A Pay Also Wouldn't Give Break Many Times and Cut Into School To Much."
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's. My co-workers are awesome! I look forward to coming to work because everything just flows so smoothly. For your lunch you get a 50% discount and free drinks on the days that you work. The schedules are very flexible and the pay is good. Sometimes things get a little hectic, however if you put your mind to it and exercise those wonderful Customer Service Skills you possess then everything will be great."
good,I always open the restaurant at 7:30 am and waking up is the hardest part for me. I learnt how to deal with all sorts of customers in my 5 years of working and now I can deal with any type of situation. Managers and co-workers really enjoy working with me because they say I bring energy to the work place. The part I enjoy most is when I make other people feel good and help them.
good,"On your feet 7-10 hours"
good,I go into Wendy's in the morning to prep food and machines to cook for the day. I learn lots of safety procedures and how to communicate with customers and to help out where help is needed. We have a great boss name Kevin Scott who is a great leader for this location. Everybody likes me because i always have a smile on my face with a positive attitude everyday I walk in the door. When I work I do not see anything hard about my job. i just enjoy talking with customers when able to many nice people in the world.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Good atmosphere . Friendly customers ."
good,Working there was fun the co-workers were really nice until a certain point. The managers were there when I need them they treat me like family there. The hardest part was being on grill cause there so much you got to manage. But working taught me there always be someone you work with that will push your buttons.
good,"As, I would go, and check in with my crew and make sandwiches or wash dishes more than likely. My supervisors was always there to help me learn from my mistakes."
good,"A typical there would consist of running a cash register for four hours during my shift. Another cashier would replace me and I would do others things such as; bank deposits, inventory counts to insure that we had enough products to meet customers needs, and making schedules for crew members."
good,"Wendy's was my very first job and I would recommend the job to someone else if you are not in a financial bind. The work load varies from time to time. Tuesdays might be the busiest day of the week consistently because of the Wesley group but a typical day isn't so bad. Wendy's is also one of the top spots to visitors come to eat after high school games or any other event. The managers were very reasonable when it came to scheduling time off and were always willing to work around practice, exams, vacations, etc.. The hardest part of the job was cleaning if the crew was short. Sometimes we would have to take orders and drop/prep food for customers and than get back to cleaning in order to be done in time. Working a job such as this one definitely gives you a great deal of respect and patience for those who also work in similar areas. I learned a lot from the job and would have continued working there but the pay isn't so great for someone like me who does not have any financial help when out of school and concerned about monthly bills and food expenses."
good,"A typical day is all about the customers. Making sure they come happy and leave even happier. I learned how to make all the foods, and even operate machines used to help cook foods. The managers are helpful they also hop on board and help whenever needed. Co-workers are all friendly and all work together as a team. The hardest part of the job is not getting frustrated or confused when its busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when its not so busy."
good,The company offers employees an opportunity of develop in different areas and grow.  Also you oferce employees discounts on food
good,"Wendys was a different fit from any type of hands on work i have experienced. When clocking in for shift start always had to make sure my work station was clean and stocked. Always had to pay close attention to monitor for upcoming orders. throughout shift not much would change in till late even came when where we slowly close down cooking stations as orders start slow down. start cleaning floors, get dishes done, also always need to have the diner part cleaned up. working with the shift managers was not bad. got along with all three different managers very well. on every thursday afternoon a delivery truck would show and drop off product to restock stores inventory. so i would have to unload it with one co-worker."
good,"Wendy's was my first job while attending West Virginia University. it was hard to adjust to a little bit but the schedule was flexible. i have worked there for over four years and it stablized my life while being in college. The only thing that really bothered me was the fact the pay rate stayed around 7.25-7.50. After so many years of working there, I expected a little more than what I was getting hence why I quit and found a better paying job. The management was very well put and organized. The coworkers were easy to get along with and we all became close friends or were friends before working there. since it was mostly students a lot of us knew each other already from classes."
good,Working in fast food really has helped me with my speed and learning how to multitasking skills. Learning to hear customers while doing another job has influenced other jobs obtained afterwards.
good,no complaints i needed a job and thay gave me the chance i wiould refer any teenager or person in desprite need of a job to apply
good,"Fast-paced, high-volume workplace.  Not bad working there, but it can get frustrating when dealing with people who want their food just so, who don't agree with condiments on certain items, etc.  Also hamburger smell sticks to you really bad."
good,"A typical day at Wendys would be me coming in clocking in and getting right into work. This was my first job after high school, I learned so much about people and how they act. I learned that customers and many others that I worked with were not always bad. Management was great. If I had any kind of issues or questions  they were always there to help or answer. I made a lot of friends working at this company my co workers were great and we always helped each other out no matter what and taught each other many things and tried to make it easier for everyone. the hardest part of the job would be getting up early and being there by 5 AM. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with everyone. I loved it."
good,"Running various reports and recording them on an hourly basis"
good,I looked foreword to coming to work everyday. Great crew and management. Customers were very nice.
good,"I have had several jobs, but never seen the high quality of team work until working with Wendy's. Each manager runs the store the same way the other managers do its easier than worrying about what and how to do certain things depending on which manager you work with. Nice working atmoshpere."
good,A typical day at work at this job was it was slow until lunch time. You had to be extremely careful when taking orders. I worked on the register most of the time but I got a chance to learn how to make burgers. The management was good and the co-workers were okay. I just stayed to myself. There was nothing really hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was taking orders. I actually like doing that and communicating with people I never met.
good,day at work consists of feeding lots of hungry people.  managers and coworkers are very ecclectic and interesting.  opportunity for advancement is definately there.  lots of hours for low pay.
good,During the time of working for the company I enjoyed myself yet always wanted to better myself. I had good management yet poor team work that set us back. Which in turn angered customers but I always had the mentality that the customers are always right
good,i worked there for so long it became the reason i wanted to go to culinary school
good,"I have worked for Wendy's for about 12 years off and on, it is a really great place to work if you have not started a family yet. To have this job you need to be very flexible with your schedule."
good,"Fast paced environment , I learned the overall function of the restaurant from payroll to running a drive thru .The hardest part of the job was leaving at 4am and having to return at 10am for my next shift . I enjoyed my coworkers and the quality of the product , but mostly the customers we served on a daily bases"
good,"Working at Wendy's not only taught me responsibility but it also taught me that with hard work there is a chance of reward. A typical day at work for me consisted of floating, meaning i did front cash, dinning room, fries and drive thru as needed. Wendy's is big on team work which i think is beneficial to life because it is not a skill everyone has. Some days i wanted to quit but i can say my good days outweighed my bad days"
good,While I worked at my Wendy's I had fun most days. I was very quick to learn and was taught everything in the store very quickly. The managers were wonderful and the crew outstanding save a few select people. I enjoyed everyday of work even if it did get a little hectic and hot at times.
good,"I loved working for the Wendy's corporations. I always excelled and caught on with their fast paced environment very well. I saw myself climbing the ladder there until a lack of management took the whole team down. I still wish I was employed with this company but, unfortunately they laid me off without proper investigation of the true issues residing in the store."
good,"Greet customers as they walked in the door, receipted money for parts and service customers, answered  multi-line phones, I learned a new computer system. My office manager was great, The sales people I worked with were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the files in order, and filed correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, the friendly staff I got to work with, and a nice new building to work in."
good,"Managed shifts to ensure customer satisfaction,profit and loss trained employees,worked alongside general manager to ensure shifts ran properly,the most enjoyable part was taking care of customers"
good,I had lots of fun working here. I met lots of interesting people.
good,"Working in fast food i have learned that time is key. I loved working 5p.m to 4a.m. during those times of day you are taught alot more about food preparation and you get more hands on experience because its not as busy as it would be during the day. I loved each and everyone of my co-workers, we all worked as a team each second of the day, we all worked together so we wouldnt be in the restaurant longer than expected. I was very nice with management, and i loved the hours they were giving me. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work and seeing everyone with a smile on their faces. There were many hard working employees."
good,"The typical day at work was, when I was getting better and faster at the different jobs that I was working on. And also I didnt do the same job position's all the time, I did diffferent things. Thats why I liked that job too."
good,"Running a Wendy's as a Training Store Manager gave me a lot of personal satisfaction.   I loved spending time with Store Manager Trainees and helping them develop by showing them how to ""run"" a shift.  As soon as I started as a Trainee, I knew I wanted to train.  The DM's that I had were great and pushed me to do more.  The people I worked with were great.  Balancing running my store and staying on top of multiple trainees was challenging.  But when you see those new managers put it all together, it is worth all the time I spent."
good,"I would go in and immediatly start washing pots which have built up from the morning, later on i usually move onto the till while doing others jobs like taking food out to customers, washing & drying pots, collecting the customers plates after they have finished. I enjoy working with the owners as they have confidence in me and most importantly trust me . I feel i have learnt good customer service skills and am liked by many of the customers. One of the hardest parts of the job is when is gets it busy and i have to multi task as i have to remember where each order is sitting while doing other tasks so i have to keep my concentration otherwise people would be getting the wrong food orders."
good,This was my first management job out of college. Wendy's had an excellent training program. I still have some lifelong friends made from this experience.
good,"I had a great time meeting new people. I love the food and the place was always different. I loved working the holidays everyone got us, employees, all in the mood to be cheerful! I made sandwiches everyday. I prepped food to be made during the week and I cleaned every part of the restaurant. It was pretty interesting."
good,"Nice environment, Friendly customers, great coworkers. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to new managers from different stores"
good,Had fun working there and met a lot of cool people. fast paced. willing to work with you when your sick. Pay wasn't great but its a job.
good,"It's a good experience working in a prestigious company like Wendy's restaurant of Canada. I just need to make a hard decision for a better career growth. I have learned every single detail on how to be an efficient food attendant, on how to give a good service. I give all my full respect to wendy's, but as part of being a human, we need to grow more and experiences that can be added to our journey called life."
good,"Excellent coworkers. I had to clean, be cashier, handle foods, etc."
good,"Wendys was my first job and throughout my many years working there I performed many tasks and learned many valuable lessons.  "
good,"Wendy's is a very busy job life, with a lot of rules and regulations to follow and a lot of satisfying you have to do, in order to stay in business."
good,"Fast paced work day, constantly moving, bending, stocking, communicating. Team members create a fun working zone"
good,"Good company to work for. YOu work hard, and they will work with you....as much as can be allowed."
good,Their was a lot of messing around but when work need done it was done and nothing can change or happen till their as free time or able to.
good,Loved working for this company. I learned how to really train employees and managers working here.  it has helped me in every job I have had since.
good,Being the night grill cook was a fun job.  The pace depended on the time of day and day of the week. worked with a lot of fun people who all enjoyed being there and being a part of the experience.
good,"my coworkers are fun to work with. The management is a little crazy, we've gone through a couple GM's since I've been working there."
good,the smell of the dead birds was one of the most horrible things about it. but if you were not a constant in the system that everyone else was use to then you felt as though in some places you were an outsider.
good,A typical work day would require me to ring up customer`s food or to even sometimes prepare food and if I was closing to clean the bathrooms and dinning area. The management was very nice and understanding this was my first job . The co-workers were nice always helping me if I didn`t understand some things . I learned that no matter how rude and nasty a customer is being to you it is your job to stay polite and respectful . There were no really no hard parts to this job besides when it got extremely busy and having to work in a fast pace.
good,"I believe Wendy's has given me a head start on how to work with crew members under the direction of a manager and I have appreciated the opportunity to work and earn a salary.  The hardest part of the job is getting complaints and redeeming ourselves from them, but the most enjoyable part is making the customers feel happy and appreciated and working with crew members who are all in position and ready to help the team."
good,At wendy's a typical day was fine. There was rushes and there was times there wasn't customers. So then when there wasn't any customers we would stock things that needed stocking or we would clean the dining area or clean the bathrooms. If you were in the back window you would take orders and wash dishes. I learned a lot about working with others and learned how to act with different personalities. My management was fine. My co-workers were helpful at times. The hardest part of the job wasn't really anything. I'm a fast learner so I catch on quicker than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being able to help others in need.
good,"First signing in and discovering work station with management. Learning for me here was working with others again still better. Prepare & serve hot grill foods, fryer foods, fixing of meal sides & salads. Keeping station clean, sanitized & stocked. Sometimes having to few team workers was harder on all. A very prepared kitchen and everyone well being all was well."
good,"a typical day through work would include clocking in at whichever time they offered me for the day, then waiting for cars to pull up to the drive through speaker. I usually only took their money, between cars I washed the dishes that we used at the restaurant in the tumbler."
good,Focusing on the customer and providing them great service. being able to manage great workers
good,"I floated, so whatever the manager asked me to do I did. It varied from cooking to cleaning to sometimes cashier, or food prep. I learned a lot about cash management and customer service. The hardest part of the job was, set aside the minimum wage, dealing with upset and angry customers with a smile on your face. I enjoyed the variety of the customers that come in and being able to converse with them while their food was being prepared. I enjoy putting a smile on peoples faces."
good,"Fun, fast paced environment. I enjoyed working there. I learned how to work a deep fryer and make chicken nuggets and fries. My manager was cool and easy going. My crew members were really helpful. Hardest part of the job was clean up time and the most enjoyable part was satisfied customers.Sadly there aren't any benefits and job location was too far."
good,I was responsible for taking orders of customers in a fast paced environment.Taking in money and counting back change correctly as well as accurately.Using active listening to take the orders.and attention to detail to make sure orders were done to specific order request.
good,"fast pace, good environment, alot of work experience, good people to work with"
good,very crazy. lots of people and lots of transactions. i handle all day to day operations on my shift. I answer the phone and handle any and all customer complaints. I follow all labor laws for all employees and ensure all food safety policies are followed at all times.
good,"Not the best job, but great work environment, steady flow of customers and good hours each week."
good,"With the right management, and not too many teenagers, the job is excelent for extra income."
good,"I usually work from 5-10 or 5-close. Very seldom mornings, only if needed. A typical day or work for me would be to stock things continuously as we run out. Take orders until close. There is always a manager around. I work very well with my co-workers. we work together as a team to complete one task after another. I really wouldn't say there is a hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part of working at this job would be keeping the time down and keeping a smile on my face. Also getting tasks done quickly and efficiently while meeting the customers needs."
good,"Wendys was a fun place to work, it was fast paced during busy times, but manageable. the management was pretty decent, and coworkers were awesome! I loved working at wendys."
good,"Management was always changing, but the managers they brought in were always pretty cool to work for. My last general manager was the best though, she worked with getting me promoted and went from the front counter to shift manager within a years time."
good,"A lot of experiences in that workplace such as encountering different types of people, such as encountering disrespectful customers on the weekends. As wendy's Manukau is near from a pub, but because of great team we have we got through it."
good,What I learned at Pilot was that the customers come first. The customer is our number one priority and we will do anything we can to make them happy. Working with customers and other employees to be the fastest Wendy's in Columbus was a typical day at work. Pilot is a truck stop so the faster the better for the truckers.
good,"The typical day at Wendy's involved preparing the team for the day. I created a monthly log of cleaning duties and expectations which helped keep the team on track and motivated. Each day was logged so we knew what tasks had been completed. I had to give each member their placement for they day which included: lobby, cashier, drive through, grill, sandwich station, and coordinator."
good,"I would get in put my stuff away go and clock- in Than i would start working in the front register, i would move around to keep busy since sometimes in the weekdays afternoon are not that busy. I would clean, pickup garbage, or just stocking up on napkins etc.I learned to manage money,work register an how to make chili which is not that great but if the FDA is fine with it than i guess I'm fine with it.It was my first job. My co-workers were fun an friendly,very helpful too.The hardest part o the job is seen a long line of customers on Sunday mornings but is fine that's the business, and the most enjoyable thing in my job for me was been in the grill making burgers weird but true."
good,"My wendy's experience was interesting. I was constantly thinking about how I thought I did way more than other people just to see how much others really did. As far as fairness goes in fast food, I have not found a restaurant that beats wendy's. I wish I was paid for training people."
good,"On a typical day I end up doing most of the work; I run the register, I also have to clean the lobby and keep the condiment stand clean and well stocked, sometimes I help coordinate the food, and I have to keep the bathroom clean."
good,"in the field of fast food it can be very demanding, you have to come to work. The moment you arrive work begins yet management and the other employees are very welcoming. management is very strict on procedure which is probably the hardest part of the job. This is because during rush times you as a human tend to forget or over look minor details. but as they say practice makes perfect so these challenges become fun and exciting making it fun to be in the work place."
good,"Was my first really job, it was fun but at the time it got in the way of school. Worked very fast paced everyday"
good,"My typical work day included assisting customers, taking orders, cleaning and stocking. I learned how to adjust to the different attitudes and personalities of guests and how to maintain a safe and clean work environment. All of my co-workers were very friendly with outstanding personalities. We all were like family and shared an incredible bond. The hardest part of this job was adjusting to its fast pace but after a couple days, i grew accustomed to its activeness. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be delivering great customer service and receiving excellent feedback."
good,"You will be well trained for a position that you are assigned."
good,I pretty work as a crew member at Wendy's. Front and drive thru cashier. Also front and dining room maintenance. Also food prep
good,I like Wendy's its okay to work there overall I learn how to do a lot things at work like prep food and I had very friendly people at work like customer's the main thing I hate the most is not getting help on a certain thing I don't understand and the most enjoyable thing is when people work together as a team
good,Management was friendly and the co-workers were productive. The hardest part of the day was lunch time and the most enjoyable part was being able to help make customer's time at Wendy's enjoyable. what I learned from this company was that teamwork makes a difference in the workplace.
good,Working at Wendy's was an awesome experience. It laid the foundation for my knowledge of the fast-food industry.  Everything about working there left me with a good feeling.
good,It felt like family environment. Co-workers were friendly and had a great time working there. But even after a year there was no raise.
good,"Was a great first job. I had a good time there, but i'm currently looking for a Junior IT Security position. It's time I begin my career in a entry level job."
good,"A typical day at work for me is training or helping a new crew member or making sandwiches for front line and drive thru. I've learned to deal with multiple personalities at once. My management at my store had a very good team we were all there for each other, but now one of are strongest leaders are leaving. My co workers need better training. The hardest part of the job is new crew members who don't know they position well enough to be on line. The most enjoyable part of the job is management."
good,"•	Handled currency and credit card transactions quickly and accurately"
good,Working at Wendy's was a good experience. I learned how to make multiple types of drinks. I Learned how to work the drive threw window. Working with the employees was a great experience they were all great and full of teamwork. The Management was also very Respectful and well understanding. I wish I could've stayed at Wendy's but at the time I got a job offer for AmercInn and I couldn't work both jobs at the same time so I had to make a fast decision in a job.
good,"I love to start my day early to get off to a good start so the whole day goes very smooth. I also love to train people to do the right things and to move onto the next level of management if that's what they decide to do.  There's nothing hard about this job. All the Managers at this location is willing to learn but sometimes they get distracted and forget what there next step would be to move on."
good,"This was a fun Job to work at, It felt so lively there. No real issues with members of crew or management."
good,"Al ser yo mi propia jefa me exigia mas de lo que se puede hacer asi pasaba gran parte del dia alli y nunca estaba satisfecha con el trabajo,"
good,okay workplace like any other job it just depend on your co workers if you work with a positive staff than youll be okay
good,"I have worked for Wendy's International for over 6 years now as a float crew which has landed me in 3 different stores in 2 different cities in Missouri. The job is easy and can be fun with the right crew and management, although I have been after a management promotion for 5 years or so, I have just been told to keep trying and my time will come, as they hire random people in off the street as managers who know nothing about the company and 70% of the time they end up failing and the store going through multiple candidates. The pay is great if you are above a shift manager, but they run your life working you 50+ hours a week, but like I said the pay can be great if you bonus your store by running labor, food cost, and questar. I do not intend on quitting my job for Wendy's anytime soon but it just frustrates me that I am responsible for training new managers in positions yet I am making only 8$ after 6 years as a crew title. Just saying."
good,"Its a great pace to dine and work. The customers, as long with the co-workers, are very nice. Management is very good."
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's is very rewarding. Also lots of fun. I learned how to multitask, and patience. Management is very detailed oriented and fair. My co-workers were the best lots of fun and very supportive we also could talk about things other than work. Getting the hang of the job, but after that it was a breeze. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the regular customers and what they eat."
good,A typical day at work starts with counting safe and drawers for each cashier and ends the exact same way. Overall my time with Wendys was great and I learned a lot while being a shift leader I loved my night shift crew. The thing I enjoyed most about the job was being able to be up front and talking to customers being able to help them any way I could.
good,A normal day is busy at the beginning and slows down then picks back up later on. I learned how to work with people who don't like to work with others anyway. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is happy and satisfied. The management is okay. Could be better.
good,wendys was aa challenging company because you never knew if u were going toget a steady flow of customers or if you were go to get bundles of people coming in every two minutes. wendys required you to work hard at getting the customers food prepared and made to order as quickly as possible while meeting all their expectations. my coworkers made it enjoyable to work with them and when it came to rush hour every one worked to together effectively.
good,"Over all my job at Wendy's consists of creating enjoyable dining experiences for customers by providing fast and efficient service and attending to customer needs, resolving customer complaints regarding others, maintaining appearance of restaurant by performing restock and maintenance procedures, utilizing exceptional service skills by taking food orders and serving drinks in an outstanding manner, and training new associates on product knowledge, selling skills, customer service, and other operations. "
good,"my review indicates that it was very busy, very productive, and very fast pace. it kept you on your toes. co-workers were very friendly and understanding when I needed time off. my hours were reduced and had to have a career change"
good,"Perform as a crew team player that take customer orders, receive directions, and accomplish many tasks during my shift.  As a crewmember, I man the drive-thru, greet customers, run the register, prepare menu items, load stock, and keep the restaurant clean and inviting."
good,My day at work was normally fun. I learned how to take leadership in a group. I constantly had to help managers with their job. we went threw workers so much that i didnt get to know too many co-workers. the hardest part about my job was doing my bosses work. The most enjoyable was working with all my lovely customers.
good,I would show up and everyone would greet me. Learned basic restaurant safety. Managers were all fun and easy to get along with and same with co workers. The hardest part of the job was closing and the most enjoyable was working with friends.
good,"Tyoical day at work is not too busy except during lunch time, which gets stressful."
good,"Fast pace environment"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the Customers were wonderful.
good,company is good to employees. pay increase and job security.
good,"Wendy's is a really good company to work for, they have a wonderful working environment its fun and your not always doing the same thing all the time."
good,"At Wendy's I have learned a lot of things and it showed me some things that will help me in my life. It showed me about respect, team work, and customer service."
good,basically take care of the customers and make everybody happy.
good,"This job was a fast paces enviroment work place.I processe dth payroll for many Wendy's store in differnet states. I also handled the accounts payable for those stores. I than processed the corporate office payroll for the building and the garnishments for empoyees. I have learned a lot at the job and this provided me advancement in my career path. The co-workers were very good team players when others needed help with payroll processing. The harest part of this job was the ability to pass out some of my work to others, i'm my dependent and able to accomplish my job duties in a timely manner. I enjoyed working with others and also outside customers and store managers when needed."
good,When I left I was being trained to take over my own store at 20. I only left because I got married and left the state in a matter of days. I worked long hours and almost everyday and I loved every minute of it.
good,"Very fast paced place to work at.  You need to be able to work well under pressure at times.  I learned how to use the cash register and became much more talkative and am able to carry conversations with strangers now.  My managers were very helpful and encouraging, so were my co-workers.  Everyone was very friendly.  The hardest part of the job was having to work quickly when it was a rush hour.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to work with my friends and make new friends too."
good,Wendy's Internationsal in the begining was a fun place to work. I came as a crew member in one month I was promoted to manager and I was very excited at first then when training I started to see some down fall to the job that made me question my excitment and pause at becoming a manager. Still I stayed with them five years and it was struggle because by being a manager I was responsible even when I wasn't working and the pay was not enought to support me and  my family plus they started to come second so I had to make a call and I did.
good,"overall a good starter job. Basically all it was was a starter job. Was not treated equal, looked down on the younger crowd. but they still payed."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's. Wendy's Management was a bit rocky. We went through multiple General managers to crew members. New members also meant reduced hours. I enjoy jobs that  constantly stay busy and allow me to stay on my toes. The hardest part was keeping up with the new employees. I did enjoy greeting customers with a warm smile, taking orders and preparing meals. I absolutely loved the night shifts, I would close and would have to clean the dining room or grill station, and would not get home until 2 in the morning. Great schedule I enjoyed it while it lasted. The new co-workers were sometimes rude, very unprofessional, but the ones that started around the same time I did were great."
good,alot of moving all the time always u have your down time but when it gets busy be on your a game
good,Very busy with a lot to do always especially since it's located by Disney. Closed at 4am. Interacting with different cultures was very nice.
good,"fast pace,go getting fun busy busy busy. you take orders or make sandwiches. many things to do and never do the same job everyday is diffrent."
good,"fastfood place where people enjoy to come eat, hot and ready"
good,"I loved my bosses, and the employees that I managed. some customers were rude, but that comes with the job."
good,This was my first job and i learned how to properly cook and serve the various food items on the menu as well as to become a successful cashier for the front & drive thru registers
good,"A typical day at work would have consisted of me taking customers orders because my job was a cashier. I took orders mainly in the front of the store, and I also did that for the drive through as well. I also did other miscellaneous tasks such as restocking products, washing dishes, maintaining the cleanliness of bathrooms/ dining room area. I learned that you have to be on point and know what you are getting yourself into in a fast paced environment.  I also learned that no matter what kind of people you work with you have to get the job done right together as a cohesive team. The management there was no to bad, the management was strict but flexible at the same time. The hardest part of the job was probably having to deal with 'back-ups' of the lines of customers when I had to wait for food to finish or something, but all in all I did my best as a cashier. I took it to myself to do something else while I was waiting for something else to be finished cooking. The most enjoyable part of that job was when people told me that I had a nice smile and they appreciated the good customer service that I provided unto them. "
good,"Although the fast food business can definitely be stressful, I believe everyone should have to work for a fast food company once in their lifetime. Wendys taught me much more than I thought possible. They were always encouraging and allowed advancement within the company for people who deserved it. I had had offers to become management three times but turned it down because my priorities were more set on family life and school but it would have been worth it to take the management. Wendys was more than a job, it was a family."
good,"A typical work day is to just put in a customer food order on the cash register and to collate money and clean up when needed. You learn every day, so what can say. Are manager was pretty cool, and co-worker was to. The hardest part of the job was to here customer complain about there order not done right and to do it over the right way also cleaning up after messy people also in sometime we don't even take a 15 min break because we be so busy. So by the time we no it, it could be time to go home.The most enjoyable part is at the end of the day."
good,My workplace is very professional. Working at this was very knowledgeable 
good,i would get there after getting out of college and talk to the customers  that came through my window and i would laugh and have fun with them i would get good reviews and they kept coming. i enjoyed the peace that came with the job
good,This is a company that offers advancements if you work hard enough for it.
good,Hours were very good. Enjoyed working there.  I work as a cashier and I also prepared the food such as make sandwiches and salads.
good,"A typical day of working includes handling customers none stop. I've learned that you are there to please the customer and to make sure that they have a great experience. My  co-workers are helpful and friendly. The hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult customers, because there will be some you cannot please. My job is enjoyable because I get to deal with people and provide them with great customer service.  "
good,"Not so great no good managment old manager got fired for theft."
good,"A typical day at work included finding out which position I would be working at including running the cash register (front and drive-thru), preparing sandwiches, running the grill, preparing french fries, or being a coordinator. Depending on which position I worked at, I had various jobs. I would also clean whenever we had downtime, organize and re-stocking my station. I learned how to smile and be polite to customers even when they weren't really nice to me. My management was really good. They worked with us and if we did something wrong, they told us what we did wrong and helped us to fix it. My co-workers were very team oriented. The hardest part of the job was making sure the orders were correct while also being fast with our service times for drive-thru. The most enjoyable part of the job was also the hardest part of the job. While it was difficult to make sure i got the orders out fast and efficient, it was also fun to try and get the customers out in a timely manner and faster than others."
good,"i would start off by planning myday,then i would set up my charts and see who will be trained more on their position.the hardest part of my job was dealing with all different personalities.the enjoyable part was to see a customer smile."
good,It's an okay place to work.  Just a stepping stone until a better tip job comes along.
good,I was a seasonal worker every April-June I would return each season to Pricing and stocking areas needed for more plants. I also helped kids that entered the greenhouse plant a flower that they could take a free flower home. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers. I had a flexible schedule.
good,"Wendy's has been my favorite place to work at so far. Despite the short staff we have had for the past two year, i love the energy im able bring and great customer service i provide. All the regular customers know me by name and others constantly compliment me on my good work. Our crew isn't very committed, so I usually have to work two to three different positions at a time which i actually enjoy. It makes the time go by quickly and it increases my ability to multitask. Ever since I started at wendy's i just enjoyed working in fast food and any fast pace job. My manager treat me well as well as others. "
good,"Despite working around fast food I enjoyed working with my managers and along side the other crew members. Wendy's works hard to create a functional, efficient, and understanding work environment. "
good,I enjoyed working here where you get to have more contact and conversation with the customers but the work/life balance was a little off.
good,I loved the people i worked with. Loved how i was always busy. Never bored. Loved talking to customers. 
good,"A 7-8 hr shift, I 've learned a little bit of  the scheduling procedure for the week, a shift of maybe  5 employees,  the hardest part of my job was not enough employees on a shift and management not helping out in rushes, the most enjoyable part is working with people that like to earn money and actually work."
good,I worked for a franchise store. It is a good company to work for if you like fast paced sometimes tiring work. The management staff are well knowledged in all aspects of the company. It is a family style environment that is fun and laid back at times but also very professional when need be. The hardest part I would say would be handling some of the customer complaints as a manager. The most enjoyable part for me was seeing customers happy and satisfied with the food and service.
good,I found that this company was a good fit for me at the time.
good,"what i learned alot from working with this company for couple of years is that i been motivated i been taught of how to managed the store and the people i work with how to work as a team,how to focus on your main goals of each day..."
good,Worked here for a summer job. Had fun and met with new workers. Worked hard to meet the customers demands.
good,"Work on a daily basics was steady and good with a steady flow of customers coming into our restaurant, This was my first job and I have learned a lot working here as I was taught all potions in our restaurant being able to work at any position needed too, learning how to deal with customer complaints and how to treat customers with a friendly and just be yourself attitude. I've also learned how to maintain food and restocking supplies within our restaurant ensuring that we were ready for our lunch and dinner rushes. I have also learned how to count money and handle the cash registers while taking orders for our customers. Management at times were lost and sometimes didn't know what they were doing causing a lot of confusion within the business but were great people to work with. Co-workers here are great workers and always wanting to get the job done and was a pleasure to work with them as I created some great friendships working here. Overall the job wasn't that hard to do and there was no real hard part during the shift, but the only problem was not being recognized for the hard work I would do, enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the great people working there, while having a fun but professional time doing it."
good,Very fast paced the poeple are nice to work for and with. The hardest part of the job of course is because it is fast food and the pay will never be what I would like to earn. What I need is a job with benefits and room for advancement.
good,a very friendly corporation to work with. the management was really nice and are flexible with giving hours. overall a really nice environment to work in. all the co workers were helpful and understanding. I really enjoyed interacting with customers and sometimes the difficulty was dealing with some customers who could not understand English as well.
good,"The number one thing i learned throughout the 6 years Ive been with this company is that the customer is number one Ive met a lot of cool people ,but it does get stressful at times."
good,"Loved working there, the owners were amazing. It was an overall very enjoyable experience"
good,"This is your typical fast food job, where one can do anything from cashier, to mop the floors. This job is ideal for students such as myself. The staff and management worked very well with each other as times got super busy."
good,"- Handling cash counter, Preparing food as per order, cleaning etc."
good,un dia en wendys era de siempre estar trabajando.
good,A day at work is not bad as long as you maintain a good attitude and try to have fun. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers.
good,Awesome i love everything about this job mainly the people plenty of laughts. management is crrazy great. ive learned to work under extrem pressure. the hardest part were inspections lol.
good,a typical day would be assisting customers with their orders. making customers smile and seeing them leave happy is always a positive
good,"Wendy's is a great employer for students. They offer flexible hours, but not a high pay amount. I wouldn't recommend it for adults who need to earn more."
good,i never got to involved with the workers really but the atmosphere was great.
good,"Come in with no problem, always on time , happy to be there , An work every hard. Everyday you learn something new such as; how to do a different postion, how to deal with all kind of custmers. Managetment is hard on making sure everything is that is being handed out is safe and safe to eat. Also making sure we meet all requirements that our postion requires. Everyone works together on doing the right thing, getting thing out as fast as possible and making sure our custmers are happy. The hardest part is making times. This such thing is a timer , that when a car comes times us on how fast we can get things done. The parts thats enjoyable is making every one happy and knowing your doing your job right at all times."
good,"Wendy's is a fun, fast-paced, high-energy environment, where everyone on the team works hard — and works together — to satisfy our customers. You can gain experience in all aspects of restaurant operations, from customer service to food preparation and cash handling. In addition, you learn valuable life skills, such as time management, multitasking and the ability to perform under pressure."
good,Interaction with customers. Taking orders from the public. I did pretty much what was asked of me.
good,I worked in a Wendy's but not for Wendy's international. I worked for Pilot Flying J. I enjoyed the fast pace environment that challenged me to think quickly and keep an even temperament. The employees that I worked with are the individuals that made coming to work enjoyable.
good,Wendy's was a nie place to work it was a very hard working job a lot of standing and upset people to deal with but i got along with everyone.
good,worked the lunch hour which was the buisyest hours to work but it was alot of fun
good,I learned a great deal of customer service in the food industry. It is probably one of the worsts when dealing with the public. It seems like people are never satisfied and feel they can take it out on the employees. I learned how to be fast but efficient as well. You can't be fast and sloppy. I learned to use a cash register and how to count change quickly. It was a good job when first starting out at a young age. You learn work ethic and all the other importance that future job opportunities look for.
good,"The managers always made the work day enjoyable, like a family environment. I enjoyed going to work. This company is a great place to start a career and there are always opportunities to move up."
good,"A typical day would consist of lettuce prep, making salads, finding my position for the day. Depending where i'm positioned would very on duties. I know every position besides management. My co- workers and I believe in team member and making the day run smoothly. The hardest part of my job would be me missing my customers up front when working drive- thru window. The most enjoyable part of my job would be my regulars. I have regular customers that come in everyday and they are a joy to interact with. They are like family."
good,I had great experiences at wendys. It made it easier for me to talk to people thanks to that job. I met great people and still have freinds from there.
good,A typical day work working at Wendy's would be to just take care of the customers.
good,"Was my first job at 16yrs old, stayed with the company throughout highschool and worked my way up to being a shift supervisor. My co-workers were a second family to me. We worked well together and as a strong team to provide excellent customer service and amazing quaility food."
good,Friendly environment to work. Learned cashier experience and the day to day of working in a fast paced enviornment.
good,"T&C Foods Inc. is a great company to work for! It is very fast paced and requires attention to detail. Benefits and compensation are about average, but because it is such a small franchise of Wendy's, it's a little more difficult to find management positions available. The owner taught me some great life lessons and truly cares about his employees. Plus, he's in to visit often, which is quite rare for a Wendy's store."
good,"I started at Wendy's my senior year in high school and quickly moved into a management position, i was lucky enough to be trained by the best. Over the 16 years of employment the store that I ran changed hands on 4 occasions. the adjustments were difficult at times but eneabled me to be flexible and to see the ""big picture"" in running a business. Regardless of who owned the company it was my responsibility to deliver the best service and quality to my customers. I had some terrific employees over the years."
good,llegaba me daban mi fondo y me ponia a despechar a las personas y despues me daban media ora para komer con algunos compañeros y bolbia a mi trabajo
good,I felt comfortable working. My co- workers were helpful and friendly.
good,"Cashiering, taking orders, inputting them into the system, making sure the order is correct before giving it to the customer, taking money, giving change, cleaning, breaking down some machines at night. greeting guests"
good,"Prepared specialized hamburgers to order for customers, also cleaned and maintained inventory"
good,"Started at minimum wage. The only thing that made up for that was how fast the shifts went by. My favorite position was taking orders at the drive-thru, but they do rotate you. Front of the house had to clean the bathrooms at the end of the night, which I was not thrilled about. But it was an overall easy job. Good learning experience for high school kids."
good,"Very busy place to work, always something to do. The hardest part of my job was running a shift when there was a benefit. It was the busiest night that I had ever run on my own. The best part of my job was influencing others to be better and to set an example as a manager to the other employees."
good,"NIce place to work but upper management was not kind at times, they needed classes on how to cope with stress, not take it out on employees.Hardest part of the job was dealling with supervisors who got to stressed out. The most enjoyable part of the job was I have meet alot of wonderful people. Customer relations."
good,-Good environment
good,"A typical day at work was fair, I learned how to take control. Management was decent. Co-workers were good workers and listened. The hardest part of the job was restocking everything. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet and know new people."
good,A typical day at work there is very fast-paced; and that how I usualy like it. I have learned how to speed up process. I enjoy most of my coworkers. They would probably be the highlight of most of my days. The hardest part of my job there would probably be coping with that fact that not everyone is always satisfied; even if everything was done correctly.
good,It was a pretty good job especially if you are in school or require a flexible schedule. Having been there for quite a while the place actually grows on you and feels like a family. For the most part most of my co-workers were hard workers and everyone helped everyone. ALOT of times you will get days where you are just by yourself because they are short handed or someone calls out and it is especially frustrating if you are in the window or the front counter cashier..and those days suck!.lol...but for the most part it was a good place to work.
good,Just take orders all day make food and clean........Theres nothing to really learn
good,ok a typical day at work starts off with the plan for the day sales speed of service goals i have learnd people skills very well dealing with all different personalities and moods and your attitude sets the tone for the day for everyone the hardest part is people who have a bad day and take it out on u the enjoyable is knowing i have done my best and maybe made some one else is day better that is what i have learned after many years
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people, it wasn't hard working there. I loved the co-workers and the managers."
good,"I worked mostly as the cashier, sending orders to the kitchen, accepting money, then giving change. I talked to customers, made sure they were comfortable and taken care of. My managers were alright, sometimes they weren't understanding with me, but I liked them overall, once I got to know them. My co-workers were good. I formed trust with a lot of them. The hardest part was that I didn't get enough hours, so I didn't get the income I needed, or a manager and I wouldn't get along. The most enjoyable part was working as a team, and I like working with others in different lifestyles than me."
good,A great foundation builder. Taught me to work hard and to always put forth my best effort on any project that I tackle.
good,i enjoy working for this company and looking forward to a promotion.
good,"My typical day , i punch in, wash my hands & start making customers foods. I learned that its a fast pacing environment & you have to do things as fast as possible without making any mistakes. My managers & co-workers are all friendly & helpful people, i love my job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers attitudes. And my most enjoyable part of the job is making my customers their food & doing it exactly how they want & keeping them satisfied & coming back."
good,"A normal day at work would be from 7 am to 4 pm as the grill operator. I have learned how to be patient with others, how to be more responsible, and it has helped me learn the value of a dollar. Management has changed since I have started working there. I have been offered a promotion multiple times, but I had to turn it down due to being a full time student. I still work nearly forty hour weeks though. My co-workers are the best part of the job. Being happy with the people that you work around has to be one of the most important parts of a job. It is important to get along with everyone, so you can work together. The hardest part of the job is getting yelled at when you have done nothing wrong, and knowing that there is no chance of you getting a raise."
good,My day usually starts in the a.m. I've learned to adjust to so many different attitudes of customers and co -workers and deal with them and realized that I catch on to things quickly. Overall I love the management at the store.My Co workers I overall get along with pretty well.The hardest part of the job to me are inspections. The most enjoyable part of the job the customers always coming back with a smile on their faces
good,The people I worked with were very nice. Had decent hours and had time to spend with my family.
good,"Going in setting up front line,prep salads,tomatoes,onions. counting cash drawers. Making the best we can to see things are getting done on time."
good,A typical day would entail speaking with and meeting customers expectations. Delivering world class customer service. I've learned everyone has there own unique management style and finding which one best fit any one particular situation.
good,A typical day at work for me is working the front line meeting and greeting each customer and making sure they are satisfied not only with their orders but with their service as well. What I've learned at wendys along with other jobs that i have held you must prepare yourself to deal with many different kinds of people from many different walks of life. My co workers are a little touchy at times but they are cool. For me there are no hard parts to this job I've been dealing with people a really long time so i know what to do and what it takes to keep the people coming back. The most enjoyable part of my job is again being able put a smile on a customers face and see the satisfaction that i have provided them.
good,Hectic. Very fast paced. Managers are frequently unorganized. Multitasking is a must.
good,"wendy's taught me alot about being a team player, and area responsibility, working with such a great team i would consider going back."
good,"The job environment was clean, happy, and healthy. My crew mates helped me with difficult tasks and the managers were quick to assist whenever needed."
good,working with food is going to be important that you stay sanitary. i enjoy working with the public.
good,they were very flexible and the hours were consistent. they was not enough room for advance ment
good,"wendys restaurant sells juicy old fashion hamburgers and sea salt fries. they are also know for their salads such as apple pecan chicken salad, baja salad which consist of chilli, pico de gallo and guacamole, blt cobb salad and spicy ceasar salad. eating even just a sandwich at wendys you will leave satisfied."
good,"good place to work as a cook, cashier, hostess, great customers, good co-workers. Didn't care for the backstabbing that went on there from some management"
good,People was always ready to greet new employees and help them learn.
good,Overall enyoable experience. Friendly co-workers and management. Flexible hours.
good,Majority of everything I know I learned from this company. I enjoyed the eastern coast restaurants more than the southern ones.
good,"This was a great place to begin my work experience, I started at 16 and worked up until i was 18. It gave me a great since of what hard work is. If you are a High School kid looking to start working, this would be a great place to do that."
good,It could have been cleaner. And more concerned of about they workers. I had a newborn at the time an they would have me working all crazy hours.. Not complaining it's a great job.
good,"The environment was fast-paced but calm, cool, and collected. We rarely have complaints or wrong orders but if we did we would always fix it and apologize and made the customer happy. The crew members were like family."
good,There’s great customer service but overall it could use a little more friendliness and fairness towards employees. The customers love Wendy’s and that’s what matters but you can’t have repeat customers if you don’t have happy employees.
good,I was a good worker I struggled with a few things when I started because all fast food places are different so pay attention get the job done and everything will be great !
good,Someone’s there gross stuff you have to do and it can be greasy. Customers can be rude but not as bad as a retail or cashier job. Try not to be in a position where you have to clean the men’s bathroom. Flexible hours. Management was nice.
good,Wendys was my first job and I used to be pretty quiet but they showed me how to work with costumers and be more outgoing. The crew was like family to me. Sometimes the management got a bit messy but overall it was a good experience
good,I worked at two Wendy's franchise restaurants in my life and they were both good learning experiences that good learning experiences.  I enjoyed working for
good,I honestly had no type of job experience until I got my first job here and it was very fascinating joining the work business and see how they operate behind closed doors. I’m currently still employed but I’m willing to try anything new 😃
good,"Everyone I see in working at Wendy's has some kind of way they work their butts off for their job, sometimes there are others who are... not as hardworking but mostly me and my co-workers try our best when we're on the line. We also have very good teamwork, even if we have to yell to the other side of the store we will call out what we are taking from the stock or if we are low on stock."
good,"Working for wendys was an experience that I was glad to have. Working fast food is a tough job but if you put your mind to it you can do anything. I loved making the customers happy and smile, it always brought my day to a better mood."
good,If it weren't for a personal complication I would still work there. Wendy's was a very relaxed environment most of the time and everyone I worked with was awesome. Overall a great work experience.
good,"Wendy's is just your basic fast food restaurant and I had a good first job experience, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a long term job. You can work flexible hours."
good,I like to cut up stuff where it belongs I like to use my hands where you at and I do have a disability and makes me a lot slower and or so it can help me out knowing where the place is
good,They were able to work around my schedule all throughout my schooling and were able to work around the sports l participated in. They made sure that the customer were always happy as well were able to give me plenty of work experience.
good,"Good management..great work environment .friendly team members"
good,They had a very nice group of people when I worked there. It felt like a family everytime I was at work. Dealing with customers always sucks at fast food but we all got along and pulled through the days.
good,The management needs work. They need to respect their employees better and handle difficult situations better. They need to recognize the good that employees do as well as the mistakes they make. They need to listen to their employees and try to help and accommodate to their needs at a reasonable time.
good,"If it wasnt for some of the staff and the jealousy issues, I'm sure I would still be working there. The GM is wonderful and I hate that she has to work so hard to pick up the slack of some of her lazy management team."
good,"Fast paced job, have to get the job down and work quick and on time. It was an experience to help me. Nice work place and family friendly, and customers were mostly important."
good,Wendys is very very fast paced however; everyone I worked with was incredibly helpful and supportive. Finding a day off when you needed wasnt bad either as long as someone could cover for you.
good,"I spent my shift working as a cashier handeling sales,cleaning dineingroom.I helped in drive thru and meal prep as well as cleaning the bathrooms and ice cream machine."
good,A typical day at work would be fun depending on how busy it was. If it slow everyone would finish their work while having fun and pick up some extra chores. Regardless of anything everyone got their work done and I loved working their.
good,It’s a nice place to work at a lot of nice people they give u a good amount of hours when you ask off they give it to u and they call u in when they need help sometimes
good,Well going in and opening is kind of easy.  Sometimes you might have to do a little than you expected but you do have you a team that really helps you
good,I enjoyed working for wendy's! The work was fast paced and those who did well in the company always got to move up and go further. I got 3 promotions within 9 months at wendys and 3 raises. It felt like my hard work was actually noticed and appreciated there
good,I like working for Wendy’s but when I worked there my Gm was a meany he put me on the do not rehire list cause he was only giving me one week to work and one week off for about 2 weeks straight then fired me cause I told him I wasn’t coming in I need better hours now I can’t work for Wendy’s any more and love working for them
good,Working there was only fun because of my coworkers. I left because of management. The overall experience was fun most of the time. Management could have used a little worked. They often engaged in employee relations and were rude.
good,Everyone there was very friendly and it was a good working environment. Average pay and up to date schedules. Always polite and very customer friendly.
good,"While working for the Wendy’s franchise I was given the opportunity to become a better employee, learn how to communicate with the customers, I was thought how to make sandwiches the Wendy’s way, and how to be a responsible adult and be at work in time."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of providing excellent customer service, and keeping the restaurant clean and in order."
good,"a good work place, with great hours, and a great environment. Managers are very understanding and make the work place not even feel like work, so it is an enjoyable place to be at."
good,Wendys is good with working with ur schedule and making you feel welcomed. The mangers are good at making sure the shift runs smoothly and the customers are satisfied.
good,A very good place too work if you're looking for a job. I really enjoyed my job while I was there good pay and also the work around you schedule if you have kids
good,yes I enjoyed working at wendys but there became a time and place where it was time for change. I would go back but there has to be room for me to grow in the company.
good,"An eye opening experience to what the workforce is actually like. while being a serious job, it was an abundance of fun and easy to thrive in and be productive."
good,"It was an alright job but the wages wasn't so good for minors. This made me leave but, overall managers were great and let you eat free food. Also, the customers was seldom so, it was pretty easygoing at times."
good,I enjoyed working at this establishment simply because I was excited that I was employed for the first time. Working here is fine and I never had any serious issues as someone new to the work force.
good,"The job was defined as general crew and it was a fast-paced job where one was expected to learn quickly and work hard. The managers were relaxed but still efficient, and the culture was relatively enjoyable."
good,"Not too much to read into. Fast food is a straight up business, everyone is aware of what is expected and what they are getting into. Fast paced, easy to fall behind"
good,I enjoyed the working there a little The people there was a little nice but the customers was kind of rude and we couldn’t really do anything about it but other than that it was a nice job .
good,I worked there for over 3 years and I loved it. There was ups and downs but it’s a good company to work for. Higher ups are nice and very helpful when you need them
good,"Although the job can get stressful at high volume time , it is a good place to work when everyone works together. It helped with my customer service ability because there will be times that you come across rude customers , but all in all its a great place to receive some experience."
good,a typical day at wendys included many thing. actually working there was really productive. i learned a lot of thing. I strengthened my communicating and organizing skills.
good,I think I would give my review rating about a 4 out of 5 stars just because the people there made the workplace fun and enjoyable. My managers were also great people as well .
good,gud place for work.  For Students wendy's gud work place. They gain experience and they should make their carrier in food chain by help of wendy's. It's also gud for full time workers.
good,"Fast paced was any fast food job. The level of professionalism could've been a lot more professional, other than that it wasn't a bad experience working for Wendy's."
good,"- Complete tasks given along with working with other employees in order to give each customer a satisfied and friendly experience "
good,A good place to work. I learned different skills during my work. I learned to work in a team . I also learned to do inventory and audit during my work. I interact different kind of customers during my work. I listen customers and try to solve their problems.
good,"Other than the pay, its a great first job. was able to learn how to work at a fast pace in lunch or dinner rushes. Had the chance to work with the staff as a team"
good,Its an ok work place need to be more pay. I worked until close and staying till 2 3 am then having to be back at 5 6 due to having to clean everything which is understandable. But they pat should definitely be increased.
good,"you learn as you go but have to really see for yourself. can be fun at times and stressful too. pay was ok. company stood behind everyone"
good,Nothing really say about it but it's just an enjoyable experience it's a little tough for you to change yourself and change your schedule around so that you can fit into this place but other than that it's pretty good
good,"It was a good first job,i did stuff like cleaning and collecting back payment, they gave me low hours, but through multiple days. I show up, clean, sometimes collect back payment, then leave. Management was nice but not run so well. I usually liked the job, but sometimes they would keep me way longer without warning, surprising me and my ride."
good,Working at Wendy’s was a fast paced environment. I am a fast learner so it was easy for me to get everything right the second time around. I enjoyed my time working at Wendy’s
good,$450 a month is not enough money to pay bills and provide for your family. We should also be off on National Holidays. If Federal and State are closed then we should be as well.
good,Was an amazing job throughout high school. Very good with flexible hours and paid time off. Just ready to move on to a better and well paying job with better benefits.
good,This job is very fast paced and requires a lot of standing and communication with your coworkers for efficient work. Must be able to work well with others
good,"I had a great experience at Wendy’s. I was able to learn multiple skills quickly and was able to use them efficiently, my only issue was the distance but I was able to find a job closer to home"
good,"Customer service crew members work order counters, registers, and drive-thru windows at Wendy's fast food restaurants. Wendy's team members in the kitchen quickly prepare food made to order. Crew members at Wendy's may also perform cleaning duties in the restaurant seating area, restrooms, or kitchen if assigned."
good,"If you need flexibility from a job, Wendy's is definitely the way to go especially during the summer months. With so many young people getting hired fresh out of school, it's easy to balance different schedules even if they aren't traditional. Would recommend."
good,"There no such thing as “that’s not my job”. It’s all about team. Being reliable, work with Integrity.  Arriving to work 15 minutes early is on time, but if you get to work on time you’re late."
good,"i loved the new store/lobby. the food and lobby atmosphere was a great start to my work day. the food was amazing, but even cooler to be able to make it for the people."
good,It was a solid job to work at temporarily. The management was solid and so was the communication. Overall it was a decent job with a good amount of workers there.
good,The people who I worked with were nice and helped each other all the positions were pretty easy to learn .and  kept me busy and the pay checks were always on time and never short
good,Good place to work got the hours I needed good work environment and good food it was clean other employees help me when I needed it manager was helpful.
good,Wendy is a great way to start a career. The job is fun and has a lot of growth opportunity. The staff is always great and the customer make your job fun as well. The quality of the product is easy to stand by.
good,"typical day was take orders, receive payment, and serve food; doing basic custodial and restocking work time permitting. Management was mostly okay. I did love learning about the methods behind the serving of food."
good,"I love my job, dealing with the public is a joy. Meeting different ppl and talking with them is also a joy. So days it's good and some days it's okay. The hardest part is just dealing with the different personally."
good,"I worked at Wendy's for a short amount of time but I had a great time working there. Manager was cool, he did not yell when we did something wrong he showed us the right way to do it. Everyone there always had a positive attitude and I miss everyone  worked with."
good,Everyone deserves a opportunity and Wendy’s is a good place to find it.one thing I like of this company is that they are helping kids with cancer.....
good,Would still be there if wasnt sold from franchise to corporate.  .turn over is very high nice company to work for. Transferred to different locations to promote  good sales
good,"During my employment t with Wendy's I was provided with great taining and advancement opportunities. A typical day started with a daily shift huddle to ensure that every employee was aware of what was expected to be accomplishd on each shift. Coaching and emplotee development also played a key role in ensuring that all policies, procedures and the brand's mission statement was being practiced and applied on a daily basis. Overall Wendy's is a great company and will do al they can to further your career,"
good,"At the wendys I worked at, it was enjoyable, comfortable, and organized. The workers were friendly and the managers were understandable and chill.   The wendys I worked at work as also always clean and always made sure we served fresh food to our customers."
good,They have a good environment for work . Management is very nice
good,All of the employees at Wendy's get along and work very hard together. There are really flexible with their hours for you. I learned what customer service is and the skills you should use for it.
good,"I enjoy working with the other employees, that makes the day faster, i get to listen to my music when i'm doing the dishes or grill after 10pm when the dining is closed"
good,I enjoyed working there. I just believe management can do better as far is it goes with their relationships with customers and how they treat them in their presence and behind closed doors.
good,Wendy is a good place to work and its fast and quick and stressful. The staff is good the employees and managers. And im the best hardworker i do my job.
good,"This was my first job as a teen and it was great. Lovely people to work with and great managers. They are understanding with hours and organized with days off. Left for personal reasons, would definitely go back."
good,The is a lot of work without any break. always setting goal of sales. A lot of grow inside the company if you take the opportunities and also can enjoy your time and make it fun for the time been.
good,I found working here was a pretty calm environment and as a first job at entry level was definitely worth it not my type of job that I would stay for long but as a first job it was nice
good,I hate that I had to leave but would HIGHLY recommend anyone to work for Wendys. The pay was great and the work hours were extremely flexible. The staff was beyond welcoming.
good,"The hardest part of the job was making food, but I practiced to help my difficulty. My manager also helped me out on a few customers who wanted their food made a special way."
good,I have been working here for years I love the job we are all like family. The pay is 15 an hour but days& hours are always limited. Some people work 6 days while others work 2 days ...
good,"Great work experience with friends. I liked working here because the managers were always fun to be with, and I always met new people. I recommend this as a great first job."
good,Pretty Productive and will always try to achieve best excellency when it comes to the customer and taking care of the restaurant. Co workers are really friendly and will always help you if you need and desire it.
good,I really enjoyed my working experience at Wendy’s because of the people I worked with and the environment.  My co-workers were always willing to help me and work as a team to reach our common goals.
good,"The coworkers at this particular location were very friendly. The location was slightly understaffed, so I was always busy. I didn't mind this because it was more interesting than keeping idle. However, sometimes customers piled up, which required work to be done in order to maintain customer satisfaction"
good,"You meet a lot of great people, the labor can get very intensive and its not a job you want to have for the rest of your life. You learn a great deal of time management"
good,"Hardworking people, great environment, and nice coworkers. Friendly customers and busy half the time. I've have had a great experience and never boring."
good,Working at Wendys made days go by fast because of the fast paced environment. I Learned every position there so finding work is never a problem for someone whose eager to learn and to work. It was a very team oriented workplace and there was always something to do. At times it can be stressful but the training is done so well that anyone new to the crew could even keep up.
good,When I worked at Wendy's I was very good at my job. They wanted me to stay their longer but as a full time student I couldn't stay very long. Typically the work I was doing was repetitive which is what I like. The hardest part of the job is multitasking and keeping track of other equipment/ food numbers. I had to constantly communicate with my co-workers to make sure we were ready to serve our food.
good,"Working here made me the employee I am today. I learned how to be a leader, how to run a kitchen and be positive. They taught me how to coach someone the positive way. Since its fast food it was quick pace. We are expected to get the customer out in 1 minute and thirty seconds. Management handled every problem with professionalism, were always there for help, never disrespectful or rude."
good,Initially i found it really tough but i became used to of the culture there in few weeks. The workplace culture is not good as the behavious of the colleagues was very rude and callous.
good,"It Was Always Busy, Constantly Had To Help Other Team Memebers ,I learned How To Pace Myself & Multitask But A Few Things They Shorten Hours If You Call Off For One Day Sick & Affect The Rest Of Your Hours"
good,My experience there was fun during the day and grueling during the night time I mostly worked nights but normally I was able to work mid day shifts. The management that was there when I started was very scarce and shorthanded and they seemed disorganized to me but they got their things situated quickly. The last manager on the night shift was great he had teamwork constantly in mind he didnt like one person doing multiple tasks at a time so he had people help me if they didnt have anything to do.
good,easy starting job. stressful due to customer service environment. workplace was fun & fast-paced. managers were understanding & overall lenient when it came to making your schedule.
good,"This was a fast paced environment, not everyone can keep up. It was effective in teaching food preparation under pressure. I liked the overall job personally."
good,My time at Wendy's was very enjoyable. I was surrounded by not only great staff but great people. I started as a crew member and worked my way up to be a shift manager. During the busy summer time the job became more of a challenge due to the high demand of product from the customers.
good,A great company to work for but some of their locations are a bit outdated and some of their workers lack morale. The company has a positive vision for both it's employees and customer and focus creating new ways to meet their promises.
good,"Making sandwiches became really easy after a couple of weeks,"
good,A typical work day would be me clocking in and counting my register out so that I could take the next in line customer. If there was not many customers in line I would go to the lobby and clean and refill things that was needed
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's but had to work a lot of hours in order to make enough money. I enjoyed my time at work and really liked the managers and my co-workers.
good,"A typical day at Wendy’s is the best , I love when my coworkers come in with a smile on there face . I make sure each and every customer have the best experience at Wendys when they visit"
good,"For my first job, Wendy's was a pretty good place for me to start. The team was fun to work with and at times it was fast paced but overall it was cool."
good,"Fast paced, customer driven establishment that helps to develops management skills and customer relations. My job enables me to  position, develop and direct managers and employees on a daily basis to help increase sales for the company and build relationships with customers."
good,everyday I started at 5pm and clocked out at 10pm. i was in charge of taking orders and making sure they got delivered correctly. also worked drive through.
good,"great atmosphere as for management"
good,"In my town, Wendy's is a perfect spot for a high school student to make some money throughout the year. I did extra curriculars like football and they were usually flexible with hour"
good,You are a team at Wendys! It is very family oriented. If you work at Wendys you will be treated as family! The people you work with are great and you will always enjoy environment you are in! You are allowed to enjoy yourself as you work. It always made me feel welcome and wanted.
good,I've been working at Wendy's for a year now. I learned about good costumer service and knowledge about a good work environment. Also i have been trained to work on a register.
good,Wendy’s is a very welcoming company . The managers and employees are very helpful and don’t mind explaining things . They will work with you because they know how hard and quick paced Wendy’s can be but we are all like a family in there .
good,"Hard work for little return, no real work life balance & management not really supportive at the time I was there, things may have changed as this was a long time ago"
good,"I think this is a good job if you’re in high school/living with your parents. "
good,Wendy's is a very friendly restaurant where everyone greet you when you come in the restaurant. Kids have a wonderful smile on their faces etc. i do enjoy working at wendy's.
good,its a good job its fast pace environment the employee can be a issue sometimes. we don't get paid enough a lot of people are picky I understand not liking something but they think its five stars and it could be a bit too much sometimes especially when there's a lack of employees on each shift.
good,"i use to open and close the store, making sure health hygiene was at its highest point "
good,"Typical work for fast food restaurants. Fast paced, but good coworkers to help each other manage and minimize stress. Good management while I was there. Earned minimum wage at first, but received raises based on merit."
good,"Wendy's was a great first job. the Manager there was great, the co-workers were funny and friendly.  It was more the people who worked there that was great than the job itself. low pay (expected) room for advancement, but advancement is still poor pay. great first job to get experience under your belt."
good,"It is a very good place to work as the crew and managers are very friendly and helpful. Everyone gets treated equally. Moreover, everyone gets to talk to the costumers and help them with friendliness behaviour."
good,"Typical work day- I usually take First Window and clean the dishes or oven. I do have to do some other tasks if people don't show up such as cleaning the men's bathroom or taking out the trash which I don't normally do on any given work day."
good,"Overall, the company was good to work for.  As a manager they did seem to want to not give you the support of enough other managers in your store. They did give annual reviews and proper raises.  They gave good benefits and health insurance."
good,"Great place to work everybody helped but not with the best attitude along with the help, a lot of personal issues brought to work and ruins the work place environment."
good,"Working at the restaurant level, it was your typical fast food experience-good days and bad days; good customers and bad ones."
good,Opportunities given to learn in a customer service environment. Fast pace all for one and one for all type of environment. Understanding higher management.
good,I learned how to make quality food and to better multitask. My night shift manager was amazing and she made sure her night shift crew knew they were appreciated and we all worked together as a team to get the job done. The hardest part about the job was keeping drive thru times down at busier times but I enjoyed the challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers satisfied and receiving compliments on the quality of their food and the service provided.
good,"The job is enjoyable but is most of the tie not as busy as a regular fast-food industry. I worked for McDonald's and McDonald's operation was faster, smoother, and way more advanced than wendy's, which actually seemed outdated."
good,"Wendys helped me a lot with learning to develop different types of skills. For instance, how to deal with people, how manage a shift. And helped me develop some leadership skills as well."
good,It was a great first job to have and the people and customers become very familiar with you and become like a big family. I have worked my way up from a crew member to Asst. Manager and have enjoyed each stepping stone I have encountered
good,"Lunch, Afternoon snack, dinner, and late night snack are considered busy times for the restaurant. I've learned to multi task, clock in early and get a head start on things, more importantly stay in contact with management"
good,It’s a place where you learn a lot and will get a lot of experience and knowledge meet and treat all kinds of people. It’s a good place to work when your a teen so you can have time for school and work
good,I like working at Wendy’s because it’s a very warming job...co-Workers are friendly and very helpful...The working environment is great just needs more or better pay.
good,Working there was easy but some days it wasn’t. I learned a lot working there and dealing with different kinds of people. Every day it was something different working there.
good,Some of the employees are nice. They change the schedule way too much. Very clean. Lots of rude customers. It's a truckers place to stop so very stinky people.
good,I grew tremendously with this company. The training and development surpassed any company I have worked. The heart  of the company is shown in how they spend time training associates and managers.
good,I learn how to help customers take orders and to stock. Wendy is a really good place to work and even the pay rate not good however the management is great.
good,Lot of drama there. Okay work evnvirmont. always shorthanded. Friendships breaks is you work with friends. No time for a life or to have fun outside of work.
good,"not many complaints, flexible, hard at times depending on location, atmosphere for the most part was great, most of the customers were great but like anywhere, you have your bad ones"
good,"It was a fun fast pace job that kept you busy and constantly  moving .As most businesses  you had your slow periods,but it also depended on the time of the month."
good,"the job was ok. at times it was very stressful and sometimes you had to do your job and someone else's job all by yourself, but all and all it was a great work experience."
good,"great work environment but it gets busy, so you’ll need to just keep your cool and focus when everyone gets flustered in a rush. customers get antsy and so do you but you just smile through it! easy to learn positions and multitasking skills acquired."
good,I enjoyy time working and the people I work with. A positive and collaborative work environment is encouraged and management cares about and is supportive of their employees.
good,"The staff was friendly, the customers were always nice to see, I would work there again. There were times when it was slow, just enough time to prepare for the rush."
good,"I believe my time as a employee qt Wendy's were the best of times for me. Work there is fun, a great learning path, and a great way to make and save money."
good,"Working at Wendy's is incredibly rewarding and fun but also difficult at the same time. The people and managers are incredibly nice and fun to work with and the job is difficult and fast paced but incredibly rewarding. The fast paced, hectic environment helps me become more efficient in my everyday life as well. It's a great entry level job for anyone looking for work."
good,It is a stressful job. I leave there about everyday and something happens. I feel like they don't want me there anymore. my boss yells at me everyday about something.
good,"I started working there when I was young. I advanced pretty quickly within the company. I moved a lot as a young adult and had to quit a couple of times. They gave my another chance to work again. Excellent company to work for, I had some of the best bosses."
good,the everyday work experience was actually ok the staff were good okay work enviorment my job ran pretty smoove it was very quick paced so i got alot done in a short time period sometimes
good,"A typical day at Wendy's for a dining room sandwich maker was clocking in and turning on your screen to get ready for the dinner rush. I learned how to prep and make various different sandwiches. The management at Wendy's was nice, they were very motherly and always looked out for us because majority of us were high school students. The hardest part of the job is when you first start learning how to make sandwiches and a dinner rush happens, but the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers that came in. To this day I still see some of my regulars and we have become great friends."
good,"Easy to move up in management, ability to learn all positions, full time or part time employee they work with your schedule, and they make sure everyone is treated equally."
good,"The management in this company was amazing! Having understanding and awesome managers helps employees be the best they can with their manager's guidance. Few companies with good management, and luckily this one was one of them."
good,"I was trained as a sandwich maker but ended up trained in cashier, sandwich maker, food prep, grill cook, and fry cook. I was perfect for the job I was always helpful especially help for shifts that needed help or people. I enjoy food and cooking so I loved my job"
good,It was a good place to start working and also a good place to hone my work ethics. The managers are nice but sometimes they can be a little hard to understand.
good,"Like I said, this place was a fun place to work when the manager “A”was around, however he left for a mission and got manager“B” as a replacement. Manager “B” was a bit harder to agree with, but I still listened to him."
good,The Wendy's that I worked at was a good place and they had nice managers and employees but before I left we had to get a new GM and no one really liked her. My opinion everyone liked the old GM including me because she was understanding and gave everyone a chance. The new GM there she basically fired or made people quit the job.
good,"No fast food job is ever gonna last for a potential winner like me. I was a cashier, sandwich maker, and drive-thru person all in the same hour sometimes."
good,Wendys is a great place to work work  is usually at a steady place great people to work with and work for flexiable hours works well if your still in high school or work multiple jobs
good,"This was my first job, it was very intense and fastpaced. It definitely gets easier as you go, but at the start, it was very chaotic. The hours were great, it was enough, but not too much to the point where it interfered with my schooling. This company is well recommended for a first job because it shows you how fast you need to be when working in a fast food environment. You develop and improve your skills as you learn which you can further bring to your next job."
good,Advancing is great but the pay is not. Majority of the store managers are great to work with and great team players. It's a fast paced so you have to willing and able to work.
good,The job allows you to experience customer services and allow you to put it to use. They work with you schedule for your other job and also classes if you are enrolled in school.
good,"If you like a fast paced environment, then Wendy's is for you. Whether you're on the front cash, drive thru, or on the production line -- there's always lots to do. "
good,"At Wendy’s it’ a nice and easy place to work at although sometimes it gets busy but the management at the Wendy’s is very good, none of the workers in that job slack, they always kept themselves always busy as well as I did, I do recommend this job more to teenagers who are looking for a very first job because Wendy’s is easy and simple and they will take u through every step of the way so u are ready to go when starting the job.."
good,"It’s a very good job for someone who enjoys working in that area . But if you don’t have experience or anything , you may need extra help adjusting and learning everything you need to succeed. Overall a good job."
good,"Realy loved working here and with the people.and manager i worked with .Managers realy help out of realy in need of hours ,but realy must earn the hours working in fast paste and making sure all your orders are exacly as wanted ."
good,Working at Wendy's is a great learning experience to me because it's showing me how to assist customers and how to work with my peers. It's teaching how to learn in a fast paced environment.
good,It was a great job with fun opportunities to advance higher up in the company friendly management with flexible hours always there to help work around your schedule
good,"While working at Wendy's it was a fun environment. the staff are friendly and willing to help you when needed. if you want a job that is low key and not very busy Wendy's is not for you, as an employee you are always doing something."
good,"great experience, positive attitude and energy . everyone was for the company and had great customer service skills. was usually very busy but always had the business moving."
good,"it's a nice place to work, customers are nice along with employees. A typical day looks like cleaning and making sure the restaurant looks nice and clean, packing orders along with taking orders."
good,Friendly staff. Fast paced. Great customer service. Great food. Reasonable pay. I really enjoyed the sedalia mo location................................
good,Nice company to work for. They give you the skills and training that you need to do your job. There is room for advancement within the company and the benefits are good
good,Wendy’s is a great job to work at for teenagers who need a fast food friendly job. Always on task and never let down. Great food and socializing with.
good,I am very happy while working their with different cultural people and really enjoy their in a fun full environment. But its too far from my home I travel a lot to reach their on time.
good,works well if still in school. does follow laws about working minors. but in note to have a schedule change but in 2 weeks in advance. very understanding about a love one passing they will not make you work on the funeral day.
good,When i worked there. I had the owner has as my manager. She kept things going .  She was the best.  Got mean when she needed to be  No one would disrespect her.
good,"My overall review at working at wendy’s was it was an experience the management was horrible due to managers picking favorites getting annyoyed when we asked for help the GM was so nice on my interview most coolest person but a few weeks later i saw who the GM’s true colors. When the owner would come in GM would act so nice and be nice to all of us and right when owner leaves bye bye nice, but it was cool because I was working I was doing my job putting my hours in working was awesome it was supper fast and easy with some training but after a while I wasn’t feeling comfortable with management anymore after almost 10 months so I put my 2 weeks in. I will definitely want to work for fast food again but I would like my managers to be as nice as they are when they hire you"
good,"Honestly I loved working there, I met some lifelong friends there and I wouldn't change this experience for anything. I feel that I got payed less than I deserved because I was very hard working and did more work than anyone combined."
good,Taught me many valuable skills to take with me in the future. I learned how to better manage my time as well as how to maintain a great work ethic and drive to improve.
good,"When I arrived at work I would clock in and the night already started, I would either be on the cash register or making sandwiches if there was time in-between taking orders or making them I would clean up my station, sweep the floor, stock, or do the dishes."
good,Wendy's was an ok job I made about  600 every  two weeks ok need more flexible   Hours to Acommdate your family  I work at Wendy's bossier then was transfer to Minden I work for this company for about 2 1/2 year
good,Great place to work! You just have to keep on top of everything to get through that place!! I recommend doing part time there though! It’s an amazing first job
good,"I would work 4 pm-11 pm Monday-Thursday but sometimes Fridays as well. I would take orders clean tables assist with drive thru, if the front wasn't busy. I would prepare fries or poutines, make gravy, help wrap sandwiches. I also started to learn how to make sandwiches and was starting to get sandwich maker shifts. "
good,Wendy’s is a good job I have learned a lot and I am still learning. I think it’s time to move on to some better. I have a lot of customer telling me to find something great because I deserve much more.
good,"Being Wendys was my first job, it was very stressful at first then working with individual who is all about working together and helping one another, the job became easier."
good,Very good company unfortunately I moved from the area but while I was there it was great for the most part. Management was great always customer oriented always awesome.
good,Wendys Definitely helped me take the next step in management as they sent me to many management classes and put great role models around me to teach me. Only left Wendys to become a GM with Arbys
good,"Fun and exciting fast place to work, something different every few mins. Can be heated at times, but it is a family oriented place to work. Pay is decent with some overtime."
good,Making your job fun and exciting is always a challenge!  Either by guessing how many cars the team can put thru in a three hour time frame and the person that guessed the closest got a frosty... improving on your previous inspection from the DM these are all part of raising your staff and managers to new heights.
good,Good confusing because management switched while I was still getting use to the old management it's good if you need to work fast or for a small amount of time.
good,The location I worked at was a college town and it was very busy!  They promoted from within and hours were flexible.  The culture was varible due to a college town so it made it nice to work at.
good,The company treats the employees well jus not enough pay to survive at my age plus with a child. Other than that good company to start with. Wouldnt recomend it being only source of income
good,Wendy's was a great place to work. The managers were nice and on top of things. I liked my coworkers a lot. They were very helpful and we all worked as a team.
good,"While I was with Wendy's our general managers position changed 3 times, and it made it hard for me to get along with the new GM. I enjoyed my job most days but me and my GM would bash heads over nothing for some reason."
good,It was actually a really good job and I liked it there. The people were nice and friendly. Also I grew up with most of them. It was withing walking distance of my house for the most part. I could catch a bus there. And it was in the heart of our city
good,"Pretty laid back job once you learn how to maneuver around the store, multi-task, coordinate the drive-thru, make salads and orders correctly and efficiently."
good,"The people were all great,  learned a lot from cooking and taking peoples orders and getting it done in a jiffy. And the management was good always there to help."
good,"most days were pretty calm but sometimes it did get a little busy. On busy days, everyone worked together and made sure the customers had a great experience."
good,Wendy’s is a good place I decided to work at and I got hired the day of my interview. The managers are very relatable to any given situation their almost like a family .
good,I work mostly every Wednesday to Friday.  I learned how to cook fries. The managers are great people to work and they have got a good command. Workplace culture is good and clean where to keep people to be happy. The hardest part of the job is to keep myself to be a quick fryer. The most enjoyable part of the job is to keep customers happy and see them smile at the same time.
good,"I can honestly say working at Wendy's was actually really fun, I had Two very nice Mangers and Very Nice co-workers. Working for Wendy's could be great For a person that is trying to make a little money on the side, but it wouldn't be a job i recommend working for if you are trying to make a living for yourself. I wouldn't say all Wendy's have the same pay rate but this particular one just didn't cut it for me. Overall not including the salary i really loved working for wendys cooperation"
good,"The work place was ok the environment wasnt good but the people was nice for the most part, and most days was fun of entertainment from the customers."
good,"Pros"
good,I liked everyone that I worked with and the managers were supportive and friendly. It was fun to work there and I would do it again with all the friends that I made there. I had Great hours while working there.
good,"Have great food and discounts for their employees, also a fun working environment, would definitely recommend working there for extra money for a second job"
good,Wendy’s is a good place to work if the right managers providing the right tools was in place consisantly they work with you on your schedule as well had a good training system but they cut the training hours out which made it hard to serve customers properly at times over a ok place to work
good,Wendy was face paced work environment. Hands on training and guidance flexible schedule the company overall touched its workers in such a place everyone should thrive for an opportunity
good,"Wendy’s gave me a great outlook for working also with gaining work experience. Working for Wendy’s as an insider, I know that the overall company provides not only great customer service but also great employee service."
good,With this job was fun and the people that i worked with were nice. Didn't take long to learn new positions and the flexibility was another thing that i liked.
good,It is a nice place to work and a good job to begin at. Everyone was nice and understanding when things pop up suddenly. Every was willing to teach or learn new stuff.
good,Dealing with the public. The hardest part of the job is I've been there so long that there is no hard part.The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have meetings in Nashville.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking the store, helping customers, and taking orders. The management at Wendy's is really great, they are good people to work with and they are very flexible with their employees."
good,Needs more communication and better management. They are unorganized. High turnover with employees and management. Nice co worker. Lack of training for their employees
good,during my time with Wendy everything started well as most jobs but then the team became difficult to work with because of issues that they were having with each other i believe that the company has a wonderful support system but the location I was at the team did not work well together.
good,I’ve worked at Wendy's for about 5-6 months now and I have learned a lot. The managers are laid back but get the job done in the end. All of the employees get along performing excellent team work that results in good customer service
good,"For my first real job, I feel like I was treated very well and paid pretty good. The management was really good, and my bosses were actually likable and made me feel welcomed to come to work. I also made friends there, who I am still close with today."
good,1 day office and 4 days in the field. This is a solid company that is in the process on re-innovate it's self. The new positions created along with new location and processes made it a great place to work.
good,"On a typical day I usually handle staffing to insure I had enough employees to execute the work needed to be successful on all shifts Once I took care of that, I would verify my shift, (meaning rectify issues from previous shifts to insure we don't run into the same issues in the next shift).  I would then secure the finances at each drawer. Then ,I would schedule breaks while being sensitive to individual employee needs. I then would make sure the store was clean, presentable, and up to code. When my actual shift was coming to a close, I would then begin prep for the following day/shift."
good,"My first job and it was great. I loved the management and my coworkers, it was so easy to meet and talk to people there. Performance wise it is busy almost all the time in the drive-thru but gets pretty dead up front. Good place to get experience."
good,"Wendy’s is a great company to build and learn from for future careers. Flexibility with their hours, always about their customers and their experiences at any wendys location."
good,"As I was in high school I worked here for a few years, with promotions that I got I saw myself staying with the company for years to come, it was stressful as a closing manager with call outs, and making sure the shift was ran smoothly, but the thing I miss most about there is the social interaction with people."
good,Wendys is difficult and face pace but the interaction with customers is great. Wendys requires multitasking and good communication skills. Good hygeine is a must.
good,Every Wendy's I worked for became like my family except 1. I love my manager and the work I did. The only down fall is there are no benefits for part time. I think it would be beneficial for the company as a whole if there where more benefits available to the employee's. Maybe allow free lunch's.
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in at 6PM and clocking out at 2AM and I learned how to shut down and clean the entire store. I learned to deal with the fast pace style and I learned how to teach others to do what I do. Lastly, I learned how to stock when our truck delivered our products."
good,A good first job although chances of a raise is close to impossible. Met a lot of nice people and learned a lot about customer service.Overall a good experience.
good,"Fast food wasn't my thing, didn't get very along with washing dishes and cleaning floors and toilets, but for the pay. It was good, I learned a lot of communication skills, how to take care of customers that is in person or drive thru, how to manage my time under stress and even work on 2-3 stations everyday at the same time."
good,"I typical day at work, I come in at 5:30 pm check the store make sure everything is okay outside and greet customers walking in at the same time I do. I am a closing shift manager so when I get there, I check the safe cash to make sure money is where it needs to be. Then I check the work schedule to see who is coming in and who needs breaks like lunch or 10 minute break. Then I do a shift change, I log off drawers from crew members that are about to be off and get the drawers ready for next person to be coming on. Then I  help maintain a great customer service work flow. By maintaining food quality and order accuracy and great tasting food. I do have to do cash drops every hour to insure registers are not over what there suppose to be. I help with the team to make sure the cleaning part of the job is getting done as well since we are closers. I do inventory count of product on what we have at the end of the night and drop the remaining cash and do a final walk thru of the store to make sure everything is clean put back and ready for next shift, then we all clock out and I set the alarm and walk out and make sure doors are look behind me. That is a typical work day for me."
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to run a good store with a bad crew and weak mangers. But when you have who you need everything runs smooth. The customers are always right rule made it hard sometimes.
good,"You need to be quick, focused and determined. Good enviorment to gain experience and learn. Too stresfull sometimes but this depends on the person and your coworkers."
good,Was hard working everyday only had like 10 minuets break then back to work the management was very nice making sure everything is in fit that’s my review
good,So the pay is pretty low and youre gonna be busy alot but its not a hard job at all and almost everyone i work with is a great friend and coworker and they make the day go by in no time.
good,"I loved working here personally, the crew was supportive and fun to work with and my managers were helpful and kept our energy up. Where I became upset was when I was preforming manager work for over 2 months and never got paid for my work. I remained being paid as a crew member, despite my hard work."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was like any other fast food place, People would rush in and we would try out=r best to give them what they wanted in a timely manner. i learned that working was going to be heard and some days I will be tired but, I have to push myself. The hardest part about working at Wendy's was probably keeping the past when a large group comes in to eat and not mixing up orders. I enjoyed the people i worked with and how busy The restaurant stayed because, it did not allow me to worry about the time or being bored at work."
good,"wendys is a friendly work environment,   that gives employees lots of flexibility for the schedules so they can still have a family life, engage in extra curricular activites etc. I enjoy the fast pace environment but it can be stressful at times"
good,"Customer service is the most important part, and food quality. Staying alert and learning to control the flow of service. Keeping the correct amount of staff on shift, and making executive decisions in stressful situation."
good,"It was a great first job, it’s just not something for long term employment. The people who I worked with were great to get along with, and we tried to make work as fun as possible, while completing our job."
good,The culture of this company is great and everyone I worked with was amazing. its so productive and to work with my management team amd also my crew staff.
good,Working at Wendy's is a great place to work when you want to go into customer service. You get to work with all kinds of people and help them make smile and enjoy their day.  Wendy's gives you lots of opportunities to do things like become a manager or just be a crew leader if you don't think you can handle all that work.  You get to meet lots of guest and learn how to interact with different ones.  The Wendy's company makes you feel like family and they try hard to make everyone happy.  Wendy's is a great place to work and I always recommend it.
good,I worked part time at Wendys. While working I've learning how to work with a team. I always had a good time with my co-workers and customers. The hours are flexible and they work well with student schedules which is great.
good,"Management at Wendy's when I worked there was very well. My GM of the store was kind and understanding with certain situations and he never acted like he was above any of us, especially since I was just a teenager in high school. He respected us all the same and I believe it was a great first job to have."
good,"learnt working in a team and creating the coordination among the co workers to be more efficient "
good,"De la empresa me lleve mucho aprendizaje laboralmente hablando, lo único malo es que haba ciertas personas que no te dejaban avanzar profesionalmente, por lo que se trunco mi recimiento laboral."
good,"Being the grill man it was very undivided attention to detail , so quality is a very big part of my work. The high energy workplace cause for a lot team work and I work well with others."
good,"This job enlightened me how versatile I can be because in my experience, I had all different types of responsibilities. The working environment was great because co-workers would always be there to answer questions about things that I had trouble with. The working environment was also great because everyone was working cooperatively. One of the most challenging parts of the job was keeping up with the fast-paced environment, especially during the beginning stages, but as I grew accustom to working at Wendy's the job seemed less vigorous. Management is also phenomenal. The managers really make sure that the restaurant is in top shape and everyone is in sync with their responsibilities. The part that I enjoyed the most is joining the working staff team and getting to know them on the job."
good,All workers are nice and fair . Always gets the job done even if it takes a couple minutes longer to get the job done correctly . It's always busy so shifts fly by .
good,"it was a fast paste job but i would recommend people who are just starting should work with fast food. it can be a bit overwhelming at times but after a while youll get used to it,"
good,"The best part about working at Wendy's was working with my co-workers and the management that made learning new skills easy and kept a positive working environment, even under high stress when the lunch and dinner rushes came through."
good,"It was fast-paced. Can definitely be a very stressful job. Often worked with people who didn’t do their jobs properly, making my job harder on me. overall it was an okay experience."
good,"sometimes very busy, loud place to work, fast past, friendly work place, time goes by fast. mangers pressure you to better, hot place to work in. the best part about is that stay warm on cold days"
good,"Pros"
good,"the work was good as aspected lunch and dinner hours were very busy, the rest of the day was constant, but always had things to do because all of Wendys for was fresh."
good,"Great place to work, get on shift talk to all the crew, get to know what is going on in the work place and being able to solve all issues. Management all had ups and downs but overall great"
good,"I come early and make salads for that day, I stalk the dining room and the stations that are close to the cash register, I clean the lobby and restrooms and I take peoples' orders. I have learned how to use a cash register for a fast food restaurant. Management is very good here, there are some that are stricter than others but I have no complaints The workplace culture is very good. For the most part, employees are nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the fact that the salary is minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible hours."
good,"it was a fun environment. "
good,i learned to work as a team on certain shifts Overall its a good place to work just to much gossip the customers are great and are very loyal they come in and order almost 3 times a day its a good place to work you just gotta stay away from the gossip
good,I learned how to deal with people even if your having a really bad day you have to smile and put them 1st. I also learned how to do team work and how to cover for other people when they couldn't come in to work
good,i would greet customers with a smile always keeping an eye on the lobby so it stays clean. making fries and sandwiches making sure people get their order and are satisfied with their purchase and don't have an trouble.
good,Everyone in our team was willing to stick their neck out for each other.  They were willing to help each other out.  It was like a family rather then work.
good,"It is a fast paced environment where service is taken very seriously. n Quality is a priority.  When working there, you must be able to multi task.  People development is part of the culture and there is always room for advancement.  When you are able to achieve your daily, weekly, and monthly goals, you are always recognized.  Time goes by quickly when you are busy."
good,Great uper management but no room for saliry increase after being hired. Very few capable shift managers and poor training program. 50+ hours a week. Jod can get repetitive
good,"Not my preferred job of choice, but was very reliable and very easy to adapt. Staff and coworkers were friendly, and I was taught thoroughly of the Wendy's rules and regulations."
good,"It's just like the phone games that have to do with reactions and timings. Every day I worked was like I was in one of those games. It might seem boring to be doing the same things, but switching up what task you're doing makes the day more interesting."
good,"Wendys corp. was a very nice company to work for. I had been with them quite a long time, even left and came back later on. January 2016 They were bought out but the Smhidt Family Franchisees and they stripped mostly all our benefits including the management. If they were still A Corporate company I would still be employed with them to this day..."
good,"Good hours, very fast paced Job, but very diverse, many people were hired working here at the time from other countries. Pay was decent and the benefits were great, because I moved out to North Dakota and they helped with giving us a place to Live. Very Clean and food was made correct. Management was good and worked well with other people."
good,"Fast food is one of the businesses that nobody really wants to work at. However, it is probably the most beneficial first job that a teenager can get. The reason for that is that it teaches you teamwork and how to manage your time wisely in a fast-paced environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job was at first making sure that your team was working together to make a nice flow of stations for the job to be complete. Then I learned how great teamwork is here! It was my first job ever so it taught ,e how engage with customers and have a very friendly service skill. The management was awesome!"
good,"Working at Wendy's like what you might imagine a fast-food is like. You are a part of a team and there are close quarters. My coworkers were friendly and helpful. The most difficult part of this job was not having the number of hours I would have liked, nor the salary."
good,this is a great place to work. it is a fun fast pace job with great people. the flexible schedule is great for those that are looking to go to school to better themselves.
good,"At Wendys a t typical day for me involves, providing great customer service by interacting with customers to get a better understanding of what they want. Also remembering a customers name is a great way for them to know you have there full attention."
good,"Typical day is making sandwiches."
good,They work you hard if you are good at your job. They allow you to try different things instead of the same thing day after day. Regulars are great and training is simple.
good,"If it's busy, you're working and the time flies by. Everyone is always working together and filling orders for the customers. There are also times where it is not busy so you can take a break without actually taking a break."
good,just a day you would think a day would be at a fast food place.. cook fries and burgers and help customers.. I dont have much to say and dont really understand why I have to be doing this.. Am needing a job.
good,Wendy's was my first real job. I worked at a training store so we always had new people coming in and out of the place. They had wonderful customers and an amazing management team for the most part. I couldn't ask for a better team. I would recommend this for a first time job for anyone.
good,I've learned how to talk to customers and greet and help people out the door when needed. Also keeping mine and store clean and polished when possible. Learning how to fix a situation and ask for help when needed.
good,"Working in fast food has a bad reputation but it's really not that bad of a job. It's like you have to be fast and there is no room for error, but it's unskilled labor so you should be fine ."
good,"received full time hours"
good,"Wendys was a laid back, decently paced place. The managers were very understanding and willing to work with employees. I loved most of the crew, was able to create relationships with some of the people and a manager as well. I would definitely go back to work there if I was able to."
good,Sometimes overwhelming and stressful but never a dull moment and never a boring day! Always something to keep you moving and that makes the day go by so much faster.
good,During my typical day at work it was fast paced and I dealt with a lot of customer service. I learned how to be a better multi-tasker and be quick at the station I was on for that shift.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know all of the other crew members and get the task done at the end of the day. The management was perfect and if there was any questions or concerns the mangers were right on top of it.
good,"aprendi a tener mejor comunicacion interpersonal con las personas."
good,Wendy's is a fun place to work and learn from other employees and assisting customers from making burgers to cleaning is easy and great to start as a young person who's starting
good,"Working at Wendy's was always great. I was always greeted with a smile and the management made me feel secure. You have to be ready to work at a fast pace, just like at any other fast food restaurant."
good,"My manager was very helpful, she was a great team leader and my workers were really cool! yes there were some customers that were difficult but with the people i was working with, it wasn't hard to sort out the problems. I think the hardest part of the job was just having to work and do school at the same time but its nice to get paid when you're still in school. I learned that things are done easier with team work and this was a good job experience. Overall i would suggest anyone to work there."
good,Great Company but moving into another direction. I been there for 17 years and I would like too get into a District Manager roll and dont feel I will get there due to no openings any time soon.
good,Every I came in contact with while here were pleasant! It was a place I loved to come to and I loved everyone I worked with! My managers at the time we're Awesome! I loved this job!
good,Very Busy Gave Us Free Lunch Also Paid Us Very Good Stayed On Task With Everything Good Communcation within being very busy everyone stayed on point with everything
good,I like working at this job because it helped me build a good customer service attitude this was my first job and it really helped me learn a lot of new things.
good,"Cool summer job! I would definitely reccommand if you are just looking to make some easy money, the job was pretty relaxed for the most part but there were times when some days were faster than others.."
good,I loved everyone I worked with and the job. They just need to give better advancement opportunities. I would recommend Wendy's to someone who is younger and looking for a first job.
good,"They taught me to accept failure.  They really given a lot of good and bad experiences in life, wisdom is their everyday weapon.  They taught how to be nice to others."
good,Was a fun place to work and the crew members were also fun to work with. Very well put together and was a decent store. Good food so it was always pretty busy.
good,Good stable company to work for. They trained you well and put you in the position to be successful. World renowned company with a very positive reputation. Great place to get started in your working career.
good,"Some days it may be slow, but most days it is busy (especially during lunch hours). The manager will work with your schedule, some of the staff are easy to get along with."
good,"I used to love working there. It was fun. It was hard to deal with rude customers, but I still loved it there. The managers loved me. I only work there for only 5 months."
good,"the work pace was fast and smooth, my coworkers were respectable and my boss helped me out with my schedule for me to go to school. discount on meals and overall friendly workplace"
good,had to make sandwhich with no mistake and a fast pace. also had to make salads. if I wasn't on sandwhich duty I would be on grill or fries. after that last resort would be back window cashier.
good,"Wendy's is a great job and possible career. You obtain a lot of skills from both customer service and management perspective as a restaurant manager. I loved working with my team to better our store goals and it really was like a family. The hardest part of the job was call of from employees and having people on your shifts that didn't want to better themselves. My job has a great stream of people of all age brackets majority of them being high school students. That being said a good portion of the people we wold train would leave for other opportunities. My most hated line was ""It's just fast food."" I hated this phrase coming from employees because I truly believe you can find a purpose in ANYTHING and be a person to bring change in the things you do-- just by your presence alone. My most enjoyable part is to watch a new employee learn and take these values and apply it to our store as well as everyday life. It really is the small things. The culture is VERY fast paced and focused on multiple outlets to bring in great reviews and increased sales. It's a a great job and can go a long way."
good,"Management at Wendy's was great ,good people to work for ,I learned how to manage crew and do paperwork that was required of me as a shift manager.They were very good about the time when I had to miss to take care of my mother.A typical day was good ,enjoyed working with the crew we had and the management."
good,Wendy's offer good job readiness to it's employees the culture of the company is relaxed and fast-paced with on the job training and experience I recommend Wendy's to anyone just starting out in the job market it will give them the time and work ethics needed to start a career so
good,"It was a great job at Wendy's. Although stressful at times, it was still a good place to be. Crew members and other managers were always willing to help or learn or teach."
good,"It was an okay work experience, some days were stressful some were very fun. When you go on break you get free things sometimes, they pay was not very good, it could be way better."
good,I absolutely loved working for Wendy's it was a fast fun paced work environment with friendly people and a great staff management was awesome as well just wish they offered 40 hours a week.
good,i really loved the job and worked full time the couple years i worked their. the management kind of was poor and didnt really care.i would of liked to stay their bu felt like it was a dead end job.
good,a typical day working at Wendy's was pretty good. I honestly never had a bad day or any complaints. I learned a lot of things while being at Wendy's I learned how to use there grills and fryers i learned the policy's and procedures of the work place and of the food we cooked. I also learned how to work there cash registers I learned drive true as well. The managers were pretty fair and also good people to work with. the workplace culture was pretty good everyone communicated with one anther we would also help one another out as well. The only hard time at work that I had was when they put me on the line and I didn't know how to make any of the burgers. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was that we where all a big familyand everyone got along for the most part.
good,"A typical day at work was stalking the sandwich station, keeping everything cleaned and making all the orders. I learned so much at Wendy's, they put me on front cash, sandwich making, order taking, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the food. The most hardest part of throb was how fast paced it was, it could sometimes me stressful. Overall it was a great experience!"

good,"Fast paced during the day, a bit more relaxed at night, I would be the first to admit that I actually loved my job. It was a bit before I found my perfect position, but in all honesty it was worth it. I did find it difficult to advance my position, but perhaps that is just me."
good,There was never any down time. I received phone calls and text on all most every day off. Wendy's did not leave much time for a family life. It was very detail oriented.
good,it was grate working at wendys they had good people to worke with i liked my job cooking the fryied food for are coustermrs when they are happy it makes me feel good
good,since its a truck stop people tend to be disrespectful  but management and coworkers were always there to back you up. It has flexible hours and is perfect for someone going to school or looking for a first job.
good,"As Wendy's is a fast food restaurant  where i learnt."
good,"Overall a very nice workplace with flexible hours. You leave and come on the time the schedule says, no getting held back for any reasons. The managers are very respectful of your time, although they will cut back your hours if they feel too many employee's are working that night."
good,"The days at wendy's are fast. You must be able to change from station. Management was easy to work with, and reliable. The hardest part of the job was trying to run a shift while training employees and making sure everything was ready for the next shift manager. The most enjoyable part of Wendys is connecting with your coworkers and helping each other when needed."
good,Working At Wendys was a great experience. And the managers were great. They worked with me during school and while I have been injured. The crew members always learned how to have fun while getting work done.
good,working at wendys teach me how to have patient and how to get along wiith other people and how to be socialable it also teach me hot to cashier it also help how to multi task
good,I had a great time serving the general public. I loved learning new things in the job. I remember always trying new ways to better my delivery time on food to my customers.
good,"Easy job, room for small advancements, friendly work environment. Higher management is pretty unreliable in the sense of giving you the material you need to properly run a tight shift."
good,Remember to forward these jobs to any of your friends who might have interest in any of these positions.Getting these notifications too often people do not think.
good,"At first it was fun and exciting because it was my first job, but later on as I became accustomed it became less fun and exciting and more stressful and boring."
good,"So I have been working at fast food since I could work. Wendys was my favorite one, I loved working there and then they got a new manager and it all went down hill after that."
good,"positive working environment, great customer service as always. I learned to speak up and take initiative.  The best part of the job was the 50% discount. Food was always served fresh and customers were happy."
good,"wasnt there very long due to the privately owned business it went bankrupt, it was an overall good place to work......................................."
good,"Everybody there will not be afraid to help you, they all have your back, not a single person there has a problem with anybody and it is also drama free!"
good,Wendys had a friendly and fun work environment. Always liked being at work. The managers were always friendly and tried to work with everyone on their schedules as much as possible.
good,"Oversee all aspects of the daily operations of the restaurant."
good,"Stressful during peak hours, relaxed during night shift."
good,"It is our job to sure we have order accuracy, times, cash and cleanliness goals are met for the day of every single shift. Daily/Night paperwork and cash."
good,I learned to manage my time wisely and I learned hoe to communicate better and to relate to other people that are different than me. my custumer service skills definetly improved.
good,Great team with fast paced food service. Clean and sanitary equipment and guidelines are strickly followed. Training and oversight is provided with great team players.
good,"busy sometimes"
good,it is a very busy location with staff that needed more motivation and patience. I learned how to work in a team to accomplish goals. Certain management was alright but for the most part they would run off and hide in their office.
good,its an ok job i met great people but the customers can be very demanding. The  coworkers also sometimes do not show up to work. Management is also very good.
good,I come in the morning prep for lunch and get side clean and ready. Wash hands and put my apron on clock in to get ready to serve customers. Lunch break is 30mins and you also get employee half of discount.
good,I loved my work place! I had some good days and some bad days but overall I managed to get thru each day! Its a good job for someone who is just beginning to live independently but for a family it would be a struggle if you don't have any managing skills personally!
good,Fast food is definitely fast pace but it has its up rise a typical day at work is just making sure the customer has its food in under two minutes not only must we work fast but we must provide good quality as well with out making to many mistakes. There are different supervisors not all management is the same but overall its still a good workplace. Ive learned so many things including memorizing the  menu and knowing what comes on every sandwich and drink.
good,The company overall is a wonderful company to work for especially if you are just starting off into the work world. The management was good with employees and great with customers as well.
good,Wendy's is cool job for teenagers. But for adults. Your not going to get the pay your wanting.  Or the hours.  It's very hard to get a raise. Even if it's just 25 cents.
good,I enjoyed my two and a half years providing the customer service that I could provide. For a casual fastfood environment mostly with high school students and a few adults with limited education I maintained a professional approach day after day. Can't say it was always easy but the customer always came first for me.
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. The people there were always extremely nice and always joking around. Its a job that you are on your feet ALL day, which can be hard on your body. I had a very good work ethic while I was there and everyone seemed to take advantage of it. I would end up doing other people's jobs because they weren't doing it. It was stressful, but I loved the people there and I loved making customers smile so I didn't mind too much. It's a good first job, but definitely nothing I would recommend for a long term job."
good,Un lugar estable para trabajar ambiente muy profesional
good,Most of the things you will learn are repetitive. Once you learn all the tasks you'll be good. The employees are really fun and its a great atmosphere
good,"Working is life you have to survive. A regular day at work for me is coming in punching the clock and getting started with no distractions."
good,Nice place to be your first job. I've been working there for a year now and would like to explore more job  opportunities. The managers are very nice and it's a very clean store. I like working there.
good,"I learned how to talk to customers if they are unhappy, and to make the situation better for them. Most of my coworkers were great to be around, same with the managers. My general manager was amazing. I had a lot of responsibility and I kept on taking the initiative with learning how to use all of the equipment by watching my experienced coworkers."
good,"Working at Wendy's was fun, I had to get the customers their food in an orderly fashion with a smile. Interacting with customers was the best part about working at Wendy's."
good,"I sincerely enjoyed working here. I met a lot of great people during my employment, from the coworkers to the customers. It can have its drawbacks, but the pros outweighed the cons."
good,It's an ok company to work for they can do a lot better in personal training. And in Management decisions like how to hire better candidates and so on
good,Wend's Int. had great culture. They had on going training classes for all management which help all to improve and learn about up coming changes in the company. I benefited a lot from these training classes.
good,"Wendy's is a great place for a first job. They offer great opportunities for advancement, it is face-paced, and has quality food and great customer service. Definitely recommended for those looking for a first-time job"
good,"As all fast food environment, Wendy's is a very past passed place to work.There are so many different potions that need to be performed at Wendy's. Can be stressful and overwhelming when you are dealing with upset customers."
good,"Friendly crew , good quality food , hygienic food but they were not gave my 20 hours of week which I required.they allowed the crew to get the 50% off on employ meal which was profitable deal."
good,This company is a nice job to have while in school the managers will work around your school schedule. They are very serious about education and I loved that
good,But the management is on the ball but one in particular would work while being very ill throwing up blood in the trash can that trash can being located in the kitchen by all the food an cooks
good,"It was only a summer job because I was in highschool  and I need some money to save to buy some things I needed,  it wasn't that bad working at Wendy's everyone treated me well and it was a fun experience"
good,i was very young just starting out with life and wendys give me my first real job experience learned a lot of people skills mangerment skills so glad i got the opportunity to work for the company
good,I really liked working at Wendy's. I felt like the manager was fair to everyone. Days were sometime fast and sometime slow. I learn a lot of different job duties that was easy and fun to learn. The hardest part is getting a big rush. I enjoyed working with majority of the employees there. I would go back if I had to.
good,Working here is a very big accomplishment and taught me a lot of things. Work ethics are very well valued and employees are well treated. Wendy's is a very cool place to work.

good,My time here was awesome and everyone was so nice and accommodating even thought I was the new guy with no experience. The managers were awesome and friendly.
good,"I liked working there. Got to work with younger people, learn new skills, A lot of standing for long periods of time involved. Uniform shirts,hat, and apron furnished."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the people I worked with and enjoyed my job. The work could become slightly stressful at times, but working with people can sometimes become demanding. Although, in the customer service business this should be expected. I felt that duties were evenly distributed and rules clearly stated. I found myself understanding all my expectations and being able to meet those expectations."
good,La parte más difícil del trabajo es memorizar los hamburgueses
good,It was a great way to meet people around the area and break away from the 24/7 on-campus lifestyle. Workers and management were all very positive and helpful.
good,"Everyone were doing their jobs. Peaceful, no problems. Loved how the manager runs the store. Well organized, great place to work at. I would recommend it if you're looking for your first job."
good,"- A typical day at work at Wendy's for me was always busy and helping out with other employee's. "
good,I would most definitely recommend this job to high school or college students because they really help you when working around your school schedule. The staff makes you feel like family and helps shows great teamwork to satisfy the customers.
good,"great place to get experience in the working world. management was nice. if you are a good worker they will promote u, i got promoted as soon as i turned 18."
good,At Wendy's there was a lot to look forward to on a day to day basis. The Management was fair.  They had nice people to work with and the customers were enjoyable.
good,I worked at Wendy's a good 8 months and faithfully came to work . I had came back in to work the day after confirming with my manager that I didn't have to come in . So I get in there and I see my name on a piece of paper for terminal so I just left . Long story in shorter version .
good,Morning rush was a busy 6 straight hours of constant customers coming in constantly. Shifts can also stressful and co-workers can be edgy depending on how they feel that day. Overall the compensation was good.
good,Wendy's is a good starting place for any career path. I learned managements skills and life lessons while working here however after obtaining some education I quickly moved on.
good,"It was high paced and ran smoothly. It was a young group of people to work with, however if was ran with great effieciency. The manager was very informative and thorough with the training."
good,"Overall , Wendy's it's a great place to work. The managers can be very lazy & expect Crew Members to do their work. The job can become very repetitive, but it does kill time."
good,"My work experience working at Wendy's was ok. I loved making customers feel at home in a public area. Management at wendy's was good at times. The hardest part about working there was keeping up service time,once I got it down it was easy."
good,I worked at Wendy's for about a month and a half. It was a very productive and fast paced work environment. Teamwork is very important when preparing the food and when taking customer orders.
good,Buena dinámica comensal - empleado. Turno bastante ajetreado todo el tiempo.
good,"They will train you to be best you can be "
good,"It's a fast-paced environment to work in. Very flexible with schedule. They have morning, afternoon, evening and late shifts available. You get 50% off your meal during break time. Made lots of friends while working there."
good,"This was one of my first jobs, and will always be one of the greatest for me. The workplace and the management is very fun and exciting. It fills a great void and the pay is decent."
good,"managers are very pleasant to work with. Although it's a fast food restaurant, it's very clean and pleasing to work at. This company opened many doors."
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers and learning new skills. Establishment was clean and friendly.Job security was good. Customers were very polite. I would be glad to work there again.
good,I feel like Wendy's was a great job to be my first job. I got a small taste of the work force. Definitely helped me get a good perspective of how a business worked.
good,"Great company to work for and was my first employeed job. They taught me how to speak better in sales and how to follow protocol at any job."
good,Wendy's is a good company if you are interested in working in the fast food industry. I was not suited for this job.  The store operation hours can be very long and sometimes you will not get home until very late at night ( or early the next morning).
good,"It was fun and educational. It was a people friendly environment. As long as you did your job and came to work when you were needed, you had no major issues."
good,"I have learned many things while working with this company. I gained experience in order taking, food preparation, and how to handle money. Also, the maintenance of the restaurant. A typical day at work would consist of order taking and giving out the correct orders as soon as possible. The management in this store could gain some improvement. The hardest part of this job would have to be multi-tasking. When another employee does not show up to work, it may be a bit difficult to cover their position while working in a fast food restaurant, but we still get it done the right way. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying our customers and being able to form a Wendy's family."
good,"I would do cash to start shift, assign positions, assign extra cleaning duties for that day. When  I wasn't assisting the crew I dealing with customers with or without complaints. I would do my paperwork throughout the shift as time permitted so I didn't have it all at close. I did my inventory nightly, and did waste count as time permitted. Then at close of shift I would do cash and deposits, nightly paperwork ."
good,"Of course the stresses of any job are there, but my days as a crew member at Wendy's are one to remember. I loved my store and my crew. Met some great people and still talk to them this day. It was well managed as well. I worked the over night shift which usually sped on by with the entertainment of my crew, but when it was time to be serious we also knew how to do that. It was a great balance there, but over time the physical aspect of the job became very demanding and mentally draining. You would get to a point where you wouldn't want to do anything else but sleep and come back to work. The pay was decent, it was bi weekly but I enjoyed it overall. I'd definitely recommend it. One thing I didn't like tho, they place you where ever position wise whether you're comfortable there or not, just to replace those who were either fired or quit. It if you're a good employee they will recognize that, either with an employee of the month which consists of free meals for a week during your shift, or offer to train you as a manager."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and to start doing work assigned by the manager. When I first started, I had to learn how to do everything. The hardest part is the rude customers."
good,Wendy's let me see I would think about going back but it's not for me I'm a construction out side type but If I was young yes.They pay you good and good hours.
good,"Working at Wendy's helped me a lot with growing my social skills, i learned how to better speak with customers and learned a lot about time management and how fast food works. Talking a customers order can actually be enjoyable and if you like organization like i do Wendy's is your place."
good,"A typical work day was extremely relaxed, but also busy considering you were working with other people. Customers were sometimes rude, but most were very nice."
good,I loved working for wendys... It was a great frist job at 16. Tgey worked around school for me... Everyone on the team was good and we all worked really good together...
good,"got a lot of experience regarding customer service. I have learned to work efficiently,accurately and with speed. Crew members works as a team.Managers were really helpful and encouraging."
good,Wendy's has taught me how to multi task in a high paced environment. I know what hard work and humility means.  There are extremely busy parts of the day which make the day go by very fast. It is a good first job experience.
good,It was a pretty great first job! There were so many great peers. Which was helpful when there were difficult customers. Everybody had eachothers backs which helped create a productive work place!
good,I worked here for a long time it was very fun and fast past the management treated me very well and my co workers as well I was pretty young but I still got paid pretty well
good,I loved working at Wendy's and would like to work with them again.ilike the way they always put the customer frist..And I like working with the public...
good,Just a nice job overall .the day normally gets hectic around noon or lunch. Pretty fast paced and if yo enjoy people it's the job for you. You can learn a lot from the job such as managing time a thing called skills  coordinate & most of all your communication skill will sky rocket.
good,"Working environment is a fun area. Does get busy at times, easy to serve customers. Easy to learn the job. Management is usually okay with many things, just keep your work a priority."
good,Great people. good work place. same as any other job. good pay managers are fair. store needs to be updated like other stores. Customers get mad because this location isn't.
good,"It was okay until someone feelings get into a place of business. Other than that the place was awesome, great attitude, timly fashion.  The managers was even better."
good,I really enjoyed working for Wendy's International and would have most likely stayed if wasn't wanting to try something more challenging at the time...
good,The Cashier position at Wendy's is pretty typical for the field.  It does require multi-tasking as you are often required to put the orders together and be ready to lend a helping hand to customers' needs and are responsible for cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's lobby and dining room along with all the cashier responsibilities.
good,Working at Tiger Market was a great experience. I loved the environment. The customers are very friendly and easy pleased. The company had flexible schedules which worked good with my full time job schedule.
good,Wendy's was challenging because of how busy it was. Nonstop rushes were a good test of patience and multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to coworkers after all the work was done.
good,"I learned a lot working for wendys. I learned to run a grill. Operate grill, fryers, toaster. I learned how to prepare hamburgers. The management is very positive and respectful."
good,"very good environment , everyone so friendly. i worked almost for 2 year in that time the supervisor teach me everything which is still useful for me if m not working their anymore."
good,"Cleaning the store, customer service, handling geust complaints, handling interviews, food safety, follow company polcies and procedures. Inventory, truck orders."
good,if you enjoy fast food then this is the place for you. Some customers are rude but thats everywhere. There are spurts of busy-ness. A good first job for young ones.
good,Wendy's was my first job ever and i really enjoyed the environment there. The working family treated me well and taught me a lot about being a hard work.
good,"Unfortunately this company has closed due to unforsene circumstances, but i would go back in a heart beat. Management cared for the staff and always made you feel good about yourself and praised you for your work."
good,Wendy's was my first job our of high school and provided me with a great start and helped me get great experience in customer service. I only left because I was looking to build a career in an office setting and they could not provide that for me.
good,Love the environment good coworkers too work with nice and respectful management so much laughs and great talk with customers food fresh smiles all over.
good,"Wendy's is a great place to come and work for a business that will teach and encourage you and your career advancement. It's definitely not an easy job, there are a lot of tough days, long hours, and plenty of cleaning. But with a great team, and management staff, its a fun loving and even enjoyable place to be. You not only have coworkers but some real friends."
good,"Good management, good job building experience. with the food being locally produced made food a bit more tolerable to be around. good people building skills."
good,"A typical day at work would be constant hard work."
good,"Wendy's was my first job. This had to be the hardest of all my jobs. Super fast paced. I learned so much from this job. This job really put me in shape and I learned almost everything in a work enviornment from Wendy's. You had to communicate, work hard, pay attention and have great customer service. After 4 months with this company, the manager of 7 years said to me that I was the best he's ever seen. I got employee of the month three months in a row. My favorite part was when I got everything down."
good,"Wendy's gave anyone a chance to further their career."
good,Go into work early. Start my day with people who I have become very close to. Good kids that work hard. Easy training everyday. Managing very easy and fulfilling.
good,"Everyday you're either on the grill cooking the meat or chicken, on sandwiches making all the sandwiches, or on a register taking the orders. The management is okay, its getting better. The workplace is pretty fun if everybody is doing their job."
good,"takes orders"
good,It was a team-work orientated environment with helpful employees. Cleanliness was a very important factor because we did work with food. Because you aren't aware of how a person wishes to have their food handled you must remain consistent with your cleanliness to not offended anyone.
good,Institute was good. teachers of Oxford institute are very intelligent they all know how to treat the weak child I leave the Oxford institute because my family was shifting
good,Great job for high school teens looking for first job in the working industry. Fun and interesting environment to learn how the real world works. Enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"I like my general manger crystal she was great much love you do a great job. Work hard play hard a good place to work for a person that want to work full time and part time, some time you work over time."
good,I loved working at Wendy's however the managment did not use proper use of their time and I feel like they did not properly train employees. Id love to work there again but not when I get the same pay as new hires while doing staff leader/manager work
good,Wendy's was a fun environment i had fun on the job. Also I like all my co-workers and we taught each other a lot about running a Fast-food. I also gain alot of experience from Wendy's. Sometimes we had through day where people had bad days and sometimes take it out on people.
good,"The time i worked at Wendy's was one of the most enjoyable jobs "
good,"Challenging and productive experience, working with different customers help build a rapport with customers to keep them returning. Staff is very effective and management effective"
good,"Todo es por el libro , "
good,Most days were really great. The hardest part of the job was finding people who wanted to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go out to dining area and talk with the guests.
good,Flexible hours and nice coworkers. The managers were very professional and had a set way of going about things. They were understanding as well.
good,"Wendy's is a great place to offer job experience and knowing the basic work etiquettes and rules. Flexible hours, as well friendly coworkers and supervisors are reasons to join. You can make really great, close friends. As of the learning aspects, this place offers great experience handling situations between customers and employees as well as etiquettes of being welcoming to others. Overall, a great place to have as a starter job, and to stay"
good,"The specific 'Wendy's' I worked at consisted of 60% of college students. This promoted a comfortable sense of unity and allowed for a fun work environment. The management, however, were lax when it came to enforcing rules among the crew members. Though it is a entry level job for college students, it left me desiring more stable management and crew to allow for reliability and consistency."
good,I started as a closer so i worked late nights. overall it was a good experience give or take a couple problems with management. Good work culture and a much better place to work fast food for the first time.
good,This was my very first job. For a beginner I loved this job because it was fast food. You were always busy. I've gotten most of my experience and skills from here
good,"The only thing I've got a problem I had with it was I had to move from Texas to Colorado, and because they were in two different districts I couldn't just get transferred. Besides that I loved working there, and the people were amazing"
good,Its very nice and you have to be very friendly and talk to evryone. You get along with everyone its a veey good place to work and meet new people. I love it there
good,"The work is easy, work time flies by and you meet awesome customers and new people. Great part time work for student. Average 25 Hours given on Regular schedule"
good,"Work environment was decent, staff was friendly and really knew how to work in a team and divide the work load, manager is reasonable and easy going. It was obvious he cared for the job and the employees"
good,"good managers "
good,The management team at Wendy's was overall below average and isn't the best.  Didn't get enough hours that I needed in a week. Always had to work overtime to finish someone else job.
good,Over all this was a great first job. The employees got along great and worked very well as a team to ensure quality. Great atmosphere! Great customers!
good,It is a high volume work place that was very fun to work for for a first time job.  It was flexible with the hours that they gave me but I had issues with management at the job.  They also dont pay very well unless you are looking to go up into management
good,working with Wendy's has been great. Great place to start as a first job because you can get some great experience and can become a manager pretty fast. If you love talking to guest and making sure you give them amazing customer service then this would be a great job.
good,"Great place for a first job, but not much room to move forward in the company. They really do try to keep everyone happy with scheduling and relocating. Very good learning experience; customer service, quality control and cash handling."
good,I believe that the company is an awesome place to work friendly people to be around. the hardest part of the job is when it becomes to rush hour.
good,a good starter job people are friendly and managers are nice to they are very fast pace work area they trained me very well it took me awhile for me to catch on but they gave me time
good,"I open sometimes, and I do try to get Preparations done before lunch rush but I  usually have to do front register and prep at the same time. I enjoy working for Wendy's, the training is good and better than my previous job. The most enjoyable part of the job is making someone smile and making their day a little less dreadful. the hardest part of the job is making a customer wait while i get out orders. My coworkers are very helpful and understanding. They make my job a whole lot easier."
good,This job taught you a lot about time mangement. You couldn't be late. Mangers and staff were kind and welcoming. Long hours with one break.
good,it was just something for high school student to do. I worked here because I needed some type of income and it was convenient overall it was an ok place to be and I liked it.
good,"Overall I think that I learned what it's like to have a hard job, expectations had to be met no matter what. Everyone on the job seemed friendly and was always there to give a helping hand. Management was always there to help. The hardest part of the job was always having to stay later than I expected. I do think that the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet people who I was able to connect with"
good,It's not the typical fast food restaurant. Management is nice and understanding to and situation and circumstances that you may have. It was a good place to work.
good,i learned a lot working here and met a lot of great people wasnt rushed to learn but they taught me quickly. They were flexible with the schedule and hourly
good,"I learned how to be comfortable around people, and not to be scared or shy to talk to people that i do not know. The management was okay the only problem was, they put me on a day to work that I did not choose which was a problem. My co-workers were great they helped me around the restaurant on what to do and what not to do, and they were really fun to talk to. Hardest part of the job was when i had to do morning shifts at 7 so I had to wake up around 5:30 which was pretty hard to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i do cashier because afer a while i loved talking to people and interacting with them, while they are waiting and no one is in line i try and just lighten them up."
good,I made a lot of friends working at Wendy's during highschool. I learned most of the food safety handling while working for them. I also learned a lot about quality control.
good,"I enjoyed working at wendys, It was fast paced and I enjoyed my coworkers. I loved being a closer and I felt like they were very fair to their employees. I wouldn't have left if I hadn't moved"
good,a typical day at work is just everyone greeting one another. greeting customers.i have learnt to get along with different people from different backgrounds from mine. i have a really good relationship with our management team. they are fair and also fun to be around with. i don't think there is anything hard about my job apart from doing a really long shift. i.e 12 hours. other than that everything at Wendys is fine. the most enjoyable part or the part that i look forward to at work are my co-workers. i get along with all of them. i really like to hang out with them.
good,It is an very clean productive safe work place. Everyone who work here love it. The food is quality .The Employees and managers are great.
good,"hardest thing is to keep up the food fresh and ready to go-and-grab."
good,Cashiering or drive thru as well as preparing food. I learned the in and outs of Wendys. Management communicated efficiently and was great to their employees. Coworkers knew their jobs and were like a little family. I enjoyed the fast paced environment.

good,Working at wendys was one of the funniest times I've ever had in my life. you can really bond with all your coworkers and learn the importance of teamwork and work ethic while doing it
good,I did so many positions here from cashier/Customer service to preparing food to cooking and cleaning the best part was getting a chance to interact with the customer and learning what they wanted or fixing any thing that may have went wrong with there order.
good,"If you work really hard and follow all procedures and targets and systems and keep all employees in line and focused, you will move up within the company. The job is hard if you don't like to stand for 10 hours a day, but you will get in a decent shape if you don't eat the food and keep moving yourself and your crew."
good,Wendy's was interesting and a very productive place to work and I learned a lot from my peers and mangers. I wish that the managers were more considerate of younger adults that were still in school therefore they won't have to work too late hours.
good,"Great work place, friendky mangers in some shifts,  working at a timing fashion, learning how to work at a fast pace. Co-workers is willing to help when needed. The harfest part of the job is when the customer come in all at once that rush hour when orders just keep on coming no stop and with out a great team it can get really messy."
good,"A very good job to have if you enjoy fast paced working, and definitely a great work environment. Very amazing people to work with, fast food has just become a dull area in my life. I'm looking for something different, otherwise i'd stay as long as I could. There isn't much hard about the job, other than the pace but the most enjoyable would be the people. Everybody is crazy in their own way, and makes fast paced work a little easier."
good,"Πολυ καλη εμπειρια σαν μανατζερ, καλο προσωπικο, ευχαριστω περιβαλλον."
good,I honestly can say that working at Wendy's helped me gain self control and make me a appreciate patience and thinking before reacting. Other wise my experience was helpful and I'm happy I choose FAST FOOD for a youth first time job.

good,"Each member of the team must deliver the best quality food and good service base on the standard of the Company. Being in a restaurant business was challenging but it is fulfilling when you see your customers are satisfied and goes back to your restaurant. In return, they give you business."
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work because we were located directly across the street from the university as well as down the street from one of the nursing homes. Because of this, we had a diverse group of customers, from students and their parents to professors and the elderly. It was also common to see those whom are disabled with volunteers because we were also down the street from the community center, a place where people with disabilities went to enjoy each other's company. I met both rude and sweet people alike and had many regulars. My one downside would be that some of the managers had favorites and it was clearly shown. They also brought personal issues into the restaurant and were unprofessional at times. Other than that, no complaints."
good,Everyone is extremely supportive and are positive. Everyone is willing to help and there is so much rapid growth. There is a big opportunity at this place as long as you put in the time and effort. So many people have expanded.
good,"Working at Wendy's was a very relaxing job , there weren't many rush , such as other establishments. Wendy's workers a also very team- oriented as well , the mangers were very helpful if needed. Working a Wendy's better developed my communications skills , because of the strict requirements."
good,The management was okay as there were a few bugs that could be fixed. Managers did help out and where there for you if you needed them.
good,"Wendy's is very focused on great customer service as they should be, customers are definitely number one. Working there I acquired many skills, such as interpersonal skills and the ability to stay calm in stressful situations."
good,There I received my first knowledge as a manager. There I learned how to lead and manage people. The environment was great and I enjoyed working with all of my employees.
good,Every day is a challenge at work coming up to new customers on a daily basis. Customers satisfaction is always our first concern.
good,"Great boss, mostly friendly & competent coworkers, decent pay and good benefits for supervisors/managers. Also flexible hours which is really nice."
good,"I really enjoy the work, learned a lot of good things and get a chance to become a manager and learned how to deal with the customers."
good,I took customer orders and maintained the cash that was in the drawers at all times. I enjoyed all my coworkers we had our times but we always worked out our problems. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers we would get all the time. the most enjoyable is when we got good comments about how the staff treated the customers
good,Pattman LLC (DBA Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers) is a quality company which emphasizes the core values of Dave Thomas.
good,"employee weekly scheduling and shipment ordering for the coming days"
good,Working at Wendy's was a pain but it was made a lot better with my co-workers. They all worked hard but were able to have fun at the same time.
good,Wendys is a good place to work.  They have a great crew.  Its busy makes the time fly by. I would recommend wendys as a first job
good,Wendys is a great restaurant they use real beef the food is a little up there but the quilty of food we push out you are not going to find anywhere but at wendys
good,"I learned to work with other people and faster. The management was good and my co-workers were great as well."
good,I really enjoyed working at this location. The general manager taught me the basic skills and ethics of working. I worked everywhere in the restaurant and never got bored. All of the staff were fun to work with.
good,I was an Asst Store Manager but started as Crew and under a year made it to Asst so you work hard Be Flexible!! The more you know how to do and become the best at it with Wendys they will work with you at least where i am from.
good,The work days went by pretty smooth. The people there make it very enjoyable to go into work.The hardest part would have to be the lunch rush.
good,While working at Wendy's I learned about team work and and how to give good customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was to deal with all the types of customers that came in and being able to see them leave with a smile because they were happy with the service they were given.
good,Very friendly team and management. Great learning place specially for people in customer service industry. Great Place for work and fun.
good,I enjoy dealing with people and meeting the challanges of the ever changing public. I have built a regular customer base while trying to gain and learn more about the community around where I work
good,"I worked about everywhere, I learned how to work the grill, Back cash, order taking, front cashier, that managers are people too that thy try their hardest to help the employees learn the most and be better qualified in other areas of work"
good,"I've only been at Wendy's Corporate for 6 months now, and I really enjoy it.  They provide plenty of room for different oportunities, and gives you the push to grow."
good,The hardest part of the job I believe would be the customers. Being able to deal with various people -polite or rude is truly something that must be mastered.
good,"I worked at Wendy's for 4 years, I would typically work drive through."
good,Wendy's is a very fast paced work environment. i learned many customer service tips to help me in the future. the staff is very friendly and out going. i love the fact that they donate money to the Dave Thomas foundation for adoption.
good,Amazing work experience. I loved everything about this job. The co-workers were the best. We were like one big family. We would have like some small little races against one another. The hardest part about working there was not getting breaks and working some long shifts. The closing people had the most fun. At times we would play music and dance like dorks. There were some times when we would make food and bring it in or order pizza and eat to when the store was closed. We ran like a well oiled machine. The best part had to have been the co-workers. Most of us would hangout outside of the store like go to the movies or the mall.
good,A typical workday consisted of being prepared t work in any position your manager needed you to work at with a variety of people not only with coworkers but also work with customers to ensure service was always pleasurable.
good,How can fast food be fun at all? With the right people and a good team. Each employee learns every position so anyone can help anywhere.
good,overall a great please to work for someone fresh out of school or someone n collage management is good as well as coworkers just to little pay for the work detail
good,Fast pace friendly i've learned that doing the right thing goes a long way. Management training is one of the best very friendly staff hours can be long for management but worth the smiles on the customers face.
good,I had fun with the employees but i was constantly being treated as though i did not know what i was doing. The environment was constantly dirt behind the counter and the supervisors were often rude or condescending.
good,"It was tiresome but the money at the time was very fulfilling.  I loved how the burgers tasted.  The management can be difficult, depending on who was managing.  If you had a manager who really cared, then the workplace can be very rewarding.  Teamwork is an absolute requirement for this job."
good,I was working and going to school. Honestly the crew became like family no matter the Wendy's I ended up at. It was always team work while I worked and if I felt someone not being apart of the team I had no problem picking up the slack. Hard work will be learned here.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and getting to work with my awesome co workers and other managers. I like that Wendy's has made me grow as a person and manager. I enjoyed getting fresh food out in a timely matter and putting a smile on the customers faces.
good,Working at Wendy's was a great place of employment. The time taken to ensure staff is trained and up-to-date on the work environment was management went above and beyond.
good,"very busy place ,fast service.very fast pace work .great management.great for short term .No opportunity long term.Not enough pay according to work."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Hours are very flexible. Politics seem to be kept away from the crew as much as possible. The best days were when everyone helped everyone else. The worse days where when you got bus loads of customers back to back. There was always plenty to do and it keeps the mind clear.
good,"Interesting place to work, you had to stay on your toes. Maintained positive environment and you can room to grow. You always could have something to work on."
good,"I would always start working in the back as soon as I clock in. They would send me to different stations wherever they needed a crew member. When I first Started I recieved 10 minute breaks. After I turned 18 I recieved 30 minute breaks. I loved working with the crew members there most of them were around my age, so we got along well. I got along with my managers who were in charge while i was working. The longer I worked, the more things i would learn."
good,"Fun and laid back environment to work in.  Employees are all very different and from different places and all have something great to offer.  Never a dull moment, keeps everyone upbeat and having fun while working.  Managers help each other and are all on the same page with executing daily objectives."
good,A typical day at wendy's is like any day at a fast food restaurant. You learn so many things but at wendy's the managers and co workers treat you with respect everyday. I have learned how to open the restaurant and close it. All thanks to the patience that the managers had to train me. I learned in no time. Co workers as well are very friendly but I am easy to get along with and get along with just about anyone. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the rushes and with working on clifton hill you get so many rushes. All you need to do is do your best and go as fast as you can. Being friendly all the time and providing fast and friendly service is a must. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting compliments from the customers of how nice I am to them and how they love my service. Many customers have told me that I am the nicest person who has ever served them in a long time or if any before.
good,"Overall Wendy's is a great company to work for. They provide you with compensation and benefits, job security and plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,Its all about the quality of service and having great customer satisfaction to our best of abilities. Working at Wendy's has been a wonderful experience for me and helping me to become a better leader and understanding of what it takes to get a job done and to perfection.
good,While working at Wendy all the staff were always nice and some had their attitude problems but over all they were all good to me.
good,"It was a pleasure working at Wendy's. The rush hours are always the fun times, as it's when we don't stand still and everyone is on their feet, including the manager in charge."
good,"I learned how to do many different activites such as drive thru, fries, cashier, busing tables, customer service, and grill. It was a very fun and nice work place. I loved going to work everyday. It is a great place to work."
good,Wendy's has processes and procedures that are easily to follow. We put our customers first and strive to make them happy.
good,"slow and fast pace at times"
good,Wendys taught me a lot about myself that I thank them for that. I learned that hard work pays off and that my name is attached to every job i completed. I learned about professionalism and that not every one practices such beliefs. I made an impact on customers daily and helped store cleanliness and production. I wish they focused their needs more on their people. As a manager I learned to lead.
good,"I closed at Wendy's, and found that the days were repetitive. The management was great and understanding when you need time off. Co-workers were good people and many became my friends. Hardest part of the job was how quick paced it was during the rushes. The best part was talking and getting to know my co-workers during slow times."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on what day of the week we are in. It is mostly busy during the weekends. While working at Wendy's I learned how to be more sociable, speaking up when needed to when it came to needing help from other co-workers. The most enjoyable and sometimes hardest part of the job was when it was fast paced , customers started flooding in so I had to take all the orders, make all the orders, and make sure everything was correct with no helping hand. But, I enjoyed it because it gave me something to do and after while I got use to it."
good,It was going well the entirety of time I was working there. It was busier during the weekends. Everyone was nice and friendly.
good,"easy and fun"
good,"A day usually starts by knowing the store's performances the day before such as sales and labor reports. Finding out the good or bad incidents that occurred and using that information to decide the goal for the day and use it to coach certain people in the store. Also, I manage to ask how everybody is doing, and ask for any concerns regarding the store."
good,My typical work day is taking orders making sure they are correct and taking money and giving back the correct change And waashing the dishes when I am not taking orders. Everyone worked well together no conflict at work. The hardest part of trhe job is keeping the dishes down after we go through a rush
good,wendy's was a great place to make friends to work with and help keep each other in good spirits and some one to talk to when times get tough.
good,"Wendy's is the perfect first job to those fellow teenagers that are eager to learn about money and how to handle it. It has many opportunities for its crew members to grow and being a part of the Wendy's crew is much like being a part of a family. Of course family is dysfunctional and because of this our Wendy's store had to struggle with not having enough supplies to make it through the week, but we have always made it through. The hardest thing about working at Wendy's is when it becomes busy and we are understaffed. Many of the coworkers have to double up on responsibilities and jobs that require two people are done by one. The most enjoyable part is when the Wendy's crew comes together to provide quality foods with excellent customer service and speed."
good,"It was a nice company to work for, although when it came to school events that were graded not so friendly. It was fast paced and the time at work went by very quickly, they made sure that their staff was doing all the cleaning requirements needed to be a successful company."
good,"A typical day at work was taking orders, packing food, serving drinks, cleaning, and helping guests with any questions or concerns they might have. I constantly dealt with customers. I've learned, through this company, to treat our customers as guests. Management was very flexible and understanding. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was cleaning the bathroom in between guests. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and satisfying guests."
good,"•Received orders and payments by cash, cheques, credit card and handled cash accurately;"
good,Management was strict but they were also very fun to work with. I learn fast and work faster. Having high trust in you and your capabilities knowing in any moment I would have to prepared to be on my own. I enjoyed talking to the customers the most and having the wends name which I represented be part in making somebody smile. For me at first the hardest part was keeping up with such a professional group of people.
good,A typical day at work busy some slow moments dealing with bad customers. I learned to succeed in a job as a manager you have to set goals and maintain a manager and employee relationship with the employees instead of being a best friend with the employees because once u become a friend and not a manager to them sometimes you lose control over your crew and once you have done that its hard to get things back in order. Management and co workers were okay just got to wrapped up in being friends with them instead of being the manager. The hardest part of the job was watching my back didn't didn't know who was out to get my job until it was to late. The most enjoyable was my customers.
good,"My day started at 5:30 a.m. I learned to make the store the best it could be. "
good,"Working at Wendy's was a blast. Taking and receiving orders, stocking inventory daily cleaning duties. Always learning new things, about different ways to do the same job. "
good,Wendy's Restaurant is a place of learning and a place where you can be more productive. Working here has given me the opportunity to make new friends
good,"Arrive fully dressed in uniform including your smile. Rather all the information I needed to complete me shift. Speak and interact with my crew, go over the shift with a huddle. Interact with my customers to ensure they are having a great eating experience also to ensure revisits. Wendys has taught me life long experiences for example how to further my customer service skills, multi-tasking, improved management skills and able to work in a stressed related environment."
good,"Business is sporadic. Sometimes you're slammed, sometimes it's dead. Lot's of teens who call in a lot. I've honed my communication skills and I have learned how to be more efficient as well. Management is up and down, but they get you through the rush no matter how bad it gets. The coworkers are up and down as well; attitude is everything regardless of position. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is getting through the Mega bus' which stop multiple times daily."
good,"The day usually started with prepping the salads and doing last minute cleaning to the lobby or in the work space. When a rush would start things would tend to get chaotic because there's a lot of people, and sometimes there are a lot of customers that aren't the nicest and that puts some employees in a stressed mood. Under the team work chatter were the employees that made it seem like high school all over. There were cliques if you will, people liked others more than other people and they talked about it. I recall someone stealing money from the registers and come to find out it was one of the managers. The hardest part about the job was handling rude customers and sometimes rude employees, but all that was nothing compared to the smiles of the happy customers and talks about superheros during the down times."
good,"A typical work day would range from 8-12 hours, helping customers, managing workers and help maintain a healthy work place. I learned how to balance out the pros and cons of working at a fast food place, I also learned how important team work is. My co-workers and supervisor were also great people to work with and be around, they definitely could make a bad day turn great. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with upset or unsatisfied customers, and on the other hand the most rewarding would be to make a customer happy."
good,Very good place to work. They truly care about their customers and the how clean the place is. The managers aren't the easiest to work with. They all have their own opinions.
good,"Wendy's has an friendly environment, The employee's and the customers make you feel very welcome. The store stays neat and clean."
good,"I enjoyed the work for the most part. It wasn't grueling labor, though some portions of the job did kinda suck, mostly the cleaning. But what I really did enjoy about the job was working on the drive thru. I was generally the one who would work the voice comms and I really liked talking to people over the headset and often getting compliments about my voice. The co-workers were mostly relatable people, very laid back but stayed on task."
good,"- mostly spending time on the operations and couple hours a day on paper works"
good,great place to work and develop customer service skills...opportunity for management always and being responsible and reliable is a must
good,"With an emphasis on the work/life balance, Wendy's has a strong team atmosphere. Many fun activities that allow you to network with other departments and have fun."
good,through the we learns you gain alot of knowledge of the the business. its a fun place to work and to gain training for fast food. hardest part for me was my turn over for higher up managers.
good,I have tried to train on 2 or 3 jobs. Trainers not very patient. And when I brought it up to my gm. He took the trainers side. I started out as a cashier the person training me was /has  emotional problems like I do. People would pick on him&not me but I was afraid to make a mistake. For fear they would. I have anxiety disorderand have showed my temper. But there is condesention ramopant . If not done right first time I am ridiculed for not understanding.
good,"I have worked for this company for a few years. Besides being somewhat non-professional in atmosphere at times, it is a good place to work. It is a fun environment with a good sense of teamwork. Consistent hours."
good,"I had quite a busy day. I started at 9 am, i put potatoes in the over, started prep, set up stations, did dishes, made chili, and stocked up the food line. I also took orders, handled cash and communicated with other employees as well as customers. I was moved to front counter where I was mostly just taking orders, but would help in other places, clean, organize, stock and prep."
good,"As a cashier I greeted all customers with a smile, making them feel comfortable and welcome. I took orders fast and made drinks. I was expected to keep my area clean at all times no excuses. I washed my hands frequently through out the day. If we were short staff I took orders, made the drinks and bagged the food for each customer. The manager was very driven and hard working, he motivated us to keep working to make sure all customers were satisfied.Sometimes he would help me take orders when the line became too long."
good,"•	Ensure appropriate food preparation activities"
good,"A typical day at work would include taking orders and presenting them to customers. I learned that customer care is very important, even for personal reasons when I want to have my own restaurant. My co-workers were very productive because we were working as a team, for example, if one had many tables a co-worker would help without wanting to receive anything in return."
good,I would come in the managers and crew friendly as always would greet me. Then the managers would tell us the goals of the days and in which positions they would put us in. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with customer complaints. Only because its they are in a delicate state and you have to be careful to make sure that the issue is corrected. The most enjoyable part was putting away the food order.
good,I was a cashier I interacted with other co workers who had great work ethics. The management were very helpful when I was new to the team had no dislikes for management. The hardest part of the Job was afternoon drive thru a lot of customers but the team made the day successful on a every day basis. My enjoyable part in my Job is making the customer's satisfied.
good,"There were good days and bad days but there were more good than bad. I got along with almost everyone at the workplace so there was not much stress when it came to my co-workers. The customers were also friendly and we even had some ""regulars"" so customer service was smooth. The only times i ever stressed out at this place was when we had a lot of rushes at once and we began to get disorganized, whether i was at the food or the cash register. Other than that, i enjoyed working there."
good,"Mostly, we are a restaurant that gets a lot of people because I work in Union Square, which is a huge tourist attraction. I learned how to work with the entire store and for that reason, I am working towards management. My co-workers are all great and I enjoy there company while I'm working there. The hardest thing at the restaurant is the grill station because there is so much responsibility when it comes to doing that station. I really enjoy the register because I get to communicate with customers which I really enjoy."
good,"A typical day at work differs depending on whether you had a morning or night shift, with a morning shift you start by cleaning the grills from the previous night, emptying whatever fry vat had to be cleaned the previous night, fetching any meat needed for the first pots of chilli and power washing one of three sections of the drive through followed by the basic tasks expected of a fry cook. When working a night shift tasks expected of you include possibly emptying one of four fry vats and filling it with cleaning materials, storing unused products such as chilli, nacho cheese and salsa, sweeping and mopping floors, cleaning the fry vat filtration unit taking out garbage and dumping the leftover grease in the disposal unit."
good,Customer service interface was the main job here. You had to deal with rude customers/ truck drivers that were impatient. This taught me to stay calm in any situation that is brought tome negative or positive. My co-workers always made the day fly by. We all became close like family.
good,Very fun and fast workplace. meet new people everyday with interesting things to tell you all the time!
good,"I learned how to get work done in a timely manner. the hardest part of my job would be the lunch rushes, it could sometimes get over whelming. but I always loved the challenge. as a first job i feel like it was a good first pick for a first job"
good,Wendy's is good place to get experience .It is hard to work there but you get a good experience working with different population which you can use in your future life.
good,"Over last 13 years I have trained and a developed a highly responsive work force who are todays leaders in hospitality industry."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great experience. You'll get to work in every station over time and become an expert. Coming to work is your relief of the day and making customers smile is the objective and it will make you learn new things about yourself while you learn about them, especially regular customers."
good,I really enjoyed working there. The people were very nice and everyone was like a family there. I'd go to work make sure my shift was set up for success and have to coach people with what they needed to do that day. I learned how to be responsible from working there with dealing with the money and banking. The hardest part would have to be dealing with all the stress that came from there. I always kept my calm during my shift though.
good,"I learnt a lot from this job. It gave me a sense of responsibility. I interacted with the clients and made sure everything was at their liking. I also cleaned the dinning room, So they could eat in a clean and proper environment. The staff was very pleasant to work with and so was the management. I had a very nice experience working here"
good,i had a good time working here also had some trouble because i was pregnant.
good,A typical day at Wendy's is really is very fast pace fast food is a very difficult and challenging job at the time I was a freshman in high school at the way until my senior year but it was fun the whole 4 years. I learned how to please the customer and put a smile on there face and keep my customer service on a very great level. I got along with management very well a great manager. The hardest part is once you get busy it last for at least 2hrs straight. I enjoyed everybody I worked with also another great starter job.
good,i love it here. just not enough pay.gets stressful at times. but i like it alot more than past jobs
good,"Opening at 8 am to turn on machines top up shop and receive order from the day before."
good,"Learned how to cope with different personality"
good,"Wendy's was a pretty decent place to work until they got to a point where they would be rude and nasty about me being a few mins late to work. I did have a small child and still do. I was told that other employees have children and they still make it to work on time but none of their children were incapable of taking care of themselves. Scheduling was pretty good and they work with you the best they can; i got off everyday i requested. Once I started closing however, it was different. I was sometimes expected to work from 6 pm to sometimes as late as 3am and then expected back at 11am. Then if I didn't show up a big deal was made. Overall a pretty good place to work unless you have young children. This was my experience but feel free to make your own assumptions."
good,"Fun and supportive work environment all co-workers and a genuine care and love for one another, management was very understanding of personal issues, I really enjoyed working here and would return."
good,My boss was straight forward and focused so I picked up the technique quickly. I worked nights at a downtown/college location so we were almost always busy. I quickly picked up the strategy of grilling burgers and keeping them fresh in line with what would be needed. My co-workers were mostly teens who spent a great deal of time texting but they seemed to get their jobs done well enough. Grill Cook was a new title for me and I was proud to handle the station. I knew the experience would be invaluable and the 50% discount found me eating lunch from our kitchen on every shift.

good,"A typical day at work for me as General Manager consisted of training, hiring, and serving the guest. Food safety was always a top concern and we conveyed that to our team. Wendy's was my first management experience and the foundation of my career so I learned everything from profitability to handling guest concerns. Since I promoted from a crew person to General Manager, I am grateful for my senior managers that invested in my development. The hardest part of the job for me was to gain the respect and confidence of my fellow crew mates, because the store I promoted in was my home store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a testimony to others that if you work hard and stay focused you can succeed."

good,"My Typical day at work is I come in a I get all of my stuff done before opening. I love to have fun while I work and I like getting to know my co-workers that I will  be working with everyday. I really like the management, My managers know when to work and how to make the job fun. I would say that the hardest part of my job is when we are constantly moving around. It can get really and and sometimes make you really tired. Most of all I am hapy to be working with some down to earth people that take the job seriously as much as I do."
good,"Manage employees and prepare food for customers"

The most enjoyable part was of course, getting to eat Wendy's food."

Hardest part of the job would have to be stress level because how fast paced it always was."
good,"I basically had one main position. I worked 4 hr days due to me still being in high school. good managers, and everybody worked together. Nothing was really hard about the job, just had to make sure every customer as satisfied."
good,i worked here when i was 17 years old . this was my first job overall it was great i just think it wasnt the job for me.
good,"A typical day at work: There is always some sort of problem that you face everyday. None of the days go smoothly."
good,"Working at Wendy's was an awesome experience. My typical day would average 5-8 pm till around 2:30-3:00am, anywhere from 4-7 days of the week."
good,"A day at work would always be fun with the co workers I had, and also the location. There was never a dull day at Wendy's, whether there was a difficult customer or someone drove into one of our bushes in the parking lot. Our store was fun to be in when you have customers to serve and a strong crew who will always keep the store clean no matter what and also knew how to make you laugh."

good,Wendy's is a fabulous place to work for.  People are friendly and engaging.  The work is challenging.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of fast-paced maintenance of the grill and delivery of food while working together with staff and joking during downtime. Management was highly involved with store activity and worked well to communicate between and motivate employees. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work load, but the most enjoyable part was bonding and growing as a team."

good,"Great team work environment.  Comradery hold the whole thing together, everyone puuling together for the good of the team."
good,My time as a franchisee with wendys was very enjoyable I loved my staff. The most enjoyable part was when I call on the riverland community to donate to the vic fires.  Myself and staff boxed up 19 pallets of household items and sent them to the poor people of vic that had lost everything. My staff and I where a little family. We had respect for each which is very important in the work place. I learnt to be a good listener and also patience with customers and staff.
good,"a day was full of counseling and giving orders. i had to learn how to transition for a regular employee to assistant manager position. my manager was very helpful. my workers were young so i had to adjust to being a boss rather than a friend. they played a lot and always were trying to get over, so i did some counseling and warnings up to write-ups. i enjoyed customer service."
good,this was a great way to learn some new skills.and practive skills i already had.
good,"I usually go in about 3:30 to do shift change. IE Change drawers in the cash registers count down the drawers enter them into the system put different drawers in and then go and do a safe count to a certain amount of money. Afterwards I do a deposit. I work all over the place trained all over the kitchen on multiple and many things. I've learned how to manage money better, and how to be a team leader when times get hard and get the store back on track where it belongs. Other management like the GM work real close with me together we run the store and when we are on shift together we make sure it runs as smooth as possible. My co-workers age range from 16 to 48 It's funny, You never seem to think about it but when you all work together it seems that a day is literally a couple of hours. I do a lot of hands on training and retraining to make sure every employee knows and follows proper procedures during a regular work day as well as an inspection. When something is ""Done"" I always look over it and know that not one single piece of equipment until you inspect EVERY aspect of the machine and DETAIL ever inch of it. The hardest part I think would probably be the over whelming part of your name being called over and over sometimes it can get out of hand but then i remember who and what I am, This is a team, There's no I in team so I better hustle.I think the most enjoyable part of my job would be the fact that you get to come up with new and exciting ideas to make the store run smoother, to keep track of inventory better and to keep track of all the ins and outs of the store as far"
good,This job was fun at times. Never looked forward going into work. Every minute spent there was doing the best work as could be.
good,"It was a fun experience working for Wendy's, it was a lot of food to be making everyday"
good,It was a great job to get me through college. The management and crew members were great. The job was easy. I learned how to prepare food as per the standards set by the Georgia Health Department while maintaining a great customer service experience.
good,"Your typical Fast Food job. Flipped burgers, took orders, etc. But I had fun with it - Was always super friendly to my customers, trying to put myself in their shoes. Figured I could be miserable like all my co-workers, or else I could try and enjoy my job! So I enjoyed it to the best of my ability, and hey! I actually had fun! No complaints here. Although, I couldn't give a minimum wage job any more than one star for salary."
good,"Opening store for employees,assigning daily tasks and clean-up."
good,the work load isnt too bad when crew works together but sometimes management sits down while the crew runs the store
good,A typical day varies. I learned production and customer service. I also learned to handle small situations where a customer had a problem with their order. The management was like family to me. The hardest part of my job was being off when new products were introduced. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we received bus loads of people and when the carnival setup next door we used to laugh at each other especially when they came before the shift was over because we knew it was going to be busy.
good,"Working at a fast food chain consists of dealing with a lot of pressure; from co-workers that work at a comparatively different pace, managers that push you to work faster in order to meet a certain service time goal, and your accountability with regards to meeting certain food preparation standards in a timely manner."
good,On the beach nice views from the rooms I loved it but some people there were rude and nasty.

good,"My typical day at Wendy's would be making sandwiches, which is the hardest part, taking out trash, cleaning tables, interacting with customers, preparing fries, taking orders, washing dishes"
good,"A typical day was to just prepare for two ""rushes"" of each day. When lunch rush was over, we had to prepare for dinner rush in 3 hours. I learned a lot of time and shift management, efficiency skills such as balancing labor costs and order completions. The management group is very enjoyable. They work around your schedule if any situations come up. The crew is a hit or miss. Some of them are really hard working and fun to be around while others like to do everything but their assigned job. The hardest and most enjoyable part of this job is to just get through the day with a lot of sales and good drive thru times."
good,"Got to cashier position."
good,"The job itself is a little demanding, it is a fast-paced environment. However, the people you meet are priceless and you get used to that fast-paced part of it and it becomes less demanding with more experience. You learn how to deal with difficult customers and how to be a part of a team. "
good,"We get pretty busy but we all work together as a team and do what we can for each other. We have the best managers who know how to train us, be serious but fun at the same. We are taught put the customers first and do what need to do to take care of them and make them happy."
good,"A typical workday would take planning and most definitely team work. I was responsible for 10 people or more per shift depending on the sales that were projected. As a manager I always pushed for quality food and service from me and my team. I found it important to be positive because my attitude affected my crew. I never had any problems getting people to work for me."
good,i had some good times and some not so good but if i had to go back i think i would.
good,you have to work quickly. hours were crazy but overall good place to work
good,"It was a non-diverse environment , i felt very lonely and it was almost like every decision was bias ! I learnt to be quick and smart when completing tasks , management were very friendly and understanding most times , although the lack of faith in crew members was a little disapointing . My co-workers were very hard working people , i have gained life time friends . hardest part had to be living upto the expectations of the old crew memebers and being steady . Enjoyable part was being able to provide cutomers with great service & food and than receieve great feedback :)"
good,"Very friendly staff, family like atmosphere.  Pay wasn't great.  I loved that it was fast paced and I was always busy.  Worked with my availability and always listened to my situations."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was fast-paced. I was always on my toes and completing multiple tasks at a time. I learned how to work well with others as a team. Everybody had to do their part for things to go smoothly. My manager Mr. Stuart was a good man. He taught me the ropes and got on to me when i messed up, but he also made me a better worker. The hardest part of working at Wendy's was when the rush hour came in. All the workers had to move more quickly to get all the orders out in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends. My co-workers were very social people like myself."
good,"Clock in, stock your area ,find cleanng tasks. Prepare to be busy nonstop for hours with a few down periods. I learned a lot about customer service. They are really big on customer experience. management are eager to teach you. plenty of advancement opportunities"
good,"Wendy's was a very busy place to work. I learned what good customer service consists of and that hard work pays off. My management was awesome she was patient as I learned all of the new things that go with a fast food job. I feel that with this particular job experience that it made it possible for me to enter any job with confidence. I loved my co-workers because my management made sure that our work place was a friendly one. The hardest part of this job was having to walk out into the dinning room and talk to the customers, but now it has been beneficial to me because I do a lot of public speaking for school. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people every day."
good,"very fast paced and busy, working on a high volume store you learn to move at a pace to suit the needs of the customer of course in proper yet professional manner."
good,"co-workers and customers are always happy and friendly I've learned a lot about how the sales industry works picked up a lot of useful skills such as multitasking under pressure, keeping up customer relations, up selling product, and being productive while maintaining a healthy clean and safe work environment."
good,"I enjoyed working with the different personalities. We knew how to have fun as well as being productive at the same time. "
good,Making sure everything is rush ready. Employees are following prep guides and procedures for product drops. Need a clean store to start with so make sure closers have followed the guidelines on having a clean store. Compare sales and adjust projected sales to what kind of day you might have depending on the day of the week. Love the fast pace environment.
good,i loved working for the company and always enjoyed my coworkers and supervisors. but there was that one were we didnt see eye to eye and that caused issues. if it wasnt for that one i would still be there

good,I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I learned so much working for this company.
good,A great place to work and make new friends and meet new people managers are great except for some of the district managers they don't really show respect or value workers they look at race.
good,Very high turnover in crew and management.  i learned and practiced all Food Safety and Sanitation Guidelines.
good,"On average, there is a significant level of customer traffic. One thing I learned was how to handle a plethora of different customer requests and, at times, complaints. The management was fair if a bit rigid. By far, the hardest part of life in the fast-food industry is keeping up with sales while simultaneously performing cleaning duties, which can easily result in longer nights which drain your energy due to lack of sleep. In stark contrast to this is the rare glimpse at the favorable nature of people as sometimes you will see a happy family out for a congratulatory meal or a good Samaritan helping an elderly couple who cannot help themselves."
good,"Friendly co-workers and management"
good,"It would start off slow pace, but graduall pick up in volume. I worked night shift so although I may have become wiery customer service was still required. A substantial amount of work madem sure we always remained hands on with something productive."
good,I learned how to interact better with others. Management was good they love what they do. My co-workers worked hard. The hardest part of my day was staying up after the lunch rush. the most enjoyable part of my job was going to work everyday.

The hardest part of the job is to maintain food area clean and giving fresh food with less time. Most enjoyable part of the job is when we complete  our daily task within allowed time and make co-worker and managers happy with our job. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was having to deal with customers who automatically direct their irate attitude towards you when your trying to explain that they are absolutely right( sometimes, depending on the situation) and correcting their order if needed. "
good,"This had to be my favorite job, although there weren't many chances for advancement, i always looked forward to going to work everyday and had a great time while i was there."
good,"platicar con los empleados en la mañana o tarde sobre situaciones o problemas del dia anterior, preparar todo, limpieza, comida articulos todo para estar listos a la llegada de los clientes resolviendo en el dia problemas que surgian, compras, limpieza atencion a clientes, etc mis jefes eran argentinos eran muy amigables aunque exigentes y me obligaban a superarme eso fue lo que mas me gusto de ellos, lo dificil fue que como era comida rapida se juntaba la gente y tenias que andar a las carreras atendiendo a mil por hora pero eso a la vez me gsutaba porque me servia de ejercicio"
good,"it was an easy job. the work was easy, the co workers were very nice. i would work here again only if i had to."

Work place being a customer-centric, I delivered the best of the best customer service and dealt with problems in a professional manner."
good,typical day is a busy day
good,"This job was very fun on most days. There were very stressful times for example if money did not come out right, trying to figure out why. If crew members did not show up for their shift you had to make sure to cover it. There were times that as a manager you would cover 2 or 3 positions at a time. This was also a high demand job that took priority in your life."
good,"I spent my summer working at Wendy's. You get kind of throw into the pond, but it turned out to be an amazing place to work. My managers were awesome, patient, stood by the Wendy's values and kept everyone working as a team."
good,It was always fun working with the people there! Overall good work place experience.
good,"food prep,cook,take otherswork cash register.close the resturant during closing hours. Customers are always right. the management was very informal,respectful,and fun to work with. my co-workers all worked well together,and was there for assisstance when needed. The hardest part of the job wasscrubbing the food out of the tile. the most enjoyable part of the job was completing the job quickly."

good,"The job is overall ok, and so as the employees. A typical day at work for me is preparing fries."
good,"Wendy's has a strong family culture. Until the recent downturn in the industry, most employees have worked with Wendy's for over 15 years. I had been there almost 12 years, and still felt a little like a newby."
good,"cashier, cooking, cleaning, fun team members, busy location. 30 min breaks, 50% of food when working."
good,"The main thing I appreciated with the specific restaraunt I work at is the focus they put into keeping everyone employed and finding a balance in hours despite changes in minimum wage or insurance legislation. The training is half online, making it possible to learn at home if one so wishes, and encouraged greatly."
good,"Prior to working at Wendy's as a crew person, I was a manager at Hardees' Food System. I took the job at Wendy's when I was a full time student. I worked part time to full time as I could and that was dependent on my school schedule. My primary job duties was to run the drive thru register where I took orders, handled cash and credit card transactions. Assisted with housekeeping, prepping of food, cook, and assembled orders."
good,I would clock in to work. Then i would wash my hands and start making drinks and fries till the resent cashiers shift was over. The i would start making peoples orders. I would clean the dinning room and bathrooms before i got off. I learned it takes team work to work in anyplace. I have learned to always tell the truth. I liked my manager that hired me but the manger after him was rude and unfriendly. The hardest prat of the job was learning everything so quick. I enjoyed working with other people and meeting new people.
good,"My workplace at Wendy's is a great environment to work at. The regular customers are great and the staff is also very friendly. We work as a big family rather than a team and I never get tired of working because of the ambience. The hardest part of the job however is not having enough hours a week as we have so many employees. However, the management tries hard to please everybody but they cannot always satisfy all demands."

good,"Open o close the store, count money, and make sure resturant run smoothly throughout the day."
good,"Clean, Prepare food, handle cash, stock, Cook and Organize...I learned what proper temperature for food.. HOT & COLD. My co- workers are hard working and team player.. My manager is like a teacher, counselor and advocate all at once.. I love the place of every job i ever had... unfortunately, there's life obstacle each moment to make changes."
good,"Cashier and Window Coordinator perform a multitude of job duties, greeting customers, submitting orders, and operating the cash register. The cashiers perform food preparation and drive-thru duties, cashiers perform cleaning duties in the dining room."
good,"Cook, cashiering, prepping food, cleaning, rush lunch hour management okay enjoyed coworkers"
good,"In my time at Wendy's I was a cleaner. I maintained clean dining areas, cleaned the facilities and stocked condiments. I also occasionally cleaned the outside grounds. I learned that while the work could be tough and the customers could be rude at times, it was a not bad. Again, sometimes different personalities in leadership could cause some minor issues, but the communication was somewhat effective and any issues between the worker and the manager were kept behind closed doors."
good,Great experience and great hours. It was fun and memorable. Meet new people. Overall great moments and experience.
good,Good Pay/Benefits. Managers in the store were very friendly. Didn't have to drive far to get to work. Really good with getting time of if you needed it. Talking to regular customers that would come in every day (some multiple times a day
good,"A typical day at work I would check and make sure everything is done from the employees from before for example floors are clean cleans the walls, stock up, dishes once that is done, i help with the customers take their orders and if their are no customers for me at the front i would help the people in drive thru, always something to do."
good,i worked there for co-op job for school to help when i get an actually job
good,The store I worked for at first was very nice. Management is not an easy job.It takes teamwork to run a store and if you do not have the help of managers it makes it a very stressful job.
good,"Days at Wendy's was pretty smooth they would have their busy times for the lunch hours, then it would slow down so you can get your side work done. My management team was great they worked hard to make sure that the store was running smoothly. The co-workers I worked with was very nice and helped when it was needed. When I first started at Wendy's it took me a while to learn the back drive window having to take orders and take money at the same time, but once i learned it I was fine. The best apart of working at Wendy's was meeting new people every day."
good,"A typical workday for me starts off with motivation and a positive demeanor. I learn something new on a regular basis so, i can not pin point all that i have learned while working for Wendy's. The management is very unique, There is never a dull moment while working for the supervisor of Wendy's. The Co-workers i work with are what makes this career so exciting to work for. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with some of the negativity from the customers and/or the staff throughout certain times of the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is making sure the customers are satisfied with the service as well as the food being given to them."
good,"Take customers orders, help customers with their orders."
good,a day at work was another day to earn money. you cant make everyone happy.we had a very good management crew. all the coworkers were happy and always had a smile or a joke. running out of product. knowing i just a happy guest
good,"A typical day at work for me would start with me being assigned to a register, either at the front counter or at the drive through. What I learned how to serve customers in an establishment that specialized in fast service and inexpensive carry-out food. Management to me was professional with the guest but not so much with their employees. Co-workers were very pleasant and friendly with one another and were always on-time, and very rarely missed work. When I first started the store needed to be brought up to standards, to a sparkle certified clean store, which it wasn't with the previous owners. Providing established friendly service to customers I found to be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It is nice, fun place to work, if you can keep up; however, it doesn't pay well seeing as I am a single mother of three young children, and I would like to advance my career experience and have the opportunity to further myself."
good,"At work I would typically be on fries or register, or sometimes organizing orders. I learned amazing customer service and how to operate a register. I had very friendly co-workers and helpful managers along the way. The hardest part of the job was the speed but I got used to it as time went along. The most enjoyable part was meeting and making friends with everyone at work."
good,"Shifts were managed well but staff was unreliable, and would work double shifts all the time"
good,"The restaurant I was at I was fortunate to have such a great manager the ran the store when I was employed. The crew members stayed for long term periods, which really made it become a second family atmosphere."
good,"Come in start my day off preparing for the day. Everyone do their jobs, good co-workers, great management. I enjoy when we work together during lunch, then it gets hard when everyone comes for diner."
good,"Typical day at work was kind of laid back had maybe one or two rushes a day. I learned alot about teamwork, workpace, and the different types of food bourne illnesses. Management was good strong core I was part of the management there at the store. My co-workers were all dedicated to the job and willing to do everything right. The hardest part was trying to balance out the right amounts of food to cook without letting it spoil when we were slow. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers they were always fun."
good,"I loved working for Wendys. being off the interstate I was able to meet people from all over. As far as co-workers, we were one big happy family."

good,I working at wendy's for almost ten year and no substantial raise in pay is baffling. good company and you meet some cool people along the but the aggravation and low pay makes you want to look elsewhere
good,"The hardest part of the job would have to be rush hour. Mornings, afternoons, and nights were the toughest because your working in a fast pace area. Its called fast food for a reason and you want to make sure you give the costumers your full and top service while making sure your speed is fast paced."
good,"working the grill, register, and sandwich board. i learned how to work as a team. the manager made the easier. the co-workers was fun to be around. the job was not the hard to do. was working with my co-workers."
good,.come into work around 8:45 and pull money
good,Teaching new employees postions and watching them continue and grow was an amazing sight to see.

good,It was a alright job but it became to the point I didn’t want to work there anymore because it became toxic and everyone was mean and rude and I tried to ignore it but it wasn’t helping me I started going to a bad place because of the toxicity
good,I would always be the casier in the dining room. I try to give everything to my customer they need that way they were happy. This company is very serious when it comes to their restaurant as well.

good,"My last four years at Wendy's were good because the employees are all nice and friendly, especially when it comes to dealing with difficult tasks. Parts of my work were stocking shelves, cleaning the bathrooms, and the dining room, changing the store signs, and keeps the grounds clean."
good,Wendy’s needs to respect there workers a little better. Rush is a thing everyone deal with but they bush 180 seconds per car and when you go over they get mad
good,They have always been good to me but of course you want to make friends at work to make it a lot more enjoyable and exciting. They will often work with your schedule if you need something changed.

good,"the hours were flexible, very interactive staff, and understandable management. Along with a very enjoyable environment, this store stood out to me amongst others, with a cozy, clean, interior."
good,The hardest part of the job at Wendy's was keeping up with a fast-paced work environment that they have up there especially during lunch rush because it's a constant flow of customers and it's hard to balance quality and efficiency but we had a good team there and we were able to get it done.
good,"The job and crew are great very family oriented and fun fun fun .Some days are a bust when other workers are down and it's busy, but we know how to get through it and make each other's day worth being at work .it is a open honestly policy with most employees that work here but we love it."
good,this is a great first job to have i definitely recommend just based off of the experience i had. i loved the energy from my coworkers and management and i always enjoyed myself at work
good,Very high pressured sometimes it can get very overwhelming but if u can keep it together you will make it through. You can also learn alot achevie alot of goals. Making new friends and make something so overwhelming so fresh and friendly feeling.
good,Working in Wendy’s taught me how to serve and speak to our customers with respect & help them in need. I’ve been working there for about 3 years now and have well experienced customer service.
good,"It's a pretty nice place however it does need to be improved team work at the specific job place I worked at needed improving on communication. Staff was respectful, and restaurant was clean."
good,Work was a little scattered with employees problems but its such a small town. Made sure that customers left happy to enjoy their time visiting the grand canyon
good,"Learned all positions and mostly put into best fit position. Management was okay, then became better after finding more well suited Managers. They were very flexible and cooperative."
good,"A typical day at work involves productivity, team work, customer satisfaction, and fast-pace learning. I have learned how to properly care for customer's needs, proper cleaning practices, and conflict resolution skills.Management is fairly inclusive and flexible, there is a highly diversity of culture within the workplace. The hardest part is dealing with short-tempered customers and the most enjoyable is learning new skills."
good,I have to say that even though I dreaded working fast food it’s not that bad. I love (most) of the people and feel like they have my back. It’s a good job and good pay.
good,"I loved this job , I was ready to work everyday . I met new people , it was a whole different environment. My managers was the best && all the customers loved me . I was very nice & understanding ."
good,"fast paced work environment "
good,I really had no problem with working here the only reason I stopped working here was because they wasn't giving me enough hours and they had really slow business so I mostly just stood around all the time and I couldn't take it. No bad comment though the managers were great and my coworker were very nice
good,Job has it’s good and bad days but otherwise food place to work. Very involved staff with its workers. Good atmosphere.  They set goals to make sure to workers are to maintain and good company.
good,"Wendy's is often filled with customers and usually requires lots of moving, cleaning, and restocking. As much work as it is, the people are overall friendly and patient. The only downside, I would say, is the lower amount of pay than I would like. The energy is very welcoming and I often find myself occupied with the tasks i'm given."
good,"the management are ok, their professional and treat their employees"
good,I had fun working there and I respect anyone who can do that type of work. I wasent able to keep up in that type of work but I still value the education And experience I got from working there.

good,"My time at Wendy's went much smoother than I thought it would. "
good,"Working at Wendy’s isn’t a complicated job it’s just fast food. It’s a moving fast environment which I wasn’t used to when I first started, however now that I been working there for over a year I’m comfortable with the pace and I can keep up , love the crew and the managers !"
good,The job provided me with flexibility. the staff was amazing more like family. The food is amazing. and there was always a positive atmosphere whenever I worked.
good,I think it was great I felt comfortable and felt wanted there I would love to work there again and try and work my up to become a manager I felt wanted and loved the environment
good,They were great people but the hours were bad and sometimes transportation was a problem but I loved the fast paced and and competition got another job closer to me so I put in my 2 weeks notice
good,I have been with Wendy's off and on for over 23 years. It wasn't great when I first started but has gotten considerably better in pay and in flexibility. They offer a lot more incentives.
good,I had a good time at Wendy's but i feel like that if the job was to easy and i wanted more it was very easy i applied my self of every position and became an team leader so i had to be determined to maintain my employees and compromise with customers I did good but i feel that if i could have more in life.
good,"Nothing too particularly outstanding to say, but nothing bad either. Liked the discount and owners were good from what I can remember. Good job for high school kids"
good,it was a good workplace i liked the environment. i just need a different job because of many different reasons. although it was a good job i need something different.
good,"It was always busy, from open to close. There was always something to do it was never boring. It was a high volume store but we made sure to keep up to avoid any confusion or conflict."
good,"Easy environment to work in, employess work hard, very clean over staffed not enough hours always changing managers and supervisors rules changing daily"

good,"Fun, fast pased, energetic first job, great to learn basic prep skills and customer service skills, hot to talk to people and give them a satisfactory service"
good,"Gained a lot of experience working for Wendy's. Fast paced, very enjoyable environment. Full time work schedule. Only downside was getting paid biweekly."
good,If your not shooting to be an manger the pay can’t really help you out on anything. I worked there all through highs hook and it was a good job for me beating that I was still in school. But overall it’s an alright company
good,"I would say Wendy's was a best place for me. I gain more experience there. I learned so many things from Wendy's. Management was really good . Really good workers , Friendly environment"
good,This was my first time working in the fast food or restaurant industry. The training program was well put together and I was responsible for the grilling the burgers.
good,When i worked there I felt like i belonged.  But my pay was not fully correct. The management team is very friendly and helpful to everyone. There are opportunities and benefits to accumulate. Was a very fun placd tht o work .
good,This was a good place to obtain management experience to make me a better nurse I was able to learn alot about managing a crew to make the store run well and efficient.
good,It’s fun and productive it was amazing working there with lovely people I loved going to work and being there and then coming back and doing it all over again
good,Good place to work. Flexible schedule. Understanding. Fast paced. Worked there for over 3 years. I enjoyed the schedule working as a team i would wotk there again

good,"Pretty good place to start as a first job. It was my first job and i enjoyed it alot. Good for kids in school. The best part was fry duty, wasn't too hard."
good,"Wendy's was my first job. If you stick with it, and actually work, it's really not bad. And I assure you, your efforts get noticed by management. Very good for a first job. More family-esq than McDonalds. Less industrialized, while still providing a solid foundation for moving into the workforce."
good,"working at wendy's i met a lot of different types of people and all different kinds of attitudes but, it made me more of a level headed individual. I also learned that you cant take everything to heart."
good,"I learned many things from Wendy's, like customer service skills and being faster.  There were some people that I interacted with on a friendly basis and there were some difficult to work with, but I manage through that."
good,"Wendys was my first job in my first year of high school"
good,I leaned a lot from that company I wouldn’t regret not one moment of it. It made my experience so much fun and the opportunity to work there was amazing but I always wanted to work at the airport.
good,During my time at wendys it was very enjoyable I got to work with a loving staff the only thing that new workers have to get used to if they aren’t already is the face pace environment because that’s what you run into everyday
good,I don't know what to say about this right now  I just came back to work here I have only worked three days as of now I hope it's better than last time I work here
good,Team work makes it all that much better  specially in a fast food establishment to get everything to the customers in a  neat manner the order that it was received
good,Some managers where nice and cool to get along. They didn't get mad when you messed up.  They help you correct your mistakes.  And made sure you was doing your job right.
good,it was an good entry level job they showed me the ropes the managers were pretty nice and stayed on top of things they were understanding and the job was pretty chill if you did what they told you to do
good,As a single mom i took the job at Wendy's because i needed it. But in my opinion its the kind of job that someone in high school or college should take
good,the best thing i about being there was that i had good people around me  and the benefits work their is good and easy to learn i have learned how to work with different
good,It was a fun place to work in. You can make new friends and its really easy to learn your tasks. Not a hard job to do at all. Works with you if you need a day off.
good,"My work experience at Wendy’s was all round and very social. I started off as a sandwich dresser and would also work fryers. I only had a few days of training but I had a grasp on the knowledge I’d learned the prior days and through my orientation of my job. I picked up on it real fast and I was soon placed in the drive-thru window and it was stressful at first, but I picked up my pace and soon found my self in a rhythm. After that I had a handle on it."
good,"I enjoyed working with Wendys because it was a good inviroment and the crew was nice. I enjoyed meeting new people daily. It was a good job. I had a good experience working on the nightshirt, and learned allot about fast food."
good,Training was a breeze. I caught on to everything pretty quick. I’ve been working there for 3 years and my experience and job facility was really great. Managers were very professional and work place was very clean and satisfying. Everybody always worked as a team and got along like a family.
good,"Work with foods"
good,"I’m a full time manager at Wendy’s corporation. Having to do inventory, training crew &’ other managers. Things just did a turn for me in the business, the job isn’t what it was 20 years ago."
good,"The time that I was working here it was a bit stressful but also fun, the team members is great to work with, the hours are good, it's overall a great job"
good,"Overall, it was fine.  I kept being told by people I previously worked at McDonalds was that this wasn't going to be as exhilarating as I had hoped, but it wasn't even about that - it was about finding a job closer to home and Wendy's did just that for me."
good,"I loved working at Wendy’s. Probably one the best places I worked at. Wendy’s really taught more about team work and other values. I also really loved my team,  it was professional but at the same time fun experience"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with new people but also the returning people. This would allow me to build a relationship with these people.
good,Working at Wendy's as a cashier and sandwich maker can be very fun . because you stay busy depending on what location the Wendy's is. The customers can be very rude and some can be very nice .
good,"Loved working there. Defiantly a quick paced job to work for, as long as you stay away from people and their drama. Managment was fun for me, I really loved it. Would reccomend working here for a decent paying job."
good,I worked for the company for 13 years as a member of one of the local area offices staff; I had an overall very good experience working for the Wendy's Company.  I would have continued working for the company had it not been for the fact that the Company sold their Corporate restaurants to a Franchise group.
good,They a good company to work for they just need better employees and less drama and arguing in the workforce. Other than that they work with your schedule.
good,After working at Wendys i learned that its better to be good at multiple things and that you cant be afraid to make mistakes and also embrace the little things because some people will notice
good,A typical day a Wendy's is taking order and making food. i learned about team work and how to be more respectful other.The Wendy's management team was grate to work with.
good,"Wendy's was full of vibrant and funny personalities that worked together nigh- seamlessly. Although sometimes they had their differences, they put all that aside during work hours in order to get the job done."
good,The hardest part about my job is trying to stay focus when 2 or more people calling you for things they missing and still be having to take other people orders.
good,"thankful for the years they provided me employment, and have always been there as a second family throughout the years. it was hard to leave, but i'll always go back and visit"
good,"The job wasn't as easy when i first started there, it was difficult at first but once i found my way the work got very easy as days went by. I did sandwiches and grill, so it was pretty as, workplace was kinda dirty, but it got better as months went by."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's  for the most part because I knew most of my coworkers from school and it wasn't a difficult job. I would recommend Wendy's to anyone looking for fairness in the workplace.
good,"It can be very busy and overwhelming at times, but the whole crew works together to help each other and its like we're a family. I wouldn't want to work at any other fast food restaurant"
good,Working with Wendy's was a fun experience. They we're great and is a great working experience in the food business. Nice people to work with and to get along with.
good,"I'm currently still working at Wendy's down Bruce B Downs. It's my first job yes, I've been working there less than a year (4 months) and I'm looking for a new job currently in the moment also. The job is decently okay? The General manager can be more professional and have more communication with their employees,"
good,"Wendy's as a company is one of the few fast food places that genuinely cares about food quality, and the workplace atmosphere is very friendly. Positions there generally ranked from working the grill(s), making burgers/sandwiches to order, taking customer orders over a headset, collecting customer payment and handing out orders, working the front-counter registers and taking orders, food prep, and general store maintenance."
good,"Working there was a good experience i got to meet different types of people, the staff & management was organized & caring to employees & customers, the benefits was fair, the experience was interesting & fun, the pay was fair and flexible, it was a good place to work."
good,"I was heavily relied on at Wendy’s completing multiple task at a time. I had no problem with doing so, I just wish the pay was a little more for the amount of work I did."
good,"With a background, you would be limited to what could be done when a background check is performed. If the background check came back with positive marks it could put you and your job in jeopardy"
good,Its a good company to work at great people good environment not a bad place to work at nothing wrong with the food just the people like to complain about what time they get out of there after close
good,"When working fast food, you can't expect the best of the best. Working at Wendy's would be great for someone who needs a start. The people make the job fun."
good,It was really nice working there. Flexible hours and highly recommend it. My co-workers were really great and also supervisor too. I love working there.
good,"Good work experience . I got do something that I have always want to do, to work with food. The only problem its district managers need to have better work ethic at the wendy I was working at. All of them are bad."
good,Over all is was a good place very clean n healthy no matter what wendys location I was at. Only downfall is working with teenagers. I just needed to make more money faster which forced me to look for a better opportunity is all.
good,"Depends on the market in which we live. In Springfield Illinois its an awesome place to work as there are no jobs. In Indianapolis its like a daycare with teenagers and cellphones, as there are 1,000's of warehouse and distribution centers"
good,I would say a normal work day here is no different from any other fast food place.In my opinion Wendy’s is one of the easiest jobs to accomplish. It’s what you can expect at a fast food place.
good,very good nice and wendys was a nice experincse with me and my friends and my manger work wtih e and we really enjoyed our time with our manger thanks wendys if you see this
good,It was relaxed but fast paced. Learned leadership and teamwork skills. Managers were very helpful and gave me good instruction. I made lots of friends and gained experience.
good,"Wendy's was a job that I first started was there for a year but, need more pay for my family . Also I felt that something in the job needed to be better for the crew members ."
good,Working at Wendy’s will teach you a lot I didn’t expect to learn as much as I did Wendy’s teach you to be organized clean and accurate and  multitask I enjoy working there it’s always a goal you try to  achieve
good,"at Wendys, I've learned a lot about teamwork, the community was very friendly, it helped me to improve my customer service skills since I was mostly put in the cashier position.over all it helped me improve my skills and it was a good experience."
good,Good place to work. Team members and management were very friendly and worked together.
good,"Management was okay. Hours are great. Good pay. Learned multiple different positions like fry station, cashier, sandwich station, grill. The hardest part was probably the crew not always working together when it is neeeded."
good,"An average work day was 10 hours minimum,  Most days you could be expected to work 12 hours on average.  "
good,I liked working at wendys i didnt want to quite but i was in a abusive relationship with my ex husband and he made me quite it is a good place to work if u like working for place that have moments that u have to rush and then moments where its slow
good,"When I started working at Wendy's it was easy money, its a fun workplace when your around good energy, When you have the help to get orders ready. The hardest part at Wendy's is when your backed up and there's no help. Especially when dishes are backed up. so Wendy's wasn't for me I started getting stress. The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers, depending on the manager working the shift. If you can handle easy money and being overwhelmed well fast food is for you."
good,"En tant qu'étudiant c'est une belle place pour travailler. La direction est pas compliqué, il suffit de faire son travail comme du monde et on t'aidera si t'as des difficultés."
good,Wendy's was a nice place to work meet alot of people everyday people like to eat Wendy's and the people was always friendly to the workers also they workers were nice and easy to work with
good,"Une journée commence a 11h pour 17h "
good,Wish i can go back .i learn how to make the sandwiches in like 4 days and i kept it clean for all the customers at all times. I got alone with every one and kept people coming to our store. I gave Great customer service.the worst part was when i had to leave cause i had to move back to philly.
good,"Cash control"
good,"Helping customers with questions along with orders."
good,I learned to work fast paced and more collaboratively. The Wendy's industry was tiring but had its funny moments aswell. I wish I could have stayed because it was like family.
good,Throughout my time at Wendy's I got to meet with all sorts of people and nearly every single one of them was a wonderful person and they did their job and they put a smile on my face too.
good,"New to Indeed, did not know I forced to write a review. I do not have anything to say other than this was a great opportunity which taught me a lot of great skills."
good,"fast past always something to do worked during the summer so never a dull moment, would have stayed but the pay was not enough to live on so needed to move on to better things..."
good,I loved working at Wendy's because the environment was friendly and everyone was always happy. Helping customers is what I enjoyed the most and preparing the food.
good,The work was fast pace and very productive. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I enjoy working there. The management was excellent. They were fair with the pay and fair to all employees.

good,"It is a very fast paced environment during the lunch and supper rushes. But the expectations were very fair, and the work required was very fair as well."
good,Friendly crew members and management. Always there to help with anything. At times it can be busy and stressful because of the short staff but together they always get the job done
good,It was a nice job. I left and went to another job when the opportunity came. There’s pretty much nothing else to say about the job because it’s been so long since I’ve worked there.
good,"You walk in, you do your job, and you go home. It's a simple job, I learned how to work under stressful conditions, time management, the menu, customer service. The hours were very flexible and that worked well for me."
good,Day to day was a normal day full of surprises and fun. I learned how to be a successful brand manager. as far as the culture it is what the GM choose to make it.
good,"You are paid the lowest of what minimum wage is in the state of Georgia, maybe even below that for a job that requires more work than you're being compensated for.  That's a little disappointing.  However, the food discounts are nice and the people are extremely nice and very welcoming!!!  There is room to grow in the company and move up into a management position.  Getting to know the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job.  While the hardest is sometimes keeping up with the amount of orders coming in at one time."
good,Not always busy start to finish allowing you a great rest during your break. I learned how to produce items quickly and efficiently with 0 mistakes. management was amazing and friendly while the work environment was a little hostile. the hardest part is getting fresh orders out the best part is getting fresh orders out.
good,Its a great place my crew is nice and the work hard. the customers are the only thing that stresses them out thats about it. days arent hard and managers do their job well
good,"When I applied here first, I was a 16 year old very desperate for a job. When I was hired, I quickly fit in with my coworkers and learned quite a bit about working a food service! I would definitely recommend this job to anyone around that age group. The only thing is; beware of hangry customers!"
good,"I  learned a lot of manager skills with this company like scheduling on  budgeted hours, ordering product needed by reviewing previous sells and making each shift had coverage for the flow of customers. We had a great crew here and all got along great enjoyed going to work and the people I worked for and with on a daily basis. Pleasing people is the hardest part of this job cause they are hard to please sometimes."
good,Good learning experience  overall. Helped further my career and gave me hands on training. Very thankful I was able to start from the bottom and work my way up
good,I started working with Wendy’s when I was 18 years old I’m now headed on 28🤣 So I have a lot of knowledge and work experience due to working with this company. Got me to other management offers I didn’t think was possible for me. Great place to learn the ropes of working in the food chain
good,It’s Ok I Mean I Loke It But Its The Employees That will Push Ya Buttons Other Than That Everything Is Fine Once You Get The Ropes Everything Will Be Fine
good,"Coming out of high school or college breaks, this is an easy and great way to get in the field of customer service"

good,Everyone is nice and respectful. We usually just do our jobs and communicate to make and take orders. I learned to take orders and serve people every day.
good,Really great people here. Had a lot of fun making friends here. But work was really fast paced. But I wasn't here for too long. Perhaps if I worked here longer I would have eventually gotten a better handle on my duties.
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's is fast-paced and stressful. Although stressful, if you are open-minded and work well with others, you will not only have a job to come to every day, but also a family."
good,"Very fast paced, but the managers are willing and able to teach you and help you grow. It’s a family environment there, everyone knows everyone. The GM is very good at what she does, she’s been there since the 90’s and she LOVES what she does. Flexible work schedule, GREAT benefits, and considerate management. There is a lot of potential for growth and promotions, especially if you are willing to relocate. All training is done on site, with the supervisor always near for any help. I wish I’d never left there."

good,"Dont have nothing  bad to say about the job , but the fast food industry needs to improve a little bit more,for there employees and give more hours, day and more options for all employees"
good,"It was my first employment experience in the food industry and everything worked out pretty nicely. The wage was pretty disappointing but it was a decent part-time, student job, nonetheless."
good,upon working at Wendy's I would have to prepare the customers orders accurately and in a timely manor to ensure the customers satisfaction so they are more likely to come back in the future.
good,"they treated me fairly, manager was tough but fair.  I would recommend working there.  The most enjoyable part of working there was discount on food.  Culture was tough but OK."
good,This was my first job. It was very interesting to learn how a fast food restaurant runs. Was given the chance to show my customer service skills when interacting with customers.
good,"Opening store getting store prepared to open for public, manage food cost, labor and crew members. Check stock edibles and unedibles that need to be ordered to provide the best service."

good,it was a nice place but the managers weren’t good and didn’t like to help a lot i left because of the hours and how they were with us but I loved my coworkers and it was nice to work with them
good,"Fast paced job. Easy to move up and easily given opportunities to try different positions. Family friendly work place vibe. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the customers/rushes without a full team, hard but manageable."
good,It is a stressful place to work and is very quick-paced but it has helped me to learn to work with others and to learn new things fast and efficiently.
good,"My typical day at Wendy's would begin by clocking-in and then I'd walk to the job function board to identify my station for the day. The drive-thru window was the easiest station to work at. Its where a beautiful plain was able to be watched from afar & a piece of  enjoyment was able to be felt especially during my interactions with my colleagues. A great help always came from my colleagues especially if they seen that there was difficulty at a station. The burger-build-station was the most difficult, but was managed with about 2 or more kitchen members, who worked greatly together. Whenever there was to much clutter, we'd put our effort & time together to clean what was around, but never to let one struggle alone with a task. The kitchen area would be left organized by closing hour."
good,Was giving a great opportunity. The job was very fast paced. Time management was a must.  Also attended many workshops that was very useful for me to use at the store. The only downside I can think of was call-ins.  The up side was seeing your crew working well together.
good,It’s a fast pace environment with great customer loyalty. Great opportunity for advancement with good pay. Always thriving to be better than the competition.
