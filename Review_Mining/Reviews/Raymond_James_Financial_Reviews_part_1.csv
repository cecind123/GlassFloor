bad,"The Cost Basis department is a dysfunctional one where the supervisors rule by fear. Turnover is high so they keep hiring contractors. Managers and supervisors play favorites and gossip. Before hiring people, the department does not seem to conduct background checks. "
bad,"This place is like the Red Lobster of the '80's...old, outdated and riding on a good reputation they once had decades ago. Do you like getting credit for your ideas? If so, don't work here as management will steal your ideas in a heart beat. Do you like decent benefits and wages? If so, Raymond James is not for you - the wages here are very sub-par, no 401k match, and you cannot pick what stocks you invest in. Out of their competitors, Raymond James is ranked 9th out of 10th - they make this up to the shareholders by keeping pay and benefits low. Check out the competition, like Fidelity, they have amazing benefits and pay way more. "
bad,"Raymond James is the Red Lobster of the finance Industry - it was good in the ‘80’s and is quickly going down hill. Do not work here, management is terrible, there are no incentives, bonuses are a joke. I spent over 8 years here and there is no room for growth. If management can steal your ideas, they will. Raymond James is run like a highschool - petty, and unkind."
bad,"The back office of Raymond James does not care who they hire. I am confident a proper background check was not done on anyone specifically in the New Accounts department. They are just hiring anybody to fill a seat. Most of the new hires would do and say things that should not be done in a professional work environment. Most of it is overlooked by management or encouraged. More than Half of the time the supervisors were the problem. Workers did not care what they were doing or how they were doing it. This puts pressure on the few good employees to do the work properly. This resulted in constantly correcting their errors. Work life balance is non existent. If you work over time constantly you will be promoted even if you lack the basic understanding of the job. Also, you will only get promoted if the supervisors like you. Training is severely needed for the supervisory team. I can’t stress this enough or just get qualified people. If you are a hard worker, a good person, looking to advance your skills, please do not work here. You will be beaten down and under appreciated."
bad,Everyone was a bigot and sexist. They made it well known. Constantly racial profiling in the worst sense. I had to be reminded about dressing extra conservative (beyond the dress code) because a certain male employee was spending his day looking down my shirt. I was told I could not take my first vacation in 3 years because my boss thought my overseas trip was too extravagant.
bad,"Two of the three gentlemen are ok but the manager is not a nice human being which makes him a worse boss if that’s possible.  No reviews ever, no pay raise ever, no dental insurance, no 401k.  What can I say it’s just a job and horrible one at that."
bad,"Worst job ever, type of place that can put you off all back end financial services work. Paper pushing. Horrible unprofessional management, that  had backing of a passive aggressive  ""complex manager."" No training,  Generally toxic environment with conservative culture. Advisors abuse admin staff with no reprimand. Not sure why they require licenses. The work is office work at its most accurate definition."
bad,Fire people becuase they dont want to deal with complaints about other employees of different race. If you file a complaint against an employee and you are of a different race just watch out becuase you will be the one to be fired because they do not want to deal with discrimination
bad,"You will never become top management unless you are white southerners from certain colleges as a employee if legal issues arise"
bad,Be very careful if working for Raymond James.  They play favorites in all departments.  There is no loyalty and working hard doesn't get you anywhere except the unemployment line.
bad,Only took the position to have a job and bring in some money between jobs. Very low pay and no possible way for advancement.  Worked for three managers and was told at interview it would be more money but as it turned out it was not. The business fell off greatly and they could not afford to keep me.
bad,"I would not recommend this to a friend. The work environment is surface level friendly, and the hours are tough for relatively little pay. There are other firms in the area"
bad,"Management has no control over the conduct of their employees.  In the RPS Department, they actually have a name for these 2 Associates that bicker all day.  Stay AWAY!,,"
bad,"I only worked for this company for 6 months, I didn't have very many duties so I was bored, answered the phone and file, I have to have a position that will keep me busy."
bad,Management stinks and there is a constant high school clique quality about the firm. Work is constantly dumped on associates who are already swamped while others are allowed to surf the web all day. Certain people get away with everything while others are hounded constantly. Turnover is extremely high here so beware.
bad,Only want people who have degrees even if the work is in the mail room. What a joke! They only care about people who can get jobs with their degrees but the ones who have trouble finding work can't get in!
bad,"Worked in Corporate Imaging.  One word Horrible management.  She is a slave driver for little pay.  Not matter how much you do in a day it's not enough.  Expect management to talk about you behind your back.  Expect drama to be create to try to get you in trouble, especially if you are a temp."
bad,"The RJ HR department is a disaster so do not waste your time by applying. The turnover is staggering and employee satisfaction is the worst. Everyone in Tampa/St Pete that works in the HR space knows not to work for RJ. Again, DO NOT waste your time."
bad,"Imature culture, poor pay, untrained managment, culture that teeters between back-stabbing and simply imature. HR function suffers from lack of strategic leadership and emotional intelligence."
bad,A typical day of work consists of sorting contracts for correct processing.  Each day there are new laws and rules and areas that are constantly updating.  My co workers and I all got along together at a team.
bad,Working in the environment of Raymond James was not pleasant.  The pay is awful for the tasks that are expected and your treated like a gerbil on a wheel. I do not recommend working for this company.
bad,"There are unrealistic expectations from management, who incredibly have no QA background themselves. Time to market is king, quality takes a lesser role though they talk it up. Reality is it's more important to ""show"" effort. Pay is low given expectations for 55+ hours a week. Lack of advancement opportunity. You can't get promoted in place and have to wait for a position to become vacant and bid for it."
bad,"Unfortunately, sales assistants or client service associates are managed by independent owners who may or may not care about their employees' best interests. The mother company has no power over how these employees are treated. You have no recourse if you are working for a branch manager who doesn't care to appropriately compensate or treat their employees."
bad,Systems are way behind other firms.  Management and Compliance have no idea how branch personnel work with backoffice departments but  they will punish employees for the way they do things even though it is the normal process.  They don’t treat all employees the same.  Way too much favoritism.
bad,I had the worst manager that I have ever worked for.  His boss wasn't much better.  My manager was let go after being verbally abusive over and over to his direct reports.
bad,"The firm is only concerned with their reputation and their company. They talk the game of creating a beneficial culture for all employees, but in reality, they are only concerned with protecting the firm and the Raymond James name in these volatile times."
bad,"This is a very cut-throat environment, brown nosing and FA talk to agents like they are not human. Also, if you know anyone in upper management you can get away with anything. So be the favorite."
bad,"Low pay, no respect, no leadership!"
bad,"Horrible place to work. Financial advisors are under- compensated compared with competitive alternatives. Management threatens advisors to "" do business a certain way, or else..."" Very little marketing money to grow your business and you just don't get the suppport you need to grow your business. Run- don't walk from this out of touch firm!"
bad,"You won't be supported here - it is all about providing services to the branch managers, since they produce. If you aren't producing $, they don't care about you. Horrible management and horrible work hours (60+ hours a week). Horrible technology too."
bad,"Management maintains a hostile work environment where micromanagement is expected.  My co-workers who had been with Raymond James for many years had all drank the cool-aid,  they would not talk all day unless it was a specific work matter...  No place for me."
bad,"Leadership is completely removed from everyone. The company claims to care so much for its employees, yet they rolled out a horrendous system that hurt operations, and they also pulled our benefits back and gave us a horrendous new plan. Communication is very cut off. As such, they have cultivated a lazy, bitter culture where accountability is absent and excuses are prevalent. This is not a company for someone who dreams big and wants to change the world for the betterment of society. If you have a vision or a dream or want to advance your career, don’t start here. Innovation is not a priority. All the company cares about it risk. Risk is very important, yes. But when you take on risk at the expense of your claimed values and at the expense of your employees, then you cultivate a very toxic culture of displeasure and misery. There is good leadership, but even those individuals struggle to influence a better culture and plan for career growth."
bad,Without a doubt the absolute worst employer I have ever had. There is an attempt underway to change the culture and bring current technology to the firm but I'm not certain it will be worth the wait given everything else that is going on in the world.
bad,"Don''t be fooled by the fake cutting edge, collaborative culture.  This company lacks technology know how and management to think strategic.  With 600 Billion in assets you would think that they are taking care you stuff...but they are not.  They make there employees pay $20 to make a trade....so you can continue to be the working poor. Conservatism is one of their pillars....unfortunately that means weak technology, which means dying dinosaur!"
bad,If you're a brown noser you have a  chance to move up or to a different department.  If you're a contractor they want you to work harder than the permanent employees.  They constantly remind you and address you that you're a contractor.  They treat them like they're illegally working there.  People don't speak to you while passing by each other.
bad,"If they dont like you, you will know it. No dignity in the dept. I was in. Unfriendly, talked down to by both supervisor and co-workers on a weekly basis.. Made to feel beneath them. Being new to the dept., I left after only 5 weeks in. Yes, it was that bad."
bad,"Working in a manager position with a pay scale of an entry level employee.  Health care is HSA this is terrible for entry level employee that can’t afford to pay up front. "
bad,Managers frequently discriminate against lower paid employees based on status.  Preferential treatment and a double standard used in dealing with employees. Customers with the most money are idolized - those with lower incomes are scrutinized. Very clickish work environment.
bad,"Salary was much lower than competition and other dis in Tampa Bay. They do not have a good culture. No culture to speak of really"
bad,"Overall a company that is not team focused, as such, the left side never knows what the right side is doing.  Focus is 100% on FA's and not on core staff that keep the company running.  Benefits are poor, especially when considering they are a financial firm.  The 401k match is only $1000  and the profit sharing plan is some proprietary firm account that you have no control over the investment options.  "
bad,"Conservative environment and culture not for progressives. Great if typical Administrative work is your thing and you have been in the field long-term already. Basically you help the advisors make their money taking in whatever demands they place on you therefore progression isn't enforced or promoted because they depend on you. "
bad,"Unless you know the right people at this company there is no chance of growth and advancement.  You can have four degrees, more education than your manager, excellent work ethic, utmost professionalism and be highly skilled and qualified it doesn't mattrr.  It will not get you any recognition to move up in the company let alone compensation no matter how much you apply and give excellent interviews.   They hire their buddy and pals to fill open positions.  Plus they promote who they like.  This company is very cliquish.  They have and will continue to lose top talent with this mentality.  They need a culture that fosters growth and avancement.  They need to encourage and foster educational endeavors and not just pay for performance but pay for how much education you have or obtain.  Not everyone is on the same level."
bad,Raymond James was the best job I ever had until we acquired Morgan Keagan. MK was given control of Institutional Fixed Income which led eventually to very few RJA Institutional employees being employed.
bad,I enjoy the work at Raymond James very much and the people I worked with. The management did not adequately train the staff when new processes were introduced into the dept.
bad,great companmy but not so great to work for depending on what department you are in.
bad,"Very stressful days.  Learned Word, Excel, Outlook.  Many classes offered.  Hardest part was working for a bipolar department supervisor.  "
bad,"Great HO systems, nice clients, enjoyed admin staff very much, head office helpful and efficient, both FAs professional always. Daily tasks and priorities were subject to change for Mngmt personal tasks which didn't allow for completion of said business obligations/ role. Mgmnt focused elsewhere and outside of business, manipulative so difficult to trust."
bad,"I receive thinly veiled threats implying that I should do whatever it takes to get the work done.  They know there is enough work to call for hiring extra associates but they see that we have been working over time for well over a year so the message received is that we have been doing it so we can continue doing it. Our personal lives are not a concern to them."
bad,"The culture is ""if you are not happy being underpaid, then leave""."
bad,"Was hired to bring on existing and new clients. I did this and was fired without adequate severance, while they kept the assets I brought on. Very little training and direction provided to acclimate to new or different software programs used."
bad,I felt that environment was cold and lacked depth.  Not my type of work environment.
bad,"I was trained from the ground up. During the on boarding process they tell you that there are multiple opportunities for advancement, that's a lie. Unless you know the right people you could be stuck in the same place for 5 years.  There is a culture of fear and they use threats to boost production. Work life balance? More like overtime. There is a feeling of shame for not doing overtime. My department is filled with people who don't want to be there and put zero effort into their work. And why should they? The slackers get paid the same as the high achievers. They like to use up the hard workers until they go crazy and quit. This job comes with basic benefits and PTO. There are a lot of activities if you can get unchained from your desk to attend them."
bad,they pay very low according to industry standards.  bonuses are terrible. management there is terrible. i would never work there again. not much room for advancement
bad,"For me the environment was very stressful and difficult to work in.  The Sr. VP was rude and talked down to women on a regular basis.  HR was of no assistance, in face it made thinks more difficult when reported."
bad,"Raymond James - Investment Banking and Securities Dealing."
bad,Not Welcoming of New Staff from the Outside. Unwilling to train new staff on the company procedures. They tend to close staff off in small groups and no one knows what the others are doing.
bad,Since it has been about 20 years since I worked at Raymond James I do not have an opinion.  As I remember it was a nice environment and nice people.  Nice employer.
bad,"Great company, Horrible department management. I have had numerous problems with office politics. It does not matter how hard you work, or how well you do your job but simply who you know and are in affiliation with."
bad,"Ridiculous amounts of on-call coverage"
bad,Its a good job/career for someone who is only looking for a paycheck.  No room for advancement unless you play the favorites games.  The benefits are good but the pay is very low compared to similar businesses in the area.
bad,"If you are offered to work for an advisor make sure to get to know that person well before you start your employment as they can turn out to be bullies and harass you all day long. Unfortunately, management and HR are unable to do anything as the advisors are considered to be ""independent"" and running their own business. They can only warn you and point out the problem and show empathy and how sorry they feel for you etc., but will do nothing to make the situation better or find a solution so that you can stay there for the long term (even though the contract clearly states that if you don't get along with the advisor you could work for a different one)."
bad,Horrible culture. Hard to advance................ Not a great experience overall. I would not recommend unless you are dedicated to the finance field.
bad,"Very stressful assignment, management did not have clear vision what they want to achieve; requirements has been changed very frequently, and thus a lot of work is useless"
bad,My current manager at Raymond James is the biggest micromanager I have ever come across. It will be a great day for when I no longer am her subordinate. She has single-handedly turned me off from the company entirely.
bad,Compensation does not match the job you are expected to do and you are under alot of stress at all times. Upper management does not care about how you feel.
bad,"How successful you are working at Raymond James depends upon which department you work in. If you look for a job in operations, run for your life! Staff are underappreciated and there are little to no advancement opportunities. Performance feedback is almost non-existent expect during performance review time. That being said, be sure you apply for a position in Towers 3 or 4 only. The corporate culture and values are excellent, as are the opportunities for career advancement."
bad,"they preach one thing & practice another.  micromanage you.  very gossipy, they don't trust you to do your job.  heavily surveilled for no apparent reason."
bad,"Good work hours, as per industry. "
bad,"The best part of working for Raymond James was the fact the location was in a good location not far from the interstate. The worst part of the job was the management that was in place. This job had the old boys club, where seniority matters more than ability.  I was hired to do the job of a project manager, and six months into the job I still wasn't given a project to manage. They want very highly skilled workers but don't want to give them the roles and responsibilities that come with those skills. They are also not a competitive paying company when compared to many in the area."
bad,"a typical day at work consist of receiving products from various manufactures. I would check for damages, count the products, write down how many of each kind and sizes, scan them into the system, tag them with our UPC, and box them up and stick a label on it. I learned how to handle product, how to work a register, and inventory. management wasn't involved when they needed to be, but when they were there commands contradicted each others which led to both managers arguing and no work getting down. management was very harsh as well, talking down to most of my co-workers an me. My co-workers were very happy and energetic, I've never had any problems with them. we could know out projects under an hour with no mistakes. i'd say the hardest part of the job would be correcting another persons mistakes which rarely happens but when it does its very time consuming. what i really enjoyed while doing my job is the satisfaction of completing various task at a fast pace."
bad,"innovative work place good environment"
bad,I don't have much to say about this company besides the fact that is was just a basic financial adviser job...........................................
bad,"start the day by getting your coffee then sit down and pull tickets from the queue. Started off easy unfortunately a massive wave of layoffs during an upper-management shift caused work to become massively backlogged. In an effort to ""not throw bodies"" at a problem that can only be solved by ""throwing bodies"" at it they undercut our efforts to do our job then blamed the problem on us when it wasn't working. They started to merge upper and lower departments together, specialized teams and without any training demanded we take on extra responsibility."
bad,"I didn't care for the management. Little communication with associates in the department. Although, he/she admitted they were not a good manger and didn't like to be a manager."
bad,"company could be better with the benefits, it takes a certain type of person to be able to work in this environment, due to the level of younger more sensitive mellinals."
bad,call on and answer calls from customers.  deal with internal company  issues.    enjoy working with good clients that are open to me.  dislike the duplicity of the company.
bad,"After 43 years in the financial services industry, I was approaching retirement (from this industry) so some of management's decisions toward  the brokers (FCs) were tiresome and unnecessary.  I felt uncomfortable about several policies."
bad,Raymond James is a great place to work.  They have excellent benefits.  Working remotely can at times be difficult with training and reaching out to management.
bad,Need more opportunities to advance or become Full Time employee
good,Good place to work and start your career. Easily accessible from Union station
good,"Not applicable, I'd rather keep this information to myself but due to the minimum requirement, I am inputting text inside of this box provided that requires 150"
good,"The description for a New Accounts Associate is totally inaccurate. You will go through hours of financial terminology and processes training to come out and actually only be a Technical Support Call Center Associate. Due to a failed corporate wide system overhaul, you will literally sit on a phone for 8+ hours a day trying to figure out computer error codes with understandably upset Financial Advisors and associates. The actual technical support department for the company was purposely not put in the loop of the new system upload and are not authorized to help with the incoming problems incurred with it. The tech support associates can receive discipline for attempts to correct the errors received. High turn over rates, even with seasoned/seniors associates that are stressed out. Mandatory overtime and a shift that is micromanaged in 15 minute increments. You do not actually receive all of advertised vacation time. There is also a 90 day freeze on any promotion received -meaning you cannot leave New Accounts for 90 days if you receive a promotion, which in turn is causing other departments to not hire from New Accounts, because if they need an associate in two weeks, they cannot afford to wait 90 days for the needed employee."
good,Some parts of the organization are great and managed well. Unfortunately I was not in one of those areas. It is time to get a fresh start and leave the politics behind.
good,"Involved in cutting edge technology, Enjoyed interaction with coworkers."
good,Hired someone to restructure and it backfired. Terrible reputation.  Poor management.  Lost good people because of it.  Caught in many lies during recruiting.
good,"Lies, drama, and underhandedness will be the greatest compensation given(under certain ""leadership"" and departments). Absolutely not worth the stress."
good,I worked for Raymond James and was the worse mistake I ever made. My experience was not what I expected and unfortunately it was a little to late by the time I realized it. I wish I would have never joint them.
good,"Everything works very slowly in the group I was with.  Performance management was a concept they couldn't embrace.  Some great managers, some very poor managers.  The lack of diversity was a definite eye opener."
good,The hardest part of the job was coping with differences between products and support promised and that provided by management and supervisor.
good,"The office I worked in was an independent office of Raymond James Financial Services, and the home office supervisors were in Florida.  This made communications very difficult.  Further, the day I was hired, my co-worker who was to provide guidance to me, left and moved out of state.  Accordingly, I did not have any support locally. This created a very challenging work environment."
good,I was an admin for RJFS and did the bookkeeping for the owner.  I expressly stated I had no experience bookkeeping and had no interest in bookkeeping.  After I started I was told I would be required to learn and would no have to do payroll as well as private bookkeeping for the owner.  The administrative job was good but the other things that I didn't agree to I didn't feel comfortable with.
good,Raymond James uses all of its resources to grow the private client business through the acquisition of new advisors but they do not use many resources for the growth of the company operations. It's a house of cards.
good,"Lack of consistency in management, very difficult to post within for another job, pay scale is low, systems are outdated, IT department is understaffed and overworked, HR department takes weeks (on occasion, months) to reply to internal job applicants, insurance coverage for healthcare only offers HSA plans."
good,Able to work from home when needed. Need to encourage more collaborative projects/efforts between different work locations to promote a single team environment.
good,"Great local name recognition and excellent equity research department. Some areas were geared to assist branch offices, while others weren't as operational as they could have been."
good,Wealth Management. Your Raymond James advisor will help you prepare for life’s major financial milestones and every moment in between. Explore Wealth Management.
good,"Working in the local branch can be demanding but not difficult. Great co-workers. However, given that it's a branch, there is no opportunity for advancement or to try other positions as there is in the corporate office in St. Pete.  Either you are an SA or an FA. That's it."
good,Very corporate and bureaucratic.  Happy veneer but just what you would expect.
good,"My co-workers were great for the most part. Great teamwork. Well ran company by upper management . Middle management is top heavy , Learned a lot , from beginning IT to experienced SME. Typical day was come in early and work all day and some days into the night.Most enjoyable was helping the company grow over the years . Also when tasks/goals were completed and the feeling of accomplishment,"
good,Good ole boy network and compensation is low. Advancement is slow and training is lacking in the IT field. Benefits are expensive for this size company and unless you are in a production department funds and salary is limited.
good,"Good Work-Life Balance"
good,Your success and job depend on the financial advisor you work for. If they do not succeed your position is in jeopardy.  Have your skill set in place and network. Good company but you dont really work for the company it the financial advisor.
good,Learn new things everyday. Enjoyed the challenges presented on a daily basis. Personal satisfaction for a job well done in solving simple to complex issues.
good,"Pros:"
good,Departments are under-resourced generally. The firm has top-down management with a small number executives making decisions. Many staff members are long-term employees.
good,"Overall the company was great to work for, but the management in the area I was in didn't recognize the amount of effort for many tasks which led to a wrong set of expectations.  This led to a lot of turnover in the group and some resentment with the department.  I think if you end up in the right area this is a good company to build a career."
good,"Above average firm with decent advancement potential but not in Memphis. Good entry level opportunities and culture is good."
good,"Good starting position for someone who knows very little about the finance business. There is room to grow but not in the independent firms only in the corporate side of Raymond James. Client Service Associate position duties vary depending on the firm you work for. Daily tasks include money movements, paperwork, followup calls and responding to emails and calls."
good,"It did not pay to be within operations or any sort of supporting role. The advisors and anyone within the profitability cost centers came first and foremost. Which, is to be expected to an extent but it was to the point where only employees at a certain salary grade could sit for certifications needed for advancement."
good,Both Operation Managers at the Downtown Chicago Location weren't the highest quality. Micromanagement to maintain their own jobs was just a small fraction of why the work environment was/is miserable for most Client Service Associates that work there. If upper management spent more time recognizing what Operations is doing they'd see major flaws in the personalities in who they have chosen to hire. I could not have been more miserable in that environment. Sad because the company is a great company.
good,"attend meeting, answer employee question, via email or phone. Manage open enrollment, new hire orientation.  Health Fairs, coordinate three Health Fairs once a year for three different locations."
good,Operations group is working on systems that are outdated with little or no industry experience. Too many in management that do not have industry experience. Good culture for FA's
good,No longer a fun culture. Environment is fearful and directionless. Have seen a lot of good people leave.
good,A typical day is busy. I have learned quite a bit about the financial world from this company. Management is good. Co-workers are great people and enjoy working together and for the company. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"Says it all.  You could get voted off the island.  Or laid off."
good,Raymond James is a great place to work. The employees here are awesome and make coming to work a blast! They provide great opportunities for compensation and contributions to a 401k are also great here!
good,Managers have very little respect for seasoned associates. The Account Transfers department is being managed like a call center with little regard to providing the utmost protected treatment of the clients.
good,"I was only there for a few months on a contract. Great compensation, excellent technology and amenities. The management was poor and lacked communication skills and leadership."
good,"Fast paced, lots of OT, lots of training. Workplace culture is open door policy with managers. Learned a lot about the financial industry while currently working here."
good,"Operations division is run almost as a separate company which does not reflect the spirit and culture that Senior Management and the CEO espouses. "
good,"Co-workers are nice to work with. Not enough work to keep busy, some days. The hardest part of the job was being self taught The most enjoyable part of the job is corresponding with the clients. Management is pleasant to work for but cannot confront employees if there is a problem."
good,"Obtention du FINRA série 7"
good,The benefits are good but there is not much room for advancement.  RJ is still a good ol boys shop.
good,Great benefits but not much room for advancement in my particular department.
good,"A typical day working at Raymond James in Account Transfer department is processing clients transfer request and assisting the Financial Advisor with documents requirements and statuses. I enjoyed with my co-workers, we work as a team always helping each other out when needed."
good,Raymond James is odd.  The the culture and work philosophy are difficult to adapt to and even harder to find open positions in career paths of interest.
good,Call center setting. Company is big on micro managing. More concerned about how much is produced as oppose to the quality of the product.
good,"Raymond James is a great company to work for, if you choose the right department.  Contract work is precarious, direct hire is better.  I don't recommend using a recruiter or agency, apply directly, pay is much better for direct hires."
good,Micro management by new supervisor that was never trained on how to supervise their past co workers. No upper management support. Constantly being told your not measuring up
good,Working at Raymond James has been provided me with a very good work experience. I have gain a lot of knowledge based on the financial sector as well as planning for a financial future.
good,Over see Adviser paperwork. all clerical duties. Account payable and account receivable. Worked to bring in new clients. Assisted current clients needs.
good,"Worked on supporting, maintaining and securing RJF financial systems. Make sure there is no performance issues on production system, backup completed successfully,"
good,Opting out of this review of a previous employer. I will not make any direct comments regarding any previous employment or employer regardless of assurances of anonymity.
good,Short term consultant with no evaluation foe the company. The management was hands off.  There was little guidance. The work was not allocated properly.
good,"I worked for an independent office at Raymond James in Richardson, Texas     Enjoyed the work environment very much and only left because we closed the branch."
good,Fast paced environment with substantial day-to day pressure that were largely influenced by external factors.  Decisions were made based on best available information.  Feedback was sparodic.
good,I work in a small office of 3 people and that's including me.    I have known my Manager from working with him back in the 80's.  We have a great relationship and I do enjoy my job.
good,"Raymond James is a good work place, It is a fast pace environment with good training and oppurtunities for advancement and is also community friendly."
good,I learned about the dealings of an independent financial services company that has a large presence in the Canadian market.
good,"Clientele were terrific.Different requirements for staff members."
good,"The job was good, buisy sometimes but a lot of downtime. Management  let me go out of no where with ought proper or at least I'd say ethical manner. Just a call from someone I had never met. Besides that the job was OK. Pay was not good although."
good,"A lot has changed in the last 10 years at Raymond James. Was a great company to work for in the past, since then a lot of internal changes have occurred along with the company's focus and direction. Since these changes, it has been a very difficult company to progress in. An example would be the lack of support for internal transitions or promotions due to Raymond James outsourcing all of the positions to India."
good,"i was there long enough to learn what to do and how to run the front desk, then the lady whose job it was came back from maternity leave."
good,Firm known for its fixed income strength with a strong southeastern regional focus.  It is a great place to launch a career and has a solid work life balance.
good,My experience with Raymond James was one filled with challenges and great pride. The firm is very interested in their personnel using all of their skills and thinking outside the box.
good,"This role included associate planner client management responsibilities, as well as sales assistant duties including trading, wholesale meeting, extensive variable annuity prep work and follow up as well as research. "
good,Independent firm that is constantly trying to improve their systems and services.
good,"Review and prepare daily equity and mutual fund research.                                                                "
good,Was interesting company due to the changes in the economy. I learned a lot about financial planning and the necessity of such services
good,"Administrative duties, Sales Assistant duties for three Financial Advisors including the Branch Manager. Ordering supplies for branch, communicating with back office with any questions or training needs."
good,"When I first started with the company in 2004, I thought it was the best company I had worked for up to that point but over time, things changed and not for the better and my outlook about the company began to change."
good,"Company as a whole is a great place to work, but there is a lot of favoritism within management and no place for advancement."
good,"Departments put emphasis on team-building and camaraderie.  Contractor positions are less integrated with rest of firm due to temporary nature, however full-time employees are encouraged to continue their licenses and certifications in various work-relevant areas on the company's dime (so long as employee can show that the certification in some shape contributes to the company).  Beautiful prized art-work collection located in all four towers of company lend to a more cheerful and interesting work atmosphere.  Art collection located in offices is largest private collection in the United States and includes Warhol, and other greats."
good,I get along well with most of my coworkers and management.  I like coming to work in the morning and having things to do right from the get-go.  I am able to complete most tasks with little oversight and I enjoy helping clients achieve their goals when it comes to their accounts.
good,"After working in much larger financial services companies, I found that Raymond James was several years behind in product development."
good,Its  a great opportunity to gain knowledge of financial investments and retirement.  They have good benefits and pension.  Work life balance is very reasonable.
good,"Raymond James is a fine place to work although it's a bit sleepy. The industry itself is facing a lot of challenges so from this perspective, I could not recommend working here, but if you are dead set on it, Raymond James is good."
good,Great health and retirement benefits.  Management is caring and easy to work with.  Overall a fun atmosphere to work in.  Beautiful art work throughout the buildings.
good,"A typical day starts with preparing all the systems that will be used during your work day. "
good,"Clearly defined job roles, solid technical team, dynamic environment and beautiful corporate campus. Good onsite cafe. Compensation was way below market"
good,"RJF experience varies between office and industry groups. Good, hands-on experience, but culture and deal-flow are seriously lacking."
good,"It was a nice place to work at first, but now the culture is changing. If you are not a male, a part of a click, or someone's crony, your opportunities for advancement are very slim. In addition, the pay is very low for other firms in this industry and this size."
good,"A pleasant work atmosphere"
good,There is a great opportunity to increase your knowledge and for self development.  Each department within the company has its own flavor and personality. Depending on the department my typical work day has varied.  Due to the community oriented nature of the company the co-workers over all are very inclusive and friendly. There are many net working groups within the company that have been formed based on a varying assortment of common interests that further encourage interaction and encourage tolerance through exposure to diversity.  Overall working for this company has many great benefits. I would say the hardest part of the job is advancement due to the fact that there is so much longevity when it comes to the average career in this company.
good,"Staff is okay. Management is okay. Work is repetitive with lots of phone calls, and paperwork."
good,It is near impossible to focus on your incoming calls when every other associate is either bickering or screaming in laughter all day.  There are no rules for personal conduct as long as it's about work.  Management and HR were worthless in setting a minimum tone for how a call center culture should be.
good,Work was great.  I had co-workers that supported like a family.
good,"This is a great place to work and learn the industry.  Very stable company to work for.  Could use better health insurance, but that is my only gripe."
good,This review is silly its been more than a decade since working for the company.  Who know what kind of changes have occurred.  it used to be a very good company to work for.
good,"I have worked in financial business for over 16 years and sales related jobs for over 25 years. I work very well with people at all  levels."
good,My experience with Raymond James was a good one. I enjoyed my boss and my coworkers very much and I loved interacting with clients. I was able to manage schoolwork and work easily and there were lots of opportunities to advance.
good,"Great place to work with many great benefits, and the company culture is very impressive considering the size of the firm. It's a very likeable company."
good,"Raymond James was a good place to work, the company itself was very customer oriented and made sure that the customer was always happy with their interaction with the Financial Advisor."
good,Raymond James has a good work life balance. Technology wise they are at par with other firms. But growth here is very limited and compensation is not good enough.
good,"I was an independent contractor. You need to  make money, all they care about. "
good,"Raymond James is a good company to start at, however, management is not the best. Culture is down in IT and advancement is very weak."
good,"The Home Office of Raymond James is an excellent place to work in terms of the facility.  There are cafeterias, a fitness room and other services provided onsite for staff members.  The pay and benefits are substandard, however, as they are not competitive with other financial services organizations in the area.  Though they hold a good reputation within the industry as a whole and take care of their clients, they do not appear to be as concerned with taking care of the employees who provide service to those clients and to their financial advisors."
good,RJL runs lean as you would expect of a financial inst. and this is apparent in some areas.  The location is downtown Vancouver an easy commute.  There is a lot of people who have been for there for their entire career. The management team is good and strong and on top of business. Conservative and very old school in most departments.
good,"Friendly, Fast pace, enjoyable and rewarding work."
good,Raymond James is a great place to work. It is the largest broker/dealer in the South and provides an opportunity to learn about Wall street products without living in New York.
good,"There is a huge discrepancy between what admin does and what upper mgmt thinks admin does which results in lack of support and inadequate pay.  What I was told by HR when I applied does not match the job.  Unless you're just looking for a steady paycheck as support staff I would not suggest an admin role because all you will do is make lateral moves around the dept, with no advancing unless you've put 15years in."
good,Management was difficult and greedy. The atmosphere was frequently tense. Staff genuinely cared about one another. Management used to take all department gifts home during the holidays for own use.
good,"I found they kept changing the grind, making it harder to hit commission targets. It also had a research department that was more often wrong on their projections than they were correct."
good,"Management is ok, working with FA's are a challlenge. But everyone is treated equally and bonuses are yearly."
good,"While performing administrative and receptionist duties, I also learned about financial advising practices, as well as compliance practices in this particular field. I was in charge of organizing and managing client data files and well as corresponding with clients, organizing events and acting as a book keeper for my employers. Unfortunately, this was a part time job and my employers were unable to provide as many hours as I needed to maintain a quality of life, also I had to relocate to Pennsylvania from North Carolina for personal reasons, so I was unable to continue at this business."
good,"Advancement is made available, but contacts are essential. There is a strong culture that focuses on putting the client first. Beautiful campus and multiple company cafes."
good,"good place to work"
good,"Raymond James has a truly unique culture and offers several opportunities to network with people across the firm. Some departments offer more opportunity for growth than other departments, but that doesn't mean you can't look outside of your area for new positions."
good,"great place to work, friendly co-workers very supportive and knowledgeable manager. flexible work schedule, only downfall is this a temp position and the pay was very low compared to other associates who were employees of RJ and not staffing agency placed at RJ."
good,"I did administrative and marketing work"
good,I found that during my time at Morgan Stanley there was a very helpful team atmosphere. I really enjoyed the goal driven people and rewarding work. Also a great working Environment.
good,The employees were very friendly and collaborative. I was trained very effectively and entrusted with fair amount of responsibility. I would recommend working here.
good,"With the help of the Branch Manager, I surprised financial advisors and their sales assistants to make sure everyone was compliant according to RJ and FINRA regulations."
good,"Beautiful campus in St. Petersburg, FL. Provided many opportunities for advancement including opportunities for continuing education and networking. Great benefits."
good,"One of the best firms to work for as it seems very relaxed but yet professional. I have been able to grow pretty well in the company in the my first 7 years,"
good,"Palmetto Trust and Investment Group is no longer an entity. While working there, Raymond James was our broker dealer. They are an excellent company that provided stellar back office support."
good,"During my unpaid work experience at Raymond James Ltd., I learned many different office skills such as keyboarding, making professional phone calls and filing very important paperwork"
good,Great culture and has career growth. The company is realy committed to the feedback of the associates as it pertains to training and the work environment. In the last few years they have begun to improve their Operations platform.
good,"Although I physically worked in MI, I collaborated with several home office departments which opened plenty of opportunities to advance your career."
good,It has been a pleasure to be employed with Raymond James. Their conservative investing programs works will with many clients. They treat their employees with respect and offer opportunities for development.
good,"I worked as a sales assistant for three advisors sometimes four when necessary.  This ranged from report, phone calls and events.  Each advisor was very different in their needs so it was necessary to be able to blend between project and their needs."
good,I have an extensive background in the investment and wealth management industry with a primary focus on customer service and relationship building.  I am looking for a professional work environment with possibility for growth and advancement.  I work well with others and appreciate a challenge.  My favorite part of the job is working with the clients.  The hardest part of the job is the paperwork.
good,"I haven't worked for Raymond James in over ten years so I am sure how the culture is now. However, it was a good company to work for but didn't pay well."
good,"Enjoyed interacting with clients daily, and creating a Rebranding process for a financial advisor within the company."
good,My review of Raymond James as a company is generally positive.  I have at my disposal a number of research tools available to me.
good,Became familiar with the duties of a financial advisor by becoming exposed to market strategies and rules and regulations of a financial broker.
good,"•	Worked closely with Financial Advisors to move and reassign funds to proper accounts for trading"
good,"The company overall has great retirement benefits and values. Management is seriously lacking; micro-management is rampant. You're expected to be here all the time, leaving early for doctor appointments are frowned upon and held against you. It is a very political environment where it's all about who you know. "
good,"This company is located in St. pete, florida. It is compirsed of 2 buildings."
good,The hardest part of the job is the 100% commission structure
good,I was given the opportunity to learn about the financial industry which helped me in my personal life as well.
good,I have found RJFS to be a very prudently managed investment services firm. The company's conservative business approach has served it well and allowed it to maintain and build a solid reputation with the retail investing public.
good,I worked at Raymond James briefly as an intern and found that they are very supportive of young talent and provide lots of opportunities. The work is challenging and the environment can be stressful at times but overall it is a great place to work.
good,Nice place to work. Smooth interview process. Great co workers. Good work life balance. Could use more opportunity for advancement. Very difficult not to get stuck in the same job for years.
good,Nice place to work.  Really Nice Manager.   Nice culture.  You can go as far as you want.  Raymond James is a good place to work.  Again the offices are independent so depends on who is your manager. Manager on Main Street in Riverhead is wonderful.  I would recommend working with him to anyone.  Just a real nice guy.
good,"Work-life balance varied from day to day, depending strongly on the manager. Raymond James is a branch, however, so the environment would differ greatly from one location to another."
good,"Family oriented, no push to sell certain products, support from management. Have issued with back office support especially over the last year with their acquisitions."
good,I love my job! Raymond James has a great support network where information is shared freely. Our back office support is always friendly and so helpful.
good,"Training and back office resources are top of the line and they help you every step of the way.  If you are pursuing a a job as a financial advisor, there is no better choice than Raymond James."
good,I enjoyed my time at Raymond James. It was where I grew up personally and professionally. I would go back to work there any time.
good,"Spend all day answering phones, assisting fellow employees with any Technology issue remotely. We take pride in First Call Resolution and we all work hard."
good,"This is a fee-based wealth advisory office affiliated with Raymond James Financial Services. It is an 8 man, family run business. Great place to work if you need to balance work and family. The clients were the most enjoyable part of the job along with co-workers who really care about their clients."
good,Raymond James as a company is great. They have excellent services and products available to their customers.
good,"A decent company to work for if you plan to become an Advisor. However, there is very little value or quantifiable appreciation offered to support staff."
good,Decent opportunities for advancement until you hit a point where your supervisor is comfortable and will never retire. Environment is challenging and productive.
good,Raymond James Financial Culture is one where they care about the employee's personal and professional health. There are education options available in a wide variety of competencies to everyone if you chose to take it. There are also many company sponsored functions to get out of the office and into the real world.
good,"i enjoy being able to work from home, people are nice decent pay. Benefits end up not being good. For the most part it is a cool laid back place to work"
good,Good Group of people and job security but no real advanacements. Growth opportunities are almost non existent and pay is stagnant. Would not recommend the company unless some one desperately needed a job.
good,"Company is great, but was not placed on a team that took advantage of my skillset. Emphasis was on learning sales tactics as opposed to product information."
good,"No day or client is the same, but everyone was greeted with a smile. Some days I had to prepare client paperwork while other days I was following up to make sure our back office was approving them. Answering client calls and greeting in person was  mostly an everyday occasion. I met with my advisors at least daily first thing in the morning to go over our calendars. Communication was key amongst all the advisors I assisted, and if something was off, we would discuss. It"
good,"Really enjoyed my coworkers at and outside of work, but the management is young and can often be unprofessional. Overtime is required basically all year long and they are very strict on time reporting. They preach more than they practice and often implement rules that don't seem to make much sense a lot of times. What you get is often not what you were led to expect (it is a call center no matter what they tell you). Also the supervisors don't even try to hide the fact that they have favorites whom they reward in material ways for sucking up to them and being their ""friends."""
good,Raymond James gave me opportunities that provided me with the experiences I needed for advancement.  I worked with great people and my management staff was great.
good,"Contact motivated business. Emphasis always on new clients and selling high commissioned financial products. Cold calling and seminars tools used to acquire new business,"
good,Enjoyed the work environment.  Non-experienced management.  I would work for this company again.  Great group of advisors.
good,Enjoyed working there. Learned a lot about stocks and bonds. I worked with one of the senior Vice President of the company and really learned a lot and was blue to understand and retain the information.
good,"Raymond James is really set up, in everything they say and do, for the independent or hybrid advisor. If your an employee advisor then don't expect any of the corporate culture or autonomy they speak of on the corporate level.  Their technology stack is outdated, but their research is a valuable resource."
good,"Old school view on many things, that don't always translate to modern times. Decent work life balance, good culture. Limited benefits and advancement."
good,Working in an open office space in a normal help desk atmosphere. Most employees are really friendly and play an active role in campus activities. The hardest part about the job is being tethered to your phone for eight hours a day.
good,"- A typical day included filing reports, answering phone calls, scheduling meetings, etc."
good,"The job was a great experience. On a typical day there would be a steady workflow,and other times we may be inundated with backlog. In which I actually liked that aspect, because it kept me busy. Management made themselves available when needed. My  coworkers there were a magnificent part of the job, always willing to assist when necessary. The hardest part of the job would have been, when we were real busy I'd have to be fixated to the computer for hours on in. Overall I have to say I really enjoyed the atmosphere there, most everyone there was very pleasant."
good,"Great overtime available. was able to do lots of overtime, and they also allowed you to make up hours if you needed to. Wanted to become a permanent worker."
good,It is a very good and well respected company within the Financial Services Industry. Good place to start a career in the securities industry.
good,This is a company where standard processes and proceedures are lacking however you do have the ability to define your role and flexibility to achieve.
good,"as an intern I had flexible work hours.  I didn't just sit at a computer and make spread sheets; I made cold calls, I sat in on meetings with the financial advisor's clients.  Organized a 401K seminar throughout the summer to be presented at the end of the summer by financial advisor."
good,"Responsibilities included coordinating performing and overseeing all the information technology audits within the company. Audits included reviews of the business and operational issues that surrounded the technologies in use. Other responsibilities included: training and supervising/managing the IT audit staff, risk evaluations, audit program development, preparing and completing the annual IT audit plan, preparing reports for the Audit Committee, budget development, recruiting, performing reviews of the corporate business continuity and disaster recovery plans and assisting the firm's external auditors. In addition, developed and maintained cooperative working relationships and as a result participated in various task forces and steering committees throughout the company."
good,Company provides excellent support on a day-to-day basis when needed.  The hardest and most restrictive part of the job is the compliance requirements which makes communications and support of our clients challenging.  The utmost challenging part and focus of the job is prospecting. Raymond James provides limited external marketing support.
good,"The Service First culture at Raymond James calls for employees to focus on customer service at all levels of the Firm, and includes those employees who are not client-facing."
good,"Fun office to work for. Stayed busy most of the time. "
good,"The compnay has shifted to heavily recruiting from outside to accomodate the rapid growth and back office changes. The new leadership appears to be shifting the internal culture, in good ways. Unfortunately, new leaders often fail to recognize the value of longer term associates."
good,"Rapid changes and fast paced."
good,I was very good at my job and enjoyed what I was doing most of the time.  There were challenges just about every day but I worked through them successfully.
good,Very involved with the community. Always giving back which is important to me. Great café onsite and parking garages with covered walkways to the buildings. Covered walkways between buildings was very nice.
good,I've learned a lot from my team/people here at Raymond James Ltd. They are very helpful and supportive. The work atmosphere is extremely friendly and fun.
good,great company but salaries were not very competitive. overall the work life balance was one of the best i have seen. If they offered more money I would go back in a heartbeat
good,The culture is great and will make you feel at home.  The training and support received is also very good.  The compensation is low compared to like firms.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. The project focused on executing different credit risk exposure reporting according to the Dodd-Frank Act & Basel III regulation.
good,"I work in the cage of a brokerage firm office.  The cage is the center of the office.  This is where I had to place trade orders, open new accounts, go thru the daily mail, made the daily deposit to the bank, make sure that all the trades were logged in the trade.  I also help the Branch Operations Manager with anything that she need done."
good,"Ramond James was a consulting firm used by USAA for a contract to hire position I took.  USAA was a good place to work and the people were very nice but unfortunately circumstances at the time, changes in management, lead to my contract being extended but ultimately not being able to bring me on permanently.  While I was there I helped with management of IBM and Solaris Unix servers including creating a tool to do inventory on their large server farms."
good,"One of the things I learned in this position is just how much I don't know about the IT world.  Fortunately it is an environment in which everyone shares their knowledge and is willing to offer assistance or support whenever needed.  One of the things I enjoyed most about this position was the freedom to get things done in a way that worked best for me.  I am fortunate in that the team I work with is a close group, each with different specialties and personalities.  When decisions are being made or procedures put in place, the group discussions include every perspective.  The hardest part for me right now would be management's shift towards micro-managing employees."
good,"No set day. I had to be flexible as to what was needed on the day."
good,"RJ is a hidden gem in the financial services industry.  Most areas are focused more on providing the best service to their clients and advisors rather than numbers.  This fosters a culture where most work well with others rather than competition.  Unfortunately, an influx of ""outsiders"" at middle and upper management has changed it a bit. I see this trend continuing."
good,My days consisted of balancing brokerage accounts. I enjoyed this because I received a sense of a job well done at the end of each day. I was allowed to hone my skills of problem solving and effective communication while completing my daily job duties. The management team was amazing. I would work for either of them at the drop of a hat. My co-workers were pleasant to be around and had a passion much like my own for the job we performed. The hardest part of this job was making time to attend the Raymond James University courses that were offered to employees to encourage continued learning. The most enjoyable part of this job was being appreciated and recognized by management.
good,"Operational responsibility for St.Petersburg Quality Assurance Corrections Team which supported all of Retirement Plan Services.  Supervised, motivated, and evaluated performance for ten QA Associates.  Hired, trained, and coached direct reports.  Maintained frequent and open communication with branches, Financial Advisors and Sales Assistants in an effort to answer questions or concerns regarding any aspects of Retirement Plan Services."
good,"Great community involvement and, in the past, a nice work/life balance with a work hard then celebrate (work, work, play) philosophy.  Was voted as one of the best IT places in Tampa Bay to work for years.  The company has grown a lot in recent years and there is currently a cultural shift taking place with new management brought in to modernize IT.  As the culture changes, so are many of the old established traditions. Still a great company, but currently unsettled in IT as decisions are made and direction still being defined.   "
good,"Very stable company, a good place to learn and grow professionally with many different financial and technology paths to be pursued."
good,"Met some very nice people, usually fun and interesting atmosphere"
good,"Working for Raymond James was a great challenge although initially it may not have felt that way. I was only working on Payroll, but it was a national payroll with components and processes I hadn't been exposed to before. This gave me the opportunity to learn and increase my understanding of different state and local taxes as well as garnishments and other deductions. I also had the chance to learn more about the investment world and see how different products were used as well as the chance to work with people all over the country since I supported branches from California to New York. The team I worked with was excellent and was as varied as the investment products the company offered. This keep even a slow day interesting most of the time. Although opportunity to advance was limited I was always encouraged to do more and when given the chance usually I was able to surprise other departments with great work despite not having the same level of training and education."
good,Management is lacking.  Workplace culture is strong overall.  Internal hiring practices are a little shady.  You can wait weeks to hear back from HR about anything or they call and tell you they went with the runner up from the last opening.
good,"Okay culture, not as great as the preach, and good work/life balance. Compensation is reasonable but benefits are weak when compared with competitors within the same industry."
good,Culture and employees were great to work with. Management was very informational about the direction they were taking with the department and company.
good,"I very much enjoyed my position at Raymond James; however my executive chose to move me to a hard-to-fill position that I was not interested in, in order to replace me with an assistant she could share with another department."
good,Great place to work and grow.    Departments work together to complete projects and assignments.   Friendly atmosphere. Great team building exercises.
good,"Unfortunately the former ""job for life"" culture at RJ has changed.  Many people were let go in one day just after RJ merged with a bank."
good,Great growth opportunities and wonderful people to work with.  The hiring process was organized.  High workplace culture and diversity is very important to Raymond James and me.  The hardest part was making the decision to leave employment.
good,I worked for Raymond James right after college. The overall experience was a good one. The training they provide was good. Managers were very good. The only drawback was the low pay and sub-par benefits.
good,"no major complaints, been working for the company for quite some time.  promotes from within. work, work play. great benefits package. 401k match. ......"
good,"Raymond James was a fine place to work.  My job required very little supervision as I was a Senior Trader with approximately 25 years in the business as a Trader.  They did however keep a very close eye on the amount of capital used, something that I never had to deal with in my 18 1/2 years at National Bank.  Over all, it was a good "
good,"Processing life insurance applications and serving as a case manager throughout the underwriting and placement process."
good,"This company I was just an Intern for 9 months, but the 9 months I was there it was great.  The people are friendly, the job was challenging, and the benefits were very good, if you were an actual employee and not an intern."
good,"In my opinion in terms of a regular work day for me was good.  I enjoyed going to work because I loved what I did.  However, I felt that my management didn't encourage or engage me about exploring new challenging tasks.  The hardest part about my previous job with Raymond James is that I never knew what to expect everyday with regards to my daily tasks as most of which were being delegated to another department or someone else. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-associates whom in most cases became very good friends outside of the company."
good,"Raymond James is a great place to do an Analyst program. Culture is very collegial but still fosters an environment of hard work and accountability. During my time at RJ I've been exposed to several capital market transactions as well as sell-side and buy-side deals. It's been nice to get a mixed bag experience and learn various stages of the deal process from origination, structuring and all the way to financing the transaction. A typical day at the office starts at 8:45am. I usually spend an hour or so getting up to speed on emails, news and work from the previous night. By 11:00am, I've usually had a meeting or 2 with deal teams to go over punch lists for the day and expectations for deliverables. Lunch is usually at my desk if I'm really busy. A lot of the afternoon is spent turning work with senior MDs before they leave for the night. Once final marching orders have been given, generally spend the rest of the day (6pm-12am) refining pitchbooks or working on a client request. Pretty rare to stay past 2am at my office."
good,RJ afforded you education and training from their in-house school.  Very interesting to learn about the stock exchange.
good,"Review all previous day transactions to make sure they were completed."
good,Working for several brokers was a great learning experience.  Everyday was something new.  It was nice to work in an environment were every one got along
good,This is a good company to work for.  There is room for growth professionally and educationally.
good,Hard place to advance and many jobs are being outsourced. The job quality all depends on which department you work for.
good,"A typical day at work involved a high volume of accounting or treasury transactions, the most enjoyable part of the job was the monthly accounting meetings, which allowed the associates to have input at times add to the discussions and become aware of other RJA location procedures and accomplishments."
good,Nicely paced work environment that fosters collaborative teamwork.
good,"i love the company, known for not paying as much."
good,"Pros: It is nice to work for a company who is always available a phone call away if we ever need support. And when we call, we get the home office in St. Pete FL, not another country. Work environment is great, nice hours. Respectable company to work for. Con: Low compensation for our level of education and work."
good,"I liked my job. My boss was wonderful. Small office, few coworkers-very little office politics."
good,"I would recommend anyone to work for this company. Good management, at least it used to be."
good,Raymond James is a progressive culture and good place to work.  I enjoyed it.  There are many financial positions available in the company and they offer mentor ship too.
good,Management is very in tune with life needs of their associates to help promote a healthy work/life balance.  Plenty of opportunities to advance within the organization.
good,"RJ has a great culture and solid benefits but the pay is subpar.  The RJ campus is enjoyable with lots of artwork.  The campus is also located in a nice central location between Downtown Tampa, Downtown St. Pete, and Clearwater"
good,"With 15 years experience, I can comfortably say that I work with, and for, people with integrity. The atmosphere and ethics are conservative, however this has stood the company in good stead compared to competitors in times of fluctuating market conditions."
good,"Great company to work for.  I worked for them a long time ago so I am not including salary information but at the time they were very competitive."
good,"Overall, the company is very good to work for.  I worked there for 23 years as an employee and 2 years as a contractor, so I really did enjoy working there."
good,Raymond James is a big company and has all the benefits a big company does. It is a great place to learn in your given field. Some colleagues would mention that management sometimes is stubborn but besides that everything was great.
good,The best part of the job is meeting new people and helping them with their accounts. I also answere the phones and set appointments for new clients to meet for my FA.
good,One of the best firms for financial advisors to work for. Company offers both traditional employee option as well independant contractor. Later better for high producers
good,Totally market driven environment where you are required to make timely decisions in relatively short order.  A bad decision could result in significant losses for the firm and clients.
good,Complete freedom. Choose your clients. Make your own office schedule. Plenty of family time. Control work load. Plenty of time to get involved with the community.
good,"same as what I said above.  not sure why it is asking for another review of the same company "
good,"good company to work for  "
good,A typical day at Raymond James can be fast paste but very relaxing as well.  While working here I have learned about the stocks and bonds and how investing can be helpful.

I have learned a great deal about credit analysis, and I have begun to develop a greater knowledge of commercial real estate and the opportunities and risks associated with real estate investments and lending.

good,I am currently interning at Raymond James. The advisor I am interning under is helpful because he has years of experience on Wall Street. I have learned a lot since I began interning there.
good,At Raymond James there is a different type of management that goes on based on what department you work for. In my original position my supervisor was we’ll knowledgeable about all aspect of the jobs that he was over. The second department that i worked for.

good,"- Enjoyed working here"
good,My internship here was a good overall experience. I learned a lot about financial services industry. I was able to work under financial advisors.
good,"Raymond James is a great place to work. I started here in an entry-level position about a year and a half ago, and I have enjoyed every second of it. It would be nice if there were more opportunities for continued growth within the company, but it is tough to obtain positions and advance within the company because many such positions are rarely vacant. I suppose this is a good thing because it means plenty of people are satisfied with their jobs and aren't trying to leave the company. But it's also a bad thing if you are someone like me that is trying to work your way up within the organization. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword, I guess. The company also has great perks. They've paid for a good deal of my graduate school and have also paid for me to study for and obtain my Series 7 license even though it wasn't required for my position."
good,Being able to enter the investment industry was something I had long desired and Raymond James made that possible. The management from corporate office to our local office were very supportive and assisted with all aspects of the job.

good,Raymond James Financial is a premier financial institutional in the SouthEast United states. Raymond James offers good benefits and is focused on business objectives.
good,"the department in which I work is understaffed and there is too much work to be done for one day.  Management does not care, all they care about is not having errors.  I was not trained properly and thrown into my position.  When I ask to move to a new department, they said they could not give me a recommendation."
good,"High powered, fast paced, working environment."
good,Great benefits and co-workers. Compensation package is good too. I would go back if I found the right position. Very good company.

good,My work day begins at 8:00 AM and ends at 5:00 PM Monday-Friday.
good,"Answer phones, set up appointments and foolow-up on tasks received from Financial advisor.  Best part of job is the clients.  HOme office is very easy to work with and diligently work to resolve your issues"
good,"Very detailed work. RJA was a good place - Management could use some improvement, but overall a good place. Mentoring and network opportunities... need more levels of advancement."
good,I liked working for Raymond James and would like to get back and work for them again as a brokers assistant.  I think now if someone who has the back ground should start at 15/hr plus bonus and medical 401 K life Insurance and what the. Big companies give there employees.
good,"Its a very pleasant place to work but internal pay advancement is throttled. There seems to be little interest in promoting worthy candidates from within, preferring to hire outsiders to fill key spots as a way to quickly enhance their collective intelligence.  Still digesting recent acquisitions, leads to an awkward mix match of policies at times.  If you're not local you should know going in there is nearly no public transportation in this region, settle somewhere you are comfortable driving to work every day."
good,"Loved my position and salary. Management had separate goals so it was hard to be on one page mos of the time. Quiet, relaxing environment. Nice place and pleasant people."
good,Transitioning over financial advisors from competitive firms. I've learned how to speak with advisors of all different attitudes and personalities.The culture is great at my company and the most enjoyable part is getting to work with different people everyday.
good,"Raymond James overall was a good company to work for. I was in the middle of a career change and no jobs for me in my new industry were at my location. The department I was in was stressful, due to the cross site department leadership. Lots of favoritism at the time. I did not enjoy MY department.. but other departments in the company did not have our level of disfunction"

good,I enjoyed working at Raymond James.  They do a lot of community work and support the employees in the community work.
good,My contract job paid well and I was well-treated by the management. The work environment was very fast-paced and I think the deadline they put on our contract for completion of the work was somewhat unreasonable.

good,"A typical work day consisted of delivered informational sales presentations to potential clients. "
good,The amazing working culture at Raymond James is one that has been the best in my mind so far. Although it has been many years since I left the company to relocate from Philadelphia back to Florida I have always missed working for the company for it's wonderful working and family oriented atmosphere especially at the branch I worked at in Philly. After reloacting to Florida I was unable to find work quickly enough at RJA and settled on BAI after a few months and although had many great years there I truly would love to work for RJA again.
good,"Raymond James was AWESOME place to work and people is what made job so enjoyable. Everyone worked together well and job promoted team camaraderie.  RJ offered industry and software classes to broaden one's knowledge of Industry and growth within company.  I took advantage of these industry and software classes, which helped me grow within the company."
good,"Working at Raymond James has given me confidence that not all wall street firms are alike and more importantly allowed me to run my business.

Researched and recommended an international mutual fund portfolio for an existing client. Learned to develop a benchmark which took into account equity and fixed income."
good,"Raymond James Ltd enabled me to grow my knowledge base on investment products and stratagies. Later in my career, I decided I neede a career change. It is as simple as that."
good,"A typical day of work includes printing daily performance details for each account opened prior day, responding to internal and external email inquires from managers, FA's and associates. Running daily queries, opening and balancing accounts. Making any necessary changes or adjustments. Assiting with other areas of the department when short staffed. The management team is friendly. However I do not think they do enough to encourage growth. The hardest part of my job is asking management for career advice. The people I work with are nice and are team players."
good,Working for the independent contractor channel during a time when more advisors are going independent made for great business. This business will continue to grow over time.
good,"Very educational and exceptional leadership. Advancement was not very available in Southfield as the HQ is in St. Petersburg, Florida and that's where the majority of the advancement takes place."
good,Enjoyed coordinating schedules for the financial planners. They offered a flexible schedule and had the ability to work the hours I needed at the time.

good,Great company to work for.  Fast-paced environment.  Great benefits.  I wish the salary advancement were a little bit better.  Good campus amenities.  There is plenty of recognition for a great job done.
good,"My main reason for leaving RJ was that they did not pay as much as competitors and they are okay with that. I compared pay between friends that were in the same position as me and they were paid $10k to $20k more. However, the culture is great. Managers take pride in their work as well as yours and really try to set up the entire team for success."
good,A typical day was working the back-office of a securities firm.  Many projects and fast paced.  Assisted Financial Advisor with client reports and needs.  Contact with clients.  The hardest part of the job  was non-stop fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job...learning from the ground up all about the financial industry.

good,"Laid Back, Amazing Manager, Work at my own pace but still able to keep on top of things, Taught me new things."
good,"This is a phenomenal company.  RJ does a great job at teaching and training and there's absolutely no shortage of opportunities to learn.  The downside is that the Southfield branch is small compared to the true home office in St. Pete, Florida.  Because of that, growth in this local branch is limited."
good,I love the team that I work for and the company's ability to make associates feel important. The organization recognizes talent both internally and externally.

good,"Raymond James is a great company. I gave 5 stars across the board, except for work/life balance - which is expected because I was in equity research.

Raymond James is very much about making sure employees feel they are appreciated, and the culture is much better than that of a bulge bracket."

My biggest obstacle, or challenge with the company was the opportunity for advancement once the market began it's decline."
