rating,review
bad,"Some old managers favour peoples friends and family, they put you to work and help them, usually under them, and they keep changing their minds what to do, people backstabbing each other every day, you can be the best, and all of a sudden you can receive a call that your job is terminated and you need to hand over your laptop.....Just like that."
bad,wouldnt recomend to my worst enemy worst management and culture i have ever had the misfortune to encounter in my 30+ years of working across australia
bad,Is tanimi ile asla ortusmeyen isleri yaptirmak icin gecic eleman alan ve yurtdisindan gelen zorunlu butce harcama sebebi ile is alimi yapan bir firma.
bad,Poor management. Poor team building. Management is not fair   Worked all this time as a temp   They will skip over you and hire externally.  They need new mgmt.
bad,Worst experience of my life. My manager was horrible from the first day of my job. She would harass me and micro manage me and when I went to HR and higher management with this they would not help me at all.
bad,Ok. Can get lost in a large company. Sometimes it’s hard to have a work life balance. The was not a lot of room for internal growth for current employees. Pfizer is ok.
bad,Hated it. I have nothing good to say about my experience at Pfizer. Thanks I have nothing more to say about my experience at Pfizer. The people I worked with were not very friendly.
bad,"pollutes water pool in front of building, then pays epa fine.  different work shifts try to poison each others product.  i really think the fda should take a serious walk through.  changes name of company whenever there is a major problem"
bad,Was not a job I would stay at I was racially profiled and had a hostile work environment that made me morally have to find a job that fit my work life balance
bad,"Pfizer (Carlisle) does not care about the employees, they only cared about the output of product for the day.  You could not go to the restroom or take lunch without management yelling at you.  Had to work 24/7, all holidays, and had to come in during snow storm and the roads were closed, you still had to be there.  They do not appreciate the work you do.  Management gets to leave whenever and you have to do their work for them so that it is done on top of your actual job and then they get rewarded for it not you.  You are running around all day doing your job because they run too many machines with not enough people.  Overall it is a terrible place to work and a terrible work environment and I would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Enjoy work with professionals Class A                                                "
bad,Worst job company stay away from this place people are clickish management is against you they do not care about their employeeswork somewhere else manpower s3nds people there
bad,"No advancement for contractors; it is rare that anyone from my department, which was entirely outsourced, was ever hired as an employee. Very little consideration for work/life balance."
bad,"McPherson Kansas plant is not a good place to work. Unprofessional culture. Only local incompetent peoples are in supervisors and managers levels positions. Hiring and promotion are based on behaviors/bar buddy search. Locals and dirty politics survives over hard work, qualification and talent."
bad,"The management is running the business into the ground. They treat you unfair, they lie to you, they show favoritism to certain employees. It was a horrible place to work."
bad,"Watch your back. these people will do anything to get ahead if they throw you under a bus, then count yourself lucky. they have clicks like high school, you either fit or you don't."
bad,"I had the unfortunate experience of working for this company through Manpower. We were told if we proved ourselves as good employees we would be able to be hired on full-time. This was never the case. The job was only short-term, and they hid the fact Pfizer was in dire straits and there was a possibility of a plant closing. Too bad Manpower and Pfizer just couldn't tell us the truth."
bad,"I hated working for this cheap, boring company.  The hardest thing to do at this job was stay awake from all the boring people that worked there.  The pay was miserable...the products were all dogs."
bad,"Was once a respectable company to work for but poor management has driven this once great and respected country into the ground. If you are looking for a career then Pfizer is not the place, you might be lucky to get 2 years but that's the max."
bad,"Worked for 19 years lost job to restructuring, cold management that was more focused on the thier advancement then helping thier reports learn and progress"
bad,"Too many acquisitions, company could not compete with competition.  Management team micro-managed everything you did on a daily basis.  Haven't seen much in their pipeline, unless it was acquired thorough a buyout."
bad,"Have to go through lots of training to clean different suffices and rooms, floors and different electrical equipment for floors."
bad,A typical day at work was alright. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting nice people. The hardest part of the job was picking up heavely equipmment.
bad,I did not really enjoy working here it was very long hours and very bad pay and u were never guaranteed work also the management were not very nice people
bad,I had an horrible experience due to the lay off. I have two children and it is hard. I am a hard worker and for to laid off was painful but my family and I have gotten past the storm.
bad,"Not a good thing to be Contract Security at a large company, People look down on your for what others in the same team did as doing a shady spotty job. Even doing the best of your ability did not get you advanced. Went on Interviews, but never got a higher position.... for even a slightly higher team leader pay."
bad,"They will pay you, I can at least say that, if the staff is late to their shift regardless as to if you have an appointment, you will have to stay until the next person is there to relieve you from your station, sometimes the staff will not even show up for that day in which you sometimes have to stay another 8 hours."
bad,"I took this job in NYC shortly after 9/11.  The pay was miserable and I was only paid 32 hours per week.  When a holiday would fall on a Monday, my boss initially allowed me to make up the missing day that Friday, but eventually she stopped doing that, which brought me down to just 3 days a week.  The work was boring, monotonous, and there was very little mentoring or counseling.  I would not work for this company again."
bad,"If you weren't part of the click you were not accepted. They didnt teach you anything, had to learn on your own. Worked fulltime M-F 630-4."
bad,"A good company with exciting projects, great benefits, but doesn't mean that your boss is good. Most empoyees like this company."
bad,"Pfizer Co (1998 –2000)"
bad,"The work place was very poor, insects everywhere, not clean. Management was not around that often."
bad,"badly run, badly managed, no opportunity for advancement and failed to treat workers as people with lives."
bad,"Absolutely no job security/progression or praise!! Management complete closed shop very quick to praise themselves, no transparency between management and staff, failed attempts to rectify have been a complete disaster and is quickly swept under the carpet and forgotten about."
bad," Receiving orders and doing the invoices"
bad,"Managed all administrative duties for 20 technicians and 4 Veterinarians, i.e., travel arrangements, calendars, weekend technical schedules, graphics for advertisement and meetings, minutes for management, etc."
bad,"very poor company to work for, sent all of our work over seas."
bad,"Long days, shot lunch breaks. "
bad,"There is SO much wrong with this place, I'm amazed to see its overall rating above 2-3 stars. (I ASSURE you, their entire PR dept has uploaded 5 star reviews) I've been with three big pharma companys over about 20 yrs and working here was a terrible mistake. In the late 90s, I was draw in by Pfizers excellent reputation, patent-heavy pipeline and of course generous salary. Over those 8 yrs or so, I witnessed a capricious, hostile & exceptionally political work culture, become worse. I watched dedicated co-workers, back-stabbed by managment. And of course the CONSTANT termination of strong-performing scientists. Pfizers' business model (now) is to buy other companies, pilage their pipelins & products and fire employees. My recommendation; avoid being associated with anything Pfizer."
bad,"Pfizer at Vega Baja PR has the worst management, disrespectful , not worth it. Supervisors are abusive individuals. Workload is unbalanced and unfair."
bad,"Experienced racism, bullying and harassment"
bad,"Pfizer sucks would advise people to work there.Upper management moved people around to much.Putting the in position to fail and be terminated.At times to much over time,needed more help."
bad,"McPherson Kansas plant is a legacy Hospira plant. It does not represent other Pfizer plant. The plant is severely suffering by the bad culture, and lack of talent in management or in skilled job roles. Local peoples are only hired or promoted in management regardless of qualification. They do not allow better qualified people from out of state or from minorities to be promoted or hired in management or in high paying jobs. "
bad,The management is poor at the westport location. They treat the workers like children and expect no mistakes to be made. They threaten to write people up on a daily basis for minor stuff.oh yeah and if you become and inspector expect to take several tests thruout the year and many evaluations thru the year from people that dont know how to do the job. The union is a pure shitshow just like management. Its just a revolving door of people now. so much turnaround. I dont recommend this place at all. Im currently trying to get out myself. only good thing about this place is some of the people and the vacation time. Also expect to be forced to work most weekends. no work-life balance.
bad,"So this company is backwards from the start. As a technician with lots of experience in this industry I can honestly attest that Management does not care what you know, how hard you work, or about your ideas. They fill you with false hopes and dreams that the company cares about you as a person. First off, that is a lie. Management only cares about what makes them look good and does not make time for you as a person or an employee. They are cut throat, backstabbers, who only look out for themselves and will try and bully you to get what they want at the time. They NEVER thank you for what you do there daily, or how many hours YOU have to work. Remarks like "" well, your manufacturing and have no idea how difficult MY job is"" are made all the time. If your manufacturing your treated worse than manure. Layoffs, layoffs, and even more layoffs. These happen in companies but Pfizer seems to have them more than anyone else."
bad,"Never think of working for pfizer... everything so screwed up especially management. Talk about safety but never follow at all... for what??!!! Work long hours, totally no work life balance. Work like a dog, especially for non executive staffs."
bad,"Not really the kind of technical aspect of job that I want to commit with. Therefore I want to do what I love most, hands on technical jobs"
bad,Unproductive Area Managers and unsupportive managers. no transparency and unethical behaviors followed
bad,"I worked very hard at Pfizer. During my time at Pfizer I studied Business Management. It used to be very pleasant working there for the first few years but new managment changed the atmosphere dramatically. Eventually, the problems with the job became too great due to the many new implementations put upon it by staff that did not understand the area. My job expectations grew rapidly until I was doing the work of three employees. I tackled this with the strength and resolve of three employees myself. My strong work ethic required me to complete every task put on my desk no matter how tall that pile got. My co-workers were limited as I mostly worked alone. Those I did interact with were most enjoyable to work with."
bad,"Benefits and Salary was good, other Supervisors and managers made it difficult to work with especially the ones that did not want to do there job or did not take responsibility for the decisions they made that were wrong. "
bad,I felt that they let the veterans treat new employees horrible. No one works as a team. If they didn't like you they made sure you knew that. No one communicates. The work environment was worse than middle school.
bad,"Unprofessional management. Got fired cuz the line 3 Line Coordinator plays favoritism. Lied to my supervisor on my evaluation to get me fired. Was already on with manpower. Was working for 4 months trying to get permanent just to get done dirty. Everyone on my line would say the exact opposite of what this LC told my supervisor to get me fired, don't waste your time."
bad,"Worked there for a short time as Quality Operation Professional. Typical workday was very stressful. I was expected to work over 50 hours a week. I was required to support remotely on my off days. Management required me to be available 24/7 over the phone. The worst part of the job was the bad culture, and mean local people. Local people are very clickish, and play dirty politics against any out of state people or people of colored who are rarely hired. Those local mangers and supervisors hire other locals from their church- very unprofessional. They will not cooperate with others who are not local or are colored. Hostile environment. "
bad,If you fit in you will work out great. Don't say anything about being bullied if you are even though in there beginning course it says no bullying. Pay is good. If you have to go through temp service it might take longer than a month to get switched to Pfizer.
bad,"Perpetuate stereotypes, stay in your lane, do not speak up, challebge authority, or have any suggestions..if so, that is the place for you..Look elsewhere! You will thank me.."
bad,"Worked there for a short time as Quality Operation Professional. Typical workday was very stressful. I was expected to work over 50 hours a week.

Those local mangers and supervisors hire other locals from their church- very unprofessional. They will not cooperate with others who are not local or are colored. Hostile environment. "
bad,"Very stressful job, expectation was to work more than 60 hours a week, and to be available 24/7 remotely over phone. I worked there from February 2018 to June 2018, left as soon as I got offer from another company. "
bad,The only thing these people OWN is not owning it.  This is a very hostile place to work. Its a culture of us verses them. They should close the doors before they kill someone.
bad,Dictatorial management with no concern for employees.  Never accepts suggestions of employees and creates a totally adversarial environment between employees and management
bad,"People are so unhappy that they are actually nasty to each other, the open work environment is the worst concept in the industry. All employee amenities taken away. They would take vacation days away if they could get away with it. The medical benefits are so expensive that they are ridiculous, while the higher ups get millions in bonuses."
bad,"At a ""how to succeed at Pfizer"" session we learned to ""get used to hearing NO"" and that is totally true.  Don't bother bringing ideas from the 21st century here.  Or any ideas at all.  Apparently they've got it all figured out and don't need to change a thing.  If you're looking to step back in time this might be the place for you, but otherwise steer clear."
bad,There is limited development of present staff to advance their knowledge. There limited sharing of knowledge to help an individual grow in the industry.
bad,"Unstable environment.   Management doesn't address issues directly with people - they will go behind your back and throw you under the bus.  You are a number with this company and if the business doesn't have the need, they will let people go without a thought."
bad,Corn Cuts.  It does.  Like a thousand tiny little paper cuts.  The mud sucks your shoes off your feet.  You dream of Pop Pop Pops as the pollen fills the air.
bad,"The job itself was good and I enjoyed doing what was expected from me, but the management sucked really bad! They did not care about their employees and no matter how hard you worked, they did not appreciate it. The supervisor would lie straight to your face and talk bad about you behind your back. I am glad I am no longer there!"
bad,Management doesn't hire production workers but once every 2 years and you have to be voted in. performance doesn't matter when applying for a full-time position.. Usually 1 out of 15 temp workers will get a job.
bad,"You may get paid very good money, but it's not enough when you had to deal with the 'dog-eat-dog' mentality that would've occurred in the 1950's. No wonder there's a high turnover of staff there. Just another Stepford corporate who read from a script, banging on about how great it is working for what really is nothing more than a glorified gasworks."
bad,"Constant grueling manual labor at a place described to be laid back and easy. I was expecting some hard work while keeping the floor running, I wasn't expecting to be constantly dealing with the same issue every day due to machines that were too old to function at the overclocked rate of production we were operating at. Mechanics didn't care either, accepting issues as ""that's how it's always been."" "
bad,I don’t plan on being at pfizer long. I dislike the workers and I do not like the area as a whole. The job sucks. But its bringing in money so I come. I could quit any day now
bad,If you can abandon all moral values and not care about anything but money this job is for you. If you want to be proud of what you do then it's not. They preach Alot about culture about its all talk. They do not fallow anything they preach. The management is terrible. the training is terrible. Comunication is terrible. They push production and take shortcuts to put out more product. They will not give you recognition for good work. No job advancement oportunity unless your friends or family of someone higher up or if you do other illigal things to get promotions. If you have any sense of morals this place is not for you. %75 turnover rate. And takes over a full year to get fully trained.
bad,"The management sucked really bad! They did not care about their employees and no matter how hard you worked, they did not appreciate it. The supervisor would lie straight to your face and talk bad about you behind your back. I am glad I am no longer there!"
bad,We can discuss while meeting. They did not gave the job which I am good at. It was the hardest job of my life. Finally those people asked me to leave the company.
bad,Les managers ne sont pas à la hauteur les bureaux pas adaptés pour un service client beaucoup de pression et de bruits peu de suivi !
bad,"I lasted as long as I did only because my direct manager was half-way decent (before he assimilated to the toxic Pfizer culture), and I had a flexible schedule. The pay was low and the benefits receded each year. I was told by a manager that ""Management doesn't care"". Pretty much sums up big Pharma."
bad,Highly political environment.  Pay is good compared to other pharma but the benefits are well below other pharma (e.g. maternity leave is only 6 weeks.)
bad,"Pfizer February / 2013 -2006 "
bad,Endless rounds of layoffs and a ranking environment that breeds back stabbing
bad,"I was told repeatedly I was a good, hard worker but they laid me off instead of hiring me on. You put vials in boxes to be shipped. They changed things all the time,if you don't like change this is not a place for you."
bad,Too many foreign nationals rotating in and out of the organization at the General Manager level. No appreciation or understanding of the Canadian OTC marketplace and no respect for sales successes.  A complete culling of the salesforce and constant restructuring and downsizing.  Very few employees with20 years or more experience left.
bad,"Pur essendo appartenente ad uno dei più grandi gruppi del mondo pharma, ci sono tanti punti negativi che vi riassumo in breve:"
bad,Job was not for me.They are to strict at this company and unorganized. I can't say if the next person would like it . The hours are swing shift and there always trying to make you stay over no matter what you may have to do.
bad,"work day PM mainly on off shifts on day shift some PM's but mainly jobs and fixes that could not be done on off shift, usually due to lack of certain resources."
bad,division is dissolving.  Need robots to sell as you cannot use any creativity or any clinical comparison.  Super frustrating.   Really a shame due to over reaction on damages
bad,Very poor management. Training for aseptic workers is very stressful. In general production workers are not happy and work moral is very poor. I would not recommend it.
bad,"Some people love PFE. I hated it! No work life balance, micromanaging boss, no chances to do science. All about image/strategy.."
bad,"horrible place. colleagues are generally miserable, all the time. co. went through good times, late 90's/early 00's, now it's a shell of what was. the work has doubled/tripled up, while head-count, benefits, etc., have been slashed beyond belief. truly a shame, once-great co. driven to its present state by series of incompetent 'leaders'. am i bitter? no, way past that. getting out of that place is like being 'recalled to life'."
bad,Pfizer is in business for one reason and one reason only: to make loads of money. They care very little for their employees and see them as expendable.
bad,no loyalty
bad,"Pfizer CRU was an amazing place to work a few years ago, unfortunately that is no longer the case. Management is nonexistent due to inexperienced staff given management positions. Out of control favoritism, unfairness, and total mistrust of supervisors/management has created a hostile work environment. Staff won’t speak up out of fear of retaliation. So sad to see a lot of the good staff leave."
bad,"Pfizer, McPherson has no visible Human Resources at all. Shots are called by Area Supervisors with little or no training in the areas of employment law on discrimination. You need to be in the “good ole boys” club to survive.  Little to no training provided new hires, most are contracted though Manpower and have no voice or backup. If they want to get rid of you supervisors will ask those in the “Club” and will manufacture a reason to terminate without any warning or discussion with you about needed improvement. They simply tell Manpower to tell you you’re done. Most tense, watch your back place of employment I have seen in over 50 years of employment. Could not recommend to anyone with honesty, dedication, and desire to work for an honest paycheck and desire to grow."
bad,Culture is one of fear and loathing.  There is a sense of learned helplessness among many on the lower rungs. Anyone who dares color outside the lines is punished.  It is a one direction operation where orders come from the top and there is no one up there listening to anything that is happening on the ground.
bad,"While Pfizer has great training requirements, it takes so long to be trained that it dimensions most value from the training. Overall the immediate management is very friendly and easy to work with, but higher up management became less concerned with people and more concerned with appearing to be innovative. they would refuse to give employees raises and promotions, but would spend hundreds of thousands into projects that were nothing more than busy work and would often result in the absolute minimal improvement. The turnover rate was extremely high and it was a combination of poor pay, location, and the fact they would hire 8 people and place them in senior positions before ever once promoting their current employees who spent years with the company. In my experience, work-life balance is completely non-existent; the location I worked from was roughly an hour commute for almost all employees in my area and everyone was pretty much required to work 9.5-10.5 hours a day."
bad,"Enjoyed the work I was doing and all of the development and learning opportunities that Pfizer provided.  "
bad,Receving of all kids of material from raw to office products. Learned many skills in my 20 years there. Management is typical of a large corporation.
bad,You never knew weather you still had a job or not each day you went to work. The management in a whole is very unorganized. They change things too frequently. My co-workers were great though. The hardest part of my job was that it took alot of wasted time to find out how to do anything. The most enjoyable part was being in the same boat with the L-company co-workers. They were your support system.
bad,They were always out of work you might have some work 2 times a week.Drive all the way there to just sit doing nothing.Management sucks employees telling the supervisor what they not gonna do.The LCs are very disrespectful it was a stressful job to me..I worked as a temp for a year in a half never hired permanent they make fake promises.
bad,"Onpersoonlijk, te afgelijnde procedures, geen kans om initiatief te nemen"
bad,"I'm currently working in this company, and all I can say is if you are bullied by an employee, the company will back the bully and will do-nothing to help you ! An absolute disgrace in a company like that. I do not recommend this place at all, besides there are no opportunities to advance in your career and the interesting roles are only distributed to a little circle of people."
bad,"Didn’t like the work environment, and the fact that I wasn’t asked to go to 1st shift when a new employee came on to the company. I needed to be on 1st shift because I had to go out there on my off days for media fills and any other training needed. I also didn’t like the unprofessional manner in which upper management spoke to you."
bad,Regimented and Competitive. 
bad,They force people to work 7 days a week. Then discriminate towards people that have to get FMLA just to get days off .What else is there to say if you want to work for a company that cares nothing for your family....work for Pfizer.
bad,"its a very Enjoyable days to work with Pfizer. Pfizer has good Environment and a very good learning place and very cooperative senior Management  and co-workers.I have learned lots of things there,and have face various situation and be a part of Pfizer implemented lots of new things according to the SOPs."
bad,"Pretty common to have an unreal amount of work with unreal deadlines. Your time is never your own. At any moment, something is a 'crisis' and needs to be completed in the evening and weekends with no warning. No one works less than 50-55 hours and the stress level in unsustainable even with psych meds. Run."
bad,Steriel werken rond wettelijke voorschriften en procedures in de farmacie. Productie omgeving.
bad,"I was not given enough opportunity to train in the myriad of softwares required to do my job at Pfizer. There was in fact an intense training protocol that sometimes eclipsed the actual work to be done. I did have a mentor who unfortunately chose to not include me in meetings in which the product and project I was working on were part of the agenda. After only two months of training, I was deemed to not be a ""good fit"", as my mentor blatantly stated."
bad,"Management was focused on low growth opportunities.  As a result you have significant resources going to another Advil initiative that yields a low return.  Meanwhile, smaller brands are being starved of resources and do not grow."
bad,"I use to enjoy working for this company. However I was moved from nights to days. They are now moving me back to nights and as a single mother of an 11 year old boy, I am not willing to go back to nights. All the supervisors are aware of my situation and do not care. There are many people that I work with that have not had to go to nights. some of them; do not have children, children are grown, or they have a significant other that can help with the children. They are very unorganized there and do a lot of time wasting. They choose favorites, and they do not hold people accountable for they job duties."
bad,"presión condifderentes fases de capacitación stante,la supervisión demasiado extrema, hay diferentes fases de capacitación, pero es de mucho prestigio y al trabajar ahí te facilita relacionarte con otros colegas-"
bad,"work environment was very good morning tea with couple of calls to vendors to get seminar stuff , running to the medical department for approval of pamphlet as the product was on liquidation had to be proactive in doing things, selection of give aways for the next cycle, market research of competitors in the market and making action plan accordingly."
bad,"Management sucked, pay was good and the coworkers were nice. Would recommend the job if you have tough skin and can put up with the bs. Management will always place fault on employees."
bad,"Don't come to Pfizer if you want the opportunity to change or improve anything. "
bad,"I arrange travel - manage calendars, arrange meetings - set up interviews, answer a lot of questions, on-board employees, print, order supplies, set up weekly seminars, fill in for people who are on vacation, notaries documents, and general PR work with our hotels for our guests who speak at Pfizer of who are interviewing."
bad,The people only care about themselves. The long hours are crazy to work along with the rotating shifts. The management is not ran very well they work you to death and feel that it is okay.
bad,"If your offer is a temporary position, do not do it. There are many things you are NOT able to do as a temp and you get stuck on things that are not worth the effort it takes. The supervisors and managers also tend to treat the temps like they are lesser people than the Pfizer/Hospira employees."
bad,"Typical large pharmaceutical company.  Positives - Good benefits ; Negatives - Slow to adapt to changes in its environment, poor leadership, aging portfolio, averse to change"
bad,Very good company . Have a very work ce ter to the employer.The company have good salary for people. Have a good health plan to employer and free medicine of Pfizer recipe.
bad,Empresa que preza pela segurança e bem -estar do trabalhador.
bad,"St. Louis plant is not stable, very rarley work 40 hours a week. Those sr technicians are no joke. If the managers like you then you have a job.  Assemblers are controlled by 2 women...."
bad,contratto finito e apertura mobilità di conseguenza licenziamento gli ultimi arrivati
bad,"The centre was responsible for managing the low stock levels of UK Pfizer brand pharmaceuticals."
bad,"it was fine as Wyeth Pharma. Once Pfizer made purchase, it became unbearable."
bad,"Artwork creation (Parma, Animal health local and Export) of the new products according to packaging design guidelines."
bad,"My review to the job is ok, needs a lot of work with communication from supervisor to co-workers. At times managers and supervisors don't take communication under consideration and assume certain situations that would allow them to mislead co-workers."
bad,"The world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer Inc discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets leading prescription medicines for humans and animals and many of the world's best-known consumer brands."
bad,Job slowing down not to many hour. Slow work. Bad management  not telling employees  what's going on. Closing  down differt department. Vendors  not buying  the products
bad,"No hay respeto al empleado. Ambiente laboral.pesimo y no requieres ser in profecional do no panismo"
bad,"Ok Place. Job life balance is very poor. Management was poor. However people were nice to work with. It has the potential to be a better place. "
bad,"Would not advice working for the insights and Analytics group at Pfizer.  it is a stressful and unethical, and hostile work environment.  Everyone is out to look out for themselves, esp. the Managers."
bad,"Put my family a side and never receive any benefit and dont always put the contract personal make the mpre perjudicial Health jobs and always putyou a side fpr the regular personal! You are a left 0 for this people"
bad,There is no consistency at my job. Bad decisions are made all the time. Nobody is ever held accountable for their actions. I feel like I am treated very unfair.
bad,"I worked as a contractor. I didnt like the management style that reuired 7 minutes max per call ... sometimes the customer takes time to explain the problem .... Anyway, it wasn't one of my best working experiences ever..."
bad,"High pressure job with no rewards."
bad,Very focused to obtain financial result. Excellent marketing company with strategic to manage complicates portfolios
bad,"I was required to check mailing listings and work from there. I did not enjoy working at Pfizer. It was very mundane working atmosphere. With that being said, I did learn some things about a new department."
bad,"If you are going through the temp agency you will be very much unpaid for all of the work you do. The people that actually work at Pfizer they help you out sometimes if you are in need, they do have really good teamwork but that is about it. You cannot miss any days. If you miss two days you are fired, even if you have a doctors note, death in the family. They want you to dedicate your life to them when they don't care about you. You do 12 hour shifts and they rotate throughout the week, throwing your whole life balance off. It rotates from days to nights, night to days. One week out of the month you have to do 72 hours with just one day off for that week. Like I stated earlier you barely have time for yourself bc you constantly work. If the machines are down you have to clean/mop until the machines are up, aint no telling when they will be up. A few times we literally cleaned for 12 hours, the entire shift. If you don't find something to do, even if everything is already cleaned, you will get snitched on. If you are deciding about working out there to just stay to yourself because the whole plant is just messy, just like to start mess and look for other jobs because this job will kick you to the curve without a notice. This job doesn't care about you nor your plans. They want you to work around their schedule and with some events such as doctors appointments and unexpected events it is hard."
bad,The equipment is not that good they're short on supplies and people are not nice at this company.I don't like the pay for the work l do and the hours.
bad,"They treat you like you are a number not a person. I don't think they appreciated the hard work that was being done. When your assignment was done they called you on your way home and told you. You weren't allowed to go back and get your personal belongs, they had security do that and it takes them approximately 3 week to get your belongings and sometimes you never do get your personal belongs EX. ( steel toed shoes in your locker.)."
bad,"Not a very stable company to work for. Alot of politics and cut throat bureaucrats. Managers don't care about your opinion on how to save money by stream lining the production process, the more contractors they can keep in the building the more ""Christmas Cards"" the receive from the contractors"
bad,You aren't guaranteed work but you must show up to be sent home. This happens frequently. Management makes all the decisions and the union is useless.
bad,They are very unorganized. Poor team moral. Very cut throat environment. Supervisor is very demeaning towards employees. All improvement ideas shot down.
bad,"If you belong to the club, you are all set. If not, there are very few chances for a career at Pfizer, Inc. It's a shark tank and you are just the next meal.It's a shame...it didn't use to be like this..."
bad,it was an ok place to work. Nothing to rave about a steady paycheck. supervisor ok but horrible upper management
bad,"Non inclusive very homogeneous sales force little"
bad,So much hours an no beniftes 3 year hire in time 12.00 a hr. On time to get hired or no job.   thanks Pfizer your temp policy need more hours  color is big here.
bad,I was contracted through a staffing agency and the job description was more for an office job not the job I got in procurement. The training was awful...needed to be trained hands on not by watching and having read to me slide shows.
bad,"Poor work environment and low compensation rate. Distant management and upper management. Flexible with schedules and work/life balance. Very hard to move up in company and little recognition. Fast pace work burns you out along with poor communication among co-workers. Lack of communication and inspiration comes from top as well as a history of this problem. Financially secure, but little increase in pay rate from year to year."
bad,"Pfizer has a lot of money to spend, but their interest is in RX drugs. They buy companies and sell any division that does not have RX products.  You are a number not a name.  Management does not listen to their employees in order to improve the workplace, and they typically leave the current management in place for whatever company they buy."
bad,"Very poor management and a culture of keep your head in the sand and do your job.If it weren't for the management team, and fear of lay offs, it would be an acceptable place to work."
bad,"Le laboratoire va ou est vendu, Beaucoup trop de choses Opaque."
bad,"Dès mon recrutement le superviseur m’a affecté avec un autre mécano pour me donner la formation pour deux mois et deux semaines, le superviseur ne donne pas le suivi nécessaire pour les nouveaux pour savoir ou est ce qu’elle sont rendu dans la formation et finalement il te dit que la formation ne rencontre pas les objectifs qui sont pas défini par le superviseur dés le début, cette façon de travail impacte la compagnie et sa processus d’embauche et par la suite augmente les  couts de formation et réalise des pertes pour la compagnie malheureusement il y a beaucoup de chose à dire....... le superviseur est D.M. sur le conditionnement liquide. Notons que j’ai 10 ans d’expérience dans des technologies complexes et quelqu’un d’expérience personnellement je recommande pas cette compagnie au gens"
bad,Management is not professional and seems to be intimidated by intelligence.  (Inferiority Complexity Issues).  Standard work times: 8 to 4pm.  Overtime available with approval.
bad,"The site as a whole is unorganized and a work environment I'd rather not be in.  Higher up management did not care about the EM especially night shift; no compensation for the ones that lived far or anything.  Felt very unappreciated and rushed many times and was actually injured there before I left but felt highly uncomfortable to say anything because I was just ready to go and down and out at the time anyways.  Taught me a lot as far as how I should carry myself in my future career endeavors, however, was one of the easy but worst jobs I've ever embarked on so far."
bad,"High School Drama all day long, Management is horrible, Supervisors not Trained well but the pay is what keeps people there.  The hardest part of the job is the fact that people try to get others in trouble 24/7, nobody minds their own business and too many chiefs, not enough Indians."
bad,"Pfizer has a reputation of buying up companies then selling the manufacturing facilities to other companies, they want the products not the employees."
bad,"Too much politics and lack of leadership and vision."
bad,"Had to leave because of shift, to many days in arow for the 80mile drive. would relocate now if needed to continue to work off shift. now i am willing to relocate"
bad,Pfizer is a great company but the culture on mcpherson ks plant was horrible. Not fun or  worth the money but there are some great people there . Just got to remember  you have no friends there. Cya at all times!!!!
bad,"Pfizer very much has a ""class"" system in the Memphis. Management had different ""favorites"" and didn't seem to care who knew.  The managers I worked for were all about micro-managing which made the environment worse."
bad,"I enjoyed the work and I excelled quickly. However, the culture and particular consultant that I worked under was a micro-manager and did not allow for lunches, breaks, nor open communication among fellow team members. "
bad,"There is plenty of room to grow within the company, if you are related to someone who works there. Nepotism is a problem at the Pearl River site and upward mobility is difficult with unqualified managers and employees. Discrimination exists in certain groups, as pregnancies seem to be a hassle for some team leaders. It is a shame because there really is potential here at Pfizer."
bad,"They have the reputation of abruptly changing directions and canceling or changing contracts, deserverdly so."
bad,"Pfizer has great benefits but that's about the only thing. the department I worked for lacked communication and management was a nightmare. they would have meetings during our lunch breaks and when I told my boss it was state law for a mandatory lunch break I was told ""one hand washed the other"". job security in this company is unheard of, as they always have rolling layoffs."
bad,"After 7 years at ""the world's largest pharmaceutical company"", I got tired of always looking over my shoulder in an attempt to see if I would have a job for the next 6 months."
bad,Very good scientists
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful with no set timelines or department structure. After the merger, the management team failed to provide the man-power to cover the case load that combining these two pharmaceutical companies had created. Unfortunately, many valuable colleagues were lost. I am however, very grateful for the 15 years that I was a part of the Wyeth family."
bad,Do not like the work environment that Pfizer has. people are always wondering if their job is the next one to be elimanated.
bad,"I worked at the Clinical Research Unit and had strongly defined tasks. There was quite a bit of training and oversight for the type of work that is being done understandably. The co-workers are nice, management tended to be overly distrustful and difficult to please. It was the first job I ever had that I felt that way. I noticed that was a cultural influence as during my time there, I saw new people rotate into oversight roles and become the same way. Overall, for a paycheck it is ok but it's not a place to grow your long term career."
bad,"With management detached from their production and personnel allowed to under-perform without any expectation of improvement, this place is sinking. Rapidly. Don't expect to move upward without having a relative working there presently, or an ability to avoid any confrontation at all. The pay may be competitive but the forced overtime isn't, especially when the production problems can be blamed on a lack of solid action plans from different management divisions. People who don't support their co-workers face no repercussions and will continue to drag down all aspects of production without any expectation of improvement. Seriously consider whether you want to work in this environment, and if you do, don't expect to stay for a sizable length of time."
bad,"The hardest part of my job was, dealing with a company that didn't care about their employee's. Very little communication between management and coworkers. What I learned while working with Pfizer/Hospira,  following Good Manufacturing skills, always abide by the Standard Operating Procedure's, doing it right the first time, every time!"
bad,No focus on the job is provided instead just acquisition and dissolving  culture is followed. no personal growth. no proper increment and very poor leader ship skills at Chennai sites
bad,"personnel très arrogant, il faut savoir se débrouiller et solliciter le moins possible dès le début ou on se fait taper sur les doigts même en tant qu'alternant"
bad,"Hated working at Pfizer, one of the worst supervisors I have ever had and worked for a year and quit.  First 6 months there had no pre clinical assignments and no work was transferred to me from other projects going on in lab."
bad,I wouldn't work for this company if you want job security.  Even if your the best employee and get raving reviews they will let you go and not relocate you to another facility.
bad,I did not like this company.  It was like living in a prision and they want your undivided attentionl.  Expect you to live your life around their needs.
bad,Departments are poorly managed due to poor communication.  Employees aren't treated equally.  Breaks are 20 minutes long and they do not open cafeteria for second or third shifts. not a family oriented company
bad,"I'm not even sure where to start. First off, during your interview they are purposely vague about the company culture because it's absolutely non-existent. If you are a ""colleague"", as they call it, you have access to company benefits such as PTO, medical, and respect. But if you are a contractor you're subjected to whatever garbage benefits your agency offers, which are usually extremely expensive, if any at all. The divide between colleagues and contractors is almost scarily apparent right from the beginning. Being a contractor nothing you say is ever taken seriously and you're practically disposable and treated as such. The ""top"" management members have horrible communication skills. When an issue happens they are quick to point fingers and gasp in confusion but will seldom leave their offices on a daily basis to actually, you know, manage. They usually do an annual ""clean house"" which means that every so often they will fire 5-10 contractors for whatever menial reason they may find. Contractors have practically no room for advancement within the company because there's always the claim of a ""hiring freeze""; however, when a position magically opens up you already know who will or won't be considered for the position because it's based 25% on qualifications and 75% on favoritism. The position itself is really quite monotonous...You're either doing ECGs, drawing blood, sitting on the computer, or scanning badges in the cafeteria for 8 hours. There's nothing more that contractors are allowed to do within the building and you will not pick up any valuable skills or knowledge"
bad,"its my pleasure to work with this company "
bad,the leadership was bad the hours were long the training was nonresident the only thing that made it bearable was the coworker and pay the boss had no duration beyond do bitter
bad,"When this company was owned by Hospira, it was a great work environment to work in but when it was purchased by Pfizer they began to downsize and layoff experienced workers. The hardest part of the job was to work on unorganized lines."
bad,"If you dont have family there, beware!"
bad,Enjoyed working in Pfizer. It was short term project. I just worked 4 month. I am willing work again. I was leading there. within 4 month I was participated in Validation Verification process
bad,"The management doesn't care about your development, just that your work gets done. Direct managers are nice, but have no power to help. Upper management just throws money at problems until they go away."
bad,"Great Company to work for, enjoyed my time there. Great location. No benefits as a temporary. Would enjoy working there again with longer hours."
bad,"-el horario es de 8:00am a 18:00pm"
bad,"start at five performing sterile cleaning, stocking, ordering. at 6am perform duties as a packaging operator and still continue performing cleaning duties, making sure everyone has there stock for there lines,running to the company store getting special orders for coworkers. keeping up on back orders from the store. Got along with everyone. done anything that was asked. Hardest part was to juggle everything between cleaning duties and packaging operator too make sure everything was done in 10 hours, which I mastered daily, some harder than other days."
bad,Difficult place to work. A company make up of legions of survivors.
bad,"pharmaceutical representative, sales person and we prepared presentation and seminar about medicine."
bad,- Mauvaise gestion du personnel par le manager.
bad,they are laying people off
bad,Working for Wyeth Research offered great opportunity. Having the ability to grown and learn within different therapeutic areas helped broaden my skills as a Sr. Study File Analyst/TMF Study Owner.
bad,Challenging work environment with execllent benefits. Good possibility for lateral movement within the company for administrative staff. Excellent HR programs for employees and excellent on site employee services.
bad,"Regardless of the cutthroat attitude and mentality of a lot of the associates there. You will need to have full control of your own mind working here. "
bad,"They want you to work 7 days a week in most departments. The St. Louis sites are barely able to produce product. And there is no growth within the company when you are union. It's the good ol boys club. Basically if you know someone that's how you move up in titles. There are completely to many manager positions. How can you be a manager and have no one under you. They give these titles out to give their buddies a pay raise. The union is struggling and they aren't able to find a consensus on even having a contract. They barely want to give raises. Simply said not a bad start, but I wouldn't definitely look for another job while working here. It's going down hill."
bad,"Meeting galore, no new drugs. This is not a place for someone who has a scientific mind. If you are a follower this is a great place to earn a paycheck."
bad,"No longer in business in Bristol TN."
bad,the people are extremely rude if you're a temp. I personally experienced some racial issues but i dont know if that was just my area (cpm) or not and im not even 100% sure if it was because i was the only black guy or if it was because i was the only guy period because i worked with a bunch of old ladies.
bad,Management is not aware of things. Technicians cover up their mistakes for each other in all manufacturing areas. Some take excessive breaks and are not reprimanded. Manager favors others and doesn't reprimand for errors.
bad,"Sadly, the use of common sense is completely absent at the Rapid Turn Lab) Under the umbrella of ""Data Integrity"" Management has created a hostile environment that is toxic and non productive."
bad,"Working at Pfizer the job is easy, they have wonderful benefits! What made me hate Pfizer was when I got fired after my brother death. They only care about themselves and its hard to advance there without someone thinking you'll become better than them!"
bad,"Prestativa em suas funções e coordenações."
bad,"Primary focus on product line, very little desire to match work and life balance, felt like a toxic environment to work in. Working with this union was challenging. Too much stress."
bad,People only talk to you if you are in their clique. Treat contractors like dirt. Manager was bipolar and always mad. Terminates project without notice
bad,"Lab staff overwhelmed with testing and re-testing on a plethora of samples.  Lack of work space, seating within the lab.  A new lab probably has probably alleviated this problem, however, since I left the company."
bad,"Good pay, lots of overtime.  incompetent management and HR in Kalamazoo."
bad,"Fast paced demanding position that changes in complexity and scope daily. Due to this, one is forced to wear many hats, and while this can at times be difficult, one cannot help but pick up new skills and learn."
bad,They are laying people off.
bad,Very top heavy. No respect for people. Wants to be innovative but no budget for research.
bad,"groups of people managers only eat together, analysts eat together. division from upper management. Fear mentality with Leads on site in some cases. few very nice leads"
bad,"Pfizer is a huge company.  I was excited to join, the pay and benefits are great.  The teams have many smart and interesting people on them.  Loved working with my team.  My only issue was the amount of hours put in to get the job done.  I am at a point in my career I need like/work balance.  It was required to be in the office 3 days per week and then be online for meetings with colleagues outside of the US at early morning/late night hours.  Management kept promising it would get better, it didn't."
bad,"Unfortunately in the elearning development arena there was little practical experience among the full time employees, so guidance was at a minimum - as was an understanding of the challenges in meeting goals and deadlines."
bad,Constant cycles of R&D layoffs.  Continual use of contract workers who are underpaid and lose 30% of their paycheck to the company holding the contract and providing a W2 often without any paid time off or benefits.
bad,"no se evalua al personal por su desempeño, gestion y resultados, pesa mas  las relaciones de amistad con los jefes de area que la calidad de trabajo, ambiente laboral muy dificil poco trabajo en equipo."
bad,"I enjoyed what I learned here but truth is they live off of contractors and treat them like 2nd class citizens. Management is great, corporate ruins all the hard work they put into things though."
bad,"awesome benefits and pay. Most of the people I worked with were ""grandfathered"" in and had no understanding of basic tasks. Management was terrible, 0 communication amount team members. They will take away your lunch breaks and not pay you for working snow days. HR doesn't care about problem employees no matter how many people complain. This is a self centered environment focusing on back stabbing. Do not waste your time here."
bad,Trabajo muy dinámico en equipo. Requiere mucha dedicación y genera estres pero la remuneración compensa...
bad,I work in the St. Louis area for Pfizer. The pay is good but other than that I can't really think of anything good to say about Pfizer. They wait until Thursday or Friday to tell you that you are forced to work overtime on the weekend. And if you are in certain areas this is basically a 7 day a week job. Pfizer has this great global image but it is just like any other company.....it just depends on what area you work in that determines if you will love your job or hate it. The biggist problem is WAY too many managers and hoops that have to be jumped through to get anything done. My location is also a union shop so that just empowers stupid lazy people to be worthless. They really need to hire a better class of people.
bad,Laid off due to restructuring. Ok company to work for despite the nonexistent work life balance. You have access to a large knowledge base and the lastest software. Upper management is consistently changing. Sites are under constant evaluation. Learn what you can to excel at your next job.
bad,"Micro management from DMs - They don't trust the reps."
bad,Testing to GMP requirements. Job itself is straightforward. I forgot more than I ever learned. In my opinion most managers are managers by connections rather than ability. Most of my co-workers did what they could despite the structures within the company. Certain co-workers are never held to account for underperforming. No comparision of like with like I was onse told that I wasn't being compared with the mean performance I was being compared against my best performance! Hardest part was to learn that no-one wanted to see a better way of doing things.
bad,"Pay was great, but too many hours with little to no appreciation for what you did as a worker.  Worked a lot of 7 days a week with 10-12 hour days. Management only cared about the almighty dollar."
bad,"Local office is managed bad and got rid of older employees with ""reorganization"" if you not in the ""click"" group of workers.  The behavior would remind you the high school ""cool"" kids vs everybody else type of environment.  Don't stay in a role to long or else your job will be moved overseas."
bad,"Did not feel comfortable with expected somewhat robotic behavior."
bad,"Meetings with clients or management to gather requirements or improve upon processes.  Development, testing and compliance document authoring."
bad,"Great colleagues but company a little too big for me. I prefer a more intimate working environment with more flexibility for the employees. Great benefit package including health insurance, etc."

bad,it's not appopriate for me to review this company at this time since my position was recently terminated
bad,Company doesn't know how to problem solve and is too legally motivated
bad,Management doesn't know how to manage people. Wrong person is management position. Great co worker. Good learning experience. Golf outing on day after labor
bad,"a typical day is challenge "
bad,best place for chemical engineers
bad,"Money is good but lines get crossed way too easy out there and the communication is not good. Still at a bit of a loss with losing my car in a flood my third day of orientation and  had to get a motel room for that second night or I would not have made it back to orientation and would have been let go. Then every other week for 5 to 6 weeks after, my checks kept getting smaller. KRONOS SUCKS! But once that got hammered out which took an act of congress things have smoothed out and hopefully get better. Time will tell."
bad,"No room for growth, no opportunity to move up and better yourself. No ability to learn different things, lack of communication with supervisor. Overall it was an experience"
bad,"The job itself is easy, but there is entirely too much overtime. Expect to be forced to work a 16 hr shift 10 mins before your shift is over. Expect to work 6 days a week and get only 4-6 off days a month. We use the truckers union which is beyond me."
bad,"As a Territory Account Manager, the most enjoyable part of the job is the daily travel to accounts, and meeting/collaborating with a variety of people. The independence of managing a territory that works for you individually, and spending time at accounts that can make a difference, with the flexibility of personal time management,   is very optimal."
bad,not enough pay for the level of responsibility that it takes to make sure people get high quality medicine to improve their quality of life. Long hours.
bad,"Manufacturing controlled Substances for the Pharmacdical company. Overworked with no notice on manditory overtime. Employees were not treated well by management, pay was high but not worth it with missed events due to manditory overtime."
bad,I loved what I was doing as a Label Room Service Clerk. I wish I wasn't the chosen one to have gotten laid off. Hoping they will call me back. A good place to work if there's not another layoff.
bad,I very much enjoyed working with the team at Pfizer.  I met some wonderful people and appreciated the opportunity to learn best practices from everyone.
bad,"Working at Pfizer under the CompuCom contract proved to be very discerning, was very vague in description and even less beneficial as an employee. there were no paid holidays or paid time off. Management had no fortitude whatsoever."
bad,"Pfizer changed during the time I was there, from 1999 until 2015.  During that time, they had many mergers and layoffs.  At first, it was enjoyable, creative and fun  The culture has become oppressive, hostile and patently uncivilized.  I wish this was a distortion, but it isn't."
bad,"prestataire de service, manque de visions commune, absence d'objectif"
bad,Not a terrible company to work for. I learned a lot and gained experience.
bad,Great learning tools.
bad,demanding and competitive work place with much enphasis on GMP's
bad,"They do not believe in layoff job"
bad,"Pfizer doesn't tell you that you have a series of testing before you are actually put to work and if you don't pass these tests you are terminated, no ifs ands or buts. The tests are difficult and a strain to your eyes. On top of that the union takes dues out of your check before you can complete 90 day trial yet there's no protection or redemption of your money if 90 day trial isn't completed for whatever reason. The rate of pay is excellent if you can hang on in there."
bad,"Pfizer bought my company (Pharmacia) and shut down my facility.  They do this all the time.  Beware, job security is low."
bad,"This short assignment just cover my friend's work. I never do the IT help desk job but I feel easy to work in Pfizer's system. "
bad,Training and preparation for future roles is a great place to work. i reall enjoy my time at Pfizer. Typcial day was very rewarding. My co-worker was such a joy to work and fellowship with.
bad,"Challenged with increasing business growth that resulted in addition shift and team members. Trained to oversee all aspect of manufacturing, documentation and compliance. monitored associates to ensure best practices were being followed and guideline CGMP's were being met. Communication a crossed all levels of associates/ management. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy working as a team. The hardest part of the job is site closure."
good,"badly organized company in Brazil, a poorly organized company in Brazil, not having procedures. People push work for others so they do not have to do it."
good,I did not enjoy my time at this company. I worked as a contract employee where we were treated as second class citizens. It is a money driven company which i understand but at the same time it's important to make your employee's happy and let them know they are appreciated.
good,"At Pfizer, there was always the threat of having your job taken from you.  Layoffs are very typical and whether or not your team was performing, you were always worried."
good,"Depending on where you work at this company, it can be either rewarding or overly demanding.  There are those in any business who demand too much, overtasking employees and not wanting to hear complaints, but there are those who are good people doing great jobs to provide quality products.  There are also those who respond to compliance requests or other tasks with ""I'll get to it when I get to it"".  There are a lot of good people here, but the culture has suffered a significant decline with the loss of great talent, as well as some management who acts belligerently to those who differ to agree even when compliance is on the line.  Nonetheless, perhaps with new talent coming in, it can be restored to greatness, building with those who remain who seek not themselves, but providing the consumer with the best experience possible and looking out for the health of the consumer."
good,"Not a good company to work in - too stressful. Poor educational opportunities, HR was not professional, too much good ol boy culture. Creativity cannot be regulated."
good,Executive leaders were stellar but communication from the top-down became convoluted as it was funneled from senior leaders through middle management.
good,"I was in charge of up to 40 mechanics a day and supervised demand and preventive maintenance. "
good,My review about my work in Dubai Pfizer office as a regulatory affairs strategic. I noticed that Pfizer it self is a strong and professional in other offices but it's not on the same level at Dubai office.
good,Very challenging atmosphere and pushed me harder then the military in some ways.  Great experience.  I loved all the trips I went on with the Company.
good,The environment is not the most fairess. Need to know people from management for you to have benefits in the work place. Having the right equiment for work also is knid of complicated to acquire.
good,"I like my job and co-workers, but due to poor management and the lack of respect from management in my department I'm not happy at my job. There is also a lack of higher management doing anything about the management in our department."
good,"Comes on 6 AM Supported about 20 Countries Users From Gulf On The East To Morocco On The West ."
good,A great place to work at the start and a great team of people to work with sadly over the years most of the great people have left.
good,"Pfizer payed decent for a first job out of college. I got the job through a recruiting company and that's exclusively how they hire in many departments. This prevents you from having any significant benefits and means you are giving up a portion of every check to the company that got you there. The management had gone through many shifts while in my 6 month employment there and the chain of command was obscure at times. The tools there are all very old and make the work unnecessarily tedious. The systems used to log any information are still performed in DOS if you could believe it and they have been ""attempting"" to upgrade their systems for years now with little improvement. Employees will have to perform testing with paper, then input the same information into these systems with miscommunication leading to unstandardized practice. Your coworkers may give you smiles but they will never stand up for you because every reprimanding nd critique feels like the last strike and nobody wants to lose their job. I literally never finished training in my 6 months there. I never had anyone with time to train me and spent about the first 2.5 months just bored out of my mind and pretending to look busy."
good,"Employees get opportunities for development based on their connections, appearances; not by quality or work ethic. All employees are not treated equally in terms of development opportunities and compensation!"
good,"Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Manufacturing; (A.P.I) of products designed to combat cancer. "
good,"Una empresa polarizada, por un lado tiene el beneficio económico, por otro lado te ves inmerso en el estrés exacervado dejando de lado el tiempo de calidad (personal)."
good,"Pfizer was once a terrific company to work for but since about 2000 they have had to acquire other companies to move forward.  As such a large organization I'd like to see innovation rather than just existence.  If you want a temporary place to work, Pfizer may be just right for you."
good,The management was not good at all.  The job had a very unpleasant work environment.  The work was tedious and unstimulating.
good,I would conduct rounds and perform water tests throughout the campus while maintaining steam pressure above 50 psi @ all times. I learned a lot about high pressure boilers and how important our job is when no one else is there such as.. preventing fires/plumbing/electrical/freezing pipes. I only had one co worker and we worked together most of the time considering we were the only two people on the entire campus. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour shifts and being away from my kids and not knowing how long we would be working until someone had purchased the plant. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say was being around a series of  unique/different style building systems all tied in together to operate as one.
good,"Top performer, but overworked. Must play favorites to get ahead.  Room for advancement can get capped very early."
good,Manufacturing life saving drugs is very rewarding. Produce a large portfolio of prescription and animal health products.
good,"Pfizer Meridian manufactures the Epipen a lifesaving drug. As a union colleague we are compensated substantially less than our competitors."
good,"Pfizer is a good company to work for, but the management sucks!!! Benefits are awesome, sick pay, caregiver pay, vacation days are great. The only problem here is the supervisors who dont treat everyone equally."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being expected to meet demands of production while sacrificing time at home with no chance of advancement, pay increase, or respect. A typical day was organizing the floor whether through employees being placed on lines or supplies for the day. The workplace culture when I started was that we were a family and supported one another this way. When I left it was more every person for their self. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing relationships with other employees through training."
good,"Pfizer has a great deal of benefits and good pay. Although most of the colleagues there had no regard for teamwork and or didn't mind slandering your name and the inability to advance in your position was rather discouraging. Personally I felt stuck in terms of opportunities for a promotion and caused a lack of motivation to do more then I had to. Favoritism throughout the warehouse was a factor in this no matter if you worked harder then another person. Every week had the same routine with little work and mostly standing around ""looking busy""."
good,"Nice company to work for, The medicines that this company makes are life saving drugs. The people that you work with work together to form a great team of individuals that work together to get the job done and the batches out the door in a timely manner to the customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is the co-workers.  All three shifts are different.  The hardest part of this job in dealing with the rotating manufacturing schedule.
good,If you are skilled trades this is a great place to work but if you are in production it's terrible. Managers treat you very poorly. You are expected to work tons of over time including your days off. The work schedule is not conducive to having a life at all. Most buildings work at least 7 days in row and some as long as 19 days with 2 days off which you are told by management you should work. If you are a young person maybe it's a great job to make lots of money but for anyone who values their family time this is not the place to work.
good,"Day to day changes within minutes. Never know what the next day will bring. Can be enjoyable and can be stressful in terms of planning. I have learned a lot about assay development as well as my previous role in this company as a sample preparation specialist. Direct management is wonderful but the higher up you go, the more disconnected the managers are from lab which then leads them to make timelines that are very hard to meet and can burn out employees."
good,"The new department head is great, but the middle-management is really bad. There is no work/life balance here and they expect you to be a work slave without giving you training or development opportunities."
good,"culture is negative,leadership espouses team and collaboration but throughout the organization there is no accountability, everyone blames everyone else.  Disappointing."
good,"The work life balance is very good and there is flexibility in the work schedule. It's a good place to get experience in many areas and opportunities to work on projects to expand your knowledge. The office climate can be very political at times and you feel pressure to participate in extra-curricular committees, etc."
good,"I liked almost all of my peers.  A few managers; however, made it miserable to go to work. I few changes, in a few management roles, could have made a huge difference in the work environment."
good,"Trabalhei na empresa em propaganda médica por uns 4 anos."
good,this is the meridian subsidiary. I don't think global Pfizer is like this. it has terrible work life balance and they do not care about their employees.
good,Diverse drug development programs. Lots to learn from a well established company. Can be slow and hard to get things done due to the entrenched multi layered processes.
good,Good company to work for if you ever advance. A lot of supportive peers. Confusing as to what they actually want you to do compared to training that you receive.
good,"PROS"
good,"A typical day consist of ISO Training, emails, and keeping the equipment running. Often the equipment is ran as close to its failure rate as possible to maximize production but at the cost of downtime to the equipment."
good,"Working as a private security officer at Pfizer was a difficult, yet rewarding experience.  Learning to work with computerized door access monitoring computers, and scientific monitoring equipment was a good experience.  Pfizer also provided experience in working in an environment where the security staff was short handed, and had to put in many extra hours."
good,A lot of work to do everyday. Many projects running at the same time with almost the same priority. Good place to enhance your career.
good,The company has great benefits and good products.  It was once a great company with best in class products and had a great name with physicians.
good,"Teams are made up of very capable driven motivated individuals.  This is a large corporation with a large corporate feel, with few apologies being made for being that way!  "
good,"Worked in a very competitive environment, when the company started losing profits extreme cuts were made and caused much tension among coworkers."
good,"Wyeth Biotech in Sanford, NC was not one of the better places I've ever worked. The management there seemed more intent on being in charge than they did working toward a cohesive environment. Too many ego issues amongst the middle management. Not enough room for advancement. Average cost of living increase was not even par with the rate of inflation."
good,The company has a lot of delegators and few worker bees who are the reliable ones to get the job done.   The company is good and would be better if the culture shifted a bit away from having silos.
good,During my tenure I watched as talented people were overlooked and forced to leave this static organization and move on to success far away from Pfizer.
good,"Set schedule..no weekends "
good,My day started very early to prepare for the morning meetings. I learned safety procedures and strict guidelines for a medical giant. The culture was in the beginning stages of equal rights and females in power.  The hardest part was getting all needed signature to complete my task.  The best part was the people and the proximity to my home at the time.
good,Only thing is that the managers doesnt accept straight talk in some cases.some times its hard to be heard. The company is always in process of selling their divisions.
good,"Good company, poor management. Tasks are not incredibly difficult, salary is competitive, good benefits and time off. Management is poor and human resources acts as part of management chain instead of an objective separate entity."
good,"consistent work flow"
good,"Management . was not good . Was hired for  Pfizer , but had to cover for other companies . Manager kept adding more jobs . Came in during a snow storm and they tried tried to keep me longer than I agreed on."
good,"Very busy in production areas, can get bogged down with meetings.  Having anything other than an engineering or chemistry degree will lock you into minimal available positions."
good,so many structural changes are done  in our company to the extent that people do not care to learn how to adapt and why it happened. this will eventually lead to loss of commitment and engagement.
good,"The process, give me more knowledge in the industry."
good,"Belittled by management "
good,Pfizer quality leadership in contract quality are bunch of men who should not lead nor should they work with women.  There is one Director from CollegeVill PA ( legacy Wyeth) has been harassing other female employees in the past and it was reported to his manager and her manager but no action.
good,"A typical day consisted of arriving at work to discover an equipment failure had occurred on the previous shift.  Because it is a sterile manufacturing facility, production would be delayed for two or three hours due to re-sanitizing dwell time requirements.  Consistent failures led to days upon which shifts were sent home due to lack of work.  At the time of my departure, many people were pursuing jobs with other companies for fear the plant would shut down within a few months."
good,Pfizer has gone through a lot of change over the years due to constant restructuring resulting from the numerous acquisitions. As a result the culture has changed drastically and not necessarily for the better.
good,"I had a lot of respect for most of the workers that I dealt with.  Prior to Pfizer buying Hospira, the Hospira culture seemed to lack a teamwork mentality."
good,"Your work ethic isn't nearly as important as how well you get along with the cliques that exist in the various locations of the corporation.  If you're a good 'Yes' man and have no personal morals, Pfizer may be a good fit."
good,"Workplace culture is poor due to example of site management to place blame and punish."
good,jai fait la préparation de commande et le dechargement et chargements des colis et materiel pharmaceutique dans des box pour ramené dans une entreprise
good,"Lack of formal on the job training.The role is challenging,enjoyable but unfortunately not all the duties one is employed to do have been utilised. The culture is hostile due to people or management.Work life balance is none existent."
good,"Es una excelente empresa, con muy buenas iniciativas para q los empleados estén tranquilos trabajando y con ganas de estar ahí, pero en particular la directora q me toco a mí va muy diferente con lo q la empresa es."
good,Additional room for improvement severely needed. Packages are fair based on merits and bonuses. Management not in touch with contractors versus employees.
good,Over all good learning experience. Freedom to work and innovative. However career growth or trajectory of individual s have to be focussed on for better productivity
good,Typical day included sourcing & applicant management along with hiring manger calls & interviews.  HEAVY TURNOVER in my direct management line.  Culture seems forced though people do get along well with one another.  Co-workers are very nice.  Dealing with the disorganization & lack of structure was brutal.
good,"Good company, but will let you go. Great culture and benefits  offer pet insurance! All about getting along with DM. Long application process"
good,"Loved my job but management could care less about what you had going on in your life.  If they needed you, you had better be available.  Way too much stress.  We were not able to bid out of our unit and they were bring in people off the street to fill the jobs that we were trying to apply for.  People were starting to get frustrated.  Just not getting any support from people above us."
good,"Pfizer is now a marketing company, not a science one. The research, design, and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is no longer a priority. This started with Pfizer's acquisition of King Pharmaceutical, and has only accelerated in recent years with the merger with Wyeth and others. I'm sure the sales and marketing guys are doing well, but scientists should be wary of the place. "
good,"Empresa en la que aprendes mucho, tanto a consecución de objetivos, como formación laboral."
good,"Really enjoy working at Pfizer.  I learned a lot about QA and experienced many pros, however the hours were often very long and weekend work was often expected and required."
good,"I worked for Wyeth and advanced in title and salary because of the successful completion of numerous very difficult assignments.  Wyeth was taken over by Pfizer and my site was immediately reduced in size by one-half.  There were ongoing reductions, which continue to this day.  I was well compensated but the ongoing work situation was very difficult because of the merger of the two companies.  I chose early retirement because of health issues with my knees and because of potential changes in my retirement/health care packages."
good,"Visitaba las farmacias, ofreciéndoles el producto que representaba y en ocasiones salia con los vendedores de la distribuidora."
good,"Since the position was a ""contract"" position, I was often excluded from most of the company's benefits and activities. However, the company was determined to have all of its employees fulled trained and the management staff ws always available to address questions and concerns."
good,"Pfizer is the school where I've learned sales and marketing in real life."
good,"Once Pfizer acquired Wyeth, the workplace was very disruptive"
good,"Due to acquisition from Wyeth, a lot have lots their jobs and one of the plants is closing down which resulted in lost of close to 3,000 jobs/personnel.  Low morale and decisions keep changing."
good,Mas nao gostei da autonomia que o Gestor teve em decidir sobre decisões tão sérias sem ter que compartilhar com um superior.
good,loved working with customers for mutual gain and the fun with colleagues
good,"Responsibility, work under pressure, teamwork, packing area was the stronger."
good,"Buen lugar para laborar, pero hay muchos intereses de por medio."
good,"Typical sales job"
good,"Good company to work for, relatively agile despite its enormous size. Many active locations and job roles, very large drug portfolio. Constantly in reorganization, thus reducing job security."
good,"I enjoyed working in Pfizer and was able to expand my skill sets."
good,"Not very innovative in terms of putting its employees in positions to be successful; Organization tends to go through a lot of reorganizations and restructurings, always for the pursuit of efficiencies and being leaner - it never seems to accomplish what I believe they wish to accomplish with the restructurings."
good,"being on production, and having to work extremely fast throughout the day. stand up in long meetings every morning with out sitting in the meeting. Being forced to stretch every day before your shift and it still not knowing if you are going to gett injured lifting heavy cases."
good,"Down-sizing  was a normal practice at Pfizer, especially once you hit 50 you had a bulls-eye on your back. Sad, but true! Great company to work for until you hit that number......"
good,"Leads are good since supervisors werent too bad but also seemed to depend who you were in there.  After 11 months as a temp was told by a senior manager he refused to hire me for some lame excuse which was pretty typical of the senior management in the facility. "
good,Management is big pharma focused.  Eucrisa is a very hard drug to sell and was a huge mistake for Pfizer to purchase.  Compensation is average/good .....
good,"I don't have any negative feedback to give about my experience working at Pfizer. I learned to work as a team, follow instructions accordingly and show great support to those that need it most. My only concern is the opportunity to move forward and excel within the skills I have developed through my experience in technical work."
good,Good job for the most part but it could be better as far as advancement and pay goes.  I really enjoy working here and the atmosphere is nice.  I do feel some things could be a little different.
good,"No set schedules didn't know until the week before when you would be working the next week. Sometimes as early as 3:30am - 9:00am and would change everyday. Example Monday 4:00am, Tues 7:00am, Wed 5:00am, Thursday 8:00am"
good,"Os processos não sao claros, as ferramentas não sao suficientes para os processos.  As pessoas não conhecem os processos.  "
good,"pros: in general it is a good place to work, it has the facilities and the necessary technology to carry out a quality operation, the payment is relatively fair in comparison with other pharmaceutical factories., cons: there is a large area of opportunity in which refers to the communication between the work employees and the leadership group"
good,"Pfizer, is a very good place to learn and develop yourself and your capabilities  and to get familiar on how can you be a professional in the area/ task you are responsible for."
good,"Pfizer is a good place if you want to develop a career in the pharma business, one of the top 5 companies worldwide."
good,"The pay is good, the benefits are great. The Management is horrible, they are not willing to listen to employees, only concerned about the stock holders."
good,"I am not sure why they hired me.  I was not given any work in my field, but was just hired to back up one particular person when they went on vacation.  I tried very hard to get more interesting work, but to no avail."
good,"If you are a full-time employee, there are generous benefits and perks that are generally not available to contractors. Lack of communication between management and part-time employees, who are not privy to what is discussed in team meetings."
good,The management is not performed for the past few years and not has good working atmosphere in the company .New products launched all are not done well
good,Overall a good place to be and recommend to anyone.  Excellent managers to work with and lots of opportunity and growth.  Distance to site  was an issue and no opportunity to work remote
good,"as the manager and clinical supervisor over 30 pharmacists, my role was to assure PFIZER, INC that our team was following Pfizer Policies and Procedures and reported back to the Pfizer headquarters daily/weekly quotas."
good,"The job itself was fine but there was little room for advancement within the path department and management needed to be changed up and improved."
good,great opportunity to gain more knowledge about GMP and how a pharmaceutical plant works. there is a sense of accomplishment when knowing that the company helps to produce medicines to aid in healing patents.
good,"In the med. Rep. job all day is tipical "
good,"Trabalho 12 anos na Pfizer, e nesse período pude me desenvolver profissionalmente e pessoalmente."
good,"Great job and company; bad management.  Nice that vaccines were developed to help babies.  Too much favoritism from supervisors which decreased advancement opportunities, no help from upper management."
good,"Typical day of work: As I got into the elevator I started greeting all my colleagues, had to check on all the Conference Rooms doors for door signs of previous meetings and take them out.  Verify the cleanliness of each room for the day meetings.  Put new signs for the day meetings. Got into my office and approximately at 8:30 am I had phone calls asking for service. Started to do work that was left at my office door on sticky notes by Director and Training Managers and other colleagues. Revise e-mails for Company notifications and other matters.  Continue to do undo work from day before, help everyone, receive phone calls, set up the Conference Rooms Satellite system if the Information Technology was not available, all sorts of duties."
good,I was not a permanent employee of the coming.  I just did my work.  Reported back to the temporary agency.
good,Top Management needs to think out of box to sustain legacy of Pfizer and badly needs to revisit compensation & benefits area to retain potential talent.
good,Uma grande industria farmacêutica que da oportunidades para o crescimento profissional dos seus colaboradores
good,"Great co-workers.  Definite burnout due to leadership.  Its not how good you are, it is how well you know the senior management."
good,Must be able to manage your time.  Accept change.  This is a very high level competitive company.
good,"Anegociação com o cliente era a parte maism motivante e estimulante, mas aturar chefes que de chefes pouco mais tinham do que policias e que por sua vez não estavam para ajudar a que a pessoa não caisse mas sim para poder ser os primeiros a apontar a queda é de fato no minimo desmotivante, tenho tanta razão como aquando da fusão co a pharmacia da pfizer acabou por não ficar ninguem tamanha era a falta de visão desses pessimos colaboradores para a organização. Mas não tenham duvidas que eu sei qual é o elo mais fraco..."
good,Management in the Branding and Marketing department was nice and the environment was non-stressful.
good,"As an environment that you can make the most of as an autodidactic and self-driven individual, Pfizer does tend to provide the opportunities to utilize resources in order to better enable oneself to gain both a great breadth and depth of technical expertise as it relates to the pharmaceutical industry. In terms of culture and the understanding of the differences between leadership and management, it is plagued by a lot of residual cronyism and buzzword innovation instead of meritocracy and the embrace of groundbreaking improvements. Navigating political waters is a corporate way of life anywhere, but when the politics supersede the science and stretch the limits of ethical behavior, it is wise to learn what one can and then move on to embrace new horizons."
good,"At Pfizer (at least the branch I worked at, Charles City, Iowa) you are rewarded with paid vacation, sick days, and personal days right away depending on what quarter of the year you are in when you start. It is hard to find anywhere that offers all that time off! The yearly salary is also very nice. Unfortunately, the work environment isn't so great. The production building has no windows and no color, but part of the reason for that is to keep the environment clean. Start time is the same every day, but there is no telling when you will be able to go home. An 8 hour shift can turn into a 12 hour shift with no advanced warning. The worst part of working at Pfizer is the people you have to work for or with. There is a large amount of gossip and disrespect - even from the managers. Maybe it is because the Charles City branch is located in a small town, but I was apalled when I heard my supervisor participating in the gossip of one of my coworkers. That is not very admirable and it sets a horrible example! The cat fights and gossip fests are a daily, and very public occurence. Most people work and stay there for the compensation and benefits, but if there are other opportunities available I would stay clear!"
good,"not any great opportunity for advancement"
good,"Productive, ok workplace,laughter. Change alot over the last five years, a lot activities have left, mostly now is focusing on work, accurracy and errors throughout the day."
good,"Typical day at work entails making a liquid injectable. I learned how to make a lot of different products and work with different instruments. I did not like the management. co-workers were awesome, easy going people. The hardest part of the job was the start of the day, setting up to make the actual products. The most enjoyable part of the day was filtering of the products, you were able to sit down."
good,"It is the big one. Change was a constant, but then that seems to be what pharma/biotech is all about now."
good,Chance of growth at my level are not visible. I had joined this company in 2002 but now not satisfied as financially & growth opportunities are limited & my point of view is not asked before implementing even some strategic action.
good,"The pay and benefits, while not as spectacular as in years past, are still nearly unbeatable for this area. However, regardless of what the HR marketing department spins, employees required to give up independent thought and creativity for that paycheck."
good,Field Sales
good,"Plan work day, typically about 3 full details (seeing doctors and entering call in the computer) in the morning.....pick up lunch for a lunch and learn.....discuss pertinent information with doctors.....enter calls.. do 2 full detail calls with docs and two pharmacy calls.....enter calls in the computer record odometer reading and expense report for the day.....plan for the rest of the week"
good,I enjoyed working with the people. The company has it's obligations to it's share holders and no one else.
good,pfizer is a global organization have good reputation in national as well as international pharma market.one thing which i learned from this company that is leg work and how to manage the things with limits and rules. the hardest part of this job is to handle other service provider companies.and enjoyeble part is that you are free to do your job in any time in a day this flexibility of timings are most enjoyeble part of this job.but i want to share the drawback of this organization
good,The bonus is one of the best I've seen in the industry. Lots of reorganizations and little stability.
good,"Working at Pfizer, Groton, Ct Powerhouise was interesting. Supporting the Research side of the business can get tedious when the Research side of the business looks down their noses at you and you and your fellow workers are a constant target for ""downsizing""."
good,we are always busy and not enough guidance is available as people keep leaving the company. The workers have no spirit whatsoever. No one has a clear picture on where this company will be in the future.
good,"Manager expects you to know exactly who/where/how to make contacts within company on your own front he get go without direction. Projects are new, innovative, and fun to work on. Only bad experience is with a specific manager."
good,"My job was outsourced for approximately 6 months then brought back to the US in Texas not back to NJ. Everything worked out for the best. Now it is part of my resume history and experiences, of which I am grateful."
good,No interview the job wasn't continued as they didn't like my fork lift skills. I was told my position wasn't extended or that their was any problem. I was never late and always stayed as needed. Upper level manager never spoke to me as why position wasn't extended. They didn't tell the temp service either. At least not that I was told.
good,"The job is boring and demanding with low pay. "
good,Good company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Good people to work with. You can have a good balance of work and family time. Must be a team player or you will fail. Management is the biggest problem here though. Care more about the company than the workers.
good,Friendly people and many people willing to help in the beginning of starting the new job.  It a Good place to work for and they provide high Tech equipment and updated software.
good,"Pfizer is a great place to work in general. It's very collaborative, team is supportive, and the work is challenging and fast-paced. Co-workers are very professional, friendly, intelligent, and highly educated. It was a pleasure working there. There are some drawbacks. As a contractor, you are definitely a second-class citizen. It's annoying, but it's the culture, so it's not really personal. The other difficulty is that IT is not the primary business of the company, so does not have modern software lifecycle processes or IT project managers who hold degrees in systems development. It can be hard to do innovative work at times."
good,This is one of the easiest jobs ever. It does not require hard labor. Pay could be better and management could be better as well. In my opinion there is a lot of pettiness and favoritism.
good,"New experience to work , helpful people, developing skills, good platform to develop career and network. Learned a lot of techniques and skills. Overall a good experience."
good,There were some interesting tecnical challenges.  My co-workers were excellent and helpful.  This was one of the things that caused me to stay on contract hwre for 5 years.
good,"Strict HR policies and the higher management is good to work with but coming to my immediate supervisor, I do not prefer working with him again."
good,"Office management is out of touch with the production staff. the supervisors on the floor don't know enough about what is going on to do a good job."
good,"Great place to work with great colleagues while we were Wyeth.   Different culture with the change to Pfizer. No job security, work shifted to other sites."
good,"Worked on both sides- consumer has awful management and morale. "
good,"I started my employment in 1999. The company at the time was Genetics Institute. When Pfizer bought the company, the entire atmosphere changed. In 2016 Pfizer outsourced the Electrical, HVAC, and the boiler plant technicians. From that time on, the work environment just became stressful."
good,La cultura de la compañía es excelente en términos de iniciativa y desarrollo de la gente. Es importante remarcar que los continuos cambios de modelo de negocio en general hacen que no sea muy fácil su implementación.
good,"Highly Stressful and poorly managed. Bad culture. Typical workday in my position was arriving at work, changing into cnc clothing and either doing rebuilds, or performing pm work orders."
good,"Good company that underwent to many take over and subsequently had to downsize and laid off thousands of people.  Good job, challenging work.  Hardest part of the job was not knowing if you were going to have a job tomorrow."
good,Contract worker that worked on everything that was needed even beyond what was asked of me. Was supposed to be QC and Data Entry.  Created Databases and Excel sheets to help optimize formulas and spreadsheets.
good,"The people at Pfizer are mostly very good with a few exceptions."
good,"Good Company, "
good,"Pfizer keeps the work life of colleagues and contractors totally separate.  There are alot of lunches, souvenirs, perks available to colleagues, but withheld from contractors."
good,I have been part of multiple medicines that been approved by the FDA and are now part of children's vaccine schedules. To have been a part of the process for making a life saving vaccines has been amazing!
good,"The people who worked there are pleasant, but there's not much career support from managers. Day to day was very mundane, and managers did not endorse or pursue change in technology or culture."
good,"Very unstructured training; disorganized and inconsistent directives given by manager impeded progress toward meeting deadlines and attaining  goals; manager was ill-informed regarding process steps inherent to job duties assigned; manager sometimes condescending and derogatory in providing feedback."
good,A good place to work for a technician. Advancement of career is much more challenging. Long term worker for Thermo Fisher Scientific. A very good company subcontracted.
good,"Great benefits but definitely has limited opportunities to grow in your career.  Perfect for entry levels though!"
good,It's a job to help pay your bills and take care of your family. I can't complain as far as money but the overall job is a easy job. I can't complain about the work or the money.
good,"Excellent scientists in the team and department."
good,"Terrible management"
good,"Pfizer is a place that was (is) continually changing, but not necessarily for the better, more to chase the rainbow.  The company does have deep resources to attract and develop talent, and the number of high level pharma executives who came from Pfizer is noteworthy.  Unfortunately, Pfizer's best leaders have long since departed and whether the momentum from years ago will keep the wheels turning remains to be seen."
good,"Es una empresa que ofrece buenos beneficios, como salir los viernes al medio día, poder trabajar 1 día desde la casa, cuenta con un buen seguro medico y póliza de vida. Al ser regida por FCPA, cuenta con procesos muy rígidos que llegan a ser extremadamente burocráticos entre las diferentes unidades interdisciplinarias. Lo mas difícil es poder trabajar con personas que no cuentan con la mejor inteligencia emocional y que se enfocan solamente en su negocio y no en la empresa como un todo.Lo que mas me gusto fue trabajar para una empresa que busca salud para la humanidad."
good,"Pfizer is the world's renowned pharmaceutical company,  work culture, and growth opportunities are very good at Pfizer but the salary for on field work force is less satisfactory."
good,"Pfizer was my first job in the Pharma industry and I learned a great deal.  I just came from the Financial Services sector and worked the Sr. IT Auditor / Security and Compliance Specialist."
good,"Great area personel to work with great site but they didnt offer regular employment to IT Personel, great group to work with in the IT Support team and a great supervisor Miguel NIeves"
good,"Good compensation, poor management."
good,i have been working for almost 2 and half years in pfizer health care pvt ltd as production officer. iam dealing with packing department were we will daily packing a batch. in our company we are preparing piperacilli and tazobactam medicine. and also i know about autoclave area and also filling
good,"good company to work for lots of great people, They have a lot of drugs going LOE very soon only issue. They need to work on getting "
good,"Es una empresa multinacional, reconocida en el rubro farmacéutico, por contar con una gran cantidad de productos de investigación y desarrollo, que esta constantemente en la búsqueda de nuevas medicinas que ayuden a pacientes a combatir enfermedades cada vez más específicas."
good,Spændende arbejdsplads med mange udfordringer og muligheder
good,productive is the perfect word for pfizer its a productive place to work   given how its a production site its the perfect word for it.
good,"I enjoyed working there even though I was a temporary employee.  I enjoyed my co-workers and got along with most of my department.  Some of the lines ran fast other lines ran slow.  I learned how to write up a PID board and we also did weekly and monthly cleaning. Management was alright at time.  We rotated from the pack off area, which was the outside to the washer area, which was the inside.  We also roatated in these two area.  One of the production operator will watch the washer while the other one would go in the filler and help set up bottles.  On the outside one would take the parts off the conveyor belt and the other operator would put it on the pallet.  I really enjoyed working with my co=workers because we had great teamwork."
good,"E uma ótima empresa para trabalhar."
good,There is no job security or job advancement. Company offers good benefits but very difficult to withstand frequent layoffs or changes.
good,"an ok company, turnover is way to high. Need a bigger facility to accomplish the amount of work they are trying to do.  Also need more employees on each shift."
good,"I am responsible for the building maintenance activities for the NJ Pfizer sites for maintaining their assets, including job plans, and new equipment entered in a CMMS. My current function is acting as an associate engineer within a reliability group. The hardest part of my day is working as a contracted resource, instead as being an employee with in a company. I enjoy maintaining equipment as well as creating a good work environment for the techs and mechanics."
good,"Management is good .There is a culture of respect , integrity and owning the job .There is always encouraged as supporting each others and avoid any discrimination and harassments"
good,I work at night which is very tuff. The work is interesting and not overly demanding. You are required to work a lot of holidays and weekends. You get a nice amount of vacation days which helps and the benefits are pretty good. If I could work days I would be happy to stay.
good,"everyone is out for themselves, little interest in others, run too much like a CPA firm."
good,"Working at Pfizer was high paced and had tight deadlines.  The work environment was stressful, yet productive.  The campus spanned acres and was well maintained."
good,"Being thoroughly prepared for customer calls with excellent product knowledge, market and disease-state knowledge and current tactics"
good,"I am a Clinical Research professional who has worked in different positions within the clinical spectrum, both as contractual and full time. Currently I am working in Europe and Africa to obtain specific study management experience with European project teams, the EU Directive and ICH, while still retaining 2 US sites. "
good,"a typical day starts at 9 am   .. first we do a market survey in the hospital pharmacies & nearby pharmacies ... then we start meeting the doctors .  promote our products to them as per their prescription habits we identified from the pharmacies ...  works goes till 1 pm .. then till 3.30 is off ....... from 3.30 -4.30 is the reporting time in the office after that again evening calls tiill 7.30 pm"
good,I learned a tremendous amount about corporate America from this company.
good,Good company to work for - very busy with great people and atmosphere.
good,"No communication with superiors."
good,"Pfizer es una buena emprea para aprender y crecer, puedes tener a tu mejor amigo, y existen diferentes oportunidades de desarrollo, sin embargo los cambio son a muy corto plazo, por lo que los procesos requieren de mayor tiempo para que puedan ser estables."
good,"plant work"
good,"""quick and dirty"" review of files.  Good grunt work.  Management is disorganized and out of touch"
good,"job changing since EB took over and taking our duties away"
good,"If it takes 15 years to discover a new drug, would reorganization of the research organization every year make strategic sense? I think not."
good,The responsibilities keep piling up at the same low pay. Pay raise and bonus was abysmal. Very high turnover and apathy amongst employees. No proven leadership. Stressful work environment. Good benefits package and 401K match up to 5%.
good,A typical day at work for me involves interacting with plan participants and managing projects. I have developed leadership and project management skills. My co-workers are are friendly and dedicated to the team's success.The hardest part of my job is the lack of opportunity for career advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a project is completed and the implementation was a success because of my leadership.
good,Pfizer is a place that cares about giving back. We were able to invest in 1 day per year to volunteer our time to any charity. We worked at the local food-bank. It was an eye-opening experience. Thank you Pfizer for your dedication to giving.
good,Constant reorganization lowers morale. Professional development opportunities lacking.
good,It has a wide variety of experts. Access to cutting edge technologies. Limited career move within the ranks. too much politics and favoritism.
good,"There are definitely opportunities to learn new things (switch jobs, talk with a wide array of people in varying functions, etc.) and the work was often rewarding."
good,"I started with Pfizer on 1999 it was great environment to work with, the people were great filled like a family to me. Then I moved to the headquarter, it was like two different companies. You constantly has to watch over your shoulder because of job security people are being very protective, put others down for them to look good. It was a messed and getting worse"
good,• Perform all PM's on Air Handlers.
good,"There’s a lot of good with the company but the detractors out weight the good. Flex hours and work life balance was good but the dishonesty, lack of loyalty, and management's own personal interest take away from the positivity significantly. It’s really a culture of actions speak louder than words and unfortunately the actions are usually undermining the words."
good,"The company has great benefits.  They provide generous vacation and sick time.  However, for which much is given, much is asked in return.  There is very poor work/life balance."
good,It was a very grueling and Repetitive job. 6 days a week and usually 12 hour shifts. Was suppose to be 4 days a week but didn’t work out that way. They did try to rotate days off. People there did get along and worked together.
good,During the first 8 years of my career the company and culture was amazing. Then they started to change the culture and drastic changes in management year after year convert this company in a year by year job security. At the end it was so stressful to work in that environment
good,QC department is not a good work environment. Company has good benefits and salary. Retaliation is real when you are not part of status quo. Many employees have only worked there so closed mindset and feel threatened by newcomers. Its a high school playground. Venture out into other departments and leave QC for the ones just passing through and closed minded to fit in.
good,No hay las mismas oportunidades de crecimiento  para todos y la mayoría de los gerentes no saben liderear a sus equipos ellos solo quieren su bienestar y conservar su trabajo
good,"Poder ascender en Pfizer es imposible. Es mas valorado una persona que recién ingresa sin titulo, a una persona que tiene tiempo en la compañía. Tiene buenos beneficios (comedor en planta, buena obra social). Algunos jefes no son buenos, inclusive te maltratan. Recursos humanos poco eficiente. Ambiente toxico. Mucha rotación de personal. Sueldo bajo con respecto a otras empresas del mismo rubro."
good,"Pfizer is a great place to get growth opportunities by being exposed to different business areas and enroll in continuous education since the organization promotes and supports professional development.  Benefits had slightly diminished in the latest years, for example, pension plans are not longer offered for new hired employees."
good,I prefer to do this later for obvious reasons. The future of my career is on the line. I am sure you guys will understand my position at this particular time.
good,Many changes over 30 years that I worked at Groton. Pay was great for the area. Bonus program changes over the years improved but final change was to take 20% of salary away and force you to earn it back as a bonus
good,the hardest part about the job is to manage the legacy of pfizer patiented brands and maintaining the sales record with no decline in sales every month
good,"I was let go due to failure to following company policy, witch I was unaware of.I had informed my supervisor about a norther worker  falsifying documents, and then I had informed other people that I worked with, so they would be able keep there eye on that person,then management brought me in told me thanks for letting them know, but they were letting me go because of me violating  company policy. This is bad working policy, I know if someone is not doing there Job, I want to know, so I can keep a eye on them!!"
good,"Pfizer was efficiently, and professionally run. The management, from an efficiency standpoint, was second to none. This includes a production-line division of experiments as well as DOE-informed, comprehensive automotive screening. "
good,"Varias posiciones: "
good,It was a good place to work. The work was easy but the system was not so great at the time I worked there. The people was very nice and patient. It was an experience.
good,"A empresa apresenta salário razoável e benefícios bons, porém deixa a desejar quando se busca crescimento profissional e promoções. A empresa não oferece treinamentos muito efetivos para seus funcionários."
good,challenging and fun place to work.  If you like to work hard and work well in a team this is a great place to start.  Pfizer hires only the best.  Pfizer has great leadership...
good,"Overall, my internships at Pfizer were useful for my growth as a new engineer entering the work place. "
good,It is a good place to work with a lot of opportunities to learn and develop and advance throughout the organization. There is a lot of flexibility with work/life balance.
good,"It is a good school.  It will test your ability and question what you think you know, specially how decisions are made.  The company leans traditional in mindset and is resists bottom up change.  You will have a say but you need to seek support from power structures to have a meaningful impact."
good,"Excellent drug discovery company.  Fast pace work environment with great resources and people.  Work in Cambridge is in an open space environment- no offices, no privacy."
good,"Bons moments passés dans cette entreprise."
good,Job security varied from year to year and multiple management changes occurred. The benefit package was the best in the industry however company pipeline was very weak when I was there.
good,Plant is not so bad as long as people from the area dont  in the higher managemnt. They dont let anyone educated or higher than their qualifications to take better positions.
good,"veel mensen voor dezelfde job"
good,"Work at Pfizer Consumer Healthcare was good. I enjoyed the people the most as everyone was approachable and friendly. I learned various skills and industry knowledge including internal audits and system processes. Management, at time, was lacking, but were always willing to learn and grow. Hardest part of the job was getting caught in a monotony spell if you didn't actively participate in work culture. It was also unfortunate that during my time there, production came before employees and occasionally their safety. There were many mixed messages of maintaining safety and but also keeping a high workload (cause for increased stress/error). Quality also took a minor hit due to such a high increase in workload."
good,"My time at Pfizer was during the time that Warner Lambert was acquired. Prior to this it was a great place to work, people had great relationships both professionally and personally. Unfortunately once Pfizer decided to implement its culture, it involved more contract employees and fewer full time ones. It was a shame to see a healthy company go through so much drastic change in a short amount of time."
good,Het is er heel fijn en leuk werken. Maar de kans op een vaste job is nihil. Ofwel moeten ze jou ofwel niet.. sommigen mogen en kunnen alles en onder de interims is er veel geruzie en jaloezie.
good,"Has a lot of opportunities available within the plant. Great culture and colleague. Management is good as well. May be hard to begin with how the schedule works, but it open a lot of opportunities."
good,Management changes so much and drastically.  Hard to stay motivated when change is so prevalent.  Not sure who is leading and what the vision is when things aren't consistent within management.
good,"Worked here as a temporary worker. I was force to find a new job within the first month because the site was closing. Overall, I enjoyed working at the site with the people I worked directly with. Many employees were lazy and disrespectful. Temporary workers were not respected the same as permanent employees. Even though, I performed more task at times than permanent employees."
good,Non mi sono trovata particolarmente bene con I colleghi poco disposti ad insegnare e sei sempre l ultimo arrivato molto dittatoriale
good,"•	Engage pharmacists, pharmacy managers and HCP’s on the importance of vaccinating their patients"
good,"Great team, sociable, flexible, concerned about quality work"
good,"Culture was a bit cutthroat for my taste.  Culture narrow focused, lack of innovation.  Acquire and fire mentality.  lost many talented people.  Rigid work style with little room for creative process."
good,"good working place, you'll meet people from all cultures, also the work is not hard but steady. you experience the joy of doing something that save lives everyday"
good,Our site was an extremely great place to work until the current site leader. After he came the moral dropped significantly and he caused several people to leave the company before they really wanted to.
good,"Management played favorites, and did not like to listen to employees."
good,"Working as an investigator for the Biotechnology division really cut into work life balance. I worked at home and at work. The investigations were VERY detailed and the deadlines were so critical since we supported the team that manufactured the starting compound for the Prevnar vaccine. Because of the nature of the investigations process, I learned a lot about various sections of the pharmaceutical industry. One thing about working as a Quality investigator is that you never know where the investigation will lead you. One thing work was not and that is dull!"
good,Pfizer has a great mission and by and large the people working there are dedicated to helping patients live better and longer lives.  But the IT area takes the brunt of the job hits and because of that tends to look and act only one year out it is very hard to secure planning and resources for multi year projects and the nearly yearly job cuts take a toll on overall strategy development and morale.
good,The area is great to work at and its a very nice facility. Cafeteria food is good and reasonably priced. Almost all employees and staff are real nice and helpful.
good,"dirty environment, lots of chemicals, stress, poor train staff, lacked in safety sometimes.  Fast moving, long hours, bad schedule, management didn't see everything."
good,"Pfizer is a great place to work only if you are a colleague, if not I would not refer anyone to Pfizer. They lack team players in their company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the food."
good,"Great Opportunity for growth in an entry level quality role. Pay is OK and people are nice. Overall good work culture."
good,"I learned different kinds of Laboratory Techniques in a ""GMP"" way.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can manage my time doing role card testing."
good,"It is a good job. I learn new things. The management are good people. Manufacturing is a hard phisical jod, so you get tired. The thing is that the mayority of employee are temporary and there is no job security."
good,This company was where in I had my lot of learning and initial trading which was really class apart and till date I cherish those memories of my training and colleagues who really mentored me for my future.
good,"Job security is very poor due to constant ""restructurings.""  Performance and position are no guarantee.  Very political, very bureaucratic environment.  Pays well and most managers are pretty reasonable people."
good,Un bon employeur. Beau potentiel d'ouvrage avec des produits varié .
good,"Unfortunately many of my colleagues had much better benefits, compensation and job security before Pfizer bought out their company.  This resulted in a general toxic environment as they often compared their current situation with their previous one."
good,There was too much of work politics and you was not appreciated for your hard work. But I am still grateful for the experience.
good,"azienda leader nel settore , ottima struttura anche se scomoda da raggiungere"
good,"Sometime we had easy days and other days were not so easy. I've learned to just be patient and just do the job as it is presented. Management was somewhat far. The co-workers was fun to work with at times. The hardest part about the job was when something happened you had to know what to do, but as time went by all the things that happened was second nature. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning how different things work and how to fix them."
good,"Lots of meetings tons of communication"
good,"16 years, multiple departments and disciplines, serves in several roles of varying responsibilities. Solid co-workers and great colleagues. Very high expectations, very productive organization. Does not always respect work/life balance."
good,"it was a nice experience worki9ng in this organisation. working as a team and learning new things which i have not known before was really good for me. work schedule was really very hard but i got used to it."
good,"Like any large pharma company, there is a lot of process and hierarchy.  Many good people, but some that are full of themselves.  If you want large pharma experience, you will get it here."
good,"primary care, I love what I do but I was limited by a micro manager. I have of relationships in the market that I was told do not talk to. It wasn't my area."
good,"worked as operations intern, supporting the supply chain and operations department in processing the order and preparing the documentation required for the same."
good,Value of right first time every time in a very fast passed environment. Global supply meeting tight shipping deadlines all the time ensuring product integrity.
good,"Una azienda dove sei un numero che deve produrre. lo stipendio era alto,la competizione tra colleghi era di vitale importanza."
good,"Most of the upper management is fine, there are a couple of directors who micromanage. In general, most people like working here, and the job is always changing."
good,Scientific career that is challenging and rewarding.  Coworkers excellent; great collaborative culture.  My manager was encouraging & interested in developing my career.  An excellent person to work for.  Management above my direct manager was toxic.  If not laid off people found work else where.  Too bad because Pfizer was an otherwise OK company to work for.
good,Pfizer is a good company. Their culture continues to evolve. I have learned to work with an host of HCPs and their staff. My co-workers are very talented sales professionals and we collectively reach team goals.The challenging part of my job is driving our business through a changing healthcare payer system. Maximizing pull-through is imperative for success. The most enjoyable part of my job is partnering with various medical practices to help them provide life saving vaccines to their patients.
good,"friendly co workers, no room for growth in my department"
good,"Constantly restructuring so it is hard to manage a career or get momentum.I appreciate what Pfizer has provided me thus far, but since they are re-centralizing to NYC it is hard to stay."
good,"The customer, community is very nice. Owner it is creepy. Working under to much presser and risky job. It is limited benefit."
good,"I'd like to work from home."
good,"morning is very typical time at work for me.lot of thing i learn in organization like time management,punctuality,coordination management was good.co workers are good.not on target is hardest part of job.on target is enjoyable.i .enjoy lot while working in such company"
good,"Long Days with self structured schedule. Highly competitive with proper training and qualified resources available."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  However, lack of advancement opportinities requires moving on in order to advance your career."
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, muita informação e trabalho de suporte em TI."
good,"Its an amazing organisation to work at, very dynamic with reputed image in the pharma market, not only in Pakistan but all over the World. My co workers were very co operative. During my tenure of work in Pfizer, I had 3 different bosses, all with different personalities. But overall experience of mine at Pfizer is unforgettable."
good,"Great place to work while it lasted. This site opened in 1906 & employed many generations of families. Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009. In 2010 we were told all our jobs were being outsourced and the entire plant, besides a small group in animal research, would be layed-off. Massive lay-offs since 2009 until the site is closed around 2015."
good,Pfizer/Zoetis is a highly demanding work place which creates many opportunities for a rewarding sense of accomplishment on a daily basis.
good,International experience in regulatory affairs. I am currently working as a Global CMC strategist/Author in a multinational company. I have a global and an international vision of what is regulatory affairs.
good,"Good place to work, going through large layoffs. No product pipe line."
good,"A typical day for myself consists of reviewing production schedule, then delgating duties to Assembly personnel, authorizing paperwork for approval for packaging and production to begin and/or continue. Managment of additional assembly projects and coordinating all aspects involved. Review and check paperwork before records are handed in. Delegate break/lunch times. Problem solve maintenance related issues with packaging machines and authorize and review signoffs. Communicate with warehouse for materials needed for production (I do the inventory for all 3 shifts). At the end of the shift, I oversee all cleanup."
good,"Pay is great but after going thru the Borg style takeover it wasn't worth it. So much opportunity wasted, short sighted thinking, and HR is fairly cold hearted. Lots of backstabbing going on to look good or get ahead, not a friendly place like it was before assimilation."
good,"A great experience. A lot of training and professional growth, but lack of job security."
good,"With the evolving changes in the healthcare environment job security with Pfizer is very poor. As it is with all pharma companies at the present time. Pfizer talks about respect for people but there have been many times, very recently in fact that that has not been the case. I've spend over 20 years in pharmaceuticals in New England and New York and the last 5 years have been the most challenging of my career. Pfizer is a good company to work for and the benefits and pay are very good but job security is always a big question mark."
good,"As product patents expire, cost-cutting is #1 priority - more chiefs than indians - no apparent long term strategy"
good,Worked at pfrzer as a power plant contractor for 11 months.It is a very complext system to learn because very small units but they they tie in to one another.
good,"a good overall experience, with plenty of diversity in tasks never Mundane, an excellent canteen always good food, parking and site services generally good"
good,"I was a Brand Manager at Pfizer for 8 years, i developed several skills in this portfolio and had the opportunity to gain international experience by reporting into a global team."
good,"This is  company that has ridden their past success for many years, with no innovation.  Products are old, and the company will not revamp efforts to innovate, because of fear of failure.  Too much arrogance on how profitable they are...."
good,"Great workplace, however not much room for advancement. Managers are helpful. However, once you're a contractor there the managers don't like offering permanent positions."
good,"My day starts at Pfizer at 0530 or so. Understand the pass down from the night shift. Communicate with manager discuss where we are and what we want to accomplish before the end of the shift. Work place culture is pretty good, some of the difficulties are having he components when you need them and staying on task. I enjoy putting product out to oiur comusters."
good,"If your not currently as an entity making money when Pfizer Bank buys the current company you are working for, they will sell those parts off regardless of future potential. All about making money now and share price."
good,cant discuss what goes on here. It is ok to work here. I don't want to be at a factory forever. I want to experience life in a new way. They do have amazing benefits.
good,"Only management is biased as like other corporate,  nothing special like very genuine or unbiased management.if there is any conflict in territory management never bother to solve,  basically they don't have time to invest their precious time"
good,"Lack of community but great location. As an intern, it’s hard to meet knew people and network. That might be due to the layout of the offices. It seems very inclosed"
good,Pfizer is a multinational company with very productive and innovative environment. There are chances of growth and learning. It was great to be part of this organization.
good,"Good company but advancement is difficult. You have to get a mentor and up-manage or you won't go anywhere. Tuition reimbursement is the best benefit, in my opinion."
good,"Such a big place that your experience will vary based upon your own situation, as does mine.  good when you have a good boss and team, not as good when don't.  So, as you'd expect."
good,the company's business plan and the turnover of the employees leaves you feeling uncertain and constantly adjusting to new managers or environments. Not conducive to productive science.
good,"Liked how you wouldn't know what you'd being doing that day."
good,A very bureaucratic culture; senior management does not and is not willing to change based on techniques used in the past despite there being new methods.
good,High turnover rate in management. The Vaccine business unit is the worst place to work at Pfizer. Other business units such as oncology were more laid back and not as stressed out as people in vaccine development group.
good,Satisfactory as no job is secure at Pfizer.  Rewarding the high performers depends on popularity rather than productivity.  Management does not protect the employees.
good,need more common sense in management ....lookout for the people that actually do the work sometimes. not just tell them when they do something wrong......
good,It is a pain to drive 3 hour every day from my place to the company. The work place is really nice in a university. No food around so I have to bring the food everyday that I cooked.
good,Always at work. Even in the snow. You got penalized for not coming time and a half . So If you missed 8 hours it counted as 12. Other than that a great place to work.
good,"My problem was more with the contracting company. Do not accept a position with Pfizer through Townsend and Associates."
good,"I have come to learn over the years Pfizer tends to hire based on relationship vs. experience. The company is focused on doing the right thing for patients, but does not always put their best people first."
good,Pfizer is located currently on midtown Manahattan (although moving to Hudson Yards in a few years).  It is a pharmaceutical company with both an innovative and off patent/generics business.
good,"Good work place, fast paced with flexibility. Quality employees that offer great knowledge in clinical research and post marketing drugs.  Flexible work schedule that supports a work life balance"
good,"This is a company that is extremely structured and closely follows FDA guidelines. Although the job is done remotely, they are very management heavy in terms of graded drive-alongs."
good,"Great work life balance but limited development opportunities. "
good,"Admin reporting, Master Data updating, filling and archiving reports, taking incoming and outgoing phone inquiries. Learnt different reporting for the different department, good management, friendly working culture environment, hardest part of the job are the reporting deadlines, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the launching of the new promo for the sales product."
good,"nice place to work with lot of collaboration. Company likes to promote and network from within the organization. It is all about networking, networking, networking, networking,"
good,I had a positive working environment for the period I was there.  I was able to work with other departments amicably and allowed a lot of room to grow my career.
good,The site I worked at changed hands several times in 20 years.  It remains to be seen if Pfizer can implement lasting culture changes at this location.
good,"The culture at Pzizer is changing as we speak.  There is never a dull moment.  There are many opportunities to learn but you must go after it; otherwise, you will miss out."
good,Conveyance the patient to continue their medicine. Basically it is toll free number where patient call to us and request for the medicine to deliver at their door step
good,"Great company to work for, due to cutbacks a lot of employees were let go and needed to find employment somewhere else. Very big on team building and inclusiveness"
good,Pfizer is a huge company where i had the opportunity to develop a lot of skills as speaking in front a lot of people and learning more about this business
good,Truly a great organization to work with. Culture is very good and parent company is simply the best. However where it lacks is people development and caring for their career path.
good,"If you like change you'll like Pfizer. In my 10 years there, I have been through 10 restructures and had 11 different managers. "
good,"tumultuous times in pharma industry lead to rapid changes in my job roles"
good,"Se encuentra en continua formación, actualización y retos profesionales."
good,Pfizer Inc. is striving for diversity and inclusion of it's divisions. Starting a career at Pfizer Inc. has great opportunities for growth and increased experience with novel scientific and healthcare related advancements to further one's career portfolio.
good,"Liked working there, env was nice, well paid"
good,"Pfizer is a pretty decent place to work. The pay is good, but management could use a course in communication. Information is not passed along as well as it should be."
good,"I work with an amazing group on the Supply Continuity Team.  We deal with very frustrated customer's that are desperately in need of major life saving medications that are currently out of stock, in limited supply or are being allocated. Our job is to do our best to assist them in understanding the status of each product and supplying them the product(s) they are needing if we are able."
good,al influir en el aumento de las ventas me otorgaron el ascenso de impulsadora a mercaderista
good,"Good workplace for learn. This workplace give me the opportunity for grow. The excellent co-workers, they help in all and explain all method and procedure for work there."
good,"I enjoyed the work, schedule and pace. Great hours and benefits. Very disappointed in management and toxic atmosphere. Lazy people thrive and hard workers have a target on their back."
good,"Nunca um dia de trabalho era igual ao outro,pois as atividades eram rotativas;pude aprender várias atividades,desde a rotina básica de produção farmacêutica até outras mais complexas;quanto a chefia imediata,sempre tínhamos assistência;o ambiente de trabalho sempre foi diversificado;manter sempre um ótimo ambiente de trabalho não era algo tão fácil porque pessoas quase sempre são resistentes;o mais legal era saber que a empresa oferecia todas as ferramentas necessárias para que as tarefas fossem realizadas com total segurança para que pudéssemos voltar para casa íntegros."
good,"Most of the 3rd shift workers are really great, When I started there,the coworkers were even better than the pay. As"
good,"operations of automatic ans manual chemical process equipment of varying complexity in various processes in accordance with operations procedures. Processes may generate large amounts pressure and temperature spikes. Required training in hazardous material handling.. and emergency procedures. Equipment includes mixers, grinders,filter presses, dryers , pumps, and filling machines. Performs quality analysis, hourly or daily audits."
good,Pfizer is a pretty good company to work for as long as you don't mind working every other weekend. If you are on an off shift it can take years to get to first. The raises are not the best. I've been here 6 years and there are people coming in off the street starting out what I make now even though they have no experience. The benefits here are pretty good.
good,"Great colleagues, reorganization occurred aproximately every 18 months so typically get a new manager with each reorg. If you get a good manager - job is great; if poor manager - job sucked. Company too big, you are only known by your employee id. Great 401k,  health benefits and stock options. Great company to work for right out of college. You get great training and company recognition to put on resume. Good luck"
good,"Absolutely a wonderful place to work, co-workers are helpful, I was able to expained my knowledge considerably, because training updates occurred on a regular basis,if I were asked to return to duty I would with no hesitation"
good,Extensive organization structure and comprehensive career ladder and personal development opportunities
good,Its a place for employees to do their work with full of obedience and follow a procedures well. And taking a personal care more. And they work with time effectively
good,I have only worked for 10 months for Pfizer but I got the fundementals of sales in Pfizer. It was my first experience after graduation. I have worked with a great manager.
good,"Empresa muito agradável de se trabalhar, porém não foca muito no crescimento profissional. Foca-se apenas em fixar-se em uma mesma função durante anos e anos para garantir a própria vaga (pelo menos na área em que atuei)"
good,My division was sold after a year so it is hard to say specifically anything that comes to mind except that the cafe was nice and the new designs seemed fresh.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Good work-life balance and above average pay. Company provides opportunities to advance your career and they promote community service.
good,L ambiente lavorativo molto buono colleghi ben predisposti orari di lavoro flessibili
good,"Good place to work, cares about employee's well-being. Team-based workplace culture with smart people and well trained management. Many opportunities to learn."
good,people are very rude at pfizer supervier never had anything for us to do and i always lost hours very slow at pfizer right now. wish i could have had more hours
good,"For Pfizer OTC division is a smaller division of Pfizer. Traditional, old school way of doing things and hard to make changes. Money was good but no bonus nor any significant benefits either."
good,I conduct assay runs and provide final results to my manager by end of week. I learned useful skills which can help to find the next job. The management is quite open-minded about new methods and that can bring the company to a new level.
good,This is a very corporate work environment.  It is imperative to be able to conform to their culture.  They have been successful at doing what they do.
good,"Una grande società come la pfizer richiede una serietà che supera le aspettative."
good,Was not happy when I left this company but that was during a lot of change to the company.  Have no worked here in 6 years so my review is not really relevant at this time.
good,"Good place to work. People are super nice, very family friendly, flexible work location, interesting project, very good experience with this group. I would recommend."
good,"As a contracted worker I was not actually a Pfizer employee and so am unable to accurately evaluate the questions asked here.  There was a large rift between the Pfizer colleagues and the contracted workers, we were excluded from Pfizer benefits."
good,"Very good to work with Pfizer.  Learned how to over come different challenges,and understanding different perspectives of different kind of peoples..."
good,"For a legacy Hospira site, there have been many changes that created problems that required much extra time at work. It can be difficult communicating with different areas due to lack of resources available."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Pfizer as a contractor the atmosphere was a blended feel, no one treated you less than professional. That applied to any of the sites that I managed."
good,"Promoted a variety of drugs. Territory was I Manhattan, Bronx, Queens. This place set my foundation for cardiovascular experience. Pay wasn't great, but much learned."
good,Pfizer took over Wyeth and out sourced one of the best IT teams I have ever worked for.  Then changed the culture and out source the entire IT dept to HP.  Eventually laying off all its full time IT employees.
good,"Pfizer is a nice and fair company. As long as you are capable, there are many development opportunities. I would stay at Pfizer if it were not a requirement for frequent travel to the NYC office as I am in other state."
good,"Work at this place at the time which I did was a continual exercise in doing  less and less with less and less.  Major parts of the facility had been shut down shortly before I started and out-sourced to another company facility.  Soon after I was hired, the parent company was acquired by Pfizer and eventually my position was eliminated.  It makes no sense to delineate in detail the duties or attributes of a position which has ceased to exist."
good,Pfizer bought Wyeth and I have no idea how the business is currently could be great could be awful I literally have no idea what to say about the current company
good,management needs to work with you to help you succeed.could be better leadership to help operators to be the best they can be. need more trainers to be there for the difficult times.
good,"For someone who has more to give and is courageous, smart, experienced, and transparent......there are better places to work."
good,"This rating is the same as the entry for Wyeth.  They are one and the same."
good,"This rating is the same as the entry for Wyeth.  They are one and the same."
good,This was my first main role in this position. I really enjoyed this position and wished they did not cut the funding for such an important position. Management was incredible and the workplace culture was pretty much on your own (with the help of the director of course).
good,I enjoyed my time working at Pfizer(Zoetis). I worked for their animal health division and learned a lot about the science and technology related to that part of their business.
good,Overall the company is good. Investing in research to discover  medicines to benefit patients and society. Benefits are good. Company location is good too.
good,"$50B American global pharmaceutical developer and producer of medicines and vaccines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology."
good,+10 years of experience in Sales in Multinational Pharmaceutical Companies like Pfizer and Novonordisk. I learned a lot from these 2 schools and searching for bigger opportunity.
good,Learned a lot about corporate catering as a clerk and a cook.  Could be very stressful.  Management not very understanding of challenges of this type work and the logistics of such a large complex.
good,"They practice a culture of hiring one educated person to oversee and train people with no background in the field.  This makes for a poor work environment that is very stressful, as it is full of resentment from people who have been there a long time having to answer to someone who comes in with degrees."
good,"This opportunity provided me the much needed initial training, support and product line and sales representative could ever want.  I helped shape my business and clinical sales approach."
good,It's a big company in a really big industry. There are many things that are good with working at a company like this and many things that are not. There is certainly room to move around into different positions.
good,Pfizer had great products and a phenomenal training program.  Career advancement was available for those that produced.  I did well but wanted to sell more tangible medical equipment.
good,"I loved professional speaking but with Pharma it became more and more difficult to meet requirements.  I had superb Pharmaceutical Representatives that were being let go, moved to other departments which then made it difficult to schedule speaking engagements."

good,"Ambiente agradável."
good,I enjoy my job that I do. It give my pleasure to know that I had a hand in the process of making someone feel better or saving their lives. The hardest part of the job is the lines that process faster then others.

good,They have there ups and downs. The wage and healthcare are great. The mentoring program is great. In the mentoring program you get to develop the skills you need to do what you want to do.

good,"Pfizer is a very large company, it can be easy to feel a bit lost.  Most of the work is controlled by regulations from FDA and other regulatory organizations.  It makes the rules seem unnecessarily complex."
good,Difficult to review since I've only been an employee for 2 months due to a buy-out.  Efforts made to communicate on site during integration is appreciated.
good,"Fun place to work, many opportunities to train and develop a future career.  Typical work day is assigned by shifts and management allows freedom for each shift to make their own decisions."
good,Overall a good company but I was not a statutory employee.  Therefore my review is very limited.  Time and distance to travel was too much at times.
good,"Flexibility is a must working for Pfizer with an ever changing production schedule, and dealing with day to day and most times minute to minute changes."

good,"Visit pharmacies and physicians to monitor and follow up on drugs sales. "
good,"Pfizer was a very good place to start a career in pharmaceuticals. They were regimented and focused.  They were a how many pills can you sell company. Individual managers I had were very good.

good,llenar documentos preparacion de arranques de linea.operar la mayoria de equipos existentes en planta.buenambiente entre colegas y lideres de grupos. Las dificultades era solo lo problematico de algunos productos por sus caracteristicas para su empaque.lo mas importante para mi fue envasar una gran cantidad de medicamentos en especial los pediatricos y coloborar un poco con la salud y el bienestar humano.
good,"Great Place plenty of work to go around, great co- workers enjoyed the great environment of good people, the challenges where old hardware and software."
good,"I have worked in various positions and departments in the time I have been with Pfizer.  I have found that the Site and Corporate management do not have appropriate boundaries or consistent application of requirements when it comes to work/life balance.  Additionally, bullying behavior is often rewarded by advancement or approved by silence."

good,It provides good exposure with providing opportunity to work in different projects

good,"Structural changes in the pharmaceutical industry have transformed the focus of the company from discovering, developing, testing, and producing drugs to more acquisitions and partnerships with smaller companies that do not have the sales and distribution channels that Pfizer does have. Although there is a lot of change internally, management has been adept at managing the change and keeping the company in the desired direction."
good,Nice place to work with good work life balance. Half day Friday's during summer hours is definitely the best compared among companies around the area.
good,"Everyone knows Pfizer--it's a great company to be from!"

good,Gave me the opportumity to learn about boiler and steam turbine operation.

good,Pfizer Surveillance is manageable. People are kind and approachable.
good,I enjoyed working at the Pfizer plant in Andover.  A good team of co workers.
good,"A company with great opportunities on the develop of new products, but without and strategic plan to reach that goal.  There are to much turnovers, because the majority of the employees are by contract.  They try to do many projects a the same time and at the end there is none finish.  The instruments are not the best or the last version of the one running on the market, the training program is not follow by all the departments."
good,"Heures de travail de 9h à 17h avec des heures supplémentaires."

good,"There are no sufficient and solid clinical development work to do in China. The company only has local registration trials in China which support launching new compound or new indication on local market, however China has no qualified resources to participate earlier stage clinical development, in terms of organization structure as well as personnel.

good,Diverse exposure groomed me professionally. Open and transparent culture helped me learn a lot from the mentors/seniors.
good,Great small company to have as a stepping stone
good,The daily routine varied based on studies that were either being started or were ending. I especially enjoyed processing documentation and gathering supplies and sending them to study sites. It was an interesting experience to learn about the various safety and efficacy studies that are conducted on current over-the-counter medicines. The most difficult part of the job was working with some previously created documents that didn't always interface with updated computer applications.
good,Great to learn about the pharmaceutical industry but the environment wasn't what I had hoped for.
good,Working on programs writen by others. Limited social contact. People were fired alot.
good,"* A large conglomerate with smaller market specific businesses that operated independently, yet reported to corporate office in New York."
good,"Great team of coworkers, but their direction forced the entire team out once Wyeth was obtained."
good,Mostly I would be sitting at my desc hardly communicating with any further member of staff as they were all wound up in their own business. I did learn a couple of lab techniques but none that I hope to develop on in future life. The management of the place was all done in sectors with seperate departments used for certain experiments where I was in analytical research and development. My co-workers where all a bunch of lovely people quite nice to talk to at lunch but there was no humor in the labs or even at their desks it just kind of made me feel lonely. The hardest part of the job was making all of the calculations during some experiments the whole of the time i spent working there I was trying to remember the things i rendered useless in school. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your put into a team and your all working together by working on different parts of the experiment or the production of the product.
good,"The typical work day was 9-5. There was not an enormous amount of work for interns. The majority of my time was spent on Linkedin researching candidates for superiors. It was good experience to listen in on recruiting calls and team meetings. However, I felt I could contribute more."
good,Ho imparato l'importanza di lavorare in gruppo.
good,Pfizer is a great company providing a dynamic working environment.

Tag and enter new equipment that is delivered. Answer emergency calls; walk down/trouble shoot calls and dispatch maintenance tech. Update data base and preventative maintenance schedule as needed. Keeping track of portable equipment for maintenance is strugle. The best part of the job is when someone stops you just to say ""Thanks for helping us today""."

good,Every day we saw new business. We had great leadership at our DC.
good,it was a fun job and had great hours. everyone that worked there were very nice
good,"I have to thank Pfizer for giving me my start in the industry. When I started, it was a great company. As things evolved and began acquiring other companies, I think Pfizer lost its identity and competitiveness. They laid off great people."
good,"Pfizer bought Wyeth in October 2009 and the group that absorbed us was fantastic, filled with very professional, bright, and gracious people who made us feel welcomed and valued. It was a great group in the middle of a very challenging time. I learned a lot during my time at Pfizer, not all of it was good but it wasn't all bad either."
good,"Empresa focada em resultados e bem dinâmica, porém dificulta o aprendizado para estagiários devido ao seu dinamismo."
good,A great place to work and grow. The experiences teaches core sales skills and allows for self managed cAreer.
good,I was only with Pfizer for 6 months as they bought King Pharmaceuticals. It is difficult to truly assess a company in such a short period of time.
good,"Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was acquired by Pfizer in 2002. Company had a different corporate work culture. Company went through numerous reorganization planning and eventually employees were laid off."
good,"Often referred to as ""The Borg"" with good reason. Compensation is first rate, but the company management has been in chaos for the last 5+ years. Company maintains a ""we know best"" attitude and gives little respect for new ideas."
good,"They prefer you are 100% all about them, good luck if you want to just get a paycheck, you're a number to them unless you can get on your knees, how good you work is only 1 facet, bring kneepads and chapstick."
good,"Its a company you love to work with. Great work, great learning. You have great mentors to guide you. Best part is their open door policy. Would love to mention few lovely people I worked with."
good,"A typical day at Pfizer is ever changing, which makes each day new for the colleague. "
good,"Having worked at Pfizer for 18 years, I was encouraged by the shared drive for self improvment which resulted in top notch job performance.  However in the last 5 years, the climate has changed.  Respect for others is not as high on the spectrum as before.  Pfizer is indeed changing, but not necessarily for the better."
good,"Enjoyed the work I did, and 12 hour day shift schedule. Too much drama in certain areas. My group leader and supervisor were amazing. I made some great friends that will last a lifetime"
good,Pfizer have a good working culture. They  are friendly environment with all the technician and management level. Alot of documentation to be done as it is a pharmaceutical company.
good,Good place to work and for your own learning and experience.But growth with in the organisation is very very slow.Salary growth is also very slow.But working in Pfizer will give u good growth outside pfizer.
good,"I have liked working here but due to health reasons I can not do my job duties efficiently. I definitely appreciate the 3 weeks vacation that they give and the great health, vision, and dental insurance. Their 401k is great as well! Management was just not understanding of why I was missing so much work even with me explaining what was going on. Other than that I really enjoy working here!"
good,"A place were you can learn every techniques on a designated area, were time management is a must to have in this type of industrial job. "
good,"Pfizer is a great company, but like most large companies there are a lot of meetings and bureaucracy. Role clarity is a challenge. You can grow and be promoted at  Pfizer if you have a senior level advocate."
good,"Al ser una estructura enorme y regional, le hizo una corporación muy burocrática en sus sistemas de gestión y administración."
good,"good place to start and grow career but old-school leadership mentality; work-life balance is variable but great remote work flexibility and vacation; culture doesn't foster innovation, but great place for business healthcare and strategy"
good,"I was charged with marketing and launching Viagra and Lipitor.  Also marketed Gucotrol XL, Zyrtec, and Accupril.  It was a good experience to market drugs that were so inherently different to such a diverse and different group of Specialists that had such different patient bases as well as treatment paradigms that you must figure out so you could find where your treatment could fit into that paradigm."
good,"Ma mission d'Assistante Chef de Projet à la direction Medicale m'a permit de découvrir l'univers pharmaceutique. J'ai mis toutes mes compétences afin d'aider à finaliser et rendre compte des études observationnelles menées durant les 10 dernières années."
good,"working at the collegeville campus proved to be one of my most valuable working experiences, both personally and professionally. it has many offerings."
good,Buenas oportunidades laborales en un ambiente laboral cambiante
good,"Fast paced environment and raises are merit based, even though promotions are not. Management could be abrasive, however they were effective. The site operates very well."
good,Le stage au sein de cette structure m'a permis d'acquérir des bases solides en finances
good,Place where a lot is learned if given the tools and oppurtunity under the right management. A typical day for me would involve processing physical records for clinical and nonclincal work in the labs and advising scientists on how to work in a compliant manner.
good,"Do what you are told atmosphere, with no challenges from manufacturing workers. This is easy to do, if you don't find a need for  change. If you are liked you go further."
good,a good place to make alot of quick money and go because of the politics in it i would tell someone to make a career out of it.. This place will mentally tear you down
good,Competitive work environment with change remaining as a constant shadow in the background.  Management moving around and you never know what will come next.  Fun times are not like what they used to be.
good,Able to understand laboratory techniques that helped me in future job positions. Very organized and good team work in the laboratory department. Was able to use technical skills in the field and obtain knowledge in researching.
good,I was able to grow my capabilities and strengths through my experience with Pfizer. I held a number of positions there that allowed me to move forward in my career.
good,"On my last account at BCD, I felt the group of co workers and the management team were very knowledgeable and easy to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for a large organization that provided great benefits and a flexible work schedule.   At the time I was there, most of our meetings were virtual which allowed you to keep your travel to a minimum.  That was very important for a working mother."
good,"My management built a very strong team. There was 8 or 9 team leads and SMEs of which I was a part, and 50-60 engineers who we guided, moving resources as necessay. Pfizer was cut throat, requiring mandatory staffing cuts each year both among full time (management) and contract (technical)."
good,"I believe this is a great company to work for. There are many possible opportunities in this workplace for advancement. I enjoy the shifts, the people, and making good quality products for our customers."
good,"Great workplace. During my time layoffs were occurring twice a year as a result of Pfizer acquiring Wyeth in 2009 and I was eventually laid off. Enjoyed my long career (25 yrs.), although I found it disheartening that I was not allowed to retire. Still, a great place to work."

good,"Provided plenty of training."
good,balanced work/life day; great teammates and management; everyone pitched in on deadlines and getting work done; it provided a strong learning culture with management always willing to help
good,"The pay was great, the work was boring most of the time. Not enough to stimulate you. Work was mandane. They dont treat contractors right. They make you sit in different cubes. It looks as if they are shaming you. I did not like that."
good,"It was a good start for me, however I was lead to believe that there would be more advancement through this position. The job became frustrating as a contractor, when Full time employees would constantly due the exact same work."
good,le télétravail mis en place aide beaucoup à maintenir un bon équilibre
good,"Created the workflow structure and set up the new team. Structured and integrated the team and Created the entire distribution set up by doing a value stream mapping."
good,"Management fails to direct line leads into a more centralized place for communicating problem resolution.  It's more chaotic than it needs to be.  They need the help, but they don't have time to direct it.  Aside from that, it's a great company to work for.  Not sure how other departments run though."
good,See my other reviews of Pfizer a good/fair company with poor feedback/reviw process which did not make it clear where I was in terms of my performance compared to my piers nor did it make clear areas in which I needed to improve!
good,"A lot of change including managers and processes.   Stressful at times depending on what area you are working in.  People you work with are generally friendly, respectful, intelligent, competent and professional.  You are provided the tools you need to complete your work, with flexibility for work/life balance (if your management allows).  Hardest part of the job is changes in management causing changes in management styles.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the actual work which was rewarding and the co-workers."
good,"Pfizer is  a good company to work with. Colleagues are great and the  work environment is positive."
good,"Learned to set a target and put the graft to achieve set targets; a typical day work include investigating queries from the market that impacts the P&L as regards cost of sales. Engaged in a team as part of the centre of excellence that sets high standards in report deliveries in cost of sales, budgeting and forecasting, data analytics etc. Achieved producing a template on Standard Costs to be used by the market analysts to ease the budgeting and forecasting processes."
good,management was ok people are kind of rude because the older they are the more territorial it gets but great pay. other than that no complaints.

good,"Awesome experience. Worked with medical, legal, and regulatory. Experience obtained in evaluating tracking systems, and supported various brand teams. Electronic submission experience. Supported Co-promote team for multiple sclerosis, TruMenba support for vaccinesale, Prevnar, and Somatotropin."
good,"Manufacturing was hard, fast paced, but paid well. Very short handed on good team leaders.Good benefits, but very few thank you's for jobs well done."
good,"Great learning experience, however the company has limited growth opportunities. Also the company is infamous for laying off colleagues and cost cutting."
good,"Pay is different but that is expected being a contractor. Was not paid double time for working during a Hurricane like regular permanent employees. Overall great environment, good staff and good team. Felt very welcomed when I started. Has a ""family"" atmosphere."
good,Good to work with this company and my team was good and they are supportive and we completed the project intime and testing and production team were very good with us.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión,la parte mas difícil era salir fuera de la ciudad ya que tocaba salir muy temprano llegar tarde, y al otro dia empezar normal, lo que mas me gustaba era la oportunidad de compartir con mis compañeros de trabajo y jefes contándonos anécdotas que nos sucedían y aprendiendo de ellas."
good,"highly focus on synthesis of designed target molecule. very good support of having chemicals and some equipment."
good,Industry is a volatile one but I try to remind myself of the value of the work I perform. Hardest part of the job is ignoring politics and rumblings and focusing on work to be done. Most enjoyable part of the work is collaborating with colleagues on meaningful projects. Typical day at work involves typical drug discovery work.
good,In charge of granulating and Capsule filling. I learn how to be a self directive team in order to make a great production. My co-workers were the most competitive team ever know. The hardest part of the job is maintain the flow because the Packaging area was faster than us. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we produce more that the expectation.
good,"Great learning experience.  "

good,"Work with a diverse group of people in offices literally around the world"
good,"While at Pfizer, I had worked for a short period as a consultant.  The Director of Finance needed a temp to assist with the accuracy of actual expenses and budgeting into the financial applications which Pfizer had utilized.  I had worked with ebuy, Crystal, and Hyperion, each financial application used for different types of reports.  Gained knowledge on Pfizers products and how they approached their finances on genetic drugs, controlled & uncontrolled drugs."
good,Niche markets are place to be with good structure. Pfizer Oncology is strong.
good,"A slow pace work place, i prefer something that will keep me busy. Quite a bit of heavy lifting that is tough to do with my body structure. I learnerd how to multi task well and get the job done in a timely manner. Hardest part of the job is that we only have three people in our department, which makes working difficult when we have a heavy work load. Most enjoyable part of the job is that I can work by myself once I am assigned my task or tasks for the work day. "
good,Selected chemical series and templates from combinatorial  chemistry hits and modified chemical structures to improve biological activity.  Used molecular modeling to assist in the selection of active targets.  Synthesized these final compounds using routes known in the literature.  Modified reaction conditions for difficult synthetic routes.  We had 1 year to come up with a pre clinical candidate for any series or template to meet deadlines.
good,Overall a fair company to work for. The only thing that is a problem is being a skilled tradesmen and being required to do unskilled jobs that other titles are also required to do but are not expected to perform.
good,"To meet doctors,retailers and stockists"

good,Pfizer provides opportunities for professionals to work with an industry leader with products that are recognized and respected in the industry.
good,Global company provides opportunities you will not find in smaller company. Salaries and benefits are very good. However there are constant layoffs.
good,- Elaboration of Contracts.
good,"not enough staff, management just interested in cost savings"
good,"Pfizer survives a lot on its historical reputation. Right now, management is in the midst of changing a lot which is needed but it's very bumpy and gives a sense to employees that the senior leadership doesn't have a grand plan and is reacting and making short term fixes. Strategies and focus change on a regular basis. If you can weather the roller coasters you can have a fruitful career there. Benefits are good. But it can be frustrating waiting it out and going through the charades."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho na empresa era muito intenso, várias atividades diferentes para serem realizadas no mesmo dia e pressão para entrega de trabalhos no prazo ou até antes do prazo."
good,"It's the same stereotype for all big companies: higher management makes decisions they know nothing about, people don't share knowledge they have so they can remain valuable, and you are 100% dispensable. It's not the company it used to be."
good,"insure lines had commodities and bottles. provided a clean and safe work area. and inspection of bottles and made sure no missing stoppers, caps and over and low fill was present."
good,"- a typical day is something that is fun filled"
good,"Pfizer es una gran compañia donde se aprende mucho aunque hay que saber sobrellevar los cambios continuos. "
good,"So many lay offs. Poor job security."
good,The individuals that work at Pfizer Inc are second to none.  I enjoy the projects I have worked on.  Many submissions are similar but different enough to make every day something new; keeps me challenged.
good,"good culture, heal plan good bonus is good and the pension also"
good,Nothing to review... we were a global organization.  A small component of the overall biz.  So we were able to do what we need to do.  Sometimes difficult to manage as our portfolio footprint was not in US... but we were based there.
good,"A nice workplace. Doing BMS PLC programming & SCADA graphic. Doing Testing and Commissioning of all control and monitoring systems. Coordinate with client, main contractor, sub contractor and suppliers to complete the project."
good,Als interim krijg je weinig kans tot een vast contract.
good,"I had the most wonderful supervisors and managers and then I was moved into a new group  during a layoff and reorganization. I wish I had not been moved, but it was better than being laid off."
good,"Pfizer Healthcare Consumer Products in Madison, NJ has a hard to balance life and work culture. Brands are constantly cutting down one another for budgetary reasons, but at the end of the day you would see those same people leaving for a dinner or drink after work together."
good,The job itself was fun and challenging but the cons definitely outweighed the pros. Felt like job security wasn't there and never felt truly supportive by my managers.
good,"diverse day dealing with senior levels down to junior levels. specialised in compensation and benefits which provided an opportunity to learn more about this, the culture tended to be very political. The long hours were difficult with small children. Enjoyed my team"
good,The company is great to work for. The benefits are nice and the pay is decent. However the big letdown is management. You will often run into situations where is feels like management is deliberately impeding your progress. Each shift is held to different standards. You have no where to go to voice your concerns so what ends up happening is morale starts to go down. If you approach the company with a minimalist attitude you should be fine but is you have aspirations for greatness then look elsewhere.
good,"The work place was very difficult, the production demanded lot of time and plan changing. It was very challenging and not many found the hability to work under such pressure."
good,"My immediate manager was a pleasure to work for, but he was also a contractor. I found the entrenched It people to be less than collegial and transparent. Fortunately, I was offered a full-time job and was able to leave after only a few months."
good,"Laboratórios Pfizer é um misto de um ambiente corporativo bom com cultura americana também bastante direcionada. "
good,Pfizer Asia Pacific Ltd is a fast paced and dynamic workplace that continually seeks improvement pushes for both short and long term goals.  A management that works actively to solve problems.
good,"People at Pfizer are great however there is lot of work and stress to produce always more."
good,Typical pharmaceutical company. Great benefits and salary with opportunity for long career. Markets are managed and success is more dependent on payer contracts than in the past. Your success to some extent will be dependent on market assignment.
good,It was a great company but a bunch of wasted resources. Talents of individuals were not harnessed to full potential. All team players worked well together but too many leaders and not enough workers.
good,Same as before with Pfizer - great people to work with but feedback could and should have been more candid to be more helpful.  This role was relatively early on but still could have used more honest feedback
good,"Fair, great benefits, work and life balance is great.  Nice facility and atmosphere.  Opportunity for administrators to collaborate for improvements in processes and procedures.  Able to make great connections with other departments and cultures."
good,"This was my first experience in a 8 to 5, office type of job. It was an internship but I learned so much thanks to the people that worked beside me. My boss was incredibly supportive and helped me learn a lot about the communication plans and strategies that need to be put in place to accomplish great results."
good,"Pfizer was closing many its offices in Cambridge, MA and moving their staff and facilities to other parts of town.  Their computers were partly managed by staff out of state.  I had to ask them to do things which I might have expected to be able to do myself.  Their building was deliberately over-staffed.  People were working with their laptops in the cafeteria.  Most staff members didn't have a regular work station.  Rather they had to look for a free spot if there was one.  Pfizer had acquired two other pharmaceutical companies and was still incorporating their staffs and facilities into its own.  There were major lay-offs twice shortly after I left.  "
good,You go through security and cannot get on the property without your pass. Small gym but the group class room was a good size and the employees were always happier once they stepped into the gym facilities
good,Joining Lupin as a start of my career added various qualities to me as well as the company people always guided me and well trained me for the job.
good,"Great training and experience but the organization has become too large and has lost focus on professional development. In addition, business has become highly commoditized in this ever evolving market"
good,"Overall good company to work for, if you fit in.  Train and develop talents. many opportunities to learn."
good,"My colleagues at Pfizer are amazing people to work with. It doesn't matter what your position is or what group you work for, everyone is willing to help and look out for each others' safety. However, there is little advancement available here."
good,I was a contractor and basically did the same tasks everyday but there was still other things to keep my attention. I enjoyed coming to work.
good,"Pfizer is a reputable company. However there are some top management has affect the job culture in malaysia. Nevertheless, great benefits they provide."
good,Pfizer is good employer. Employee carrying. Good culture where some values are considered most important for example respect for people. customer focussed organization with latest operational tools to move in the market. It was wonderful experience while working with Pfizer.
good,Empresa muito grande e dinâmica porém os processos você se torna especialista pois necessita fazer poucos processos em virtude do volume de trabalho.
good,"Work from home is available, most managers provide a good work/life balance, development/training is minimum, downsizes approximately every 6mths, has fitness center, promotes good health, depending on your location you can often feel secluded from everyone as they keep to themselves."
good,Typical day includes many tasks-from normal duties to projects that arise each day. I learned how to accept change and multitask while continuing to complete my regular duties timely and accurately.
good,my co-worker was like family member and we looked out for each other we worked in teams. so team work was very important
good,Good place to work if your looking to stay in a position and have no advancement opportunities. The benefits are amazing and the pay is good. The work life balance is also an added benefit the only down fall is the management and lack of opportunities for advancement.
good,Always busy and faced paced.  Always room for advancement.  Easy to talk to management.
good,"- A typical day starts with an issue and continues by trying to resolve theissue"
good,Typical day was making executed sales calls on specialty physicians
good,Slow back-office work with upper-aged employees. Not an exciting place for a college student.
good,"Loby is there,so that I am transfer to delhi inspite good performance,ultimately leave company."
good,"Highly motivated and Very extensive experience in the Strategic Sourcing environment for bio tech, Perenteral and pharmaceutical manufacturing.."
good,Siempre llegaba temprano y me desarrolle en todo sentido.
good,"I started as Wyeth employee and became Pfizer when Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2010. I enjoyed my work, the opportunities to learn new things and be a part of diverse programs."
good,Gathering specifications of manufacturing equipment to create test case scenarios to challenge the required perimeters for production. Create proof of qualification of equipment to commission and place into production.
good,In process of retrenching after patent losses of major products. my co-workers were highly capable and a pleasure to work with. The major corporate environment gives you an opportunity to work across many functional areas and to encounter a broad set if skills.
good,They worked and got me a position as a back fill for a windows xp rollout. I am grateful they got me the position but I was not paid much and it only lasted four months.
good,"Pfizer is an extremely large organization that is somewhat bureaucratic, but provides opportunities for advancement and decent pay and benefits due to its strong financials and widespread international presence. Employees have plenty of opportunities for international transfers and mobility within the organization for exposure to new functional areas."
good,Good company to work for with a great work culture in a clean well organized method of product production from start to finish. Great opportunity to progress and learn with opportunities to improve. Like a lot of companies it falls a long way short with it’s tiered structure sometimes leaving personnel isolated from getting issues resolved.
good,"great people, great environment, high expectation to perform from upper management. Some expectations are unrealistic leading to poor management, hard to maintain work life balance"
good,"Been with Pfizer for several years, very few regrets. Great people overall, opportunity to grow technically, great work life balance, happy family life. However, career growth opportunities are limited, unless you are connected, build great PowerPoint decks and live on the east coast. If you are a hands on individual (i.e. someone who actually does the work, chances of being promoted are slim - because then who would actually get any work done??). Stock price is a sham, so no point in counting any long term stock incentives towards overall comp. Not clear where the company is headed...hiring like crazy followed immediately by layoffs, would rather hire from outside than promote from within"
good,Had to leave because of the poor culture. While the compensation of the company was excellent the culture and the morale of the people there were extremely poor. Would not recommend this place.
good,"Laboratorio con gran nivel de capacitación en las diferentes áreas, obtuve una gran enseñanza y profesionalismo en mis tareas asignadas."
good,"When I was there, company was still in transition from having purchased Hospira, which created stress and uncertainty among the employees. The people are what makes Pfizer in Lake Forest a good company to work at. Pfizer made major improvements to the work environment and engaged the employees before making those changes. The transitional period was rather stressful. My division was sold to another company so I was with Pfizer briefly."
good,"I have learned a lot of skills and technologies at Pfizer, mainly downstream. Some equipment and facilities can be improved, and the we need more resources at times."
good,"My first professional job after graduating from college, I was excited to work and have benefits and a stable income. Typically most days I worked in the customer service department answering calls about the Pfizer animal products and processing orders. Through my career at Pfizer I also helped in sales and outside sales covering territories over the phone. I learned a lot about this company and their products, the management sometimes came off as frantic but overall the workplace culture was supportive and positive. The hardest part of the job was not feeling passionate about what I was doing and sitting still all day every day. The most enjoyable part was having such a stable position with great benefits."
good,"Company gives incentives to Team,  all brands."
good,"Es un lugar que se trabaja bajo presión, siempre enfocado en el resultado, permanentemente medidos por resultados."
good,"My typical day at Pfizer was routine but important. I Work long hours insuring that the quality of the IV bags are perfect. No matter what , i have to practice safety and quality.I have to make sure to keep a sterile environment to ensure safe IV bags. To me its important because somebody's' life can depend on it."
good,"lack of transparency and reorg's seemed constant. I made it through each reorg, but with each reorg, we had a newly designed team and territory that seemed to disadvantage the physician client."
good,"JOb & work life balance"
good,"Pfizer is a company that acquired Wyeth and it was a very difficult time and Pfizer decided to close the plant."
good,"In America company culture, you gain flexible time, good cooperative team. All you can do is to deal with your own business work well."
good,I enjoyed all my years of service at Pfizer and was very dismayed to learn of the layoff that ultimately brought me to indeed.com.
good,"I have worked for almost four years for Pfizer and it was a very good experience, it added a lot to my CV and to my career. "
good,"Wasn't there that long, but liked the job.  Enjoyed the people, workload is heavy, but management makes it worth it."
good,"Uma das grandes empresas do ramo farmacêutico e que prima pelo conhecimento técnico dos seus colaboradores, gerando oportunidade de crescimento diariamente."
good,"Zwar ist es eine anstrengende Arbeit, jedoch wird man fair bezahlt und hat ein gutes Arbeitsklima"
good,"It takes quite a bit of training, and you'll do great if you get a good trainer.  It was warm inside and you are on your feet a lot.  They offer excellent benefits."
good,"Avec mon esprit d'initiative. Je suis capable de me.'adapter facilement,."
good,The work at pfizer is very challenging and has a very good career path. but it has a very bad managerial levels. managers are very rude and unprofessional!
good,"Pfizer a racheté l'entreprise où j'ai fait toute mon expérience, elle l'a racheté, et mis le personnel en chômage économique, c'est le risque des entreprises Américaines."
good,"I am Indian working for Pfizer pharmaceutical company on shift basis, can you please find some part time job, ready to do any kind of work."
good,"Compagnie d'envergure internationale,"
good,not a bad place to work. great co workers and fair management.  Need a position in lower Hudson valley.  10992 area
good,"My overall experience with Pfizer has been invaluable. Nice surroundings, conducive to productive working environment. Easy to balance work and personal life with telecommuting."
good,"Working with Pfizer as a consultant was a very rewarding experience, until I realized I was only a consultant and my time was up after two years."
good,PFIZER sold use to Fareva of Richmond after Buying Wyeth.I Enjoy working for wyeth/pfizer/fareva of richmond it' time to move on I learned a lot from my 20 plus yrs in manufacturing management has chanege so much in the last five years My co-workers have been one of the best through out all the sells of the Co. to be around the hardest part of the job is knowing there is no retirement the most enjoyable part of the is my co-workers.
good,"Utilized computer skills, wonderful co-workers and team environment."
good,"Great place to work. Verty flexible, procedures are verty understanding for anyone able to do their work in a proficient timely manner. Products are on point."
good,"la empresa exige demasiado, no por nada es una de las mejores del mundo es muy incluyente y de politica de puertas abiertas situación que en Mexico lo veo complicado. negocios de clase mundial, productos innovadores y reconocidos en el ámbito de la salud. profesionalismo en la capacitación cero improvisados. exigencia al cumplimiento de políticas de la compañía, pocas utilidades."
good,"They do not have a good internship program for interns. However, they have a good workplace culture. There have different events inside the company to help the employees mode up."
good,I would say is all very regular for a Pharmaceutical company. A lot of change in the Consumer business not offering a stable work environment. Great employee benefits.
good,Pfizer pharmaceuticals purchased Wyeth in 2006 and closed down the pearl River New York site. This closing put 4000 employees out of work in the New York area
good,Pfizer provides a great work to life ballance. The wages are at the top of the area pay scale. The plant manager is a good man and a good leader. Some of the left over Hospira managenent are stuck in the past and need to get with the times or move on to other things so Pfixer can grow and prosper.
good,"The jobs were all important high paying, great quality jobs, a since of importance, Knowledge of a product that is only made at the facility in Rochester Michigan."
good,"Fue una experiencia en donde tuve desarrollo, crecimiento, estabilidad y progreso durante mi estancia. acompañada por el respeto y seguridad a autonomía para efectuar las actividades diarias."
good,"In this company the evolution of the almost exclusivity of potentiating and improving the physical environment, to include the psychosocial areas and the promotion of health, is observed, generating the tendency of change in the workplace, which must be an environment where The actions of prevention and promotion of health are strengthened, not only with the purpose of preventing accidents at work but also to evaluate and improve the general health of people."
good,"I can still say that Pfizer is still a great place to work if not with a number of restructuring. Worked there most of my life after school, been to many places and work experiences, and had everything I needed benefits-wise."
good,"La verdad que me encanta mi trabajo, todos los días hago algo nuevo, es muy delicado y sé que esta en juego la vida de otras personas.El ambiente es grato, el lugar tambien, los equipos son de última generación. las taécnicas estan en Inglés por lo que diaramente es un desafío y apredisaje."
good,"It was very good to balance the life and job at pfizer."
good,"Pfizer is a great place to work, the management on the other hand is bad, favoritism, gossip, not around when needed, more into the stocks Pfizer offers not the job. I was laid off due to a rumor the group lead told the supervisor. I did not get laid off due to my work ethic, I am a very hard worker. The group leader before he was the leader, called in for 3 months with no work applied for a job he had no business doing got the job, when there was a woman who also applied and was way more qualified was turned down. the group leader that was promoted was promoted to a position he did not know and the woman who had applied moved to a different room and the room I was in was chaotic, no one know what they were doing. the group leader never showed up to work, and when he did he was lazy and did not want to do anything, he always told me I wanted to learn to much, he got mad at me because I wanted to get hired on and move up, instead he talked to a supervisor whom was never there told him he didn't like me, not my work ethic but personal. I was laid off unfair but seeing I was through manpower the management would not talk to me, he would not tell me face to face I was let go, he text me and told hr I was a no call no show."
good,I enjoyed working at Wyeth and left before it was acquired by Pfizer.  Excellent salary and benefits.  The workplace culture at Wyeth was positive....
good,"great place to work prior to merger with Hospira. Learned alot about surgery by being in the OR everyday."
good,Pretty good place to work they tought me many things about working on assembly lines and fixing the machines.
good,"Team work and positive environment"
good,"Working for Pfizer was by far the best job I have had to date.  The only negative is that once Pfizer bought out Pharmacia, they out-sourced many departments.  I would have continued to work for the company if my department was not out-sourced."
good,Skilled co-workers. Friendly working environment. Not so good management. Too many meetings. Not so good marketing division in consumer health.Flexible schedule to accommodate family needs.
good,"I had a very good experience working at Pfizer. great co-workers, and the job was pretty relaxed. Unfortunately the lab life wasn't for me!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Pfizer and their corporate philosophy of continuous improvement was excellent."
good,Have a nice expereince in pfizer that he help me to perform a good and bitter work tp gain more expereince to may basic ideas and to help othera co works in ther work
good,"I interned there. I learned a lot. "
good,"My review is required by Indeed, but I am not sure that is it fair, it has been a number of years since I have worked there and the company has undergone a lot of changes."
good,"dia a dia de visitação normal ,além de negociações"
good,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience there. Did not have sufficient training upon starting and did not have a good rapport with my manager."
good,"union is just for looks,doesn't do anything but collect dues,company does what ever it wants,people are at work more than at home,you work ten straight days and then you get one day off"
good,Pfizer is a nice place to learn and grow. I hope to be able to advance my career and retire from Pfizer. my co-workers are down to earth everyday people with an agenda and I love that in a workplace.
good,"In fact its a good company to work, which was my long term dream. However the compensation, benefits were not at par with the Industry  Standards. "
good,"Best part of this job was learning a new programming language and applying it to solve problems. Another benefit to me was that I got to wear three hats at the same time: Business Analyst, Project Manager, and Software Developer. This job was quite challenging from an IT pov, but rewarding at the same time when I came up with viable solutions."
good,"En el día a día se atendían circunstancias de diversas índoles, haciendo el ambiente y la cooperación en una gran familia, la gerencia tenía sus áreas de oportunidad dada la experiencia, la cultura es lo que esperaría de una empresa de la región con valores y estrategias propias de la ideosincracia de la ciudad, atender emergencias y prioridades, representando un reto administrativo, aprender sobre el proceso de fabricación farmaceutica."
good,"The consumer’s view on quality consists of the quality of design. This includes the quality characteristics of the product or service that the customer sees, as well as the price. The item’s fitness for use is the final determination from the customer’s perspective. The producer’s view on quality consists of the quality of the design of the product or service. This includes conformance to specifications and cost. If the product costs too much too make, the company has to charge more than the customer will pay, it does not work. The consumer must feel as though they “get what they pay for” or they won’t but that product or service."
good,"Company has been merged with CITADEL"
good,"Buscaban la competitividad entre todos los miembros de la empresa fomentando la vigilancia de unos sobre otros, pocos amigos de verdad."
good,"If you are in you're in.  If not you are just background noise.  Managers play favorites at an extreme level.  Like all companies these days Pfizer is all about the shareholders and the executive management team.  Excruciatingly excessive bonuses are given to executives and CEO.  They are doing what is needed to ensure the shareholders have a great return.  Unfortunately, that means moving jobs to tax incentive countries."
good,"Typical Day at work consist of onboarding offboarding new resources, Managing updating of all policies, invoicing, creating PowerPoint Presentations, Uploading to SharePoint information for east access. "
good,Me reservo la misma. No fue una deducción voluntaria.
good,The hardest part of this job was the competition from other employees which caused a lot of drama and no team work. Enjoyed the fast paces environment.
good,"Solid position with a lot of room for growth. The job can be performed at home, given you have collected the appropriate data and interviews. Workplace culture is tough and is not oriented towards teamwork, but in the end it makes you stronger for it."
good,The company itself is a great place to work and has good salary and benefits.  Each department is a silo and only as good as its senior leader.  Some are good and some are extremely toxic and create other toxic middle managers which breeds a nasty cut throat culture.
good,"not exactly my cup of tea. very cut throat. very little job security but masked as organizational growth. lots of unofficial leaders, not enough followers.  tons of gossip and talking about folks behind their backs."
good,"Pfizer was losing its Lipitor ($13B revenue oer year product) and were ""adapting to scale"" after they acquired Pharmacia.  The Corporate IT culture was very cut throat.  "
good,"A typical day of work"
good,"The exposure to learn the business all around the world allows for incredible professional growth.  The people are highly motivated, tremendous team efforts.  And the gym at the site is a plus."
good,"Its a nice place to work,  very nice people, but rarely had fulltime jobs with benefits, and rarely give jobs with benefits only temporary jobs without benefits,"
good,good organisation to develop and sustain. but due to hiring talent from outside the internal talent has been neglected and were treated inhumanly with more of personal agenda rather than the professional agenda.
good,Great place to acquire global exposure. The company has a large global presence that allows colleagues to interact with key stakeholders in various countries. This minimizes the language barrier.
good,It was good because I was given training on machine operation and computer training. The future of Pfizer is uncertain as the company will on longer operate in Havant.
good,great co workers to work with management knows how to handel there workersbenifits are great great location to work at great pay rate.learned a lot working for pfizer
good,"Excellente équipe professionnelle et dynamique"
good,This was my first maintenance jobs. The building was a big building that requires alot of attention due to the many tenants in the building. I enjoyed seeing my work appreciated and the areas that I cleaned stay clean
good,"All thou I loved my job and loved working with the people at Pfizer Andover. The management team in Andover were horrible. The managers on the trade floor were bullies, lyres, had no clue how to treat people or even do their job. Upper management was clueless as to what went on in the working level. When Pfizer bought out Wyeth Andover it was a down hill spiral from day one. Pfizer is all about money and nothing about employees as they showed by laying off more than half the employees and just telling everyone left to work harder."
good,"reviewed all project aspect on a daily basics"
good,"Handled basically 120 calls per day in outbound. Calling Doctors offices and physicians offering samples, co-pay cards, and brochures. Putting information into the data base system."
good,Pharmaceutical Sales to the Western Slope of Colorado. A great stepping stone to the pharmaceutical arena.
good,I have learned to work in a new department because eventhough I've worked for a lot of years at the Pharmaceutical Industry Regulatory Affairs is a new experience for me. Like to work in a team work environment.
good,"As a contractor I am disconnected from the full Pfizer experience. However I will say that a temporary position had lasted for the last 5yrs."
good,"Good working environment, Good respect in the doctors chamber, products will be unique and result oriented.............................................."
good,"N/A, was contract employee for a brief period of time. Very comfortable place to work, deadlines changed daily. High expectations always from management."
good,"Pfizer was a great place to work as a consultant."
good,"Pfizer was great place for learning about pharmaceutical industry. I think hardest part of job was telecommute. Also, I reviewed procurement management for warehouse for pharmaceutical drugs."
good,"Pfizer is a dynamic company that evolves every year with extreme focus on achieving its goals."
good,"Pay well but there is no accountability for management in promotions or hiring. Good ol white boy."
good,"I am working in Infosys technologies contracted to Pfizer."
good,"Workers in the EM lab work a lot of overtime hours. Permanent employees are burnt-out, projecting negative impression on new employees. Some employees are good team players, some are not."
good,Well establish system so less chance to learn as big team and job role is only focused to one area no chance to look and learn on other areas. Management is ok but overall work environment is great
good,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
good,"The balance between work & life does not exist if you are on second shift with a family. The work is 24/7 with weekends and holidays, but you know that going in. Every unit seems to run by it's own set of guidelines. Schedules and rules are different. They focus alot of effort on Safety, which is great. But, you still need to get the work done on dangerous equipment."
good,The best part of my job is without a doubt the people that I work with. Everyone is always ready to help and encourage one another. That has definitely helped me become a better person.
good,"productive work environment with a high potential of growth and progress. to be able to succeed and be always ahead, you should always be keen to learn new tasks and develop the current ones"
good,"Pfizer es una gran Compañía y a quién le debo gran parte de lo aprendido y de lo que soy, en estos momentos se están produciendo muchos re-ajustes y vi la oportunidad de acogerme a un ERE y poder buscar un nuevo proyecto para continuar creciendo"
good,They are looking to move out of the Philadelphia area and are slowly moving positions to Northern Jersey and over seas. Many positions do not require coming into the office so working from home is very common.
good,"Société Pharmaceutique Internationale et leader Mondial de son secteur. "
good,Manager need to be educated about their what they do and what to do.All the workers in that place work hard.Most of them do not stand up to do the right thing because of fear of  losing their jobs.
good,"Data collation, trending and reporting, using web based applications were the highlights. Management was easy to approach and supportive. Co workers are job oriented and subject matter focused with no job rotation. Therefore monotonous and wok load is unbearably low. Enjoyed using statistics as part of the work."
good,The work is very interesting and no 2 days are ever the same. Benefits are wonderful.
good,"Too much change, no job security.  Limited opportunities due to many lay offs and outsourcing."
good,The company offers good benefits and compensation in a pharma industry.
good,"Buena empresa para laborar, mucha inestabilidad en los contratos. ( No ofrecen plantas)."
good,"I am currently working at the Rochester MI. site I transferred over from Kalamazoo. I have been here 3yrs and the culture and management here are much different than those in Kalamazoo. This site has cultural issues, morale issues ,management issues. They loosely follows Blue Book Company Wide Established conducts of behavior. I once had a voice when I was with this company in Kalamazoo, I was disciplined and wrote up for the first and only time which I disagreed with but was blown off by Senior management as I tried to pursue open door policy in blue book. This site and its management say they want your input but the way they treat their subordinates says otherwise. I have 8yrs invested in my career with this company but I am on here searching out other opportunities due to the lack of respect and appreciation I have endured at this site. I am hard working and dedicated even more so when treated properly, unfortunately the management and culture of this place will drain that out of you. I am thankful for my time with this company but when respect and appreciation are no longer being served it is time to move on. I hope this site gets up to true Pfizer standards In policy and treatment of employees but they have a long way to go."
good,"Generally speaking, a good work place with decent pay and opportunities to learn. Able to move laterally within the company to diversify experience, which can be useful for advancement when further in career. "
good,"A couple of supervisors and some the employees there are unprofessional, but other than that everyday is easy and the job help me get back on my feet."
good,Overall it's a good job but it's difficult to have the time or energy to do anything else besides work because of all the overtime. Safety and respect for your coworkers is emphasized.
good,"I genuinely enjoyed my job for many years until recently. Many departments are now extremely understaffed and forced overtime is occuring on every shift of every day. While this is good for those who wish to work overtime, the overall morale of the site has tanked. Most colleagues are stressed out and regularly facing disciplinary action for refusing overtime. This is probably the main cause of colleagues quitting, which has been a problem lately."
good,My summary said it all. If they dont change the mindset of management they wont make it. They will throw you under the bus to save their own behind. Management is not to be trusted.
good,"I worked with construction contract crews. It was hectic. My job was to watch the construction workers and keep them out of restrictive areas and etc,"
good,They pay well at first but the raises are poor. The paid time off is awesome. Great benefits! Production jobs are boring and not much for advancement.
good,"been over 5 yrs things could have changed. PSM contract work not hired because at the time I did not have a degree...the positive was the loss of this job was no fault of my own it was just a policy change that motivated me to go get my degree,  now make much more money."
good,Great benefits & pay for none production floor employees but can be high stress depending on the department. If you have worked at a big corporation you know the drill.  It has a lot of rank and file employees.

good,"Great colleagues and opportunities to grow and learn. However, recurrent layoffs due to reorganization (cost reduction) has a negative impact on teams."
good,Intense workplace but fairly typically of manufacturing environments.  There was a quick turnover as well but the majority of these pressures were an understandable result of growing pains associated with Meridian Medical Technology's acquisition by Pfizer in 2012.  The same issues don't seem present at the Chesterfield site.
good,Multidisciplinary experience in clinical devlopment and working on medical strategy with medical affairs collegues on existing products and new development products.  Led cross-functional team with severals members responsible for established product maintenance and defense as well as ongoing clinical trials.  Several management levels exist and the hardest part of the job is arriving at final decisions.

Only job in the area that paid well and had good benifets and full time work.I enjoyed working in maintenance especially in the manufacturing maintenance position, I learned a lot about keeping the process up and running on a time line."
good,No longer a sales driven culture.  Professional but hard to get things done.  Risk averse company even though the OWN IT culture has tried to make a dent with this issue.  Very good benefits.
good,This company makes its money from M&As  buys the assets and gets rid of the people.Overall the people working there are great.  Management attitude can use some help.

good,They promote almost anybody willing to deal with the stress and chaos of unrealistic production goals. Pay is great and so are the benefits. Communication is lacking.

good,Fairly good work environment that gives you global perspective and provide self-improvement always
good,"Es un trabajo muy noble, se cerró mi plaza y es por eso que se dió mi baja"
good,Working for Pfizer was a great place to develop basic selling skills and interpersonal relationships.  Professional work enviorment and opportunities to advance make this company a great place to begin a sale career.
good,"Colleagues are engaging and always there to help, but management can do more to retain colleagues. Benefits are MNC standards. Might have long hours depending on your function."
good,"Sterile work environment where ""ants marching"" is an appropriate phrase.  I will say that, although EXEC management is not visible, nor doe they  communicate, they have created opportunities for me to improve my skill set and become a better marketer."
good,Like the place but being hired through a temp agency my hourly wage is lower and they seem to keep the temps as long as they can without hiring them in which makes them not want to stay.
good,"Amazing company to work for."
good,"Pfizer's Chemical Operator role provides great training and the job is fairly easy to learn. There is however, a large propensity to screw up because of how technical the job is.

good,"Pfizer continues to be a competitive pharmaceutical company, one of the largest such companies in the world.  The company emphasizes having a highly qualified and trained staff."
good,Working for the company overall was a good experience. I was excited to work for the company. After 6 years there was a big cut in the department and subsequently had to reapply for positions. But I think that the choices were made even before the interviews took place.

good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno,buen trato y mucho compañerismo."
good,"It is a nice place to work. Atmosphere and colleagues are good. Although, contract jobs are not always the best. The managers can really get a lot more work done from you than the permanent employees. So make sure you find out about the manager before you join in. Some managers are better than others."
good,"My first job experience was fun and I've learned a lot when from training to dealing with clients, and how to handle difficult doctors."
good,Pfizer has changed over the years.  Due to ever changing environment of the health care industry.Changes are business related and necessary but not always welcomed by the field force.  Pfizer will survive but will never look the same.

good,"Working in drug safety gives one a very intricate and involved experience in what makes big-name pharmaceutical so impressive. Work here is a great proving ground, with well-versed and concise training. The only downfall is the contractors only remain for a year, with no renewal. Personally I feel the company should pay a little more, and make the contracts last closer to 2 years. I believe that would benefit both the company and the contractor, as there would be more competent people working, less errors, and a company would be able to maximize its efficiency."
good,"(GC site, Vaccines Conjugation):"

good,The job required a great deal of flexibility as schedule changes were an anticipated part of the job.  I learned a great deal about solution behavior and had the opportunity to learn a little bit about cell culture and purification processes (an overview).  My coworkers and I placed a great deal of importance on customer service.  The hardest part of the job was that it required some heavy lifting and it was a bit repetitive.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting feedback from our customers and being appreciated for my work.  
good,"I learned many things,how to tackle a problem,and how to talk with a customer(Doctor) and helped me to make my career to come up.."
good,Excellente société avec un management à haut niveau
good,"Excellent compensation and benefits. The people are fantastic: smart, personable, driven. The biggest challenges are: a highly regulated marketplace that limits sales creativity and entrepreneurship; a powerful insurance industry that is focused on short term results and therefore limits access to new products; and massive government reform that is limiting how much revenue the industry can generate. Because pharmaceutical development is a high risk venture, most companies are going into specialty markets and beginning to focus their marketing efforts in developing countries where it is easier to recoup investment. Therefore the number of pharmaceutical sales jobs in the US has decreased significantly and is likely to continue a downward trend. The best opportunities in this sector for non healthcare providers exists in consultative sales to integrated healthcare delivery systems. Unfortunately, this sales model is still being developed and will take a while to truly mature. If you are thinking of going into this industry to sell, your job security will always be highly unpredictable and as long as you're okay with that - it will still be a great job."
good,"Lots to learn from the seniors, much indeed knowledge is shared"
good,"Pfizer is a great company to work for with amazing benefits, work/life balance and job security, specifically within HR."

In order to get the final promotional material for each product, there is how work that has to be handled as a team within the company and outside the company with the Advertising Agencies."
good,the best co-workers you could ever have. a typical work day was always eight hours. I work as a temparary employee but was always included in every activity that the company would host.
good,"People treated as company assets, not as human beings.  Some groups treated better than others. ""A"" team got what it needed and listened too while ""B"" team was marginalized.  Benefits and pay were good."
good,Pfizer has wonderful managers and technicians that were always in support of you doing better as an analyst. Work environment can make it very easy or very difficult to access managers in order to get feedback on performance. Great gig but the moment you start slipping they make it clear someone else can do you job

good,great place to work overall decent pay but under paid compared to all other pharmaceutical near by the rocky mount area...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
good,I have learned a lot about distribution as well as EHS and DG from time here. There are great benefits and people seldom leave. I am only thinking about leaving because I have reached a limit in learning and earning potential and would like to have the opportunity to gain more.
good,It pays well but like any large organization you are nothing more than a number.  They got kind of lax in their hiring practices.  Once again good place to work just not my cup of tea.

good,"juste un cdd donc pas trop de recul"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Pfizer as a contractor. The folks, for the most part were incredibly knowledgeable and committed. There was a culture of not following through with ideas that could be frustrating at times, because they could really benefit the whole. The frequent reorganizations and changing directions made it difficult to truly pursue a path toward the future, but I would still certainly return there in the future."
good,"A fast-paced, dynamic, global environment focused on continuous improvement with an Own IT culture, matrix-based, process-driven, and innovative environment"
good,Busy. Friendly environment. Willing to train you. Great location. Some managers like to micromanage. There is a sense of teamwork. It all depends on the department you work for.
good,They laid us all off. Bought a bad company with a bad drug therefore bye bye went our jobs. Sad thing because I really liked most everyone there and made good money.
good,This was in the antibiotic therapeutic area of infectious disease. The systems for reporting and report generation were excellent. There was Corporate Communication but virtually none within the department of Regulatory Affairs - CMC.

good,"Great benefits, big stable company. Although the company is quite large and there are many job posting it is possible to get stuck in certain role or certain groups. Flat org structure depresses promotional opportunities."
good,"Clean environment, work clothes are required and provided due to  what location in the plant you are working. Some upper management group leaders are down to earth and work well their subordinates. The twelve hour days can be difficult after three days. Hardest part of the day is working with trainers that don't want to train another female,more geared toward the male environment. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that I was not going to be chased away, so I made it another day. The twelve hour shifts are long and demanding, when upper management says one thing and practical on the floor is another. You can take time off if given far enough in advance."
good,Pfizer has a diverse culture with a high quality transparent policies and values. It is an equal oppertunity employer. I like its  OWNIT! logo & culture.
good,"Pfizer is a massive company with different cultures, personalities and workstyles depending on where you sit within the organization. I've worked across many groups and divisions - some were the best experiences of my career. One was the worst. It really depends on who you work with, for and how savvy you are a making the right political connections to cover yourself. Pfizer reorganizes constantly so never assume the role you are in will stay the role you are in."
good,"Uma empresa distante da cidade, mas temos o transporte privado."
good,"We were purchased by Pfizer three years ago. Changes have not completely taken place. Since management is basically the same, I am not sure if there is going to be a cultural change. Benefits may become better. The hardest part of the job is consistency. The most enjoyable part of the job is they try to adjust your schedule to meet life situations if possible."

good,"huge corporation great place to work opportunity for advancement "
good,Days are very busy with a challenging workload and engaged colleagues. Over the course of my career have learned many skill sets.

good,"came in to work with a line of people to begin drawing blood."
good,"Every day is extremely busy for all engineers."
good,Very sad that this once premier company has shed all the benefits that once made it the best company to work for.  Pfizer is now like any other big Pharma; cutthroat colleagues and diminishing benefits.

good,"Exponer en el profesional los beneficios sobre la marca que les presento y la evidencia cientifica que lo respalda."
good,My time at Pfizer working in the Animal Health Division in NYC was one of  the best assignments I was privileged to fulfill.  Sadly the assignment concluded at the time of the merger with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.  I so do miss working there.
good,"Dentro de mi labor es muy frecuente hablar de temas de inventario surtido de prodcutos ,relaciones comerciales con regentes de faramacias negocaiciones ,etc,todo esto me ha contribuido amejora comercial como peronalmente en elarea de las ventas en el area de mercadeo siendo una empres auqe cuenta con unos productos de la mas alta calidad y gran prestigio."
good,"A lot of people working to survive and growig over the other personnel.  Pushing the personnel to be the best in the world.  It was a good learning place.  EHS Hard philosophy Safety before all.  Great Salaries,"
good,"They foster a true environment of learning and collaboration. As a contractor, with the current financial situations it is not likely that permanent positions will result even if they are promised upon initial hiring."
good,bons trabalhos realizados com a equipe e com os propagandista.
good,"You are given an assignment in the morning as you come in you check your emails. I was trained by the stuff and every day was about learning new things and apply them in every day work. My supervisors at the end of my shift he will sit with me and ask about my day and how it was if I had any difficulties or I have some questions. Always asking for a feed back . Sometimes I will have something to say and sometimes we just have a chat. We work as a team and I worked well with my co-workers. The hardest part was that my contract was ending and there was no hope to renew it. When you have a great team you look forward to come to work every"
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,"A typical day at work was starting by meeting briefly my subordinates and re-cap what is expected in the day or the coming week. Review e-mails, prioritize, and assign to the corresponding subordinate. Learn about the challenges in a pharmaceutical mfg. site. Excellent co-workers and management, professionals in all senses. Hard part of the job is to achieve in limited time goals. Achieving what is expected is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Wyeth was a great company: good compensation/benefits, strong pipelines, good management, good job culture. Unfortunately it became Pfizer's target."
good,Pfizer is a indeed a good company to work with a very good job culture. The company needs to focus more on career Progression.
good,build up proposals of payment for help a families ragain their homes
good,This was a this was a great place to learn and hone my HR skills.
good,Irrelevant review. Site shut down and personnel got relocated/ let go.
good,Pfizer was a great company to work for. Managment was very supportive of a flexible work schedule.
good,"Gostei bastante de trabalhar na Pfizer, principalmente nos últimos anos. A Pfizer passou de uma empresa como uma gestão autoritária e com muitas regras, para uma gestão de responsabilidade, onde todos tinham uma voz e onde todos se sentiam importantes. A relação com as chefias intermédias e de topo era perfeitamente informal, com espaço para a franqueza. Todos tínhamos um objetivo: ser bem sucedidos! Competíamos uns com os outros, mas eramos amigos e respeitávamos a audácia e a humildade."
good,"The typical day work of a pharmaceutical representative early morning phycicians appointments. Details, marketing information. Calls 8 to 10 daily and after work  analsis next work preparation, study of clinical data reviews, exams and send data to headquaters."
good,"Great place to work with excellent benefits but due to industry utilizing contractors as opposed to full time staff, it makes for a shaky and uncertain work environment long term."
good,I was intern at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals for the summer. The co workers helped me lot as it was a completely different atmosphere comparing it to my previous internships. I was the only intern in the department and there was a great work load. It was a very good experience as i learned time management and how to customise reports according different supervisors preferences.
good,"Trabalhei na linha de especialidades oftalmologia, visitando médicos, com 30 líderes de opinião conceituados no Brasil e no mundo."
good,"Trouble shooting PC's."
good,Nice to work at Pfizer. Great organization and co-operative people.
good,Good company to work for.  Good room to move up.  Co workers are great.
good,"On a typical day I would either have an appointment with a doctor clinic or hospital  or I would cold call a propective client that was using pharmacuticals from one of my compettitors and I then would ask for opportunity to introduce them to a comparative product that they were currently using, and leave them some product information and tell them that I would get back with them in a couople of days or weeks , whichever fit better in their schedule or mine."
good,Extremely collaborative and bright group of folks across all groups.
good,"A typical day at work is meeting and talking to doctors and other hospital accounts employees/gatekeepers."
good,"A fast paced, multi-task environment that requires frequent adaptation to change.  I work with amazingly talented individuals who bring an impressive amount of knowledge to each and every project.  I have learned that the only constant in this industry is change.  You have to be willing to flow with the environment or you will sink.  The hardest part of my job is finding ways to be more efficient with less resources.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making individual contributions that impact the overall goal of our team."
good,"Learning and Development"
good,"I worked at Pfizer's R&D facility in La Jolla, which includes about 100 scientists and support staff. The best part of the job is working with people dedicated to helping patients. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the bureaucracy and politics of a global organization."
good,Great company for leadership experience and professional development.  
good,I worked very hard while at Pfizer managing and conducting quality visits for 4 protocols. I worked remote so I was able to get a lot more work completed and learned how to manage my time.
good,* Visites clients .Plaisir de les rencontrer et de leur parler des produits Pfizer.
good,"Ich fing um 08 Uhr morgens an.Ich habe gelernt medizinische Daten zulesen und zu erfassen.Meine Kollegen waren stets sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich.Am schwierigsten war für mich die Einarbeitung und am besten gefallen hat mir dann die Arbeit selbst,da ich dann nach einer gewissen Einarbeitungszeit,selbstständig arbeiten konnte."
good,Good learning experience and great place to progress ahead in career.
good,"Marketed Zithromax, Norvasc, Lipitor, Glucotrol XL and Viagra to primary care providers, urologists, dermatologists and cardiologists. Sold Zithromax in IV form to hospitals in ER, ICU, MICU, NICU, and hospitalist."
good,"I was employeed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for a number of years with increased responsibility. However, due to the economic down turn in 2009, my position was eliminated."
good,I worked at the Manpower office and for Pfizer through them. Very fast - paced job but friendly people.
good,Experiencia muy positiva que me ayudo a crecer en un ambiente de empresa multinacional en el cual cada día aprendes algo nuevo.
good,"Very busy all the time. I learned how to manage time and stress, the good managent and co workers helped with stress but the hardest part of the job was too many changes on a daily basis and the lock of consistency. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility of working from home."
good,"Highly motivated in vivo biologist with 10+ years experience in inflammation, obesity, and diabetes research in the pharmaceutical industry. Delivered high quality in vivo data to support preclinical compound development and facilitate their transition to clinical development. Provided in vivo expertise for the development of in vivo models to evaluate new and established targets. Experience in data analysis and interpretation, data presentation and production of study reports."
good,Was an excellent experience to work in a new project since the beginning until the completion of it.
good,"Great company to develop your knowledge by yourself, because doesn't offer trainings to their personnel."
good,"I learned how to handle with customer, solve their queries"
good,"Lieu de travail collaboratif, management à l'américaine, autonomie et rigueur"
good,"Good pace, professional, and slightly diverse. Location is in a tiny town in central KS. May not be ideal for young seekers who enjoy the hustle and bustle of larger metro cities."
good,"Pfizer stays on-top of who they are, an innovative company that ensures that therapy portfolios are meeting present needs. Because of this, structural changes are inevitable, roles are altered at least annually to met with the evolving trend. Be assured of a good work-life balance and a flexible work schedule."
good,"Often had to work late and some weekends to meet release schedules. Able to take laptop home to do work. Priorities often change throughout the day, so focus has to shift on a dime. Able to purchase a week's vacation above that earned. Good diversity and equal respect for all. Cafeteria meals subsidized.  Management focused on safety first, then releasing product and quality. Fair compensation and outplacement help for people downsized, but people left were overworked/stressed out."
good,"Same as answered previously."
good,"Belle usine !"
good,Learned how to manage visual inspection systems for biomed products.  The hardest part of the job was the culture change between the previous company and Pfizer.
good,"It really comes down to what position you have in the plant and what your shifts are in relation to where you live. those are the aspects of the job that really make it or break it. MOST positions are definitely worth the pay. great benefits and depending on the position, at this moment. there is unlimited over time. People are generally satisfied with their job at Pfizer."
good,"Company provides generous benefits and my division emphasizes work-life balance.  However, structure is screwy, I need to work with 4 or more attorneys to get anything accomplished and there is very poor role clarity that often results in interpersonal conflicts.  It is very frustrating to work here at times and some divisions are held to different (lesser or worse) standards which is super annoying.  At times it feels like I work for the government."
good,"Fun place to work and learn.  Good salary and benefits, however, there is a lack of focus due to the size of the organization; many repetitive functions targeting a similar endpoint."
good,"Pfizer is a very aggressive in the marketplace and has an own it culture putting the patients first for all the activities we have."
good,"Pfizer is a good place to start a career in the Pharmaceutical Industry, but keep in mind that most will not be able to advance beyond the title they start with unless they make an internal move to another department or seek a position outside the company."
good,"The good things"
good,Overall I really enjoyed working at Pfizer. However like many places there were things I didn't enjoy like the factions that were in place. There were groups that promotions happened for quite often and others that were overlooked. With Corporate America comes many changes and there were reorganizations happening on a regular basis. These sometimes seemed to be done strategically as some people would survive their area being reorganized no matter how long they had been there and others were not so lucky. I know there are politics in every company and it's just a part of life.
good,"Pfizer provided good people, good environment with a clear passion for patients.  It was obvious that the patient was the main focus and the science supported ensuring that was pulled through at every facet. Leadership was fantastic, but environment was extremely competitive and ability to move up was limited."
good,"Meu trabalho era traduzir do português para o inglês informações de eventos adversos recebidas por e-mail, carta, e contato de "
good,Was a consultant working at Pfizer. My hours were 8 to 5 Monday through Friday. The culture was process driven and fast paced. It was a very professional environment.
good,Great mentors in all aspect of the corporate world.  I worked as a biochemist for 10+ years and my mentors in Outsourcing and Project Management urged me to obtain an MBA.
good,Great culture with lots of opportunities to learn and grow. Opportunities to interact with other colleagues at other sites.  Also great flexibility for working parents!
good,"La compañía invierte con facilidad en el desarrollo profesional de los empleados, por otro lado, valdría la pena mejorar el ambiente laboral ya que hay mucha rotación."
good,"Me forme en esta compañía, ya que inicie desde practicante ,."
good,"Collaborative & Fun Place To Work - Great Benefits (401K, Health Insurance, Productive Atmosphere) - Paid Holidays - Paid Vaction - Half-Day Fridays During Summer."
good,"I am still friends with so many of the people I worked with. It was a great atmosphere, great amenities and benefits. If your job is not eventually eliminated, you will likely be a lifer and stay until retirement. This industry is very volatile though, so expect changes, a lot of them. It was great experience overall."
good,Opportunities to learn new things with wider vision and advancement in Analysis models and streamlined data collection from end to end business portfolio.
good,"Like any big business, hard to get things done.  Good salary and benefits and decent work life balance.  In the 12+ years I've been here, there are ups and downs.  For the most part, Pfizer has good management and quality employees and I've had the honor of working with some extremely talented individuals.  However, it takes a long time for bad managers/employees to be let go."
good,"Pfizer es una muy buena empresa para trabajar directamente cuenta con respaldo internacional, tiene una cultura laboral y estándares definidos claramente, lo mejor es el recurso humano y el direccionamiento, lo mas difícil es trabajar por intermedio de una empresa temporal y no directamente."
good,"Good company "
good,"Worked as a contracted CCR. Whole team was remote except for the manager. Great attitude, bonus's available. Lot's of driving. You set your own schedule and accomplish your own goals."
good,"Great place to work, but extremely demanding schedule. Generally good people.  Very difficult to advance your career in enabling functions due to such low turnover. No room to move."
good,"professionnels très enrichissants, cadre de travail agrèable"
good,its a challenging to be a part of multi national company but they allow me to grow and apply my expertise in sales specially dealing with medical doctors.
good,"Overall, Pfizer is a great company. Compensation and experience are exceptional. It has a highly formal environment. Things can be confusing as the company evolves almost every year due mostly to mergers and acquisitions and that never-ending goal to ""optimize."""
good,Pfizer offered me stability while the manufacturing plant was open.  Management did what they could to help colleagues with preparing for new jobs with a variety of training.  It was a good place to work.
good,Empresa que capacita a su personal a todo nivel. Con profesionales capacitados.
good,"I was one of the lucky ones to still have a job after Pfizer's purchase of Wyeth.  Back then, Pfizer has had a pretty poor image, of the big bully in the industry.  From then till now though Pfizer has been working hard on that image and have instituted several policies towards its ""No Jerks"" culture.  Every year we take a survey and every year I feel it is becoming a better place to work.  Pfizer embraces risks which is good."
good,"Nice to work with Pfizer, good experience, good culture, career goals. Improve your knowledge etc, incremental bonus, timely training to get yourself to Pfizer standards"
good,"A typical day at Hospira, now Pfizer work environment is stressful as a result of shortage in manpower to perform laboratory task. The employees are hard working, and the leadership in the lab try their best to create a conducive work environment."
good,"Empresa Global com muitas oportunidades a todos. Tecnologia de ponta, sempre a frente de seus concorrentes"
good,The culture could be better along with management but that is at any corporation. Pay is good alng with benefits but like i said the culture brings you down alot.
good,"Pfizer provided a great environment for professional development, career advancement and mentorship. I had many different roles, from working in the field as a medical professional, to regulatory affaris, leading teams, developing people, lead commercial operations and working in domestic and international markets."
good,The workplace culture is professional but fun. But the company at that time is under-going cost cutting that's why there were a lot of people who we laid off.
good,The typical day of work meant starting immediately after punching in and continuing that pace throughout the day.  Rotating positions made it less repetitive.
good,"A typical day at work was always fairly relaxed, the workload was never too heavy. The management was very supportive and helpful, and delegated challenging and enjoyable tasks throughout the placement."
good,"I was working here as a Label Room clerk, had lots of fun and learned a lot about pharmaceutical manufacturing as a whole. The plant was closed, as it was Pfizer's plans around the globe. Had to move on."
good,axé sur le développement des compétences et évolution  du salarié
good,"Gostei da empresa, atendeu todas as minhas necessidades como profissional tanto na parte de salario, ambiente e benefícios."
good,I like that management was well organized and plans seemed well implemented. The work was planned out well enough that our days were certainly busy and things got done.  We were given all the tools we were needed.
good,"Pfizer has one of the best salary/benefit packages. A collaborative working environment."
good,"Por ser contractors de Navitas, no pudimos seguir trabajando dentro de las instalaciones de Pfizer bogota, lo que me pareció una falta de respeto, porq sacaron a muchos contratistas que le prestan servicvios a Pfizer."
good,"i dont want to write a review blah blah "
good,There is a positive culture at Pfizer. It is a typical corporate environment and strict policies on bad behavior are enforced. There are events throughout the year to celebrate and bring people together.

good,Obiettivi di lavoro spesso difficili da raggiungere ma grosse motivazioni per riuscirci
good,Um empresa dinâmica e com excelente monitoramento de processo.
good,In Pfizer there are lot of learning and better work culture and compliance  among in pharmaceuticals industry. but still some working problems related to field.
good,Boulder is a great location.  The weather is always nice.  There are great shops and restaurants.  Pfizer is cool about getting sunshine and staying out doors.
good,"is a good place for work, great benefits and good procedures. very GMP focus and quality and safety is always first. I work there for 14 years. Good memories."
good,Once Wyeth was bought by Pfizer the process of closing the plant started so we all lost our jobs.  People were nice.  Job was good i enjoyed working with the products and making different products.
good,Good place but very demanding. People working there are nice. Managers are ok. Benefits are good. At higher level you really have to be visible to show that you are good.
good,"I loved my job at Pfizer but it was very stressful and I always felt there were not enough hours in the day to get my job done. The hardest part of the job was attending meetings and then trying to get your job done on time. You were treated as a professional in the respect if your child was sick or if you had an appointment, you could attend to your needs without a problem."
good,Worked there enough to learn a lot .It was a strategic way of working and the structure of job was somewhat complex.I Loved what i did cause it helped people with health issues
good,Good organization and learning environment. Work/home balance is good. Benefits are great compared to the average companies. Work culture is good and management works with you.
good,"Amazing training and trainers! To this day everything I learned in classroom training is of utmost value to me.  Lessons in pharmacology, medicine, customer relationships and self growth are very practical and I live by until now. Best company!"
good,Pfizer expects a lot from their employees but at the same time they are adequately compensated for their efforts if they are successful. I was one of those individuals. The fast pace is not for everyone.
good,"Entreprise trés agréable , toutes les dispositions sont mises en place pour mettre les employés dans les meilleurs conditions de travail."
good,"It was a great place to work, my life work balance was acceptable. I would have continued working there but the company decided to outsource our department to an agency,"
good,The compensation and benefit of Pfizer is world class. You won't find another company that has the resources to help you further your goal than Pfizer. The culture can be a little outdated but the standard and practices set are still relevant. The culture can be a little intimidating from the outside but it usually boils down to the team you are in and the manager's preference on how to run the group.
good,Intimate research facility where I could interact with all levels of employee and had the autonomy to develop and manage my programs.  Oversite of operations enhanced the quality of work.
good,"Opportunity to develop and acquire the skills necessary for future advancement. Others developmental opportunities include, fellowship, mentorship, and secondments."
good,Pfizer has some skills behind its success. There is a lot of growth potential for high achievers and great managers who motivate you to succeed. Some projects can have tight deadlines and are quite challenging.
good,Empresa numero uno farmaceutica donde se valora ante todo el interes por el paciente. La seguridad prevalece ante cualquier departamento y por el bien de los empleados
good,"however, they change them all of the time and you can get a good one or a bad one. I have had both kinds.  I loved my co-workers and they made work fun."
good,"I have been retired for 10 years so I don't know how the company is now.  I loved working at Pfizer.  I have a great job with good pay, plenty of job security and opportunities to to do a great deal and learn as much as I wanted."
good,"Great company in terms of salary and benefits.  Located right in Manhattan.  But no growth in revenues, so there's not much promotion or salary increases lately."
good,Pfizer was a good place to work. The benefits and vacation were great. I learned a great deal about the buying of medicines from one Company to another.
good,Good company to work for.  The culture has changed but overall it remains a great company. The company is always changing so you should be willing to adapt to change.
good,"Very good work/life balance. Co-workers can be very competitive trying to move up the corporate ladder at ANY cost, including taking your job.  Excellent pay and benefits."

good,"Good HR, but they need to be quicker with enacting policies that are more efficient and employee facing and to address issues that matter deeply to the highly motivated work force, otherwise they will loose belief and the organisation will loose this talent. HR slowness on addressing key employee issues, is something the organisation needs to be far better at"
good,"Started my career with Pfizer, fortunate to head with such firm that brought a brand value towards to my career."

good,A typical day could be anything but typical. Working in a fast paced environment schedules could change at the drop of a hat due to equipment failure or lack of staff. The hardest part in my day could be juggling the many personalities that one comes in contact with on a daily basis. I have learned patience is a virtue in dealing with people and changing routines and situations. It is satisfying at the end of the work day to see production run smoothly despite the delays and mishaps.
good,"Παγκόσμιος ηγέτης στην φαρμακευτική αγορά αλλά παρόλα αυτά πάρα πολύ ευάλωτος στις οικονομικές αλλαγές ισορροπιών ."

good,"O facto de termos flexibilidade de horário, permite-nos ter uma certa autonomia em relação a nossa agenda."

good,"Directed software development activities for business process mapping of the client and identifying appropriate development methodology; carrying out activities like prioritizing tasks, development, mentoring, preparing test cases, tracking schedule and defect"
good,"Pfizer continues to be an outstanding leader in Pharmaceuticals.  It is a mentally stimulating, challenging place to work that rewards high performance."
good,"My day begins with the shift update, shift huddle and shift expectation.  I have learned to understand the art and science of leadership, management and making decision using the decision tree.  Also the school and real life version of managing direct reports have conflicts."
good,"Pfizer was a great company to work for as they had great benefits, and if in the right department, a lot of fun people to work with every day.  Due to multiple mergers, they have been downsizing for years with what appears, no end in sight."
good,"Nos meus anos na Pfizer aprendi muito tecnicamente (novas metodologias, processos, etc...), bem como na parte gerencial dos processos & resultado e decisões baseados em análises de risco. Aprendí muito a gerenciar e desenvolver equipes de trabalho focado em resultados e melhorias contínuas."
good,"Extremamente desafiante, somos permanentemente estimulados a nos desenvolvermos e a superarmo-nos."
good,"	Oversee P&L, Budgeting, Forecasting, and Business Planning"
good,"Em questão de salario e benefícios são um dos atributos mais atraentes desta empresa, empresa que presa o compromisso com o cliente, e que tem bem estabelecido seus valores, respeito ao empregado e a comunidade, aos clientes principalmente, quanto a promoção, ainda não tem sólidos e aplicáveis conceitos o que desestimula o funcionário, a gerência é pontual e têm grande capacitação para gerir o negócio, mas como detêm  poder de promover o funcionário e ainda não desenvolveu ferramentas adequadas para isso, não foi melhor pontuada e outro ponto fraco é conseguir manter o equilíbrio entre o trabalho e vida pessoal, pois as metas são ousadas e o funcionário acaba não cumprindo no tempo determinado suas tarefas, gerando acumulo de horas tralhadas e horas de descanso."
good,"It was the most challenging but fun job I have ever had. I was given tremendous opportunities to grow as a scientist as well as a person.  I came to work every day thinking what need to be done to answer that critical question in order to move the project forward. The hardest part of the job was to face tough deadlines on the regular bases; in return we were able to advance multiple programs to the clinic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, the culture. We managed to fit many fun events between busy schedules, for instance, miniature golf tournament, chili cookout contest, Thanksgiving potluck and many more. It was a good place to work."
good,Ability to work remotely is a big plus. A typical day consists of emailing/phone calls and meetings. Managing numerous documents and timelines along with time zone differences.
good,ts a good place to work in some areas of the company. Some areas are not a good place depending if you like hearing people gossip all day and talk about you behind your back. and theres other places where the work is so slow its hard to stay up and not fall asleep
good,"Being well structured company, it's so pleasant to work there"
good,"nieuwe afdeling,nieuwe collega's en een uitdaging"
good,A great opportunity to learn new skills and advance career. Department was re-locating its employees and found a new position at Merck.
good,Being the study manager and helping to conduct the flow and efficeincy of the study is the most enjoyable part about this position.
good,A typical day at Pfizer is calling on many physicians each day and weighing the importance of each call you make. It is important to consistently review product trends and determine where to focus your time. Solid messaging is key to creating growth in products.
good,Advancement/Job Security is not given when you are a contractor. This was my first contractor role and I enjoyed being part of the team. I am not looking forward to having to find a new job in the coming months. I won't be looking for a contractor position moving forward.
good,"Very supportive of providing for colleagues an excellent work life balance. ALlowing flexible work schedules, working from home, and supportive sick days make this a good company to work for when you need to make time for your home life as well."

good,"Good: stimulating work with patients and healthcare professionals,compensated well"
good,"*Usually the day is really busy with multiple tasks,mainly due to teh huge and tremedous activties required for spin off BU and acquistations for some othe busiensses and companies. inaddition to the above the old systems are another reason for bsing busy all day long."
good,"Solid benefits, flexible schedule, quality focused, visionary top management that strives to be competitive within the industry, embraces innovation, technology and research"
good,Pfizer is a fast-paced organization; not for the faint of heart. It's a competitive and at time cut-throat organization.
good,"Very laid back atmosphere, comfortable place to be. Managers very easy and available to talk to. I would work there again given the chance."
good,"Pfizer is a great company to work for. Great pay and great benefits. Security is not strong, with the continuous shutting down of facilities."
good,"Great place to work if you come in as a manger. They balance between actual work and down time if great. co-workers were great, but management seem to be a little full cut throat when deadlines approached."
good,"My co-worker were very helpful, and made working here easy."
good,"Pfizer is an extremely large company with many opportunities. Working with the Supply Chain group, I learned the process of clinical trials, the planning and forecasting of these processes and felt that I truly contributed to the roll-out of valuable pharmaceuticals. I worked with wonderful and intelligent people. The most difficult part of working at Pfizer was working on so many projects at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture this company embraces."
good,Learning a lot about Project and People management.
good,"The Brooklyn facility has closed as of 2008. Pay was great, and they promoted a family atmosphere."
good,"Pfizer was the pharma company of the previous decade. It grew exponentially in the nineties to become the largest in the world. Coming from a mid-size company as Pharmacia-Upjohn, I was delighted to promote my portfolio of products with every resource I could possibly need. The culture was one dominated by aggressive sales goals and fast corporate pace set in New York city headquarters. The sheer size of the company was its major asset and eventually its liability, Pfizer now is trying to redefine itself for the next evolution as it adapts to the new era in healthcare where small and agile companies tend to thrive, and where pharmaco-economics are as important as the promotion behind a brand."
good,Culture and everything was extremely good and co operative. Management was very good..We were doing lots n lits of product training at office and from time to time we had refresher course for updation.
good,"First in class medicines, fair compensation, good work-life balance, smart and capable coworkers, ethical business practices, moderate level of job stability"
good,I was very over worked and not appreciated. I was the only forklift operator for my company and they wouldn't train anyone else. I felt like boss did not have my back when a problem occurred!
good,Pfizer work environment is good with workload as well as fun activities. It was a pleasant experience working with Pfizer and would recommend to every individual looking for a job here to apply for the same.
good,They have really Great Benefits/Pay  and its a great place to gain experience. The only thing is that the balance of work and life can be a little tough with overtime
good,"The overall work experience in Pfizer - good"
good,We work suitable in workplace. there are separated room. Employees act friendly. Work-environment is not stressful. The management is new generation.   the hardest part of the job is uncertainty.
good,Good place to start a career and add to your knowledge of the field. Many opportunities to learn about different aspects of drug development and pipelines.
good,i enjoyed my work in the company but at certain point of time it was uncertainty in the company i found so i decided to quit and than gave my hand to my farming  along with my father .   now i want to work  freely .
good,Great company to work for. Good and clean facility. Recommended for all ages. Can learn a lot and also advance to other departments if looking for a future with company.
good,Pfizer is a great company. It has great products and great performance. The company never stops seeking change opportunities and it's the key reason that it can sustain in this dynamic industry.
good,Typical Contractor function. Was hired due to my previous experience in another Pharma Company. Contractors are tasked to manage day to day field activities and support Pfizer project managers. Based on your experience and capacity they would let you have some kind of independence of how you manage your projects/tasks. As always there were some on-site personnel that blamed contractors for their mistakes. You will need to move on if you are not to progress. No space for growth or opportunity to get a full time position.
good,"My job was unique to the organization, created to better manage meeting production vendors.  I standardized budget submissions and proposal guidelines and worked with executives to choose appropriate vendors for meeting projects.  My goal was to lower costs and maintain quality services.  Provided script writing and visual development for executive presentations and creative elements.  My role required frequent domestic and some international travel to Pfizer meeting sites.  I managed a small team of in-house Meeting Producers.  "
good,Azienda in continua evoluzione.
good,"Working at Pfizer for 2 years during the sale of Hospira to ICU Medical was an experience. Pfizer treated the Infusion Pump System with respect and integrity. Knowing we would be sold, Pfizer corporation supported executive leadership with their vision on the business unit. Pfizer was honest with communications and their intentions, which is rare. Management was supportive and encouraging during the selling process. I enjoyed my employment with Pfizer and would gladly work for Pfizer again."
good,"Pfizer is one of the last companies that still follow the long standing policy of rewarding their employees. the culture/workplace is great, if there is one negative to working at Pfizer, its there continued reduction of departments and staff."
good,Great company to work. Leadership practices its core values to its true spirit. High respect for colleagues and work life balance. Meetings can be reduced and decision making can be improved.
good,Great company with wonderful benefits. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor. Great staff to work with and good management. Not much room for advancing.
good,"Good place to work with a good ""Work-Life"" balance plus sound management teams. Great knowing that you're working for the largest global animal health company."
good,Salário poderia ser um pouco melhor para propagandista médico.
good,Excellent place of employment.  Good benefits and a supportive culture.  Expectations are high but you are provided the tools and resources to succeed and have the support of management.
good,"I worked in three separate departments over three summers. All of them were very different environments with different job expectations and management styles. While most people were supportive and interested in helping you succeed, there was definitely a sense of competition and arrogance among the other interns. There was also a VERY strong corporate/business vibe (which may be expected, as it is a large company.)"
good,Working with the world's no 1 organization with a good  working culture. No much tension in doings things. And the best quality is there is no senior junior criteria everyone is equal .
good,"I am very impressed with the management team at the Rochester site.  The site leader is very transparent and a hard worker.  He's very approachable and honest with his people and is very user friendly.  Unfortunately I am a contractor and at the time the site does not have the head count to hire me direct, the site leader was very honest about this however the contract company that I work for was not and unfortuantely I have to put myself back in the market in order to get better benefits.  Overall, I love being at the location just wish I could be direct for the benefits."
good,"No comments just a good company. "
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Most managers are great.  Upper management is very good, with some unfortunate headstrong jerks (as the company refers to them); however, the high up you go, the more Jerk-Like behavior is tolerated with virtual impunity. "
good,"Collected and distributed laptops. Imaged and re-imaged computers, plus addressed clients deskside issues."
good,I worked as a contingent worker in the summer of 2014.  I had a wonderful experience there and would go back to seek employment in the analytical lab.
good,"Advancement is almost entirely dependent on sales numbers, which can be a difficult hurdle to overcome if you happen to have a territory with difficult access and/or less than favorable insurance coverage."
good,"bonne entreprise, entreprise avec de gros moyen qui prend grand soin de ses employé."
good,Pfizer was a great place to work as a sales representative.  Very competitive salary structure and educational training was top notch. Management was supportive and educational reimbursement was a great option.

good,"Trabajar en esta empresa fue un privilegio, y aprendi mucho"

good,"A day at the office is to manage the calendars of my team, make sure that they have what they need, especially if they have meetings. I also check if team members have to travel soon. If there are team members traveling, I assist them with their flight and hotel bookings and also visa processing if needed."
good,"I worked as Professional Healthcare Representative doing promotions to Healthcare Professionals.As part of our job with Pfizer, we underwent regular trainings on the technical aspects of  the products we promoted. During these sessions, we are updated with various medical studies as supporting evidences to products’ efficacy and safety. These trainings improved our knowledge about the products as well as relevant medical background including pharmacology. Our daily work improved my selling skills. I find it hard when I was still new in my territory but I was able to manage and cope with it. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to dealt with different types of people. I love working with them with diverse interest and background, It gave me the opportunity to grow and developed my excellent communication and interpersonal skills."
good,Pfizer is one of the best organisation to work with ! It's values OWN IT culture embibe in employees and give a way forward to work for the growth of employe and organization!  I am proud to be a Pfizerian 😊

good,"Excellent benefits.  "
good,Enjoyed my time working at Pfizer.  Great resources to advance the portfolio.  Great history and scientific depth in the Boston/Cambridge area.  Sometimes there is a disconnect with HQ and satellite offices.

good,Apegados a procedimiento y aprendizaje constante. Crecimiento laboral
good,"Friendly work atmosphere "
good,Unsure what the future may hold for Legacy Hospira employees. People work day by day because we they don't know if they will be laid off or if a department will be sold.

good,not much promotion and career advance opportunities; much politics on project assignment; good pay and relaxed culture; clear established SOPs and WIs
good,Good company to work for except there is little job security.  Culture at sites can vary.  Collegeville is fairly laid-back with a majority of people being legacy Wyeth.
good,Great group that I worked with.  Everyone had everyone covered if time off was needed as well as a lot of benefits.  Left due to better income offer..
good,"Pfize is a nice company to work at culture wise, ambiance wise, and includes contingent workers. Everyone is helpful, works as a team, is understanding of certain situations that can arise.

good,"Pfizer's business model of purchasing other pharmaceutical companies and integrating their existing product and development pipelines generates a lot of money and a lot of work. However, it also provides little job satisfaction because your efforts are often outdated before projects are completely implemented and job security is basically non-existent. There is constantly a new company in the acquisition pipeline and your replacement may very well work for that company. Layoffs are a constant consideration as they have standing monthly waves for separation agreements to facilitate the integration of new companies."
good,"Great place to work over time may vary, great people to be around , but annoying management . yearly raises and bonuses , very easy job with room to advance."
good,Great place to work. Good mgmt. and direction. Great co workers. Family atmosphere. Mgmt. always available to help or communicate with employees. Very fair

good,"Exciting and rewarding as a sale staff as its sales commission is one of the highest and most lucrative sale commission in the industry. I learned the most with this organization from all the relevant and qualitative training programmes by qualified world reknown trainers which would have cost me greatly if i had to pay to attend all those invaluable courses carried out by world reknown trainers globally."
good,"Pfizer is a nice and fair company. As long as you are capable, there are many development opportunities. I would stay at Pfizer if it were not a requirement for frequent travel to the NYC office as I am in other state."
good,Worked with a lot of people my age who enjoyed what they do. Management was also very interactive with the employees. The work environment was also very motivating
good,A contractor was always at risk here. No idea how long the job would last. Sometimes pitted against other employees unfairly. The direction of the company seemed to always be in flux
good,"Close to home, has allowed me to be medically certified, taught me to be orderly and by the books, and had made me feel like I accomplish something every day I come in."
good,"Pfizer is a large pharmaceutical company.  The location I work is is an acquired company.  The most challenging part of the job is the battle between the two cultures.  The older company is still resisting the ""Pfizer"" way of doing things."
good,A good place to work. Growth opportunities. Work life balance. Bonus is good. Promotion criteria not very clear. Ethical Company. Varius programs to keep employees motivated.

good,"For all of the companies that I work for , this was the best. The staff, researchers and management was excellent. The facility was excellent and all employees where treated great."
good,"The benefits you got made it hard to leave. I was busy, in an environment where documentation and procedures were clearly specified.  Working in other industries made me miss Pfizers policies."

good,Boa Empresa com bons valores e programas aos colaboradores

good,"Very happy working there. Management very helpful, in training, and advancement. Good work habits, and follow all safety rules."
good,"Workplace culture is great and you will be kept busy. It is a fun environment, but the work can be pretty demanding. Continue to learn and expand skills on your own time because you'll mainly focus on a couple of skills. The work is rewarding at the end of the day, but it is very easy to get lost in the trenches of the daily grind."

We worked with a broad range of instruments and methods (HPLC, UPLC-MS, GCMS, UV-Vis, FTNIR, FTIR, among others), which I am grateful for. I suppose the hardest part of the job was closing the site down. I was responsible for closing the lab, dispositioning the instrument and the chemicals, including training our replacement at the new site."

good,I have learned to work with different people in different departments at the highest standards to achieve a common site goal. The job was very enjoyable and rewarding because I had the opportunity to work on many different ad varied tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the quality of the people that I worked with each and every day. The most difficult part of the job is knowing that the site is slated to close and moving on

good,I worked in NL offices in Rotterdam. It was a pleasant environment to be in but I believe it's not really suitable for young people who look fasted passed development.

good,"In my position at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals I was responsible for the entire state of North Dakota. My typical workday included calling on the psychiatrists in my territory, preparing for the next day of calls, reporting results to the home office and to my district manager. Staying in touch with my counterparts was very valuable to me. I learned many valuable selling techniques from them, and the exchange of information was how I learned."
good,"Pfizer provides the needed training essential for the job. Employees welfare is a priority to the company. Being part of Pfizer makes you feel secured in most aspect.

Mis supervisores depositaban mucha confianza en mi y cada vez que eso ocurría, me esmeraba mucho mas por hacer todo correcto, y a ellos les gustaba enseñarmme hacer otras cosas.

I would then refer to a book of contacts for the responsible persons in charge of that specific equipment and notify them with the type of alarm that was activated. I learned to contact and dispatch the appropriate tradesmen to service alarms also. My managers were always very courteous and helpful.

Work/life balance is a priority with this company....in the New York City region the employees in those offices leave half day each Friday.  Fitness center complete with a sauna, employee health staffed with doctors/nurses, daycare in the building for those occasions when a parent has a hard time finding a sitter, a cafeteria with good food that is subsidized by the company to keep the prices reasonable, Six Flags amusement park outing every June where only Pfizer employees along with their friends and family are in the park and back in 2006 when I worked there an all you can eat buffet down the hall from the cafeteria for $7.50 you had waiter/waitress service with a menu theme that changed each day of the week.  In the amenity area they did drop the ball by selling the consumer healthcare division to Johnson & Johnson and closing the great company store where employees could purchase their products (Listerine, Benadryl etc.) for a fraction of the cost at a pharmacy....but again no company is perfect!"
good,"Keep looking at the our ticket Queue throughout the day"
good,"Pharmaceutical sales has changed dramatically over the years.  I do not feel that this is singular to Pfizer but is industry wide.  The job itself is still enjoyable but the impact that sales reps have on changing behavior is weakened by the power that insurance companies have on what is prescribed.  Federal and state health agencies also apply great pressure to hold down healthcare costs.  But with that said, Pfizer continues to try and remain relative in this ever-changing market.  They have very talented people in all levels of the company and the sales organization is no exception.  I learned early on that regardless how good you are as a salesman if research cannot bring products to the market in a timely fashion you become a financial liability.  The hardest part of the job is the fear that sits in the back of your mind causing you to wonder if this is the year that you will get displaced.  But the relationships you build with healthcare providers, their staffs and your co-workers make it worthwhile."

Trabalho em equipe, na Pfizer é levado muito em conta, uma vez que a ideia é colaborar com os mais novos, e também buscar ajuda dos mais experientes. Nestes 20 anos de empresa conquistei o respeito e a amizade de todos os colegas das equipes onde trabalhei.

They did not micro manage and they were always willing to listen. My co-workers always lend a helping hand. They help complete any task as a team member. The hardest part of the job was convincing team members to get pertinent information to me in time to submit for deadlines. I would end of working sometimes until 2:00 a.m. to make sure all information was submitted into our systems for processing. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling, planning and coordinating meetings."

good,"King Pharmaceuticals was the ideal place for me to work at that paticular time in my life. As you can tell from my history there was advancement opportunities and even though my education was in the secreterial side of the workforce, it allowed me to branch out into the IT part of the corporate world.

good,"Great place to work as long as you and your supervisor are on the same page😉 Job satisfaction is largely dependent on a good working relationship with other Pfizer reps in your territory/division. As long as you are doing your job and consistently working hard, management makes every effort to help you meet and advance your career goals. Excellent opportunity for advancement- hard work is rewarded. Job training is top notch- I don’t think anyone else offers job training at this high level.  One downside would be that the large majority of newly hired sales reps are very young (recent college grads, early to mid twenty-something’s) who can lack experience /maturity in a way that can sometimes negatively effect their contribution to the “team player” environment Pfizer encourages."

good,Wyeth was a place I liked working at very much. I truly enjoyed working with my co-workers and supervisors. The supervisors were promoted from within and knew what the workers were dealing with daily. The work environment was clean and the work was not strenuous although it could be monotonous at times. It was like working with friends and family. The only part I did not like was working in certain parts of the building in the summer that were not air conditioned. If they had not downsized and eventually shut down I would probably still work there. It was the kind of place where some employees had fifty or more years.

I became the assistant/marketing executive of the senior product manager of Pfizer. On a day to day basis, I do research, field works, interviews, and made use of all the resources which are present in the company and not present inside the company. Meaning, I was able to become resourceful in getting information about the product and its competitors. The manager became very helpful to me since she was helping me out by giving comments and suggestions on what I'm doing. The thing that excites me also about Pfizer is the culture that they share amongst other employees. They have this 'family ties' relationship and positive outlook towards work that I don't normally see in other companies. That also made my job more fun and enjoyable. I didn't treat my job stressful because of my colleagues. However, the hardest part of the job was thinking of campaign materials to use. I consider it the hardest because I got a lot of ideas on my mind then. Good thing that the manager was helping me out which campaign materials to consider."

A gerência sempre me acompanhava e acrescentava informações de produtos e comportamento que sempre agregavam.

A Pfizer sempre cobrava muito a questão de número de visitas, o que nem sempre era possível e este foi o ponto mais difícil de atender.
