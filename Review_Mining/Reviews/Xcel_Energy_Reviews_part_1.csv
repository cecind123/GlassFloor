rating,review
bad,This company does not value its employees.  From my experience the employees in other departments or workgroups are only out for themselves and do not take accountability for their own responsibilities.
bad,"Xcel uses mostly contract employees, pay is low, and opportunity to become permanent employee rare.  Some coworkers had very little experience in scheduling and wouldn't budge from using template even if float affected."
bad,"Most corrupt, unethical managers I’ve ever seen.  VPs are all about themselves and require unethical behavior from their employees.  People were disciplined for no reason.  It was worse for minorities."
bad,"Xcel was the worst company I ever work for. When it was NSP I love my job."
bad,"Depressing, non-supportive work environment. I was not given much direction and the pay was very, very minimal.  I will probably never take another assignment here again."
bad,This company was the most corrupt culture I ever worked for. You are a number and make money. Ask for a raise and they will say they can’t afford it. The company is greedy and will undercut its employees left and right. The working environment is toxic and it’s like a mean girls club and men will act like they are in a frat and not respect the outcasts. You will be working 70+ hours no matter what corporate position your in or a leadership role. Everyone I’ve known has left here or absolutely miserable .
bad,"I had a conflict with my manager which could not be resolved by my continued employment, I used the proper chain of command at every level to get the concerns addressed, I made every effort to resolve the issues and concerns I had to the satisfaction of all involved, but was not able to find a common understanding and I left the company"
bad,"Xcel is a fine example of a bunch of slackers with jobs, wasting company money, playing on their cell phones for the better part of their day. Disgusting place and people to work with. I would not recommend."
bad,It was a difficult environment to work in while I was there. The manager already had her foot out the door and there was a lack in specific direction for all working under her.
bad,"If you do not answer enough phone calls as fast as you can your are warned. If you take a break at the wrong time, you are warned. If you take a phone call and the person on the other end is foul, you are warned. Not a good environment."
bad,"Who you know and if you are part of the ""good ole boy"" system are the only things that count here.  Your work ethic and desire to assist never are considered.  I was thankful that this was a contract short position.  They did offer me a permanent position which I declined."
bad,You don't really receive proper training. It was all about collections which is expected. It was challenging and stressful. Co- workers didn't really help when you would have a question or problematic caller.
bad,one of the worst experience of my working life they promised me hours and never called me in took the word of other and did not call me to let me know they had let me go waited until i asked about hours to tell me
bad,A typical day at work was overwhelming. There wasn't enough service reps to fulfill the need of the customers. There hardest part of the job was keeping up with the day to day service levels.
bad,"Learned a lot of things on my OWN as my co-worker was unwilling to help me for fear of losing her job.  Constantly sending emails about me to others, talking behind my back and creating a stressful work environment.  It was allowed, then she was given a talking to and then it went right back to what it was and nothing was done about it."
bad,don't work here not  a fun place to work management is horrible and has less experience than a lot of the people underneath them
bad,This company is no longer in business. This is a good thing. I later learned this company was involved with several tax evasions etc. The system was corrupt and the doors were closed. The employees old and present at time of the doors closing really had no idea.
bad,"Southwestern Public Service is very distinct from the two other utilities that make up Xcel (NSP and PSCO). It is at least twenty years behind most other large IOU's in wages, benefits, work methods, and system design. The difference in the Journeyman Lineman wage between PSCO in Colorado and SPS in New Mexico is over six dollars an hour. The medical insurance for SPS is actually more of a catastrophe insurance with an extremely high deductible. Vacation accumulation is extremely slow. It takes years to get a decent amount of time off at SPS."
bad,"Company culture is less to be desired.  When a company wants to dictate who you can associate with outside of the company, that is a red flag in my opinion."
bad,I have never worked in a more toxic work environment. If you enjoy bullies and management full of drunks and drug addicts then this is the place to work.
bad,"I worked as a contractor, in Arvada. It was good at first, but then some of the permanent workers treated me like dirt."
bad,"I was so disappointed with Xcel.  I took a contract position to get my ""foot"" in the door only to find that the advancement opportunities were non-existent.  You were advanced based on who you knew, not what you knew.  Employees were placed in management positions who had no experience managing and made it difficult for everyone in that department."
bad,"Xcel is a good company. Most of the employees I met there worked in the company for more than 10 years. The company offers opportunities for advancement and have a good talent retention strategy. However, unfortunately, had a very bad manager that was not professional and very reactive, so I decided to leave my position."
bad,"When I worked at Xcel I did the following tasks:"
bad,Didn't like the cooling tower industry. Pay too low and Company sucks. Management only cared about production and the money that goes into their pockets with job  completion bonus.
bad,"Xcel energy is a great company to work for as long as your not in the call center. I dealt with daily verbal abuse, which was my job how ever it was very hard to be motivated when the company did not allow any down time and promised benefits after 3 months during the hiring process, and then told us we would have to pass their test. Scheduling was done way in advance so it was hard to get a day off and expectations to take on other work load was ridiculous. The Pay was ok but should have been better for the work being done"
bad,"Team Lead, Management have only favorites. you do not move to other jobs, if you go to school they do not help you reschedule your hours, if you have a doctors appointment it is hard to get time off."
bad,The position I applied for wasn't the position I worked as. The companies culture is horrible. Company is backward in technology and lack a lot of efficiency.
bad,"You will start as a contractor and probably end there as well.  There has been no traction for hiring on full time for almost 4 years.  12 hr shifts with no over time.  Managers lack leadership skills as well as technical skills.  "
bad,"HomeSmart is a division of Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy is a very good company and I highly recommend it. "
bad,"The bullying is being done by HR and--it seems--this is the accepted method of employee discipline, complaining about does not work. HR makes the workplace look similar to the school yard, except the cafeteria is more expensive."
bad,"Really tough place to work.  Some groups are ok but overall the company is very toxic.  Very little collaboration.  Constant reorganization efforts.  Benefits are being cut.  Bonus targets are being cut.  Utility industry is in trouble and has limited options for growth so cutting employees and employee expenses are only areas company can manage.  While there is little loyalty in corporate America, there is ZERO loyalty to employees at Xcel."
bad,"What can you say about a regulated monopoly?"
bad,"First I will say, I have an amazing supervisor, that is a perfect example of what other leaders should be.She is the reason, why I have stayed as long as I have. Unfortunately, the other leads overshadow this and make working there a not so great experience. The company works backwards in achieving goals. The call center goal is good customer service and reduce call backs. However, we receive a large amount of call backs due to new hires and high turn over ratio. If you stay on a call too long to fix the issue, your numbers are negatively affected, if you have to place an outbound call to resolve the issue, your numbers are negatively affected, if you have to place the customer on hold to get help or call a specialist your numbers are negatively affected. Things outside of your control negatively affect your pay, your schedule and your ability to move up.If you had to go to the doctor because your child is sick, you are not excused. If you are hospitalized due to an emergency outside of your control, you are not excused. During training a girl needed emergency surgery and was hospitalized for three days, those were her only absences, she was fired. I wish I could say I am exaggerating, but I am not. You can get away with somethings depending on wether or not you are liked by your supervisor. The place is very unprofessional, there is alot of favoritism and injustice to agents who have given years of hard work to this company. There are not many longtime agents anymore as most have quit, due to the environment created when SPS was bought by Xcel Energy. The communication between"
bad,"I spent many long hard years with Xcel, looking forward to retiring. They have an ongoing war with their union employees. Each year they take away more benefits. The working conditions are unsafe in their power plants. Many calls to OSHA and the labor board. Management makes life unbearable. Constantly changing work shifts, not following the union contract. But life is great for electricians and managers .Managers caught stealing millions while they go to the PUC and ask for more money! They seem to want to be the next Enron."
bad,"I thought it was gonna be there forever.  The management and lack of PUC training, made that decision for me. "
bad,The stress level could be so much less if we all just tried to get along rather then to try to make each other look bad in order to make ourselves look good.
bad,"Management totaly disengaged and unaware of plant status."
bad,I have already worked at excel the interview and time to hire you was quick and easy but just after got hired on went down the drain had trouble getting schedule I needed
bad,"Overall, there were some nice people working there. The glaring issue I dealt with was bullying- on a daily basis. The worst part was that lower level and upper level management were fully aware of it and did next to nothing about it. They seemed unwilling/afraid to take them on themselves. I ultimately managed to find another job and left. However, I don't think I would have wanted to stay just because of the depressing office atmosphere; it's library quiet and really seems to have a lot of unhappy people there. It's physically a bunch of cubes that offered almost no privacy, drab walls, no color.. and consequently, no life. Essentially the opposite of a Google or Best Buy Co. Not to mention, there's no contractor training other than being reliant on a coworker or two to try to help (and none of them were very keen on that)."
bad,"There's a lot of learn and great opportunities working in the lab and plant environment, but be warned its a pretty depressing culture/environment to work in, most people were not very enthusiastic about their job and it showed every day, and the management needs a serious wakeup call.  There was little to no direction given and nobody wanted to take responsibility for my development, this absolutely must change if the younger generation is going to assimilate and take over otherwise they will be in a huge world of trouble."
bad,"If you are a contractor and you work here, run. Run fast, run far. Do not look back. You career can easily be ruined by the lack of management and zero ethics of your coworkers, some of whom have no business being employed by anyone ever."
bad,"It paid very well, but was hard to deal with the customers at times. There were great benefits, and good coworkers. Managers helped you if you needed."
bad,"This was a very stressful place to work, due to management flip flopping our daily procedures.  I did enjoy reading meters, I did the same thing everyday but not in the same place."
bad,Management is not the best. Liked the hours. Was a ok job while it lasted. Not pleased with my experience. Hope yours will be better. Being a contractor with them is not what you want.
bad,"This company is too corporate to care about a single employee. Too strict on absences, they would rather you be sick at work and get the entire call center sick then let an employee rest and get better for a day. They have to offer great benefits to keep their employees, with out the benefits no one would stay. Customers are horrible to deal with, they change protocol all the time and you have to train yourself and keep yourself up to date with new rules. You are graded on everything you do. If you like to be hounded for every action you take, xcel is the job for you!"
bad,"managers leading groups that have never supervised in their lives. not so good. no education, at all for most of the middle and some of the senior leadership. show up with a couple degrees & experience and you're a threat - especially if you're a minority."
bad,The culture of this company is that of a large company where profits always out weigh both the employee and customer.  They tend to cut corners in as many ways as possible so that they can meet their bottom line.
bad,"I learned my job and had received good feedback on my performance.  I was let go due to too many occurances.  No consideration was given to the situation to realize it was beyond my control and if they were placed in the same situation they would have choose the same path I took.  I had to leave due to wildfires as well as state highway closings and wondering if my home would be affected.  Yes I had other occurances some due to accident's on highways or street's getting to work which would detain or cause me to be tardy, and even some due to illness but still,  no consideration was given to the situation again.  I was"
bad,"It's a very ""conservative"" environment and socializing is not allowed. Management is very hands-off and employees do not receive any formal training. Employees must find their own projects as they do not receive any guidance from supervisors or management. People complain about the smallest things and you have to be prepared for a very harsh and strict environment. Many people are unhappy and openly express that. Many have either left the company or are currently looking for a new job. With all the changes, Xcel makes the transition harder than it needs to be and nobody has a clue what is going on. Management doesn't even know what is going on."
bad,"The opportunity to learn new technical skills was the norm. "
bad,"There are no benefits and the schedules are crazy and its too much work for the amount of pay that they give you. They promise advancement, but there are employees who have been there for several years and are still not permanent employees."
bad,Biggest mistake I have made professionally by coming to this company.  My supervisor does not promote growing as an employee or moving on to different roles int he company.  Often puts up roadblocks when trying to switch roles.  Micro manages every little detail.
bad,"Very high pressure call center. On phone with continuous calls most days. You are required to be on-call and able to report to work within one hour.  You are not paid for being on call unless you have to go in.  You have to learn A LOT of information and work fast. You must have good computer skills and be able to type fast. Your calls are monitored for quality. Every minute of your day is measured.  You can't hang up on abusive customers. No time between calls. Always understaffed.  Constant hiring.  Must compete with coworkers for shifts based on performance. No seniority.  Mandatory overtime last several years.  Many benefit cuts including incentive pay, hourly pay, healthcare benefits, retirement benefits.  Cuts hurt the lowest paid workers. CEO and upper management salaries are excessive with generous incentives. Few opportunities for advancement.  Many people in the same job for years in the call center. Low morale.  If you can get out of the call center it might be a good place to work."
bad,"The job had potential to be great with lots of opportunity to learn and grow for someone who is new to the energy market and eager to get involved. However, unfortunately the management in my department (risk) was too busy backstabbing and fighting each other every waking minute. It's nearly impossible to get fired from the company, so its acceptable to be incompetent at managing people, while simultaneously being incompetent at your actual job. The company is also full of lifers just waiting for their pension, so there's limited to no upward movement."
bad,Great benefits and pay for the area but every one is related to one another. Large portion of the Union members are super lazy and giving up their jobs to contractors. Xcel hates coal so they are not putting any money into units 1 & 2 in hopes something happens so PUC will let them close sooner.
bad,Don't work here unless you are solely committed to working for a utility for the rest of your life. It is also not a good place to intern since skills learned here rarely transfer.
bad,If you fit in you are fine. Different is difficult. No place to be somebody. If you are new it helps to have a seasoned employee sponsor you to let you 'in'.
bad,"During my employment, there was a high turn over rate - for a reason. Management was poor, and there was a constant shuffle to change policies . Would not recommend."
bad,It's a bureaucratic company with little focus on actual employees.  Managers are not advocates for their employees and the whole structure advocates silos.  Meaning it's difficult to collaborate with teams.  It's a multi-billion dollar company with duct tape holding together key processes.
bad,"As a call center representative, a common day is helping customers with their needs. Needs include, but not limited to: paying bills, discussing bills, support with programs, and reporting electric and gas outages and emergencies. Staffing is bad because turn-over is high, so call volume can be excessive most days. Lots of mandatory overtime. Company cannot understand why attrition is so high, but is easy to see. Management shortcomings has destabilized this operation. Communication is horrible to dispatchers and field in most states. Supervisors are unapproachable unless you make a mistake, then they will be willing to talk to you. If you are tough enough to last, once you make it to a higher pay-grade, they start looking for reasons to make you go away and get new, cheaper help. Only bonus is pension, but nobody lasts long enough to retire out of the call center. Good paid vacation and fair wage for area, but there are better, higher paying call center jobs with less stress nearby."
bad,"I worked for Xcel Energy in Carlsbad for a year. They put on a good show but that is all , the people that come from outside the company are always a outsider. This is the most selfish area I have seen if it don't affect me then it is OK.  This is a big company and they do not care about you. I was asked by management to break safety rules, and expected to do it. There is no training, or communictions, they segregate the lineman you are a second class lineman until they need you. "
bad,There is no work life balance when working in the call center. Mandatory overtime with no regards to family life. Stressful environment. No respect for the the call center staff. Toxic environment.
bad,"Interviewed with 2 Individuals who advised of work location (Remote), that changed within 2 weeks after hire. Interviewed by Individuals who were not even my direct Supervisors. Supervisor I ended up working for had no management skills"
bad,I would recommend this company for anyone. It is okay to work for and the employees make it fun. Management is okay and could use some improvement as does management in any company.
bad,"Okay employer, all about the bottom line and key performance indicators regardless of safety and common sense.  Xcel Energy definitely does not care about retention and does not invest in future leaders.  No a good company to advance if you are a true hard worker.  Great company if you are a brown-noser."
bad,Xcel Energy has an old world mentality when it comes to process and policies.  Very difficult place to work if you are used to a fast pace work environment and energy.  Decisions are slow to occur and the processes make no sense as it relates to buying and category management.
bad,"I wrote quite a bit during my tenure at Xcel.  During my first two to three years I drafted numerou, complex applications for authorizations to construct high voltage transmission lines.  Around year three, I also worked on complex, capital expenditure cost recover petitions.  The hardest part was making sure I was on target with pre-approved due dates schedule given the multiple project i was working on."
bad,"Credit and collections for a utility company is very difficult and demanding on the collectors.  The need to collect the balance and the empathy needed for the customer clash on a daily basis.  Advancement only seems possible for those with college degree although the posting does not require this.  "
bad,Not much for motivation or wanting employees to feel good about what they do.
bad,"Wonderful place to work located in roseville, mn. close to shopping center and great services"
bad,"The job description made it sound like it required a technical skill, higher degree, or previous experience to complete the daily responsibilities, but in reality any one can perform these tasks which are very repetitive and boring."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you have morals and values, not to mention integrity. Union crybabies take all your time and productivity is non existent."
bad,"Within Xcel Energy there are many different departments. I being a member of the Customer Service Representatives. While here I completed an 8 week training course and later went to the call floor where I had began proficiently answering questions by customers who would call in in regards to bills, account info, and web issues."
bad,"The culture is changing to where it does not value existing employees. The unknown is valued more highly than the known. The company uses an antiquated job assessment test for promotional positions. Employees who don't pass it, have to wait SIX MONTHS before retaking it and applying for another promotional opportunity."
bad,Very high turnover for a reason. Management very closed. Coworkers are great.
bad,"I wasn't there very long and neither were 75% of the people from my training class. Let's just say there is so much wrong with this company I don't even know where to start. First off, the pay is just sad. They started us at $10.05 and they recently raised it to $10.50. Still doesn't help in the long run considering how high gas prices and everything is nowadays. When asked why they're paying us so low, they tell us it's been that rate for the last ten years. So it doesn't matter if you have tons of experience or no experience, $10.50 is what you can expect."
bad,My work is very boring and I do not like my job. There is almost no room for advancement in the nuclear community if you are not a part of the boys' club. If you are starting out then it is good for a first job but leave after a few years if you want to find advancement.
bad,"The administrative staff are treated like serfs. They are the only job category of jobs not included in the bonus pool. Administrative staff are eligible for ""spot on bonuses"" but no one has every actually gotten one.  The pay is very low comparatively."
bad,Poor team building environment. P/L accunting was not withing GAAP accounting requirements. They gave flexibility to allow you to manage your business.
bad,"Xcel Energy has become the typical Corporate Bully! Where Management believes that they make the Company run and Profitable. They have completely forgotten about their many dedicated Employees who are out in the Field making the MACHINE RUN every single day of every year!! Do not Question authority, or you will be severely reprimanded and most likely terminated!! I believe that Xcel is in a severe Downward Spiral that they will not recover from!!!"
bad,"This division needs creativity, employee recognition and to be more in line with the corporate initiatives in these areas. "
good,"This is a good job for someone just starting off into the work field, the only thing that I did not like is that they would not train good enough on the job & the pay is not all that good."
good,"My last 10 plus years, initially ran the fuel handling system, maintenance and operations; Mechanical Maintenance different areas of mechanical equipment; Electricians and Instrument and Controls Technicians; filled in as Operations Supervisor as needed, while running my own crew. I planned, assigned work, scheduled workloads, identified needs/problems and made adjustments accordingly in whatever area I was responsible for."
good,"dont get me wrong xcel energy is a great place but working there made me see them very different they play favorites and make the job sound alot more ""glittery and great"" while hooking you in. the rates they pay and the work you do is not fair pretty much its just not what i thought i met some very great people there and some not so nice and learned alot about life."
good,"Old company culture. Moving toward newer culture.  Company-wide, there are many locations through out the United States.  Good or Bad company experience varies greatly depending on what department you are working in."
good,The only thing I enjoyed about working here were my co-workers. A typical day involves you getting cursed at by customers and talked down to by management. I learned how to handle irate customers. The company has shifted its views from being a family to being a team. It really has no sympathy for your personal life. All absences are seen equal no matter the reason. If you have a heart attack at work it counts against you. They constantly remind you that you are just a number. It's hard to be happy at a place that doesn't value it's employees.
good,They state they promote from within yet every position I applied for as a Veteran I was turned down for and or not even given an interview even if i was qualified or not. They speak a big game but dont follow through the process.
good,Xcel Energy and Home based agent is one in the same. The job duties are the same and therefore the review is the same as prior. Enjoyed working for the company because of the flexibility.
good,"union vs management culture"
good,"After having been told that the budget was approved for an additional 15 months plus and not even half way down with the assigned project, a new management team came in and topsy turvied everything. They closed down the project and laid off multiple people with no warning...."
good,"Account closing, next position required.  Looking for a similar position working with technical infrastructure, planning and implementing complex installations"
good,"Call Center personnel- this is a fast-paced, high stress, competitive position. It is the perfect job for persons who thrive in that environment. It is certainly not for everyone. I left the company due to the health issues that arose while working there."
good,"Xcel Energy has 2 specific sides of the company, union and administration. If you pick one, you typically have to quit to move to the other side. There are a small percentage that move after years of investment. If you are over qualified, you are considered a threat to line level management. As a result, there are some toxic political games and the management from line level to Director positions is typically unqualified and under developed.  At my last position, there was a significantly unethical nepotism problem. In essence, if you weren't drinking buddy's with one of the family members, your potential for being successful in your position was dramatically reduced.  Xcel is not the worst company to work for, but they are in need of serious cultural changes."
good,"There are many great people working in this company but the management level in some areas could use a lot of improvement. In the onboarding process, new hired are not well equipped to perform their jobs such as laptops, apps, point of contact, etc."
good,"It was ok to work there. However, they hired another person to take over my role when they knew that I wanted it.  The work was moderately difficult but one of my coworkers was very willing to help me. My manager was OK but had only certain times each day we could go into her office with questions.  The culture was OK too,  People were friendly and helpful.  Hardest part of job was keeping busy despite my request for more work.  Best part was learning about nuclear energy and the cost of producing it."
good,dont like it much as their management isnt very great and they dont have a great handle on how to manage large or small projects.  They need better managers.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, however I had to end up driving 85 miles each day to work and I was not compensated for this. I was required to be to work on time despite the harsh weather conditions. i.e snow storms ect."
good,I package pies and sometimes help out in production. It is interesting to watch mass production of pies.
good,"They are cutting costs and paying shareholder.  Employees fee like a number.  They used to care about employees, but only goes about 1 or 2 levels up and the relationships aren't there."
good,I feel they could be more family orientated. Some of the straining staff are inefficient and rude. They should take they time to get to know their employees a bit more personally.
good,The company seem to not care about retaining employees and do nothing to encourge there employees about working here. The question that is never asked is what can I do to help you but why are you not able to complete the tasks assigned to you.
good,"This place is unbelievable. I have worked my tail off, gone well above and beyond for them, and have received nothing for it except condescending remarks from my boss, who thinks as long as he chuckles about it, they aren't insults."
good,"Xcel has it good points, which one is the pay.  They paid more than the average pay in Amarillo. "
good,Regular employees are treated well.  I have enjoyed working as a computer support technician.  It has been challenging.  I have learned a lot in a relatively short time (4 years).  Getting to meet customers is the be4st part of the job as I enjoy pleasing people.
good,"Xcel Energy (Contract)                                                                                                         October 2013 – Present"
good,Benefits have slowly been taken away or reduced. Customer service is constantly in flux as management team is shuffled on a regular basis. Daily workload is micromanaged and can change at any time due to help needed in other departments. You may be required to be on call in case of weather emergencies without any compensation. High employee turnover in customer contact centers.
good,"3 month set schedule with 30 min lunch, closed on Sundays"
good,"Currently employed as an Electrical Distribution Designer as a contractor.  My day consists of working at my cubical in the Distribution Division of the Chestnut Service Center in Minneapolis.  I respond to emails and calls from customers and developers regarding their current and future electrical projects.  Meeting customers in the field takes up a lot of the day but its my favorite part of the job.  My ideal job would have a mix of 60% field work, 40% office and this job comes very close.  The hardest part of the job is prioritizing the jobs that come through.  Most often priority goes to the party that is angriest and threatening to jump the queue. I work with a solid team of designers with various levels of experience and background and I get along with my Manager. More importantly our manager goes to the mat for us and his design team."
good,"Way too many managers looking over the minions.  Every manager wants the work done a different way. You cannot please anyone.  Very frustrating.  The supervisors all are scared of the managers, and you know that stress runs downhill!!!  The only saving grace was being Union."
good,"fun place to work. managers too relaxed on job. alot of swearing around the work enviroment."
good,Very high deductible heath care plan and poor wage compensation.  Currently working 5 hours per week mandatory overtime (so working a 6 day week)..That's it.
good,"Often people are not promoted from within, and end up quitting. Their job is advertised and new person hired at the higher level they were seeking. Company wasting money and reliability of assets is suffering. People leaving and not being replaced, so those who stay are getting more and more piled on. Most folks in the plants feel the company is looking to sell generating assets. Very ""old school"" management style from top to bottom. Most managers are ex-military so many places can have a culture that feels like military."
good,"I was a contractor that worked remotely; therefore, I cannot provide an accurate or constructive review.  The only feedback I can provide, it was extremely difficult to progress with projects within Xcel due to their processes and procedures."
good,There are numerous in upper management who are lifelong Xcel Energy employees. They are not very open to new ideas. I think they are working on that but it's not exactly a progressive industry in general and Xcel Energy is on par with that.
good,"Associate II Customer Service Contact  "
good,"No room for movement within company, management ok with people staying exactly where they are at. Great coworkers, good compensation package."
good,"Fast paced, challenging employer. A typical day will allow the employee to interface with customers, emergency response personnel and social service agents."
good,It is a safety conscious work environment and employees are encouraged to excel. 
good,"Xcel Energy is a great place to start a career. They have great people but poor direction from leadership. The company is run by accountants and engineers, which in turn means your always viewed as a number, a cost that needs to be minimized in any way possible."
good,Old school PM practices and processes.  Very smart people but old school thinking.  Move to SAP was very smart.  They need to continue to leverage what SAP can offer.
good,"Lots of focus on safety and on keeping things running. There is however little coordination between the different departments and the focus on promoting from within means a limited pool of potential managers. Overall a good place to work, workers are valued. However the company needs to invest in technology as it is falling behind the times."
good,It was a contract position that kept you busy taking orders for appliance protection plans. It was a division called HomeSmart. It was a bilingual position.
good,"Xcel provides opportunities for professional growth by maintaining a fast paced, cutting edge environment constantly challenging it's people to the highest standards of professionalism.  While this facilitates skill enhancement and phenomenal career and personal growth it does not promote work life balance. The culture tends towards elitism and hierarchy is very important. This is not openly espoused, but the patterns contribute to cross functional and vertical communication barriers impeding organizational performance. As an OD professional breaking through these barriers to penetrate the culture is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable aspect of my job from an OD perspective is the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues doing innovative, challenging and meaningful work. It has truly stretched me in cultivating my professional skills"
good,"Just your standard call center job. You will be trained and expected to keep up with veterans on the floor and help the same standards immediately. If you enjoy people blaming you for their high electric bills and getting degraded by customers on the phone then this the gig for you. Any job has those moments, but at Excel it was guaranteed that every shift you would get that one customer who had to ruin someones day! If you want a consistent paycheck and don't care about your dignity, give it a shot."
good,I have great co-workers harvest part is dealing with some of the customers. I learned about customer service skills and how to be a great customer service rep.
good,"The IT organization is heading in a good direction under the leadership the of the current CIO.  Implementation of SAP software has been a challenge, though overall considered a success to date."
good,I worked at this place for 4 years. Some of the guys were great and others not so much. Management wasn't much help when it came to managing. I did have fun working here.
good,"I was merely a contractor that was brought in at an inopportune time. People were being laid off while I was just starting, and it created a very low morale."
good,company only really cared about itself and its cost. did not care about its public impact. pay was very good and benefits as well. company did not stand behind employees.
good,"I have worked for Xcel Energy for 9 years.  This is a great company to work for in many ways.  During that time I have served two tours of duty and been a citizen Soldier for my entire time I have worked here.  There is a long list of things that I have encountered as a citizen Soldier while working here that I do not wish to discuss publicly.  Like many companies, they truly do not understand the meaning of supporting a veteran.  This does not mean that I think this is a bad company."
good,A typical day at work would best be described as very productive. Friendly co-workers. The hardest part was dealing with customers screaming at me.
good,The plant has had a bad run of luck in the last couple of years and the senior management seems to be having trouble turning the trend around. The management that got the plant into its current pickle have been promoted and that has resulted in some problems with moral.
good,". Co-workers were professional and very easy to work with."
good,"Advancement within the company is extremely slow.  To advance forward would require someone to leave the company, retire or transfer to a new department.  Lately, the philosophy at Xcel seems to be to not hire within for advancement rather to hire from outside.  For those managers that have low employee engagement scores and for those with a lack of management experience the company fails to address those issues."
good,Working at Xcel would've been great if they ever hired anyone on. They hire everyone as temps so they don't have to pay benefits. I worked there 2 times and couldn't seem to get ahead. They also don't work well with student schedules.
good,"Company is generally great place to work. Financial organization is looking to remake itself. It's always a challenge to change lots of things - systems, structure, culture, all at once."
good,Typical work day is answering phone calls with little to no gaps in between. Very little time to adjust to incoming calls due to insufficient staffing. No time to gather thoughts between phone calls and overall very difficult interactions. Good pay but insufficient for level of mastery required. Constant mandatory overtime resulting in a poor work to personal life balance.
good,"Very standard, typical workplace. The office environment was pleasant and had just the right amount of structure. There really aren't any standout pros or cons."
good,Many have the desire to improve the work environment. The biggest challenge is to convince those who have been part of the company for over 5 years to see that we need to make improvements to remain competitive.
good,"Xcel leadership is some areas is very poor and are afraid of challenges from their employees.  You can work very hard and produce tons of results, but the second something doesn't work out, all the blame is on you."
good,You spend the whole day on the phones with a breaks of course. The day  goes by rather fast because the calls are constant. Fast-paced environment.
good,great culture. Awful leadership. The training is decent and the people are what make this company great. Other than that this place is awful.
good,"A typical day, you come in and log in to your phone since that is what is used as your time clock. As soon as you log in to your phone you log in to your computer and get all the screens set up for when you will take your first customer call. emails, schedule(to see when to take breaks, lunch or any thing else you may have been scheduled for during the day) next, bring up the two company software that are used for accessing the customers account or creating a new account, bring up the post it note screen to make notes on when speaking with customers, bring up the companies vast informational for using to answer customers questions-known as CCQR, provides updates to the various state guidelines that are needed to followed dependent upon customers situation. "
good,"Xcel Energy Nuclear is a good place to work for those interested in a military style of work.  There are some projects which require long hours of work, but often engineers have the ability to work 40-50 hours a week.  The management team is very young and struggles to fit the needs of their engineers vs. the needs of the company.  There are also certain mid management positions which do not stay filled.  The hardest part of my job is trying to understand what tasks are priorities and trying to meet schedules in the framework of the nuclear system.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the relatively flexible hours."
good,I enjoyed the work I did and the retirement package was more than decent. Their focus was on providing excellent customer service.
good,"Stringent procedure adherence."
good,"Large company a lot of different people that work there young, old, enjoyed being friends with so many people. Hard to get company to repair anything was the worst thing."
good,Organization does solid things in concept.  Operationally the lack of discipline to execute projects and staff appropriately grossly affects delivery.  Too much time spent on security and network with not solid goals or reporting.
good,"blame culture. unorganized boring work at ioc. lack of management. lack of communication. lack of training, very little documentation, ""you'll figure it out"""
good,"Like any company, there are pockets that are amazing and some that are toxic.  IT is going through and has been going through a lot of turmoil.  Hopefully the boat will get turned around with a new CIO."
good,"Xcel Energy was a challenging place to work, very demanding."
good,Great company to get your foot in the door with! As a contractor it is hard to become full time with xcel. Try to get in as a full time employee rather than a contractor if possible.
good,"it was an okay job, the pay was good with good benefits. a typical day at work is answering phones getting to the root of issues. hardest part of the job is a lot of down time."
good,"I do not have a review.  All was good.  Learned about current and future utility options.  Conducted customer satisfaction, brand tracking, and new product development research,"
good,"overall good place to work, though the management needs additional help to run a network. Need lots of help in the network and NOC area of expertise.  Overall good."
good,"I worked for Xcel for a over a year. It was a fine job. The work was ok, except I didn't feel like I fit in there. I often felt out of place, and I had wished the company had more flexibility with my schedule, as I was on contract and needed to work a second job to make up for my loss in pay."
good,"Big company, so it operates as expected.  Maintaining the status quo was valued more than innovation but this could be good for some people.  Nice folks to work with."
good,"Good working environment, professional and easy tools to work with, but not a growing and learning environment. Poor documentation and bad training. tx"
good,My manager believed in the boys club and didn't manage fairly or in a positive manner. He discriminated against those he didn't like and made it a very negative working environment.
good,"The job is good and you can work from home but they contract out most of their staff and never hire from within. As a contractor there are no benefits, raises or time off."
good,"They actually pay ok and the job isn't too tough. There could be more support from management to other than ""do better"" like maybe how to do better. There is always something going on and they have Thanksgiving and Christmas catered meals which is a great touch"
good,"Although I loved working in my office, there was no advancement opportunities so I had to move on. The hardest part was leaving my team. We were like a little family."
good,"My contract with Xcel Energy does not allow me to provide ANY company related information to the general public on its activities, employees, or salaries."
good,"The culture is changing due to re-organization and implementation of a new work management system. This is causing delays and large additions to daily work loads. People are not held accountable to do their job and in turn others have to pick up the additional tasks to get the job done. "
good,I liked the business but thought the values were misplaced a little with what they thought was important. I would think customer service would come first and they placed a lot on a survey that the customers took and I didn't feel that was worth a whole lot.
good,"Stats seem unrealistic. Hard to obtain.  The customers are mostly rude.  Alot of information to take in.  "
good,"After working there for 10 years I was passed up on being promoted, even though I meet all the job equirements."
good,*typical workday is 9 hours and 10-12 hours during close
good,"Xcel is a solid company to work for, but oftentimes encounters struggles similar to companies of its size (e.g. - lack of clear organizational objections, clarity in roles and responsibilities, ownership of decision making).  Overall, the benefits and culture at the company are fair and the company does have a number of tremendous people with whom to work."
good,"Spent time looking for projects to do as a intern, other engineers didn't have time to teach about systems or how to start projects. I was barely able to scratch the surface of gas turbine generators. My timing might have been bad, but felt like a poor experience as an intern."
good,Drive truck any type of truck. Do lots of useless paperwork. It was. Fun place to work for years now the management has taking over and is a mess. But overall good benefits and pay.
good,The people at Xcel are going to be really close friends and co workers. the down side is the job it has the throw you  in the fire and hope you survive is taken to the extreme.
good,"Co-workers are good to work with & always helpful."
good,Worth sticking around long term however things move slowly with this company and the lack of communication is sad. Most employees are kind and hard working and willing to always take the time to teach you something new.
good,Fun place to work at and co-workers are friendly. Flexible work hours. Paid training. Opportunity to work on special project.
good,I gained new experience among intelligent and pleasant co-workers. Management was very focused. All in all a good company to work for.
good,"The work was consistent. I enjoyed helping the customers. The time went by quickly. I enjoyed my co-workers, they were always ready to lend a hand with question or assistance."
good,Working for this company has been great. I worked in Talent Acquisition. I was a corporate recruiter. I worked very well with all the hiring managers as well as my peers.
good,"I support the Denver Metro Region Leak Survey area and monitor all leaks found. I obtain a heavy full work load on a daily bases which includes, payroll for a count of 60 employees, ordering equipment for managers in other departments, running weekly reports and staying within compliance. I also help lead the gas shop inventory which means ordering and shipping meters in and out of the Denver location and keeping track and documents to stay in compliance. I submit in city and county permits for approval. Create and close out work order packets, and service renewal work order numbers and also track all work going out and coming in to meet deadlines for my director’s database."
good,The work is mostly paperwork as the company is the provider of energy and does little to no innovation.  Employees do not interact as much as they should to stay happy and connected.  Not a teamwork culture.  People mostly work on their own.  Long hours.
good,Employees are extremely smart and knowledgeable with respect to their jobs and particularly in terms of the technical details. However employees are quite homogenous and there is little diversity.
good,Currently we are pouring concrete pier foundations for a new transmission line.  The best part about my job is being home at night.  The most difficult thing about my job is the desire I have for a more challenging workload.
good,Everyone is nice to work with.we work 10 to 12 hours a day.good place to work.
good,Very political but they seem to care about employees. They prefer to have contractors than employees- that is their business model.
good,"Most days, I trouble shoot issues with the PBX and IVR.  I am the primary vector writer for the call center.  I create call flows and process maps for various departments and systems.  I run outbound calling campaigns for planned and unplanned outages, vegetation management as well as other electric and gas emergency and non-emergency situations.  I also help maintain service levels through skill changes, IVR enhancements and upfront messaging."
good,"I learned organizational skills, leadership, time management skills."
good,"When working for Xcel Energy I created Several Outlook Forms to facilitate certain interdepartmental actions. Even though Xcel Energy had procedures in place to handle these actions there was no set documentation. At the time I created these forms I was a Credit agent and this had nothing to do with my job. I did however have the expertise they needed. As far as I know the form(s) is (are) still in use. "
good,My pay started at 10.50 per hour and no benefits until you get promoted.  Recent changes they are now offer pay at 10.55 per hour plus benefits for beginners starting Jan 2014.  I got promoted within about 6 months there to 11.10 per hour plus I was working odd hours so I also got shift differential pay.  This is a beginners job so get paid 10.55 per hour is great.  Above minimum wage.  This is a call center so normal days can consist of upset customers and lots of phone calls.  I don't have anything bad to say about management.
good,I have learned a lot. I will say with union and non union employees altogether in one place there can be a lot of tension. I think the tension from the union good ole boys is the hardest part of the job. Some guys are so old they just don't know that there are newer ways to test and find problems. Mixing these people with computers was also a bad idea. The fun part is all of the people that came here after calpine. This place got really boring with the skeleton crue Calpine ran. The management is good and bad. Most of the time they don't know much about what you do as a worker. Most of the time I'm thinking they don't know what they are supposed to do as well. This causes the sineless management technique to dominate and with this the bullies come out and give others trouble.
good,Now remember I can only verify what it was like at my location very different in culture from the rest of work force strong favoritism the ones they like get to go to breaks early and leave back from break late there are two fifteen minute breaks and for most both breaks turn into thirty to forty five minutes each and the half hour lunch break turns into an hour to an hour and a half they go to the locker room at like thirty to forty minutes before time to go home and walking out the gate fifteen to twenty minutes before time employees that r there have been there since they have gotten out of high school and are very spoiled they will through a fit if the coffee is not there all day or if the tea is to strong they are clueless to the real work field and management turns there heads the other way for them to do what they want if you don't fit into there life stile they will get rid of you whether or not you do your job correctly . I have things in my life that most dont and can not go to normal company family functions and so i was singled out now remember i can not talk for the whole company just the power plant that i was at Harrington station
good,I worked as a contractor in the technology division for Xcel Energy. The company pays well with a typical office work environment. The company management is very hierarchical even in the technology divisions which hinders change and service and technological advancements.
good,"Typical Work Day = 12-16 hrs"
good,good pay and benefits but you have to be willing to accept that you're just a number. Promotions are not given you have to wait for an opening and go through the application process.
good,Working at Xcel energy is a very stable job and has the added benefit of knowing you are providing a service to the community. They are also fairly laid back in the approach but still demand accuracy and quality.
good,"unfortunate, but contractors really don't have good benefits or compensation for that matter. No PTO, holiday pay, and very decent , at best, hourly rates. Makes this job so unappealing after you get settled in."
good,Very good place to work. Everyone is helpful and there is a lot of work on TX and NM presently.
good,Overall a great place to work with advancement opportunities and pay.  The health insurance is really bad.  The 401K is decent if you know how to manage it.  The management isn't up to par.
good,"Loved working there for 6 years.  Since leaving, they have reorganized several times and unfortunately several of the leadership team I enjoyed were forced out."
good,"We all know call center life is a life of boredom, burnt coffee, and an insane amount of snacking. You'll love the people you work with, but maybe not the people you work for."
good,"Upper management is very informative in the fact that if you have ten years or more before retirement, to possibly seek employment elsewhere due to the uncertianty of the company."
good,"I had to learn a lot in a very short amount of time.  With very little assistance.  It was a bit overwhelming.  However, if you are a go getter and can apply yourself, you can survive at this company."
good,stressful work environment. Each person experiences things differently. The staff I worked with were very kind and wonderful people. the workload was overload expectations.
good,"I learned how to help customers with their accounts, how to negotiate with customers, I learned all about electricity and how it works and I also learned about meters. Management and co-workers were great at this company. The thing I enjoyed most would be the learning part and the hardest is remembering everything."
good,"Lots of incentives like gift cards etc. For the call center, not great about understanding chronic illness and the union field workers were a problem."
good,"Building sub stations  52,000 square miles  safety is number one watching your fellow co workers maintaining good equipment and tools productive and completing jobs ahead of schedule"
good,Xcel is mostly comprised of contractors.  The big positions are filled by boomers.  I was told that within a few years I could have one of the full-time positions as they opened.  What tends to happen is jobs are continuously replaced by people with 20 years of experience.  There is very little chance of making a meaningful promotion as a young professional.
good,"While this job is really easy, there isn't much room for advancement. No raises, as the new boss doesn't believe in performance based raises, so there isn't a reason to do more than the daily quota since working hard won't get you results. As for moving up, that's only possible if someone above leaves to another job or another position."
good,"Not a bad place to work excellent pay great benfits bad location, there is room for advancement within the company. They provide great training and are committed to safety."
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  Typical days are busy, but not stressful.  I have learned to be patient with people while working in teams.  The hardest part of the job is really the amount of meetings required, and most of the time just seem like time wasters, they can last up to two hours and generally the first 10 minutes are the most informative.  A lot of time meetings just turn into gripe sessions."
good,You can learn as much as you like about the industry  They have many opportunities for learning in the classroom or computer base training. If you like things fast paced. This is the place for you
good,Was a good first internship but was not very structured and they did not keep you busy enough. Able to see shadow different people but would have liked more work.
good,I love the department that I support. It is more of a family than it is co-workers. They are very supportive and we all work together to solve any unforeseen problems.
good,Xcel is a good company that is creates its power in various forms. So depending in which sector you work in there are a different set of rules for different groups. Overall it promotes safety and cares about the employee.
good,I learned patience because this job is a lot of customers calling with issues such as power outages and delinquent accounts.  The hardest part of the job was keeping customers happy and trying to figure out solutions when there wasn't an easy solution to the issue.
good,I do like working for Xcel but I am looking for something closer to my house. They have showed me how to be a good manager and how to do payroll
good,"A typical day at Xcel Energy consists of sitting at a cubical, and answering phone calls until the end of your shift. Management is really supportive, always there when you need help."
good,i enjoyed working for xcel energy however was not conducive to my family life. i loved being able to help people and talk to people from different states. The work place itself was fantastic. had a real family feel.
good,"I loved managing the business. The people were great. I just didn't like the fact that our checks would bounce sometimes, and I would have to pay the employees with my money. I did all the hiring and firing."
good,"This was a contract position and my time there doesn't reflect the true workplace experience.  During my time there, we were testing the new SAP system they were implementing.  Required hours were 10 hour days and weekends; with two weeks of mandatory 13 hour days. I believe that testing should be completed now, and working hours should be back to eight hour days"
good,"Pays well, no advancement, micro management, call center work, customer base is to many"
good,I enjoyed working with the various personal and getting to know the different areas of where I worked.  The hardest part of my job was staying busy towards the end when the work load was diminishing.
good,its a tough time in the oil and gas industry which makes this a hard field to be in currently.Seems l;ike everyday there is a chance of more lay offs
good,too many bullish people at xcel. they don't care who they walk over and if you have some personal issues they push you aound and just say tough it out. I should have turned many of them into HR but I did not want to be a tattle tail. but they sure treated me that way.
good,"This was a ""matrix organization"" that operated like a traditional management structure except nobody knows who to answer to. Instead of 1 boss I had several with different agendas."
good,"Not enough management oversight for the project I'm on.  But the culture and employees are good.  There is a lot of structured company communication, but not much coming from immediate management."
good,I've been here for almost 2 years now and still don't know how to really do my job correctly because the training doesn't exist and everyone has different opinions on how to do something
good,"HomeSmart was a appliance repair plan being represented by Xcel energy, the main electric and gas utility company in Minnesota. It was a wonderful job,  being able to assist customers daily in various ways as setting up their appliance repair appointments, listen to their problems with their appliances and have them try a couple things to see if it would work, send out emergency repair technicians especially during the winter months if their furnaces were not working, direct them to the proper department if they were directed to us in error, upsell the appliance repair program, enter their information when they completed our card we sent for information on their appliances, filing and any various other projects as were needed. I loved getting the team uplifted, some of the customers can be quite a hand full and it would get quite stressful, so I would do something just to make them smile when they needed it. The hardest part of the job was no paid time off, so I could not afford to take time off and refresh and that was sometimes difficult to get through especially on a particularly busy day with upset customers, but the most enjoyable part of my job was the self satisfaction of making that upset customer laugh by the end of the call. I learned so much about certain appliances that made such a difference to me when I went to buy my own,"
good,They have a super strict attendance policy and super high standards for performance and phone call times.  Stressful work environment and dealing with angry customers most of the time.
good,inbound call center.. learned about electric/gas services.. management was good.. workplace was great.. nothing to hard about the job.. loved working with client..
good,I like this company the pay was great and I got to travel a lot.the down side was that when the temperature warms up there is a lack of work
good,"At Xcel Energy, I learned a lot about clerical work since I had 10 years  of retail experience prior to Xcel Energy. I learned how to create work orders in Fleet Focus to running end of month reports. Multi-tasking and prioritizing were the two main objectives that I focused on through my career path as a contractor."
good,"Manage daily work plans, assign and direct Field Operations employees in the utility new construction, operations, and maintenance of gas and electric work by installing underground and overhead wire, single-phase and three-phase cable, transformers, switch cabinets as well as install street lighting for commercial and residential areas or cities.  Ensure projects are safety compliant, meet all OSHA standards, work completed on time and within budget, and restoration efforts meet or exceed original conditions. Secure occupancy permits and approved plan and profile and submit to city municipalities. BMP’s, and storm water inspection. Manage O&M/Capital budgets and payroll. On call (24hr) emergency cable fault repair. "
good,"Learned a lot through my coworkers, very heads-down do-your-work...  Typical day is, all day in front of computer working numbers, dates, IDs, maps.  Lots of sitting and screen time."
good,The short time I was there it seemed like a good place to work. I was there as a sub contractor for a shut down. I did not work directly for them. The time I was there working with there employees it seemed like a good environment to work
good,Long days but rewarding. Tough jobs but finishing them is a great feeling. Not a place everyone would feel is a great fit. Not always the quietest place to be.
good,"Good and nice place to work. Balanced personal and professional life. Flexible working hours, Cooperative and very helpful client to work with. Clear defined process."
good,Excel is a great place too work. I like my co workers.  I enjoyed helping the customers.  My schedule was flexible.  I would refer anyone to the Excel Center
good,"Xcel Energy is a great company to work for as they believe in customer safety as well as giving back into the community.   The benefits given to employees is great and we are well taken care of.   I think the one thing that I would like to see changed is the culture for internal advancement.   Promotion process has alot of red tape and the benefit to the employee is not beneficial.   If you want to be promoted,  it is better to quit and reapply,  your salary compensation will be higher than if you moved around internally."
good,"Granted I worked the hardest job they have, Transmission Lineman, so the review is going to look weird. Yes long hours, yes overtime packages were above industry standard. However; underpaid for position in region. They took more health benefits away in order to pay more. Health benefits were already kinda slim. Good culture, but their Texas SPS region sucks."
good,"Back-to-back incoming calls.  Learned about the utility industry, how it works, how it is billed, etc.  Pleasant co-workers.  Fair management.  f you enjoy the fast pace, it's a great place to work."
good,Working at Xcel was on of the best paying jobs and bonus base is not BS. The only thing that I did not like was the lack of consistency in the way leaders communicated expectations to employees.
good,"My role at Xcel Energy didn't have a great work / life balance, we were understaffed most of the time. But the people are great and there was always something new to conquer."
good,"This is a great place to work. Unlimited growth potential. Very safety minded culture. Pay is above average. Management is very skilled, and organized."
good,Getting a trailer to unload boxes onto skids.  learning how to know how many boxes should be on a skid for a order.  most enjoyable part about work it's a team job.
good,This was my first call center job.  The company devotes an intense amount of energy in training new employees.  You train full time for 6 weeks to see if you will qualify for the expected company standard.  I learned a lot but I worked weird hours.  You are expected to take call after call and there isn't a social aspect to this job due to this.
good,"The people at Xcel Energy are very nice to work with.  There are definitely positives and negatives, but overall, it is one of the more pleasant environments I have worked in."
good,When I first started outstanding performance was richly rewarded.  Over the years this has changed and now Political Maneuvering is rewarded.
good,"Developed Mainframe applications for telecom / financial client."
good,"Good place to start with varied energy port folio. Has Fossil - (Coal,Natural Gas),Wind,Solar,Hydro and Nuclear generation units."
good,"The managers and people are have been helpful in improving the business become more resilient."
good,"Xcel Energy Colorado / PSCO region; Predictive maintenance and safety cultures are a few years behind the normal pace of companies  of this size. Management is ineffective and there is no accountability through the ranks. A lack of employee training and attention to detail has created an unchallenged complacency that breeds through the ranks."
good,Very rewarding both technically and professionally as an outage scheduler for ~ 15 years.  3 years as a contractor and 12 years as an employee. I enjoyed the challenge of performing the Daily critical path analysis during the execution of each refueling outage. I took particular satisfaction in how well the logic of the baseline schedule held up despite some very poor production rates across most shops.
good,"Xcel energy is a great place to work if you enjoy talking with customers of all types ie.. angry, mean, upset, talkative, pleasant, and just needing help."
good,One of the better employers.  Pros are the pay and benefits but poor management individuals are able to hide behind policies.
good,"•	Strong commitment and dedication to customer service and relationship building"
good,Very large power and gas company that is in many different sectors.
good,Good Company.  Lots of Opportunities.  Long hours some times and very technical.
good,"Ordered and stocked material for the plant,management could of been better,the most enjoyable part is you can workout in the workout room anytime you wanted to.The hardest part of the job is the upper floors had no A/C and it got really hot during the summer."
good,"Loved my job, the better you did the more praise, bonus and pick your own schedule.  Very laid back, with lax dress code. They had food days often, hard to stay healthy."
good,"Great place to work for people that want to learn the utility business or learn how energy is changing for our country."
good,Great people. They feed you constantly!! Good food!  Very safely oriented. You can change your schedule at various times through year if needed. Job was stressful and I woke up every night talking to customers in my sleep
good,Enjoyed working there hardest part was the on-call status throughout the storm season. Most enjoyable was talking to new people everyday from different parts of USA
good,"There are few who care about their teams, credit department can be stressful but when grouped with a good team, we de stress each other and create support."
good,The staff was great to work with lots of social interaction at lunch and after work hours. As new management came in became very cut throat with emphasis on eliminating senior staff members 50+ with negative job performance reviews. Learned and experienced a lot of what a utility company goes thru good and bad. The hardest part of job was dealing with the new management which forced me to seek employment elsewhere. The best part was formulating friendships with some of the hardest working and sincere staff you will ever find anywhere.
good,A competitive company with room for growth. Opportunity to work with many departments and gain more work experience. Stressful at times but offered good time off to get back the work/life balance.
good,"xcel strives to make sure that all customers get the vest service possible, but they have a high turn over rate because of the lack of advancement possibilities and the mandatory overtime. typical day at work consist of answering billing calls, outage information and stops, starts ,and transfers of service orders, hardwest part of this job for me was the mandatory overtime for the last six months that I was there.most enjoyable was talking to the nice customers"
good,Xcel Energy was a great company to work for a lot of vacation time and sick leave if needed easy to work for. If you want to advance in the company their is many classes you can take to advance.
good,"Worked closely with union employees and benefits. "
good,"Xcel is a stable company, and your career can flourish. But, it will be up to you to find the opportunities and craft your way forward. (That's not a bad thing!) "
good,"Inbound calls  center for starting, stopping, transferring electric and gas services, as well as emergency dispatch for gas emergencies, power outages and fire."
good,"A typical day at work involved corresponding with volunteers & college students, creating newsletters, helping research for grants, attending fundraising functions, planning activities & lessons, leading multi-level Girl Scout Troop, and running the after school program. I learned a lot about multitasking and prioritizing tasks, how to train/manage/recruit volunteers & college students, how to create relationships with community members & other programs in order to create new opportunities for students, how to develop strategies for struggling students, how to communicate effectively with parents from diverse backgrounds. My boss was very driven and could micromanage at times, but it was for the greater cause. I learned a lot from her and was inspired by her desire to succeed. I started as an AmeriCorps member at this job and was then hired to stay and promoted to the Director of XCELr8 Afterschool Program, so my only co-worker was another AmeriCorps member who was an amazing mentor. The hardest part of my job was having a lot on my plate and not always knowing where to start, which in turn led to me learning a lot about prioritizing. I also dealt with some difficult students who were dealing with very difficult things at home. I learned to be patient and to truly listen to them, which was often all they really needed. The most enjoyable part of this job was creating long lasting relationships with my students, their families, and my volunteers."
good,"Good job security, great benefits, low pay, poor work/life balance at times"
good,"A typical day at work would be placing outbound calls to all customers scheduled for disconnection that week & began contacting them first. Attempt to collect a pmt or est. a repayment schedule. I learned of different organizations that will assist with lowincome families, I learned of certain guidelines & laws the power co. can't break pertaining to utility services. Management was okay, I enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was attempting to collect on a debt & the customer is non-cooperative & having to place an order to disconnect the services. the most enjoyable part was being able to compromise with the customer & come up with a way, where we receive some type of payment & they receive some type of arrangment to avoid disconnection."
good,It is very family oriented but does not pay very well.  A good place to retire and one of the only employees to have a pension plan. The benefits are OK but you do receive vacation time and company holidays off.
good,I enjoy working with Xcel energy. It does vary from position to position on how well they will treat you. The pay is great and benefits are good as well. Very safety orientated. They do have problems keeping good management
good,"Due to budget concerns, there were very few expenses to be spared for entertainment. Regulated heavily by government.  Lots of meetings, at least for an auditor.  Aging workforce."
good,"good place to work, fun friendly atmosphere, good, good benefits, company vehicles. getting to work in the outdoors. plenty of advancement opportunities"
good,Hardest part of job would be managing priorities of which you can be easily overwhelmed if you're not ready for it or organized.  Best part of job is not having to be micro managed everyday.
good,Corporate culture is fine. Often get free lunches. Exercise room on site. Middle management often has excessive micromanaging to the point it hinders productivity.
good,"Xcel Energy places a heavy emphasis on advancing the brand and image of the company. From operational excellence to support in those areas, Xcel Energy is unmatched. The outlying business departments are a constant fight with corporate Xcel to gain any headcount, budget or resources. Outside of the company's core operations, it is a struggle to feel worthwhile or productive."
good,Great place to work. This company provides many opportunities for advancement and variety. They are interested in developing a diverse workforce and provide many opportunities to learn new skills.
good,some areas better than others. the constant bickering between GO and Denver is pretty bad. newer technologies in areas. not sure why I am doing this review - think I got suckered into it.
good,"Depending on the department the culture was a family-like atmosphere with many advantages to a ""we are in this together"".mentality.  People were friendly and willing to help out in any way possible."
good,Paid on the job training - learned all about Nuclear power operations. Good team work. Mostly friendly atmosphere. Heavy workload. Competitive pay and benefits.
good,Not a bad place to work. I have learned a lot about the utility industry and what it truly takes to keep the lights on - I no longer complain about my utility bill.
good,Worked directly with engineers on power plant testing. Was able to move up from technician to engineer status over the 4.5 years I was there. Not able to stay with company due to group going away. Management not good at dealing with personnel issues.
good,"Company has a very good mission and vision and the C-suite has its heart in the right place. However, much of the workforce are long term employees with a sleepy utility mind-set, which is not necessarily a bad thing. They are great people and excellent at the day to day operational / transactional activities that keep our lights on but transformation to a future of carbon free energy continues to be difficult."
good,Hardwork everyday would not expect anything less froma company that is improving the field of energy innovation.Time Managment is the key to doing your job
good,"The credit call center was a challenging place to work. You had to have extrememly good diplomatic skills, be a good listener, know the Public Utility Commission guidelines and be tough while remaining fair and empathetic. The job had a huge turnover because it was not for everyone. I was very good at it and found the job rewarding myself."
good,Great company. Great people. Some management issues that need to be delt with on a higher level. Managers are held accountable for their own work as opposed to how they manage their groups.
good,"If you can withstand the ever changing culture, then you will survive this place. You have a lot of tasks not on your job description, a lot of gray area here. But if you apply yourself and show you are willing to work, it may work in your favor. It is hard job when it comes to collecting and having to speak with people who cannot afford their services. Some of the Team Leads are not fair, but if you just do your job then you will be fine. A lot of opportunities to gain knowledge and good benefits, once you become eligible. Not flexible at all with your time off, very strict timelines. But overall a good company to work for."
good,Great place to work. I liked the assignments I worked on and the people I worked with.
good,Compensation and benefits were very competitive. Often a hostile work environment though
good,"Challenging bur rewarding work"
good,"Was a good Employer overall. Had decent benefits, work was somewhat challenging. I am sure career advancement would have happened if I had stayed.I left because I had started my own business"
good,"Nice place to work, Very competitive work environment."
good,Xcel was a great place to work. It did have its downfalls as far as work life balance. They also had issues passing down information and or were to get information from.
good,"Hard working engineers constantly trying to keep machines running to make sure the Denver area has electricity.  They have a vital job and do their best with what they have."
good,"The day usually started gathering numbers and data for as close to real time accuracy as possible.  Fires were put out as they arose to be sure the database reflected any issues broken at the time as well as resolved.  I had a better understanding of networks, database, Microsoft office and 3rd party software relative and used by Xcel.  management was fair and pleasant to work for and be involved with.  One of the main difficulties in the job was figuring out how to remedy an aspect of involved data if incorrect.  The satisfaction of resolving an issue and my co-workers were most enjoyable."
good,"Always working with management or supervisors to resolve any questions or find resources for them to resolve their issues.  I or other co-workers would bounce ideas off each other on certain issues.  Our Director would have an open door for final decision making. "
good,Intensive training very fast paced most of the staff are friendly and helpful.
good,"Fast paced, good training, and great benefits. Answer inbound calls and accurately maintain customer accounts and records. Deal with escalated calls or transfer to supervisor. Handle emergency situations such as gas leaks or accidents that take out power poles, calmly and effectively."
good,"A great company to work for, they sent me to school for many different certifications as they were needed for my position. I would recommend this company to anyone willing to work hard and has a willingness to learn"
good,Would recommend to anyone to work here.  Opportunities for growth are there for those who have a drive to grow.  High-potentials will do well with Xcel Energy.  Engineers will find a variety; many options to learn different skillsets.  Technology on the leading edge.
good,Getting hired by then Northern States Power Company was a dream position as thee had not been an opening in their 'Land Department' for almost 15 years.  The Lord out me in that spot at that time.  The steady work was a godsend and continued until all my three children graduated from high school.  The Lead Sup. left a lot to be desired. Taking the glory for jobs well done by employees and chewing down hard on those same employees when things didn't go as planned.
good,Good place to work if you get on the right team.  Good benefits and pay.  Very liberal especially in the northern and central region.  The right manager can make all the difference.
good,They have a very good sense of purpose and know where they're going. the management is knowledgeable and doesn't play politics any more than necessary
good,"Very focused workplace, determined to accomplish major important objectives, good camaraderie, pleasant accommodations, ability to network with many Xcel professionals, good periodic meetings to celebrate holidays."
good,I liked working there for hockey and other events .. I like customer service jobs so I really enjoyed working with the customers... all the customers are happy because they're paying to be there and have a great time... I'm there to make they're experience better with my outgoing attitude and personality
good,"The company has a lot to offer, but there is a high turnover of upper management. There has been issues with priorities that has been slowly improving."
good,This is a great company with very dedicated employees who are working hard to transform the energy industry. I would recommend it to others.
good,"Great work environment and people. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between upper management and employee issues. Overall, a pretty great place to work!"
good,"I loved being a Category Manager, co-workers were amazing.  This career broadened my horizons and pushed me to be better at my career everyday. I trained in high risk negotiations and worked next to professionalism everyday."
good,The work at Xcel puts the engineering training one learnt at school to good use. Your problem solving is put to good use. Xcel energy is a great place to work. I enjoy working across many departments and the nature of the work. Getting to work with different departments to solve problems about distributed energy resources.
good,"Time Entry / Payroll"
good,"Logging on to the computer, check e-mail from supervisor for work assignment. The cubicles are close together and a bit claustrophobic."
good,It's a great place to work in any area. They have plenty of opportunity for advancement throughout the company and provide all of the necessary training required to perform in your current job function.
good,"Management is great and always has their door open, no micro management, co-workers are great we always work as a team and always willing to help each other out as needed"
good,Good place to work friendly atmosphere retirement 420 k health insurance good support system communication with supervision community service flexibility with school schedule
good,The company has a real great and open culture and it was easy to meat people and become friends with my coworkers. Sometimes work can be a bit boring but you can always go to lunch with coworkers.
good,"Loved what I did there, they have their interns work on actual work that a lot of the full time employees would be doing. I learned a lot from my internship and the work environment was busy but relaxed."
good,I worked a temporary position so I don't really know what office work is really like at Xcel. I worked as a Field Checker so I was never really around other employees
good,Xcel Energy is a great company to work for and has an outstanding management. Xcel provides you with great benefits and discounts on things like gym memberships and phone bills.
good,"Relaxed place to work, unfortunately however there is quiet a bit of bureaucracy because this is part of the energy sector which is understandable. I enjoyed working here."
good,"typical call center, answer phones and work with customers to pay bills and answer questions. work in cubicle. Has a good training program. management is fairly friendly."
good,Benefits great. Awesome discounts. Good manager.  Fast paced. Makes sure employees gets rest. Open communication. Over time can be killer. More pros then cons.
good,"Learned a lot in the company, but there are not enough positions to advance into. Needs more opportunity for growth and advancement in the company. Great benefits."
good,"It was a nice place to work. I only worked there on a 4-month temporary contract to cover for an employee on maternity leave. It was limited as a tempt, but the tax team I worked with was very nice. I do recommend others to seek for employment at Xcel Energy."
good,"Over all it was a pretty good internship although my work was tedious, I leaned a lot. The work life balance seemed to be pretty good for most people. Most technical people did not attend many meetings"
good,It's a good place to work. When I was there it was a temporary job but could become permanent.  They made sure we were trained well for the job and that there was something to do
good,Xcel contracts a lot of it's work and will not hire it's contract after years of employment no matter how good of work they do.   It's a laid back work environment.
good,Xcel Energy has given me an opportunity to grow in my career and as a person. They have given me a chance to work with subject matter experts to learn and grow. Doing so I have learned many thing in which I have been able to apply on the job in my daily life.
good,I worked there as a contractor but I could tell the employees were given a lot of freedom in terms of travel and work schedule.  It is a very good place to work!
good,"A good mix of people across multiple teams in the CFO organization each bringing a mixture of talent, value. The utility industry is a niche industry."
good,Interned at a power plant and it helped me discover a career in the energy field. My supervisor made sure I was exposed to different power plants in the fleet and encouraged that I learn as many systems I could.
good,"Reads and records electric meter indexes into a computerized handheld system."
good,"I like the company and my coworkers. Very little office politics, and a supportive environment. I just find call center work to be too stressful, and am having trouble securing a position outside of the call center."
good,"Great  smart friendly co-workers that were kind and helpful"
good,Great company Nice people in my dept.and offered great benefits and retirement package. Would recommend for a great career path but hard to get an interview .
good,Xcel Energy is a great company to work for with great benefits. The job itself I am in is challenging and is a high stress position but overall it is a great job with advancement opportunities my reason for leaving is simply because of scheduling conflicts as schedules are based on a bidding scale the schedule is never consistent and I need a consistent schedule.
good,I just retired about 2 months ago. It was very good for the time I worked for them. The company was beginning to take away benefits for the last few years. I guess that is how businesses operate now.
good,The company is currently changing major software systems and is migrating to SAP environment.  Company has very aggressive safety culture.  Flexible work hours can be arranged for most.
good,"A typical day consisted of daily job briefs, time sheets, scheduling, and safety. There I learned how to do drilled piers, concrete foundations, transmission lines, as well as electrical sub stations. Management was minimal in field operations. Co-workers at Excel are dedicated and professional. The most challenging part of working at Excel was incomplete drawings. The most enjoyable part of working at Excel was the employees."
good,"Good to work here. They have two offices,"
good,"Typical days only happen in boring jobs. My days at Xcel Energy are busy and exciting. I have an outline of the things I want to accomplish from day to day but am bombarded with other priorities on an as needed basis. This required me to be flexible and able to adapt while keeping a positive can do attitude. "
good,"Working in the field with Xcel Clients, both commercial and residential was very demanding but also enjoyable. My day would typically consist of 20 - 40 reconnections or disconnections. In my opinion the most difficult part of my duties; was disconnecting users, who fell upon hard times and where unable to pay on delinquent accounts. On the other hand, my co-workers and department as a whole; was just outstanding. Really good working environment, and solid leadership."
good,The Transmission Engineering group at Xcel Energy is a motivated group of individuals that make coming to work an enjoyable place to be.
good,"I had fun working at Xcel Energy.  It was was a great experience.  I worked 8 hours a day, learned the importance of teamwork, got along  with my co-workers and was able to learn new things."
good,"Good place to work, good experienced people, solid business. Certain aspects of job functions could be better organized and more efficient."
good,"I worked in the call center, and it was a very nice environment, I always felt that my supervisor was there to help and was not overly critical of me. "
good,Good place to work if you have patience and like to be indoors
good,I just need a permanent position. This was also a temp position.
good,"I was afforded a lot of opportunities during my 5 years at Xcel. Following a company merger, my position was ultimately moved to MN. At that time in career, I was a single parent of 3 small children, so I made a decision in the best interest f my family and did not relocate."
good,A great job in a field I was new to. Things got good real fast but change in the office changed that
good,"Xcel is a great company, but there is a lack of advancement opportunities for the Product Analyst."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work.  Was able to grow and learn.  Management worked with me to obtain my goals of moving from the Mail Room where I learned about the company and the different departments.  From there, I was able to move up to a typist position and learn the accounting fields.  Promoted from accounting to Safety & Security Department and learned about this facet of the company.  Was able to use my skills in typing, dictation and organization as Secretary to the Manager. Really enjoyed moving within this department to learn the Workmen's Compensation process of claims.  Keeping all reports up-to-date and the payment of the employees who had been hurt on the job. Co-workers were very helpful and willing to teach me all aspects of the job and we worked as a team. Hardest part of the job in all was hearing the stories of the employees who had been hurt on the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and feeling like I may have made a small difference in helping employees obtain the compensation for their injuries.  Terminated employment here 1 month prior to having my first child."
good,"Xcel Energy is a good company to work for.  They have excellent benefits, offer pay raises during hard economic times; and instead of lay-offs they freeze bonuses (including upper mgmt) so that employees retain jobs.  Also, they allowed me to log in to online classes while at work (on breaks), and paid for part of my tuition.  They offer volunteer ops with Habitat for Humanity, Feed My Starving children, etc.  They also partner to get discounts to things like the Cannon Valley Trail, Vikings/Twins/Timberwolves/Wild games, etc.  "
good,"good, very good, the best"
good,Great place to work many friendly people with great benefits.
good,I loved the environment they make you feel like you matter and the bosses were amazing. Pay could like anywhere be better but it was a great place to work.
good,"Great experience working in accounting department. Was part of a fun team with a good manager. They were up to speed on new accounting issues, and had impressive internal policies and procedures. Very effective operation; yet due to the size and type of industry (highly regulated company) there was a certain level of bureaucracy and workplace rigidity that was too cumbersome."
good,"Xcel Energy, although a regulated industry, strives for consistency and diversity, as well as encouraging the advancement in learning.  Daily routines provide a structured environment with some opportunities to work on new projects.  Management reflects a power distance dimension, which is expected within a regulated industry.  Traditional workplace culture. Limited creativity in the role except within areas of streamlining and advancing work processes or new project assignments. The environment of working together as a team reflects a positive atmosphere and opportunities for growth."
good,I worked for a company that was contracted by Xcel. I entered work orders. The best part of the job was management. Competitive pay. The worst part was dealing with support issues with my lap top.
good,It is a lot of work and stress serving customers all day long but being on a team with others and having individual goals along with team goals make it feel like you have help and people to understand what is going on.
good,Touch and go they seem to care about your life outside of work one day but then if you cant do the over time for lack of child care they aren't very concerning.
good,"Very good pay and good work environment. I went through three different job reorganizations on five years and my children and spouse did not want to relocate, so I chose to be laid off and work for a local Company."
good,"Has given me great work and technical experience while also working with my schedule, allowing me to come in when I could. The other engineers and my supervisor were always willing to talk and help."
good,"Management and co-workers were nice. Laid back culture. The company needs to invest more in training and have a more standard policy and procedure across the company. The hardest part of my job was to wait for ""busy"" people to get the job done."
good,"Just hit my two year mark with Technical Training in the Energy Supply side and continue to look forward to going to work in the mornings. I have a very supportive supervisor, manager and co-workers. We are constantly bouncing ideas off of each other and solicit feedback, formal and informal, from apprentices and trainees in order to make the material more relevant. I have received full performance bonuses as I am always looking for additional opportunities to challenge myself. After working for the federal government for 20 years, the benefits are not as good but my supervisor allows us to take afternoons off here and there without taking PTO. I also take full advantage of the 40 hours of volunteer paid time off working with veterans."
good,A typical workday consisted of receiving calls from customer that where having issues and trying to resolve them in a timely manner.
good,"I liked working here because my type of work. I was on phones all day with customers trying to help them , and i loved it."
good,"turned out not to be the job for me, but if you don't like standing for 8+ hours, enjoy talking all day, helping people, and staring at a screen your whole shift, then this might be the job for you. The management was great though."
good,When I first walked in to the lay-down yard my co workers that were engineers looked at me differently because i was only in a two year college but then they soon realized that I was more educated then they expected.
good,I found my contribution to be  valued and appreciated the projects that I was assigned to.  I was looked upon as a respected professional on day one of the position.
good,"Company is extremely flexible in accommodating schedules.  Compensation very reasonable, but some instability in long-term strategy and planning due to external business environments. Politics apparent, but not oppressive."
good,"Everyone that I have worked with has been friendly and genuine. Management gives great feedback and is focused on developing individuals. The culture is focused on teamwork, and innovation."
good,This company take the initiative making sure that are able to excel by offering various IT training with the latest software for  forecasting and production.
good,"I am very happy to have worked for a company that cared so much for its employees> I enjoyed my coworkers, they were like family"
good,Easy paced job with much learning potential. Family type atmosphere with plenty of extra perks to go along with salary. Good benefits as well.
good,"I thought Xcel Energy was a great place to work and supported a very professional, yet fun work environment."
good,"Business casual work atmosphere, management are all very friendly and helpful. I really appreciate fact that company works with your life schedule. "
good,You are challenged and supported to be able to expand and become better.  Collaborative environment where the team helps each other to expand and grow.  Excellent pay and benefits packages to boot.
good,A typical day at work was really relaxed but productive. I learned about Xcel programs and how they assist their customers. The hardest part of the job was balancing it with my other job in retail.
good,Supportive working environment with consistent hours. Provide great incentives for overtime hours as well as bonuses for promoting product and services. Hardest part of the job is meeting the strict guidelines for call length and availability
good,"I loved this roles as a security architect, it has been a privilege to protect their electrical grid from hacking."
good,retired in 2002 after 30 years. would like to get back in the work force to earn some extra money. I have a good work record and get along with people.
good,Working in the nuclear power industry is very challenging yet rewarding.  The balance between job work and life was always maintained.  There was always opportunities to make contribution in areas outside of your core work responsibilities.
good,"Liked the work it was a good pace and great pay. You are appreciated for what you contribute. All benefits offered and affordable compared to other large companies. High deductible health insurance this is one down fall. Roughly $4k per person & $8k per family. VSP for vision. Delta dental for dental. Life, AD&D, STD & LTD also offered among others. PTO is based on your years of service but do accumulate monthly."
good,Good open communication working with other and main focus is to do what you came to do
good,Great place to work. Plenty of days off. Plenty employees that are willing to help with whatever. The job mainly consisted of training to actually learn most plant equipment. After the apprenticeship was done we were on our own doing work orders and tests on plant equipment.
good,"The management is willing to listen to you and help you out. They would always do things to help the employee out. They would have fairs, they would provide food almost everyday. The worst part is probably just talking to rude customers on the phone. For the most part, I did enjoy it."
good,Great place to work. Open culture. Many opportunities for advancement. Multiple locations to choose from. Denver and Minneapolis are lower cost locations.
good,Great learning opportunity as an intern.  Was encouraged to continue my education.  Appreciated strong focus on safety and good training program.  People were very supportive and friendly.
good,Xcel Energy is a great place to work because of the security and longevity of employees.  Very easy to get along with employees.  Employees work as one company.
good,"Xcel Energy was a great company to work for during the time I was there. However, the department I worked for did not have benefits for employees. You had to earn benefits and it was vague in how you were supposed to achieve that. It was not based off years or merit. There were outstanding employees there who worked for the company for more then 10 years and still did not have benefits."
good,"Great client to work with - smooth transition from XP to Windows 7"
good,My experience with Xcel Energy is exactly the same as that of Northern States Power as they changed names while I was there.  It is the same company.
good,A very good place to work. Great beginner job and great experience working with customers. Good benefits after three months and bonuses every once in a while.
good,"Xcel energy really truly cares about their employees, and it creates a wonderful working atmosphere to know how appreciated we are. They always pamper us :)"
good,I am very busy with a small team and an incredible amount of work. There is never enough time in the day to complete everything you need to get done.
good,"Great place to work, the people there all genuinely care about their co-workers and the work that they are doing. I also love what I do but will be without a position at the beginning of 2016 due to a reorganization."
good,"I already did a review, it was a great work place. No lack of work and all the overtime you can handle."
good,"Worked for “The Structure Group” on the Xcel Energy Display Migration for Dynamic EMS (DEMS) Project,"
good,"I assisted three distribution engineers with their daily responsibilities. I investigate device outages and submit any work for issue found. I also would perform load balancing and voltage analysis projects. "
good,most days we were giving the daily plan in the morning then everyone went to the job site communicated with each other to meet that days goal all co workers worked well with each other
good,"Good job and great experience. Would definitely recommend the job to others. Can’t complain, they worked with my daily schedule. I’d definitely recommend going back when the time is right."
good,"For the most part the job was fun and laid back. I would work for them again. The work load was easy, has a great systematic routine that is easy to learn and follow."
good,"Fast paced day during outages. "
good,XCEL is a great place to work. The people are friendly and the environment is conducive. The only fault I find is that contractors are poorly paid and have no benefits.
good,Customer focused organization with fantastic employees that are committed to ensuring customers' energy needs are met.  The hardest part is being able to meet the high workload demands efficiently and cost-effectively.
good,I enjoy all of the opportunities given to employees for career growth and giving back to the communities we serve.  Exposure to learning about the energy industry is robust.
good,Management is very proactive with regards to safety and work/life balance. flexible work hours are readily available. free fitness center memvership. Only drawback is having to pay to park which is quite expensive.
good,Serious workplace. High degree of safety responsibility. heavy equipment and high voltage. No place for daydreamers. Good sense of accomplishment on a regular basis. Some of the management people were unlikeable - unnecessarily. Some you would give the shirt off your back to. I just started getting a little tired of all the seasonal layoffs and lately a lot of traveling for weeks at a time. I'm a family man and prefer not being away from home so much. I made some genuine friends who not only exhibited but shared high degrees of skill.
good,"Enjoyed working there, but at times customers wpuld be very rude towards agents. It isn't recommended for everyone. I would recommend it to anyone that's ok with working mandatory overtime"
good,A good company to work with. They take care of employee's. Very professional atmosphere. Very busy call center. Coworkers are great to work with. Always something to do.
good,"I really enjoyed working here."
good,"good place to work yes it is, this is bullpoop though that I have to write this crapola.  words words trying to meet the minimum letters thing, im drinking coffee"
good,Great place to work!  Great people to work with and fair pay for most positions.  Very stable company with an over all good work environment and work life balance.
good,Great company to work for job security lots of opportunity.  Managrment is ever changing. This is a 24 hour 7 day. A week company
good,Comfortable work environment with supportive management. Excellent opportunities for career changes and advancement. Always feel my efforts are valued by the company.
good,"Xcel is a very successful utility company in the electricity and gas business.  They are a highly desirable employer in Denver, CO."
good,"A typical day at Xcel Energy was vary fast pace on average I handle up to 300 or more calls a day. I learned while working at Xcel Energy how to manage my utility bills and set up my own payment arrangements. Managers were available to help you solve a problem to ensure that all customer were satisfied. During my time, co-workers were available if there was no supervisor around to assist. The hardest part of the job is when there is a gas leak because you're a little scared for the customer but you have to remain calm and help the customer to the best of your ability. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving help to customers in need."
good,"I love working with Xcel team, it is very fun and loving environment. Colleagues are so understanding that the work life seems to be very cool. The company and the management are open to new ideas and designs and there is a lot of meetings which is focused on the employee satisfaction."
good,"Xcel Energy happens to be an exciting work environment with passionate staff, many of whom are enthusiastic about the company's overall goals and objectives. Managers exhibit good leadership qualities."
good,daily activity is base on ticketing system and what ever tasks assigned to you. why there I enrich my team work experience communication skills and multitasking skills.
good,Worked in the Customer call center. We had to meet a quota of calls per day. We were monitored weekly. The company did offer great benefits. Learned how to deal with customers and offer solutions to their billing and order questions.
good,I did enjoy my time there and would go back. I enjoyed all the people I worked with and management was good to work for.  The only thing i did not like was the schedule i only had one weekend off a month.
good,"I made anywhere from 80 to 100+ outbound credit collection/courtesy calls to customers a day. I had to cure accounts either by collecting full or past due balances, set up pay arrangements etc. Educate customers on products and services the company offers. Collect money and Customer Service."
good,"Great place to work, great people, wonderful mission statement.  They are attempting to balance the environment and business profits while not forgetting the people component of their business"
good,"Good pay and good people to work with.  As the years went by the family atmosphere and the contact with upper management decreased.  Care for employees seemed to wan over the years.  But all in in all it provided a great living for me and my family.  Safety was always a to priority even to a fault.  I made it through 36 years with no serious injuries.  The work was strenuous at times and technical at times and there was always a challenge if f you were willing to take it."
good,"Great work environment. Close to home but, but job contract changed, without chance of rehire. Scope of services working with all aspects of the client."

good,Nice environment.  Good employee engagement.  Interesting projects to work on.  Good advancement possibilities.  Was able to work flexible hours avoiding any traffic issues.
good,"Excellent place to work if you can get on full time to enjoy the benefits. As a contract worker, it depends who you are contracted through, but either way it is an excellent place to work at!"
good,I liked working at Xcel. I don't think they pay the meters enough money and their benefits cost the employees too much.

good,"The corporate culture has really evolved over the last 10 years since Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwest Public Service formed Xcel Energy."
good,Great company but poor management. The company is too wide spread to address the concerns of individuals. It stretches from the south to the north and obviously it causes massive difference of opinion in the personell
good,"As mentioned in other reviews it can be back-to-back calls but the day goes by fast. Some customers can be difficult but most are nice and it's especially rewarding to turn an unhappy customer to a happy one! 6 paid holidays, 5 floating holidays, 11 hours of PTO earned per month. Health, dental, vision, 401k, etc. Always some sort of food it seems like. No flexibility in scheduling really and calls are QA'd for a lot of different things, but a great place to work!"

Dressing clean and making sure to have all uniforms on. This is a daily/typical day at work. I really enjoyed working at this place. The hardest part of the job; the machine doesn't work well, meaning the cash register, and the machine for ice/ice cream, cheese and other things as well. This will cause the customer to be mad and this is a money issue as well-the items doesn't sell well."
