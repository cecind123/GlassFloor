rating,review
bad,"All management cares about is you making money for them- NUMBERS. You are a dollar sign to them. No respect for employees. Managers enable bad behavior and participate in bad mouthing employees in front of others employees and clients. Managers discipline employees in front of clients embarrassing them."
bad,I personally didn’t like this job field. The workers were so competitive and would come up to you and scream at you if you ‘ gave away their client to someone else ‘ . Had no respect would do it in front of everyone including customers and the boss and they wouldn’t say a thing . As a person who just started there and didn’t know the clients well yet this was unfair and humiliating.
bad,My 1st 3 yrs was awesome... New DM takes over... My skills the same... Instead of pay increase dropped me back to minimum wage then to come to find out I'm training people that is family members to the new managers for $2 more than after 10 yrs of there games... My abilities to file a return and I was A receptionist... Extremely knowledgeable... A lot of jealousy issues ppl being rude staff... Decided hr is more than a headache and extremely negativeissues...
bad,Tax preparers do not care if mess up a tax return. Bullying was all the time from other office workers. Headquarters hours away and never supported the office.
bad,Terrible system of paying for taking their Tax Course in order to get a job offer.  You get hardly any hours and if you do not take the Tax Course the next year then can not work there.  Pays only minimum wage or 25 cents more!
bad,"I believe people who are not well funded need some kind of alternative banking services. HRBlock is positioned to provide those services.  And so this company has come up with a predatory and self-serving set of alternatives to serve poor people:To fleece recipients of Earned Income Credit and any tax refunds they have coming as fast as possible."
bad,"Very difficult place to work, rude management and will harrass you enough so you quit. There is little training & rough coaching. "
bad,The manager was never there unless she was having an affair after hours at the office with one of her employees and let the other ladies at the office bully and degrade me and others as well as stealing there cliants. I was constantly in trouble for things the other ladies at the office told the manager that I was unaware were wrong such as eatting and drinking coffee at my desk.
bad,"I was told by another Multi-unit manager that the clique would run me off. I am the wrong ""color"" and basically didn't fit in. I felt discriminated against from day 1 and was never ""included""! There was no inclusion at all, they are a group and no one different is going to enter that, even though I did try. Management should have nipped that in the bud immediately. Just a horrible experience over all. I can not recommend this company in this district to anyone."
bad,So busy there where times I could not sign in to pc.  I was on the phone non stop. One time I timed how long I was answering phones and it was 5 hours straight without not being able to take a drink.  Others in the office where very bossy and over lording.  Awful!
bad,District and Regional Management are only concerned with bottom line.  No associate advancement opportunities.   Constantly placing less qualified individuals in highly skilled positions because they are paid less.  Break federal pay contracts as well as falsifying paperwork to mask nonqualified individuals to satisfy local contract parameters.   Force employees to cheat clients in the name of great customer service.
bad,"Toxic, overworked- underpaid, racist, sexist environment (but more specifically 1 manager)"
bad,The company expects you to move up in certification levels by making false promises about pay increase. They keep hiring new people because of the high turn over.
bad,"I worked for them for 14 years and they are NOT a good place to work. They don't care about employees, the DM's are out of control and unfair. DM are allowed to play favorites make bad decisions with no place to lodge a complaint against them. I would not recommend H&R Block to anyone!"
bad,H&R Block sucks there a rip off company that over charges and rips off its clients and doesn’t stand behind clients or employees they don’t promote within raises are non existent I was there 12 years I left to open my own business
bad,You are more a telemarketer than a tax preparer.  They are more worried about handing out flyers printed in black in white on old printers low ink than doing what the job description says.  The upper management lets the basic employees tell the mangers what to do.
bad,"The fees for tax preparation are extremely high but most of the money is kept by shareholders. There’s no compensation for going above and beyond, there’s no clarity in how they pay, your end of the season pay is always less than what you’ve worked for. Never mind in the office, no office supplies, not even enough toilet paper for customers or staff. They’ve become stingy and greedy.very stingy and greedy."
bad,"The office staffs were fun to work with, but the District manager was relentless with short timelines to get things done and countless emails all day and night to push and prod all of the managers."
bad,"Environment very stressful and disrespectful for the manager at that time, I'm still frustrated for everything she did against me. Every morning waiting for for with the finger point at me, claiming what Hispanic people did  or do on the town I live in, making me guilty of their behavior."
bad,"Taking care of clients with their tax situations was rewarding for a majority of the time I was working there. I learned each tax situation was unique and needed to be handled in a different way. Management leaves a lot to be desired. Wanting to create a team environment is an excellent concept but the follow through was poor at best. I learned that there is an ""I"" in team. The 'I"" is the DGM.  The hardest part of the job is knowing what was required as the DGM would change things on a daily basis making it very difficult to do the job to the best of your ability. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on the clients face when you showed them they were getting a refund on their return or the balance due was less than they feared."
bad,"You get paid barely over minimum wage, Commission is based on number of returns you prepare. If you go into bonus , their program gives you more hours when customers are not likely to show up, so essentially you work long hours for free. The experienced preparers take most of the deals and leave you with almost no chance of getting bonus. It is a cutthroat environment."
bad,"Very stressful place to work"
bad,They don’t care. They work with out breaks. They yell and scream at employees. They expect you to work all weekends. No breaks allowed. They don’t give raises at all.
bad,"Stay away...."
bad,"Terrible. Everybody is there to cut throats; backstabbers!"
bad,"I don't agee with their policy but it's a job. Some of the workers were great. Some rude. But if you need the money it works."
bad,"Ideal for retirees, SAHM, or others who are not looking for room to grow, potential, or full time hours. Not ideal for someone looking to advance in their own career."
bad,"It is no longer just about doing taxes"
bad,It can be a great place to work if you do not upset the wrong people. They pretend to do the right things but do not actually care about laws. They will work you day and night and if you need a break they take away all of your hours and refuse to let you work again.
bad,"Never received a raise but always asked to take on other projects."
bad,Probably the worst run company I have ever worked with.  The office culture was toxic.  The remote managers didn’t have an social skills.  A lot of confusion daily on procedures.  Over worked and terribly under paid part time staff.
bad,"Very Poor management. Totally unqualified and unprofessional. "
bad,This was a great job till I moved to Bullhead city Az. It was no longer a company job. I felt like a second class citizen with 0 experience not a person with 15 years of experience
bad,good thing is all the courses available . you do not have to pay for expensive courses. you can take as many as you want and only have to pay 20 dollars a year
bad,"I worked for Block for a year and a half. Purely Commission at minimum wage. Very political environment.  The District Manager had favorites and made life miserable for those he did not like. There are no benefits.  Commission is based on the amount charged on tax returns, so the incentive is to drive prices up. Clients are mostly blue collar and lower. At the end of the day we were asked to perform janitorial duties on our own time. Empty wastebaskets, sweep floors, clean toilets.  It is a dying company.  I would never go back."
bad,"Business manager was rude to employees and customers wanted to making every customer pay for every little thing."
bad,This is a role you could use as a first job on your resume. Nothing more! If you are a retiree and want to be busy then it’s for you. But know that it pays 7.25 an hour
bad,Too much micromanaging. No days off. Not considerate for others. Money driving and don’t care about their employees or customers. Long working hours with no recognition. No time off to spend with family.
bad,"Although training seems extensive, workers are not well prepared for what a typical day is there. we're thrown into situations and basically told to figure it out"
bad,"I was told I would get a minimum of 16 hours every week, and eventually was allocated a shift only for 5 hours in a month, no communication or timeliness. Kept calling and following up and no one ever cared to respond!!"
bad,"When I first joined this company, it provided the opportunity to get my foot into the accounting world. It was about helping people with taxes. I enjoyed it very much. Recently, it's all about sales, sales, sales. They wanted us to push products onto our customers. We ask, and when we don't meet the numbers, they ask why not. I have been their for over 16 yrs, I felt very unappreciated. The atmosphere has changed drastically where I had to leave the company just last year when I had a car accident. They treated me like I was non-existent and I couldn't even use my employee benefits to prepare my own tax return."
bad,Lots of back stabbing throughout offices with little support from upper management. Too many long distance meetings that consume the whole day with continuous increased daily demands to meet quotas.
bad,"This is a good entry-level job for those who have no job experience and need work desperately. But otherwise, I don't recommend. The tax pro's were really rude and nasty. They talked about other tax pro's, clients and CSP's. I had clients storm out because one of the tax pro's had the rude demeanor. I had to take out the garbage, file away documents, make phone calls to clients over 100 a day, count the draw at the end of the day; don't get me wrong all of that is good experience but for the pay and stress it isn't worth it one bit. I like the flexible hours. The original office I was at, I had to relocate. The price the clients pay for their taxes is a lot. They run this place like a puppy mill and give CSP's who aren't appreciated more pay. It's so much more but I'd rather not. This is my last season here, not again. Know your worth."
bad,"No one should have to spend money on a class and end up making $9 per hour. Managers are never in the office. The old-timers are rude and unhelpful.  Drama, rumors and bad-mouthing are everywhere.  If you don’t want anything repeated don’t say anything about anybody."
bad,"I was so excited for this job and loved helping and serving the customers.  However, H&R Block broke my heart with their biases and poor treatment of incomers.  The advanced agents do not want the competition or taking time out to help a coworker in need."
bad,"Low Pay made the same wage for 2 Seasons.  No Benefits. Very clicky environment. The regular associates look down upon the Seasonal Associates.  When I applied for a regular position, I did not even get interviewed even though it was my 2nd Season. They hired a young man who had worked there for a month. When I asked why I didn't receive my fair shot I was told ""we don't have to interview you, we can do what we want"",  Unethical."
bad,They expect you to come in on your days off to learn their system.  It is not the best place to work as they mainly want to make as much money as they can and pay their employees the least possible.
bad,They dont pay good not enough hours an the manager is very aggravating the work is easy but when you have a manager  always breathing down your shoulder is aggravating for the pay they give you no worth it
bad,On the operations side of things they expect a lot out of and management has no clue what it is really like in the field.  Corporate policy changes constantly.
bad,"The work place was ok at first, new ""younger"" management arrived and things changed. Lack of management , high school environment, fights, and poor communication between management and employees."
bad,"High turnover, at the beginning it is nice but once you get to know management they do not care. Also, this company breaks California Labor Law regarding Sick pay. Call out, use your sick hours and will still get occurrences. Once settled you will see all the shady things that go on. They had told employees that all they are is functions that is it, reason for high turnover. Only a few last one reason is because during tax season you cannot call out, mandatory overtime and yeah free lunches but you have to work through your lunch in order to get a three inch sub, not worth it. Go for an interview and ask a TSC agent if they like working there."
bad,Ended up paying for all my training with no reimbursement. Had many issues with management. Had to drive and get everyone lunch every day and was never reimbursed for gas or food.
bad,They take advantage of you and if management does not make their numbers everyone is geting written up so the blame is not on them. If you make the numbers then not even and thank you.
bad,Does not keep the same manager from year to year and does not promote from within. Hires managers with no working experience. I was wrote up for things out of my controll
bad,"seasonal work only there for two months:"
bad,"Long slow days with very little in terms of excitement or appeal. Just sit at the desk and wait for customers to come in. If you need extra money, then maybe go for it."
bad,"This company is was closed due to a purchasing issue with sister company Option One.  This was a subprime mortgage company, so this has NO present to anything on going."
bad,This company most likely won't exist soon...and they will treat you that way. They expect for you to live and breathe them and then over charge and mess up taxes. There is not enough training and expect your boss to change almost twice a year.
bad,"Our location was not known for good tax preparers, they didn't have a relationship with their surrounding community.  That was due to poor management and marketing.  Management did not embrace the culture around the office and business was slooooow because of it.  Business is slow = small paycheck."
bad,Job sucks don’t get hours pay sucks management was rude and they didn’t know anything from a whole in the ground . They need to get there minds out there butt to do the job right .
bad,H&R Block did not have enough hours to keep me working there. In general they are very nice people to work for. I will not be returning there although they do want me to.
bad,"During tax season you might work 10 hour days, seven days a week."
bad,The did not train me and it was a very chaotic place to work. The place was very hectic and there was not very much room for improvement without help that they were not willing to give.
bad,"•	To give client an excellent customer service experience"
bad,"I learned a lot from working at H&R Block. Marketing for new clients, getting clients to sign up for additional services like Loans Advancements, Debit Accounts, Etc..."
bad,I have no good review for this company since their actions towards my employment wasn't favorable.. I would help customers and spend the companies valuable time with each and every one and they didn't appreciate this
bad,The clients were interesting.  they came from all walks of life.  The people I worked with were really nice and we call got along with one another.  There were days that we were really slow and other days that we were really busy.
bad,"H&R Blocks continues to go after the low income customers so that they can offer add-ons that really are not a good deal for the client.  They push their tax preparers to add-on as much as possible, as opposed to teaching the tax preparers more complex returns that would bring bigger fees."
bad,Lots of opportunities here. I enjoyed working here for the time that I did. Great location with a short commute for Davis county employees. I would recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"If not for my manager, I wouldn't have stayed all season. Not a good company to work for. Ergonomically incorrect. Disorganized. Had another data breach. Don't trust."
bad,was a hard day at work everyday. you worked with the public and it could be very stressful. Management was nice and helpful unless they were stressed..
bad,"I worked for H&R Block for 1 tax season.  I really liked the people I worked with and I enjoyed my job.  Most of the clients were nice but some were not.  The pay for the work I did was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, I did my best because I was taught and desire to always do my best.  My co-workers appreciated me for that."
bad,I loved the work/life balance and the wonderful clientele I built. They became like family to me. The hours were flexible and allowed me to be with my children.
bad,This is a company where it is about who you know or at least in the Norfolk District. If not like or cared for by management they will do petty things to their employees instead of being a trustworthy company.
bad,"Easy job, I learned Points of Sale. Office was GREAT the main managers didn't make efforts to know your name. Dishonest about pay you agreed to your pay and when your check comes it's less and they seem to forget important things like this! You set what you think are your hours and someone comes along and changes them without your knowledge!"
bad,I enjoyed working with the customers the most.  The Tax Pros in the office always bickered and were talking about people behind their back.  The pay was also very very low.
bad,"I did not enjoy working here. There was no room for advancement, long hours, rude customers, and co-workers were horrible. It doesn't matter if you work for a corporately own location or franchise. No organization at all."
bad,During the off season you are able to take different classes  to improve your knowledge when assisting clients when preparing their income tax returns
bad,Very unprofessional company to work for management is very unprofessional. Communication with management is not professional and very unorganized. The pay rate is minimum wage which is very low.
bad,"Too much work to do at new job so less time for a seasonal job there is nothing else to say"
bad,Had to take a class that I spent over 600 dollars for to learn how to do taxes. Teacher was not very helpful had to do a lot of learning on my own. Once we were put into jobs the instructor owned the H and R block we worked at and was never available to assist with any questions.
bad,The job was very stressful. PC's and printers were constantly down because of the over use of the equipment. That was out dated. A lot of travel time to different locations.
bad,I f you have any self-drive or ambition get ready to get rid of those. They will do everything to steal your clients and undermine your job. The territorialism and cattiness is too much.
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked for. Managers are not trained properly, and are usually low level tax associates, and are quick to lie on you to higher management to make themselves look better. Pay is poor, at $9/hr will little hours for new associates. Higher tax pros are extremely rude and treat new associates like they don't belong there, and always get first pick on potential clients."
bad,"WSI staffing hired for temp work, the trainers would take phone calls during class but then yell at the people in the group for having their phones out, they only hired for month long staffing needs for H&R Block for certain promotions, once that promotion was done, they didn't train you on the new one coming out, instead your temp position was done"
bad,"Uneducated and unethical company. Employees constantly discuss the clients and their private financial information in the office, which is unethical, and against all policies of the IRS and HR Block Corporate directives. They also gossip about co workers and upper management with other employees as well as clients they have in the office. None of the employees have any formal education, most barely have their GED's, and yet people willing share their financial information with them. And these same employees gossip non stop about their clients among themselves and even with other clients. When you remind them this is not correct, they cold shoulder you, click together like a pack of wolves and try to make your work day unbearable. Low pay, no benefits, you have update training available, but this is all a joke, because the ""office manager"", gives you the answers so you are not really tested on your abilities, but rather on how ""tight"" your relationship with the office manager is. Very unprofessional, disorganized, and very ""loose"" with the client information they receive. Not a good place of employment for anyone, especially a trained professional."
bad,this was a fast paced job and very stressful. There was no flexibility in work schedule. This was a seasonal job so there were no benefits and you were not guaranteed a position the following year.
bad,"This position is seasonal but no one was made aware of it. "
bad,Some tax professionals are great.  Others have quirky attitudes.  The cast of characters that come through the door to have their taxes done are the highlight depending on what office you work in.
bad,Not happy place to work. Tax pros competitive. Not supportive of CSR to relieve for breaks of ANY kind. Continual pressure to move into tax pro position after repeatedly stating no interest.
bad,Company culture is not supportive of women in leadership positions. Annual reorg and workforce cuts have caused top talent to leave the company. Remaining associates are forced to do the work of multiple people.
bad,"I was sexually harassed by my district and store manager. I filed a claim with the human resources department, and while the two men lost their jobs, I also was not allowed to return by the next season. The environment is incredibly ageist, closed off to younger individuals, populated mostly by older women. After the first year, you switch to minimum wage and commission, which you will most likely never see."
bad,its OK for a kid who doesn't have bills to pay but if you need a steady income its probably not the place for you because i only worked for them during tax season
bad,"I was able to work and stay at this office because I liked my co workers. Other than that, I don't recommend this place to others. Owner don't care about employee's benefit and don't really know how to handle management. Thus, there was a high turnover."
bad,Rough place to work. Everyone is old and doesnt say anything to you when youre new. The old people dont help you out at all and the managers are rude.
bad,"During my time with this company I was treated poorly. Provided misleading information from the owners. Forced to work OT hours at regular pay, was told that labour standards did not apply as I had signed an employment contract. I was also told that there was no WCB coverage for us ""office"" staff, even after an injury that I still have problems with."
bad,"Very slow, boring place to work until tax season then it gets hectic. Low pay, management/seasoned employees were not very helpful, expected new people to be able to assist customers without guidance"
bad,"no breaks no lunches, poor pay"
bad,"In the 20 years I have worked there, there have been many changes. some good some not so good. During tax season you used to be there to work for the customer as many hours as needed. With new rules this last year not so much for customer much more for company pockets."
bad,They under pay their employees for the job they do and the hours that they make you work.  don't care if they job is done right only out to make money no matter what.  they want you to go to paking lots and put flyers on cars
bad,"pricing is to high and they do not about their clients as long as they come in and pay. Sell selll sell They want your to sell their products even though some clients don not need or can afford them"
bad,You have to understand you work to help others understand it's not about just making money it is about helping others. Doing a good job makes people happy helping people understand is better but you have to know and understand yourself
bad,This one is the biggest offenders when it comes to stressful work environments. This company expects its call center employees to work miracles with the limited resources that it provides them with.
bad,"You have so many clients to work for and you don't have the ability to tell them how much your services cost until the end."
bad,"You don't feel valued. I feel that during the hiring process, it should be way more extensive. Contrsts should not come before customer service."
bad,negative high stress environment. poorly managed and they treat their employees terrible. You will not be appreciated and poorly compensated for your work
bad,"Parttime work. Greeted clients and set appointments for ta professionals.  Relearned computer skills.  Management scheduled appropriate times for work."
bad,In short I did not feel safe at this job location. There were fights as well as police officers on site each day. It was a call center environment and no one seemed to care what happened during a shift.
bad,"I enjoy working with H&R Block, the excitement of helping my team help provide the best customer service and watching the team grow. As Managers I always look forward to the Manager meetings we hold once a month, the knowledge that I can take back to my team is very helpful. I look forward to going to work everyday and helping the team be the best they can be. to watch the office grow in New clients and the pride on my teams faces when the reach a goal."
bad,"Great learning experience, plus you get to learn more about things you should know about being and adult and knowing what you pay in taxes. Good client interaction."
bad,"The best part of H&R Block was most definetely the clients."
bad,I was hired back in December for this company went to all my training and the manager never put me on the schedule. She told me to keep calling a she would but didn't
bad,I do not wish to leave any comments or opinions regarding this company and/or establishment.  I only worked for the short 2015 tax season.  Learned what I needed to learn and gained experience.
bad,The store was a very busy location with a lot of loyal customers. The upper management was not very supportive and did nothing to insure the safety of the employees. Did not help with inventory control
bad,"this is a seasonal job to begin with and they make promises but don't keep them, people don't show up when they are scheduled to work and the company wants you to sell their products"
bad,"They only care about themselves & not the clients "
bad,its a seasonal job which you wont get the next year so dont waste your time or energy for 7.50 a hour and 40 to 10 hours a week its not worth it at all .
bad,"H & R Block is one of the worst companies to work for. Pay is started off at minimum wage and decreases to commission after the first year based on the volume of returns you complete. Managers are supposed to base your schedule on your availability, but often times they set the schedule without any regards to your full-time job and expect you to find someone to cover your shift you couldn't make in the first place. Very cut-throat competitive environment since every customer that walks in is a potential paycheck. Not a place to work if you have outside commitments (such as picking up children from school, etc.) because you have to stay in the office until the last customer is served, which often means 1 am during peak tax season. No meal breaks allowed. Managers don't train you, so you are left to figure out the process on your own. If I were you, take the class to learn the basics, but join a legit CPA firm for the experience."
bad,H&R Block does not value their employees nor their clients.  I believe the company will suffer for it and probably won't be around in the next five years at least in the same capacity .
bad,"H&R Block for me is not a good place to work, there is no security, the pay is horrible, and there are no benefits."
bad,The hardest part of the job was not having a supportive district office manager. It was very difficult to escalate customer issues to management.
bad,"My manager was nice however, company was downsizing and I had no room for advancement. Learned how to deal with the public."
bad,"This company will try and lure you in with flyers, posts, and ads that for $ 50.00 and hour.  The fact is, I answered one,  Dispite all their promises of high potential earning and clients coming in the door (next week.month) I made just $ 8,000 over 6 month period. This is because the real hourly pay is between $ 10 and 15 and $ 9.00 if they say you need their training.  "
bad,"This is a 3 month position, hours a 10 hours a day 6 day a week.  They expect a lot and do not give anything.  I have gone in on Saturdays for many years because I had a good friend who was the office manager."
bad,"This is a job for retirees or part-timers. In order to qualify for benefits, you have to work an average of 30 hours per week for the entire year. Normally, you have to take an 8 week break some time in the off season, so no one in the ""field"" i.e. tax preparers, can qualify for benefits."
bad,"HR Block, we are Educated by taking online and in classes to better our skill for each tax year. Working at HR Block is a place to update my skills, customer services skills,  meeting and greeting people. At Block their is nothing hard about the job, all co-workers are team players to get any task completed throughout the office. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment of the office set."
bad,"Run, run, run from this position.  It will appear to be a good career move for management.  Truth is you will work 100X harder and longer than any retail management job and not be paid for your time.  The salary is very low for hours worked.   There is training available, however the District Managers do not use what is available so you always feel like you are waiting for the DM to decide to teach anything. The company culture of fear and intimidation so  that you could loose your job at any moment to get you to do what they want. Watch your back. If you value honesty and integrity this is not the company for you. You will eventually have to make a choice to give up your integrity to survive."
bad,Working towards preparing taxes was great and very interesting to serve clients who have great regards for all tax associates.
bad,H & R Block has unusual business model where employees with the least tax knowledge are promoted to managers.  The Regional Manager job description describes a perfect candidate's background to include experience working at Best Buy.  Not a good company for someone looking for a career in taxation.  Retirees work the tax season and then collect unemployment until it runs out.
bad,This is a tax company that has a high client flow. This company is busy from Jan-April. Most employee's are seasonal and replaceable.
bad,Fine as a PT job for 5-10 hours a week.  Only pays $8.00 hour and the tax professionals are rude to new hires.  Tax professionals also gossip in front of clients about other clients.  Unprofessional.
bad,Company was interested in profits not their employees. The commission structure pitted employees against each other.
bad,"This was the worst company I have ever worked for, would not recommend it to anyone.  A fellow CSP and I got into a disagreement.  We were both written up for this, but then I was terminated.  When I asked if the other employee would be terminated I was told that  it would be looked into, but other employee was not terminated."
bad,I worked in a tier 2 problem resolve center . Customers were first sent to the Philippines which upset them even more. Once they reached us most of the customers were livid and it was our job during tax season to calm them down.. That was very challenging.
bad,This was a temporary part-time job. I was promised more hours than I actually worked. I spent my free time looking for another job.
bad,"Management is horrible!"
bad,"Seasonal job, low pay, irregular hours, professional office environment, good location, enjoyed meeting people and helping them with their tax questions."
bad,"Overall I really enjoyed the administrative duties I had for as putting the clients packets together for their taxes,copying, filing and also seeing confidential information for as ssn, check stubs etc."
bad,Was one of the most horrible job I have ever had The management suck and they give no cares about there employees. All they worry about is the work and if your getting it done
bad,"Organized and distributed packages to the appropriate delivery driver."
bad,"Great self-directed training."
bad,"I had a wonderful manager she was very good at her job. Nice work environment, with a quick training process. Be prepared for your hours to change each week sometimes getting a lot and only getting a few at times."
bad,"I regret spending the last 4 years of my life in this job, working for a company that doesn't care about its employees, with no hope of ever advancing your career.  A horrible company to work for."
bad,"I work for the company for 17 years. I felt like the company didn't"
bad,"While some consider H&R Block an excellent company to work for, "
bad,"I was a mortgage loan processor. I would input data, verify employment, order title, appraisal, insurance, credit report, verify employment and payment history. I would calculate income to debt ratio and follow up on any other documentation that was needed for the file. I learned to multi task at this position. It is very fast paced and detailed. I worked well with my co-workers, we often worked as a team at month end to get all loans processed. The hardest part of this job was month end. People prefer to close at the end of the month so you would have several loans at that time. You would have to work late nights to get the loans completed for close. The job was a lot of work but it was not boring you always stayed busy."
bad,Being able to work with other experienced Income Tax Preparers
bad,This position was great but the District Marketing supervisor is not to be trusted. She has some serious issues. She not accurate and doesn't have an integrity. She in the Atlanta market! Beware!!!!! She didn't  provide an training or direction for the marketing position.  The job is easy with promotions and events to get clients in the door.
bad,"•the typical day at work"
bad,Great general manager and everyone is a team player. Everyone work well together.
bad,"There was classes to attend to learn how to be nice to the public."
bad,"•	Averaged $500,000 in monthly sales volume "
bad,"Little training, little pay, job only available for tax season"
bad,i answer phones and set appointment and do lot of filling the call to come pick up your packet.
bad,"Everything about H&R Block was BAD. Sucks, sucks, sucks,sucks,sucks."
bad,"Employees were not friendly, very cut-throat and mean spirited. Wouldn't recommend working for them at all.  Syracuse headquarters was useless in even address the backstabbing from other branches, and lack of leadership from within office, lack of cooperation between employees and supervisors, and backstabbing when one didn't get promoted over another.  It wasn't a good situation. The dissed everyone no matter what."
bad,"co workers work together to help taxpayers"
bad,"* Typical day: make sure irs check's where printing, call backs for appts, making coffee for the customer's that came into h an r block."
bad,I would not work for this company again. I enjoyed greeting clients upon arrival and setting up appointments.
bad,"Favoritism, dishonesty, gossiping, verbal disrespect. And everyone is blaming the new ones for everything. Steal each others clients as if you was not sitting at your seat. Sneaky!!!"
bad,"Truck Drivers are allowed to do other people taxes, not what you expect from a professional job"
bad,"What can i say about hr block, job is more of sales position then tax."
bad,A typical day at work very busy.
bad,"The owners in Lincoln,NE do not like to handle problems they like to take the easy way out. In one office an employee was harrassed by two employee's instead of moving them to another office they fired the victim. The owners also had other complaints...not worth working for."
bad,"the co-workers are great, the environment is good, the work load is constant. always more to learn"
bad,"During tax season clients expect to be serviced in a proper maner, and most of all just wnat to get the information they are there for, like whats is my refund, or how much do i owe? Clients if they want other services like a 401k plan they will seek it themself."
bad,"A typical day at work included providing customers with assurance of the right tax professional. Some co workers friendly and helpful some not. management team was terrible, and the most difficult part of the job was understanding how everything came to place with what was to be you job classification."
bad,"I thought this would be a nice part-time seasonal job, but it was instead a very disappointing overall experience."
bad,"Working there you better be prepared to be working there long hours, which there is nothing wrong with that, except you won't be able to take time off unless you want a write up. They have a zero tolerance on tardiness, and absenteeism. Even if you call in, you will still get written up, no matter what. Hey your relative dies and you call in, you still get a write up. They will tell you ""that is why we give you so many available occurrences, because we know life happens. It makes no sense to write someone up when they call in, or when there is a snow storm and your stuck in traffic, or an emergency. Still write you up for being late. The training is horrible, they show you the sites, your log in information, and then next. The senior techs there are supposed to support you, but belittle you when you don't understand something. Some of them will even cuss you out if you asked them something. I don't recommend that place to anyone. Other companies don't even like employees coming from there because they say that you don't know anything, because H & R Block doesn't teach you anything."
bad,The wages are low and you take some staff have rather extensive backgrounds and deserve more. Anyone can be taught to input data but to truly understand what it means is something else.
bad,"I liked H & R block when i first started working with them. LOVED my office and my boss, employees...it was great. Then the next year, same thing. Same office, same staff...it was like my second family. Only problem was district office dosen't really give a care in the world about their employees and they prove that all the time. It was the 3rd year i was there that was the worse. I was put into a different office and the women in that office treated me so bad that they even sent me to the back crying at times. And the manager did nothing. She was just as mean. It made me not want to go back. Even though i found out that manager was gone. I just couldn't put myself back in that situation. I even brought the situation up to the district manager and she didn't care. This is why i did not go back this year."
bad,Training was required at home and no compensation paid. Very poor compenation and not legal to require home traiing and no compensation.
bad,"Nepotism and on-the-back favours are the only way to climb in this company, that continues to fill office seats with anyone that has a heartbeat.  Students who barely know the basics are let run free doing returns that are far above their education and capabilities. If what you have is a delusional sense of confidence and are able to lie your way into good graces, this is the place for you!"
bad,"District Manager in the Watertown, NY area is a micromanaging, bully, who does NOT fully support her managers. Most dislike her lack of manners and her demeanor is anything but positive. And heaven forbid if you want to go to someone about issues with her, she will tell you that her boss will come to her and talk about you and he won't do anything about her. I used to love my job here, then I thought they believed in me, only to find out that I was a pawn in a very nonsupporting and unhealthy atmosphere. Never again, and I will gladly advise family and friends on a better avenue for their tax return. I saw way too many issues, one tax preparer is NOT like very well with the local public and many times did there have to be an intervention because HE was very unprofessional and rude."
bad,"The pay is substandard. When you look at the job description on job sites, they say they want someone with a BS in Accounting and prior tax prep experience. However, they pay everyone the same across the board, whether you have a Bachelor's and experience or if you have a GED and no experience. On top of having to pay for the Tax Prep Course (which isn't a guarantee for employment), if you decide to level up, or come back the next year, you have to pay HRB for the training that they require you to have (basically, you have to pay them to work for them). They treat first-year employees like second-class citizens, then don't understand why people don't come back. They want people to stay with them and develop big client bases, but they don't seem to understand that in order to get employees with tenure and clients, they need to treat them well and pay them well from their first day. This job has so much responsibility tied to it, but pays about as well as flipping burgers or selling sweaters. I wouldn't recommend working here at all."
bad,"Pay is substandard. You will be paid the same whether you come in with a college degree or a GED. You don't get a pay raise when you level up. For the pay, you may as well get a retail job, but the retail job has fewer responsibilities, better benefits, and an employee discount that you actually want to use."
bad,Fun job. Nice co-workers. Horrible pay. They do not provide benefits. They will hire just about anyone that passes their paid tax class. Declining industry.
bad,"Management was inadequate. Hired as a CSP, told it was a receptionist position. It became a cold calling, house keeping, phone answering position. Only 1 person could do the filing, since no one else knew their alphabet. Turnover is high. Assistant manager put manager and other CSPs down and talked about everyone behind their back. It was like getting paid $8/hr to be stuck in highschool again."
bad,"I have never worked for a more awkward, mixed up, disorganized company in my life.  Most employees leave.  Some very good people stay and try to make a difference. "
bad,HUGE disconnect between corporate and the field.  Culture is a shark tank.  No family time.  Company does not care about associate or client opinion.  Huge micro-management at all levels.  Accuracy of returns is not the emphasis.
bad,Did not like this job very stressful and very low pay but sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do. So this is all I want to say about this
bad,Excellent training opportunities.  The work is seasonal and so this job is best suited to someone who only wishes to work part time and for part of the year.
bad,There for a season and there was terrible management. My manager had no training and was learning on the job. There was no communication between seniority and lots of misunderstanding and politics. I only gave better stars for job culture because I had nice coworkers and the people working in the company for a long time are very helpful.
bad,Enjoyed my seasonal time bet would never consider a long term place to work. They make constant changes and you do not have much to look forward to in terms of advancement other than a twenty five cent yearly raise.
bad,"Employed diverse group of people, friendly staff, tax course prepared first year staff to file personal taxes. Employment guaranteed once completed tax course"
bad,I learned a lot my mentor was great-   I will say the class was much more complex than keying taxes-   Im glad I took the class-  I certainly understand more now about taxes.
bad,"Unwilling to say at this current time, however I do really like most of the ladies I work with , its nice on most days to ccome to work. And there are times that its very very stressful"
bad,H&R Block was a very interesting first experience. I would not recommend working there if you are looking to perform more advanced tax work and grow in your knowledge of taxes.
bad,"You are paid by commission or how much the tax bill income is based off of. I cannot rip people off especially senior citizens or young adults because it is not in my motto to gain a quick buck to take advantage of someone who can get it for free or does not need to be charged for simple tax questions. "
bad,Management was never available and when they were there the did nothing in a work related capacity. Jealous backbiting and disrespectful made for low morale and depressing office atmosphere.
bad,"Poor, Poor pay.  Tons of unpaid training.  Long, crazy, stressful hours.   Poor Management.  The paid preparer tax industry is dying, so if you are thinking of going through the training and going into this field- DON'T- you will be very disappointed."
bad,"Management only cares about making money and seeing as many clients through the door as possible. Training was lacking, and senior staff were too motivated to complete their own work to take any time to train new staff. Communication was seriously lacking, as staff were not given company emails.  There was no means of effectively communicating with other staff in the office that worked different shifts, and District Managers were not very good at writing effective emails; BCC function was not used, emails were paragraphs long with no effective headers and not to the point.  The company internal website was difficult to navigate and did not provide any sort of notification when updates were made. Scheduling for part time staff was so disorganized."
bad,"Excellent leadership, good training, nice people to work with and great resources both online and document library to excel.  The day includes preparation of 4-10 returns in an 8 hour day, admin and retail duties and some time for self training and education. Management is strong, workplace culture in supportive, hardest part of position is being knowledgeable on all the tax law or knowing where to go to access information to enhance your performance.  Best part is a happy client."
bad,The job was taxing. Everyday was extremely redundant. It paid minimum wage and they expected you to work late quite often but always made sure you never worked over 40 hours a week.
bad,"Scheduling in a nightmare. Slow times they cut hours now to 11-3.5 hours A WEEK!"
bad,"Not much training is given, a lot is expected. People are not especially helpful and managment lacks leadership capabilities. There are no chances of growth, they want people to work for free. Not to place to work year after year."
bad,"The hours were wonderful, working from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., however, as an entry level receptionist there was no moving up in this company."
bad,"This is the worst experience I have ever had with a business. I was hired on a Wednesday told to attend training on Thursday, which I did. There were 20 hours of training, the person read from the manual and had trouble teaching us the program. I was told I was full time. There was little or no on the job training and after 2 weeks all of client services professional were cut back to less than 10 hours a week."
bad,"Working with the same DM and manager for 2 seasons, that I was judged by the color of my skin and not the content of my character."
bad,This was a seasonal job so I was only able to learn the basics. I did enjoy helping people get the money back that I feel we deserve
bad,This company lies and cheats to get to the top. It does not care about its customers or emplyees in tonly cares about the bottom line.
bad,I have a direct manager that is wonderful and works with my schedule. I would not be a tax preparer because of how they are treated. But I believe the tax preparers are nice skillful and work well together. There is a good team work enviorment here.
bad,Not enough hours and never felt challenged.  Job was uninteresting and very boring.  Never got to do challenging returns and all the company was interested was in us selling peace of mind instead of doing a good job with the client]s returns.
bad,"This is a retail establishment, nothing more. Its driven by numbers, which in turn is dependent on how many returns you do. The more returns the bigger the bonus, but not for you as the employee. The managers are the ones who come away winners here. You are a temp employee for 90 days and thats how they look and treat you. No room for advancement except upwards in tax classification and still they treat you like a third class passenger and they pay like it too. "
bad,"Minimum wage pay with high stress. Asking for time off is frowned upon. Calling in sick is frowned upon. Paying you for your sick time is frowned upon. Know your job or leave attitude. Promise of bonus pay that is a lie because of how pay is structured. You have to work with a full schedule of clients or you lose out on bonus pay for any hours worked where you do not have clients booked. Constant pressure from upper management to level your certification up. High stress during tax season. New trainees are just thrown in with no direction, guidance or help. Once you pass your initial classes company expects you to know everything and not ask questions. Too much information is thrown at you and expected to remember everything. Asking questions gets people mad at you. Better just know what your doing and enjoy dealing with crabby customers constantly complaining about the high prices they charge to prepare tax returns."
bad,"HRB has what they call ""Block Behaviors,"" such as 'straight forward', 'curious', 'better together', but in reality they say this and don't follow it themselves. You will be told whatever it will take to keep you believing things are fine, then they will blindside you with the truth because many lines of business throughout the organization don't care about the employees, only their own image.  If you work there, don't go in believing you can be straight forward. "
bad,To many new people that can't do the work.  People getting hours they shoudn't have.  Making phone calls that are required and trying to do the required work.
bad,"If you get hired anywhere but the El Camino office it is a great job!! The job itself is very laid back and ideal for anybody going to school. You get paid for training, and get to work in a super laid back environment. The tax people can get pretty angry at times which can be hard."
bad,"After 5 years work experience and a Senior Tax Analyst with HR Block, I quit. I  was a 20+ year tax professional. The new inexperienced office manager knew nothing about office management, tax offices, tax code, tax prep or even simple basic office skills. She was hostile and rude. She yelled and screamed insults at me. She was extremely stressed and out of her depth. She called me stupid for working at HR Block. "
bad,"Poor management, didn't wanna pay their employees their pay differentials. Also we couldn't use our Paid time off. Also the place was very unprofessional."
bad,I never had regular hours and frequently didn't know till last minute when I would be working.  They wanted me (a receptionist) to stand at my desk the whole time I was working.
bad,"The Norwich location is awful and unsafe, especially at night. 14 employees work there micromanaging 1 front desk receptionist who has NO help with phones, payments, and scheduling. Computers constantly froze locking the system leading to a lobby of angry customers. Older reps very prejudice and unhelpful. Not safe as most clients come in high on drugs."
bad,"H&R Block used to be an awesome place to work for tax season and even on the off-season sometimes. The company has cut back pay constantly. Managers leave constantly. The district manager is a complete joke, it's like high school and who is their best friend. The environment is toxic at times from the regional and above managers. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Biggest scam tax system there is don’t ever use thier system their system is set up to rob people if you file and your return gets rejected twice you will not be able to file electronically nor get a refund on your money that you had to pay no discounts poor management
bad,"My first 2 years with HR Block were great.  My last year; 2017, was a disaster.  New office manager,  promised part time, which turned out to be 3 hours per week.  I stuck it out because of loyalty to the tax pros.  So what happened when those tax pros did not have a CSP in the office?  They had to answer phones while preparing tax returns.  They had to do all the duties for a CSP.  No one wants to have there preparer interrupted while doing there return.  Unacceptable!  I would not work for them again."
bad,"wouldn't recommend anyone work with them, they are not the nicest company to work for and its only temporary, so if you want stability then I would say look elsewhere"
bad,"A very competitive work environment, with a lot of stepping on toes. No camaraderie. Poor pay and compensation. Negative feedback from co-workers and clients."
bad,Until the last 2 years I worked for Block it was a great place. Then I stepped down as manager. The person who took over brought his won staff and non of the prior associates received proper anything afterwards.
bad,"The job did give me more knowledge about taxes and did help me gain experience working in an office, and I got along with all the Tax Professionals well but that is the only positive thing I can say about this job. My hours were constantly switched or taken away without notice and it seemed that the rules didn't apply to everyone, and there were clearly favorites. As well as severe lack of communication"
bad,"This seasonal job wasn't worth the time, effort and money it took to comply with continuing education hours during the off season.  After 2 seasons, the third was slower than the last two.  H&R Block expects its tax professionals to provide janitorial services, such as cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming the carpets and polishing the floors.  The pay was minimum wage; only the most seasoned tax pro whose clients' returns are expensive receive good bonus checks.  Many individuals are preparing their returns on the internet."
bad,"When starting with the company you're promised you can find year-round opportunities to make money and that there's room for advancement. The truth is that you can work all year except for a two month furlough, and outside tax season itself the pay rate is severely decreased and hours are severely cut. The only room for advancement you have is if you live near corporate. You can't make a livable wage here. It's great if you have another job and work for Block on the side, but it's not at all sustainable for someone needing an income."
bad,"Very bad experience working with this organisation."
bad,It is a dynamic company especially in a tax season. There are no benefits provided. Employees are working under a big stress and for a tax season only.
bad,The manager was very rude and unapproachable.  The atmosphere was tense and frustrating. The scheduling was last minute and often changed without regard to the employee. The training was minimal.
bad,"I found another job once I realized I was being lied to so much.  I do not even think they are still in business.  I was promised year round part time work.  I did not know that would mean a 10 hour week in the off season.  That also did not qualify me for unemployment and almost put me in a position to be evicted"
bad,"Provide tax expertise to assist customers in navigating the complexities of federal, state and local income tax codes applicable to individuals and businesses.  Advise on tax considerations that assist with almost any tax situation, encompassing securities, retirement, home ownership, rental properties, health expenses, interest, penalties, and more."
bad,"If either one takes a disliking to you, you will not be working much, if and when you do get to work, it will be up to the Office Leader to allocate the tax returns to you!  So if you are not ""in the good books"" you will not be working much""  if you are not working much, you will not reach your quota for the season, which will result in you not returning the following year!"
bad,Excessive training for a job that pays only slightly above minimal wage is what you sign on for. Management vary from being barely competent to poor. Management is seriously lacking in priorities as customer service and accuracy takes a back seat to volume. Not really proud of having been a part of this organization as a whole yet there are some talented people there.
bad,The company offers little chance for vertical advancement.  The indiana regional director is a poor communicator and does not value the employees in his region.
bad,"Terrible place to work.  As a beginning tax pro you have no clue what sort of client is going to walk through that door.  Management preaches that we are all part of a ""team"" but try finding them when you need to ask a question and if the off chance you do they treat like you like some dolt. The company is so incredibly cheap it is laughable.  For example, the office printer crashed on one occasion.  A requisition was made to corporate for a replacement which was a used printer WITHOUT the paper tray - i.e. you had to retain the original paper tray of the broken printer and use it in the replaced used one.  Seriously. You can't make this stuff up.  Then, there is the pushing of every side product and side fee for ever little service that most clients don't need - $xx amount for automatic deposit of federal refund, $xx amount for automatic deposit of state refund, $xx amount for e&o insurance, $xx amount for identity theft insurance...on and on an on.  Being a ""tax pro"" really has very little to do with the job - one is primarily a customer service marketing rep."
bad,The people who have been at this particular location have been together for a while and if you did not fit into their clique you were treated as an outsider. I loved working with the customers and gaining experience but I will never return to working for this location.
bad,"The Front desk representative is the first person the customers comes in contact with. It was my job to greet the customers, and connect cliants to the best tax professional that meets their needs. Collect payments using any payment method that included cash, check and credit card payments. Schedule and reschedule all appointments,  along with notifying tax professionals when their clients were in the office. Sort/file papers and mail, make copies of documents. Maintain a clean and neat desk, always polite and ready to help someone."
bad,"aggressive sale culture. "
bad,you put in more hours going to training classes that you pay out of pocket for than hours you actually work.
bad,Tax preparation..I learned a lot. I was not what I expected.
bad,Getting to meet new people and learning how to use a cash register for yhe first time
bad,"This company cannot get their act together. They make terrible decisions and then expect their employees to put them into effect with little compensation. There is no opportunity for advancement. They do not reveal how little tax professionals will be paid - they imply that there is a bonus that you can earn, but don't be fooled, you will not earn it for years"
bad,"When I started with the company it was amazing and the leadership team in place was great. But recently the company has had a high turn over for leadership positions in the area of District Manager. The current District manager for Glendale has very poor leadership skills and has made several racially charged comments, which have created a toxic environment. The team over all is dynamic, believes in the company and wants to be of service."
bad,"Answering the phones, and helping customers with answers to their tax questions.  Making appointments for tax preparers.  Keeping the front desk tidy, and clean.  The office I worked at was very competitive, and the staff and management would say inappropriate things about other staff members.  Not a professional environment."
bad,"I was a receptionist for hr bock this year January through April. With in 5 minutes I felt it was a mistake and by the end of the season I feel it wasn't worth sticking through. Because the tax professionals ate paid commission they are nasty, conniving, vindictive. Constantly you have one of the tax preparers telling you either give them all the clients then the next day they don't want to work and bark at you when you ask if they could help a client. The pay was minimum wage and completely not worth it. Did not receivethe bonus they promised even though I worked 80+ hour weeks since one csp walked out. The only positive was my manager who was very proactive as much as he was allowed but you could tell he was restricted by higher ups. Also legally required breaks are not inforced or even allowed most the time. Even the tax pros barely get breaks but when csp's need a break good luck trying to get anyone to cover you."
bad,"Daily ""huddle"" conference call meetings and Weekly in-person meetings are poorly organized and executed.  Conflicting information is frequently pressured upon you.  On one hand, Servicing the Client is everything.  But on the other hand, we are to treat Clients as pawns in the grand scheme of things.  As the weeks go by, the focus turns to reporting and results - the bottom line.  Customer care flies out the window which creates more issues to manage.  Before you know it, there isn't enough hours in a day to get everything done to satisfaction."
bad,"The company does not really take care of the employees. They pay minimum wage, can terminate your contract any time."
bad,"Fast paced, long hours, low pay, huge amount of responsibilities from both company and government. Senior management out of touch with client objectives and daily office workings-change goals and procedures frequently.Company too focused on satisfying shareholders. Told repeatedly to push company offerings clients simply did not want.Training and expertise of staff deteriorating making for angry clients. Advancement, accreditation and privileges based on who you know not what you know.  With the right mix of office staff, it can be fun at times, though. Enjoyed meeting, helping and educating MANY clients."
bad,"The local sandwich shop pays the same starting salary as a first year tax preparer. There seems to be too much infighting between offices, as well as poor communication."
bad,"H&R Block was the worst job I ever had. All they cared about was taking the calls, leaving you no time to work on the issue. "
bad,"Manager of the local HR Block has no people skills.  I have many years experience in Customer Service, and I would have never spoken to clients they way the manager did."
bad,"Accommodations are not met as required for different positions within the company. Also, this company should be more diverse in upper level positions."
bad,"I was working at the front-dest as a receptionist, I look after for the client's appointment, answering the call."
bad,Management is inept. I had no repect for them.
bad,"H & R Block instead of taking care of former employees, they cut your pay and make you feel guilty for working hard and being loyal to this company. They don’t care for the employees they make you feel dispensable they don’t need you. They have other people they start off with acceptable pay $10.00. The management is great they try to make you see the positive of these actions but, sometimes you can’t.  Not a great company to be loyal to."
bad,"No benefits, reduced hours during non-peak weeks (only about 4 full-time weeks during entire season), auto-firing after April.  120 to 80+ hours of up-paid training required every year.  When not helping people with taxes you are required to call former clients - most of who had a bad experience and did not choose to come back, to try and get them back into the office."
bad,"Uncertain work hours a week, difficult to budget on. Very low pay and you are expected to solicit for your own clients. Seasonal job"
bad,HR Block is only good for learning and moving to some other better paying job. The pay is too low for a tax professional. Can get better job with other companies.
bad,"It is a vast field of the job to learn every year. We, the tax preparers have a good opportunity to help people every day during tax season. It is hard to have a bonus compensation at the end of the season. H&R has a bonus system that according to the sells of product and services and tax preparation, add up as bonus credit that is meant to be paid at the end of the season. However, the bonus credit is subtracted from the salary earned and however much comes from that is paid. Meaning that if fewer bonus credits are earned than the salary made, no bonus payment will be made towards the worker."
bad,They are the worst place to work. They promised me better pay and they promised me at least one day off during the week and they didn’t do any of this. When I asked them about what they promised they cut my hours to only 3 hours everyday. They hired a new receptionist to take my place and when the receptionist quit after her first day they changed my hours again and let me know Sunday night. This is completely unprofessional of them. Not to mention they don’t pay you correctly or on time. The manger there treats you like a personal assistant to make her coffee or hand her water and when you can’t she give you attitude. There is also another manger who is the complete opposite. She is the more cool and chill manager able to help you when you need it. Everyone else is amazing but the owner herself is very unprofessional. If you’re gonna work for H&R Block don’t work for this franchise work for the corporate!
bad,"The company used to be a great company to work for in the past years, they respected their employees and treated them very well, promoting from within, but recently the company changed the management and their ethics went out the door along with the previous management.  The new management team has no respect, no work ethics, no knowledge of taxes, no knowledge of loyalty to their employees.  They hire people that don't know anything about the tax industry, they have too much favoritism, they make employees feel harassed and working in a hostile work environment, they speak other languages in the offices to make employees feel uncomfortable as if they are being talked about, and when you make a complaint to the human resources or employee hotline you get blackballed from the management team for doing so.  They push out all the long time employees to bring in new ones that don't know anything just because they want to and have a big ego issue.  They use their job title to mislead others.  They take advantage of their employees for their own benefit.  They are not a equal opportunity employer, and they do not tell the truth to both employees and the companies clients.  They avoid clients with issues and don't return calls and push the blame on to others to make themselves look good. It's sad within the last couple years the company has lost a lot of long time employees because of the new management teams work ethics, and they will continue to lose staff because of this, and the corporate office does nothing about it."
bad,I liked working there it just that they would send me to work at a place that was 20 minutes away from my home and if I wanted to work there I had no choice
bad,"Office manager is in direct competition with tax pros for clients and commission, this creates a very volatile work environment for the tax pro. Most managers won't give the tax pros many scheduled hours, leaving the hours for themselves."
bad,H&R Block seems to change its direction frequently. They can never decide what is their future. Changes every couple of years. Price increases make it hard to meet goals.
bad,"The training only cost $150 for the materials."
bad,The so called Tax Professionals were extremely unprofessional. They  were rude to customers and other co workers.  It was very uncomfortable at times. They sometimes would argue in front of the customers as well.
bad,"I have to be totally honest, this job was very hard, and with the lack of training, well it made things a lot worst. I had to basically train myself and train others!"
bad,"They want you to take all these classes for doing taxes, which is completely understandable.  What isn't understandable is how they then pay you minimum wage with no benefits and force you to fight everyone else in the office for customers because the more taxes you do the better chance you have of getting a bonus at the end of the tax season.  The job environment is completely cut throat and hyper stressful."
bad,"Manager is NEVER there, saw her maybe 1 day a week all tax season. Hours scheduled did not mesh with my other job so I was tired and had to call in. She left me go 2 days before the tax season ended and kept the commission that I worked the whole season for. Plus had to sign an agreement not to work for another tax company for 3 years. Prices for customers to get taxes done is overpriced then you as the preparer have to explain to them, yeah I know it's just a piece of paper, and it costs per form to do. They are too worried about making money and DO NOT CARE about their customers. I do not recommend this business to anyone to work at! It was a joke, so glad I'm done with that place."
bad,"The overall experience working with my direct manager was awesome, very friendly and helpful. Other tax Pros were talking behind everyone's back and things that should be done by everyone were not enforced"
bad,"The company pays the 100,000 plus field employees (Office Managers, Tax Professionals and Customer Service Associates) very poorly and offers NO benefits. You would be better off working at a convenience store, a fast food location or the public schools (they pay better and have benefits). The management at the District, Regional and Corporate Level are generally clueless and have poor communication and leadership skills. The good news is that they are ALWAYS hiring (turnover is unbelievably high) and if you need a job - you can get hired - 95 percent of the population is just a few miles from a H&R BLOCK location. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the clueless management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the Tax Professionals, Customer Service Associates and clients."
bad,"Company was founded and grew on tax preparation, yet each new CEO thinks they have the answer to expand HRB original offerings into something extraordinary. Every venture (mortgages, banking, tax identity theft) that the ""new blood"" schemes up is a costly failure. They coerce and pressure their employees to sell additional product during the tax preparation interview. Most preparers are excellent tax preparers but poor sales folks. Each preparer has taken at least 100 hours of tax knowledge education and must take at least 18 hours for each additional year, yet HR Block pays these folks like they are entry level $10/hr! Sure, you can make commission if you manage to produce enough tax returns, but management keeps you busy with telemarketing and canvassing so that your hourly draw keeps eating up your commission. Senior preparers have seen the best days and are ""retiring"". New folks don't last once they find out what they must put out in personal time and training just to get paid a minimal wage."
bad,Work long hours.  Office manager name in title only.  No additional benefits nor additional pay for office manager position. The hardest part of the job was going from company owned to a franchise owner.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients you work with on a daily bases and the employees you build relationships with.
bad,"Maybe other H&R blocks are better but.so.far my experience has been terrible, the tax pros act are unprofessional, annoying, and act like u are their personal assistant, they try to force clients to stay their client even if they want to see someone else. Training is mainly directed to tax pros. They try and make it seem like the job is more than what it is. Favoritism is HIGH In my office, u go against the grain and your hours get cut,"
bad,"You have to ask for a break.  Otherwise, you don't get one.  Management has no concern for employees' personal issues, such as being late due to being sexually assaulted."
bad,"Installed computer work stations, set-up offices and deliverd merchandise and supplies to various stores."
bad,"During peak tax season it was non stop clients."
bad,Over all great place to work for. Too bad it is a temporary job. Usually from December to April. Offer great study guides and a unique way to train it's employees.
bad,"They were an awful place to work for, hyper controlling, you were judged on every word, every thing that you did, the culture was stifling, the overall atmosphere was not pleasant and not a good place to work"
bad,"They put time limits on everything even though some things/people take longer and some things/people take less but the time requirements are ridiculous.  you pay to work for them. The offices are under staffed, there is no receptionist for a majority of the time."
bad,i would never work for this place again i am not happy and was not happy with the services. I have nothing more to say about hand r block. I am not sure what more this test wants but this need to be adjusted
bad,I ended up earning only about $5/hour with all the extra time added in. This company has no problem with breaking the employment laws.
bad,"Stay away from this Company. The new management team is horrible. They put in a new District Operations Coordinator position across the country, it started out very good, full time position, okay pay but unfair - men make more than women. They said that the salary is low because of overtime and mileage. Well, they cut hours and overtime and mileage."
bad,No one seems to know what is going on from higher down to management. Too much change for things that did not require changing...…………………………………………………….
bad,"From what I experienced, the higher management often procrastinated about everything. He was definitely hypocritical and a very unreasonable person. The other things I figure are better left unsaid. Overall, when and if I decide to continue employment there, he'll hopefully be long gone at that time. I should not be subjected to a very obvious hostile and uncouth work environment with nothing being done about it."
bad,Typical day working on growing the business to meet future objectives. Managers learn the skill necessary to stay ahead of the competition. The workplace culture is teamwork and the hardest part of the job other not working together. The most enjoyable part of the job is the unlimited resources.
bad,"Complete tax return for clients ;served clients through greeting ,answering the phone and processing client information; completed cash - back service and accepted payment for regular return. Through working at H&R Block , The most enjoyable the part of job is I learned some useful knowledge."
bad,"Owners say one thing but do another, don’t reimburse the things they say they will and don’t let you fix returns that need to be fixed because it cost them money. They own several offices so beware!!"
bad,"I enjoyed the people. And the manager was really nice. I learned a lot about taxes, but the pay and the opportunities of advancement were bad. They need to pay their tax prepares well but they don't."
bad,I went through express to get on at Genpact and although I liked the job I didn't like that they never had the schedule up and ready. other than that everyone was super nice and helpful if you ever had any questions.
bad,"Laid off employees but give away 10,000.00 a day this past tax season. The company does not care about their employees and their families. There is nothing more"
bad,Great opportunity of growth. Great to network. seasonal. Learn as you go. Great to improve skills. Great professional environment.
bad,Only good for a part-time seasonal job. No one makes a living working there. They manipulate retired persons into working very hard for very little pay.
bad,"After scoring a 98% on my tax studies, I was told that after tax season, I would run the office full time alone.  After the season was over, I was informed that I would run the office alone, but only 20 hours a week."
bad,"The office managers are just the best!!!! Hardworking!!! All of them go out of their way to make you feel important."
bad,Its good starting job. I would suggest getting second job while working at the company . Coworkers were friendly. The environment is not good depending what office you are at.
bad,"To be successful here you have to really work at it.   The pay is based on your retention and it can become very cut throat between preparers.  The company cares more about sales and revenue than preparing accurate tax returns.  The fees they charge are getting ridiculous and I feel like I am spending most of my time justifying these fees although I don't agree with them."
bad,The workplace was awful besides the clients. They definitely need new management. Learned plenty and I worked really hard and received a raise within a month time.
bad,don't recommend to anyone not work the salary. They always change the commission cut off rate and ask for too much for $9 an hour. The hours are crazy as well new employees get the worst hours.
bad,"This job was a call center, which working over night as a chat agent was a great job, until the tax season was over and had to move to the phones, once on the phones, it became a little stressful due to the clients calling in about h&r block messing up something on their taxes, or them receiving a letter from the irs, or the customer service they received out of the office, but there was always little that we could do which was only make a call back for a tax professional to call and they never seemed to contact the client back ever. which they would call back the very next day upset because they did not get a call back"
bad,"Hr block is good for extra money, not a positive work environment or experience."
bad,"this co no longer follows previous high moral standards"
bad,The OM and DGM of the district are VERY unprofessional and shady. The will do anything to get rid of you if they don't like you. They are VERY dishonest.
bad,H&R Block has the best training and learning resources in the tax business.  H&R Block is the best tax company to learn taxes and develop positive client relationships!
bad,"No one in this business is properly trained to run the office. There was no one around to help train me. This was my first office job and I left with so much stress and confusion, that I wanted to walk away from reception work. Not a very good place to work."
bad,"I would not recommend working at H&R block, if you are interested in full time or part time year round work.  This would not be a bad place for someone that only wants seasonal work without any benefits.  They have a non-compete clause in their contracts, so if you do work for them, you will not be allowed to do taxes for 2 years after you leave them for another company."
bad,This job will keep you busy and is an excellent work atmosphere. The managers and other employees are great to work with. This has been the best job i have ever had in my life so far and would reccomend it to anyone that loves taxes
bad,"I worked in central falls the management is really professional "
bad,"Be a monkey and type stuff in the computer. At least you get to meet new people, although most of them a there unwillingly and like to contest the price."
bad,"great people, bad management. Stressful job but i enjoyed working there for many years. Company has lost it edge. Pricing has gotten out of hand. It's my opinion that they are pricing there customers right out the door."
bad,This company does not care about their employees. They make mistakes at the customers expense. Rude staff and not knowledgeable in their field. Would not recommend this employer.
bad,but the customer were lovely easy going as long as you got there orders right and did have them on hold for too long (lol) i would work for any of these companys as long as its outside of usa800
bad,The job was a good learning experience. I worked for the company for 3 years. I had a good experience you meet new people daily. The co workers worked well with each other.
bad,"If you are in the right click and do not say anything that would rock the boat in the office, you will enjoy working for Block."
bad,H&R Block used me like an animal and cheated me at every opportunity. Un healthful work environment and many severly ill clients at my desk.
bad,very difficlt to work for and not customer friendly they want customer lyalty but dont offer loyal customers any advantages
bad,In the Daly basic we assist the consumer when they come to the establishment. I learn who to establish good communication  with consumers and be better in office environment. I work with a great manager and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that with only work seasonal. I enjoy work with H7R block because they help you when you learning and You like to go every day to a please with good co- workers.
bad,There is a lot of interaction with the public with this job. You are entrusted with their financial situations that you must keep private.  Sometimes they are not happy with the outcome of their tax refund/balance due and you have to be able to handle that situation.
bad,Management is not very friendly. They do not take the time to train clerical help.
bad,This is a very people oriented job.  You need to be versatile and able to change in any situation.
bad,"I am working in a call center and H&R Block is the company I am in. I am a tech/product support agent. I was told in the beginning I get paid 10  dollars an hour. Doesn't seem like it to me seeing as I get paid bi-weekly, and only getting 500 dollars from them. This job is not worth the stress and cursing you get everyday from irate customers because of the problems between HR Block and the IRS!"
bad,"Mission Statement"
bad,seasonal employment is not conducive to starting a career.
bad,"Specializes in working with small business owners, rental property, and families entitled Earned Income Credit. Work hard to find every legitimate deduction to help clients get bigger returns"
bad,"The days are varied because it a client driven business, there are days  when we meet the days requirement based on the forecast. and there are days when there are more clients to service than we can handle,"
bad,"I was in a bad location, so every day was a nightmare of walk-in appointments demanding to be seen right away. On top of numerous walk-ins, we also had to manage a 4-line phone on our own and deal with paper work that tax pros couldn't seem to organize themselves. Whenever we'd receive a call about a tax question, CSP's are told to hand them over to a tax pro, because we don't receive tax training. However, everyone in my office wouldn't help me with calls, and I basically had to direct them to our website, or have the manager call them back later with an answer. "
bad,"At H&R Block there is no team work Tax Pros are arogent, inconsiderate, and rude. Office managers think the office work For Them instead of With Them. A lot of the H&R Block procedures are a waste of time. Management don't listen to anyone but office manager."
bad,"I was hired in as a receptionist and on my second day I was told I was a CSP, I had no idea what that was. On my first day, I was shown how to open up the office, shown where my phone was and givien a quick run through on the scheduling software. That was the extent of my training. I was sent home early everyday my first week because it was slow, rather than the manager having me work through the extensive amount of training material come to find out I was supposed to do before setting foot behind the front desk. I was given contradictory information by the manager on how to schedule clients (use 'best match', but you have to make sure everyone gets an equal amount of clients, and it doesn't actually matter whose books someone is on because whoever is available will take the client, but make sure it's all equal, even though the newbies take 4times longer). The upper management who doesn't spend time in the store was cold, abrasive, and unwelcoming toward me. I was told during my interview I would have close to full time hours until after peek, but was only scheduled 3 days a week. A co-worker complained to the manager and another co-worker about me, within my range of hearing and other co-workers, and a client- because my first day of being told to make a list and mark off each time a tax professional takes a client, I said I wasn't sure if it was up to date (this was my first day working that more than a small handful of clients walked through the door during my shift!). She was also griping because I was making phone calls, as I'd been told to do, and couldn't answer every"
bad,doing taxes and setting up appointments and you meet new people.
bad,answered phone set up appointment. Prepare file for clients having returns done.
bad,The most enjoyable part was working with understanding people and knowledgeable tax professional.
bad,I worked with the other workers as a team providing a great customer experience.
bad,"I didn't like the job with them because it was part-time job, also was so boring and no cooperation between the employees."
bad,Meeting new people that took value in the performance that I showed and gave them
bad,Decent ground floor opportunity to advance...handled approximately 60 calls a day...how to be cordial with all clients regardless of concerns...worked closely with management to resolve all concerns...casual environment...angry clients...resolving concerns...overall rating; decent place to work...seasonal
bad,They were ok to work for. Just when it was time for a paycheck we always had to wait a week to get it. And they never paid me the rest of my money.
bad,"A typical day at work would be, opening up the office, prepare coffee for clients, notifying clients about their refund checks."
bad,My job is exciting and especially getting to know my clients and how I can translate my Hispanic community is very important to me.
bad,"i have learned a lot but still need to learn more about taxes a typical day is unpredictable,management was great, the co workers were very helpful. the hardest part of the job was not knowing everything"
bad,"I had high hopes at H&R. The job is seasonal and the pay is low.  You are reliant on clientele and repeat clients.  Many people are doing taxes online now diminishing the possible bonuses.  Additionally, because pay is dependent on clients, co-workers are cut throat and unfriendly."
bad,management only cares about numbers and pressure staff to create new clients out of thin air.  they do one thing then do something else in a different direction.
bad,"Management has no regard for employees who are unprofessional, incompetent, not client centered. Clients do not return because of poor customer service and this organization does little or nothing to eliminate problematic employees."
bad,The education and the people you meet are not bad at all but as a career it is very cut throat and a lot of back stabbing the District manager talked about working as a team but at the same time promoted back stabbing as well as there was no real team effort
bad,"I have nothing nice to say about this company. It's not nice to bad mouth someone, however I would warn anyone to NOT take your taxes there to have them worked on."
bad,I loved working with the clients and the opportunity to learn everything about state and federal income taxes that I could. This is a seasonal job with high demands on your time and patiences. It fulfilled a need in me to aid people that did not understand the yearly requirements of the IRS.
bad,"You come in to work and get yelled at by your DM, maybe you have a client there its very embarrassing, Did not have a good year and will not be going back to work there and will take my clients with me. The office manager is very nice and knowable   but I fell sorry for her. the most enjoyable event is when I quit."
bad,"Was promised advancement after tax season, which was never given. Found out after accepting job that it was only temporary, which I never would have accepted had I known that was the case."
bad,"They tell you flexible hours, one weekend a month, and give you lots of training. However, expect long hours, little training, and being thrown into tax scenarios you aren't prepared to handle."
bad,"I have worked for HRB for about 10 years.  We finally have an office manager that is great..District Managers are nothing but a bad cheer leaders. Most of them are nothing more than (terminated)  ex Best Buy, Verizon etc managers.  I have had 5 of them in 10 years. They get fired every 2 years. National management.... complete joke....Again they are mostly Best Buy, AT&T, Verizon, UBER retreads.  Everyone above me, except the local manager, knows nothing about taxes.  They look at the tax pros as nothing more than (expendable) product sales agents.  Management does not care about the years of experience that is required to become a great tax professional.. The have frequently been terminated and they see it as normal. They don't care about anything but product.  Sell more emerald cards, sell more piece of mind, sell more more tax identity shield, sell more fee producing extras.  The new thing this year, reassign clients to less experienced tax pros, that are paid less, so that the experienced tax pros have more time to tackle the tough returns. A win for the experienced tax pros?  Not exactly. We mostly get paid by the return. More time working on tough returns means less returns. The new clients by the way, are the only ones who ever get any sort of discount..Discounts mean that tax pros get paid even less.  "
bad,"In the beginning of the job the staff and management was professional and a joy to work with that's why I decided to go back for another year. However, this year the company changed President's as well as Manager in the location I was employed in. Because I was asked by another manager to fill in for another location, my manager decided to take it upon himself to replace me and text me that I was no longer part of the current location. Not only was the manager unprofessional but neither was the District manager  and my perception of this particular office has completely diminished."
bad,"A typical day at the H&R Block near my location was frustrating to work at. There was no training after being placed into the location of your preferred office. No help or guidance from the lead. They were closed minded to ""New Comers"" and they'll make you feel very secluded from the rest. All the hours were given to favorite employees so you don't really make much. The hardest part of the job was insufficient training which lead to not knowing much, even when or if you've discussed the matter. The most enjoyable part was leaving. I wish I had a better review for this company but unfortunately I'd like to tell my truth."
bad,"you may have to work at several different offices to get a FT + overtime because of that the hours are long. if you can get through 4 month of tax stress then you will be fine. NO benefits and management is bad. You maybe doing things that ARE wast of effort/time, and things you didn't agree to, volun-told."
bad,"Definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to gain employment there."
bad,"A lot of training and certifications to become a tax preparer.  The job in itself was rewarding, the pay, not."
bad,I personally did not like this job at all. The managers were jerks and did not care about their employees. My coworkers were great. Ive learned that no matter how hard i work it does not matter to people that do not care about their employees.
bad,"PRC was not very flexible when it came to schedules, but they were always offering overtime so you had the chance to gain a lot of hours."
bad,i take all the signs down at the end of the rd come in clean the office and then check stats on returns and send returns organize the returns in alphabetical order and then file the returns the i would greet and meet all the customers and take payments 
bad,"This job is a very low paid job, but to learn how to do taxes and stuff, this is the best place. I learnt a lot from HR Block. Now I can use this knowledge to do all kind of taxes by myslef. This gave me confidence to deal with different nature of clients."
bad,Workplace seeped animosity among office staff. Not a pleasant environment. Other workers were territorial of their clients and often would not help new employees if needed.
bad,Low pay. Lack of proper traning. Seasonal work. Flexible work hours. Oppurtunities to learn and take initiatives. Good learning experience. Helps build network
bad,"Hired as temp season tax agent, hired way to early ""CSR"" Lead Front Desk Greeter certified programs told it took two weeks, two in half days! Started at Hub 2 weeks late then promised, Baptized  by fire by Assist Mgr half my age 10min session! I was finally given my already confirm location a half month was left of tax season! Replacement, for me did the same to (Not impressed, ""I personally stayed 35 min longer of my crash course time and number, if she had any questions! Own location, I barely allowed lift paperclip"" sit in front lobby couch until claimed by ""bitter retired tax agent,"" allowed me to preform!"" Corporate mandatory break/ lunch statue never got,"
bad,"I did a lot of work for little pay, was unappreciated, they wanted me to work more hours for less pay. Didn't enjoy it and wouldnt go back. Lot of rude people"
bad,"It is a tax company, so the hours are adjusted according to management needs without asking employees prior to mandatory overtime.  I do not know how it is rated high for work/life balance in some reviews/ratings.  Pay for the job is low for a fast paced call center. As for job security, unless you are full time (Non Seasonal) there is no job security.  Managements humor when a person is hired, I am hiring you now but get to fire you end of April, with a chance to rehire you at the end of June.  No benefits, which makes the low Pay even harder to take.  Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by Tax Professionals when they call in for assistance."
bad,"I only worked at H&R Block for the season, but most of the employees have been there for years and don’t want to adjust to change. Many of the offices are full of drama and the managers do little to nothing about anything. They treat young people like your stupid and never know what you’re doing even after working there for months. I never felt like I was actually being paid the correct amount with how many hours I worked. Lastly, I wasn’t actually told I was fired, they told me if I didn’t have medical prove for my anxiety (which I did) that they couldn’t excuse anything and they were cutting my hours. Never said I was fired, just showed up to work because I was still on the schedule and I was told to go home."
bad,"Seasonal positions. No benefits other than your income tax return prepared at no cost. Low pay for the work performed and annual training required to prepare for the tax season.. Feast or famine work flow. Inconsistent work schedules. Great job for a college student, a housewife with school-age children of retired senior citizens."
bad,"H&R Block has it's perks only if you are needing quick money. It's more about finances than the customer.  Watson is suppose to help, but that is suppose to be for a human."
bad,It was not difficult for me to work with taxpayers.  H&R Block overcharges customers for simple tax returns.  I have seen other advisors help poor customers use free smart phone apps to file their taxes for free if they cannot pay H&R Block.  The staff are really real people who have no reason to put H&R Block interests ahead of their neighbor person's best interest.  Excellent work culture.
bad,"Your experience at H&R Block all really depends on your direct supervisor. 90% of them are terrible and know nothing about what the people they lead do or what it takes to do their job. Most, if not all employees, unless your at the top of the food chain, are under paid and over worked. This goes for all positions. People at the bottom work the most and really bring in the money while the CEO makes almost a million a year plus a cool million dollar bonus. Management do not respect their employees, thus the employees do not respect each other. As a tax pro you are a sales person to bring in business so everyone above you can bonus while you may get a thank you at the most. Field support are worked like dogs and are paid what you can make working at a McDonald’s as a shift lead. Almost no opportunity for career growth, zero respect from management, and pay below cost of living. This is an honest view point form a 10 year employee. I’ve had a number of different supervisors (they all leave or get fired) and have seen countless district and regional managers get let go every two years. I would only apply if you really need a job and your desperate, other wise, look elsewhere for something better."
bad,Worked as a receptionist from open to close 7 days a week because there was just me and one other employee and there had to be at least 2 people in the office at a time so I barely got any time off.
bad,Working for Block is like being back in high school. Most staff are only there for the almighty dollar. They spend more time being rude to others than anything.
bad,"Enjoyed the clients, but management isn't very organized and too many different ways that each office is run, no good flow or procedures that are uniform to anyone."
bad,There is no structure at the regional level in general. Quality of work varies greatly depending on location and exposure to various subjects matter of personnel. No opportunity for research and growth.
bad,I enjoyed working with my clients. This was only a seasonal job. Management wasn't very good. My co workers were awesome when I needed help. I did this as a part time job.
bad,"Seasonal position did not allow for full time positions.  Pay the first few years is very low, minimum wage.  There is ample opportunity for overtime during peak season.  Training is available."
bad,Enjoyed the atmosphere and the environment and enjoyed working with the public.  All the employees were always willing to help out in any situation and circumstance.
bad,"basically, due to the IRS time line so is the time line for tax preparers, means no life from January to April 15 - you live in the office including Sundays (depending on the city)"
bad,I worked for a franchisee and was paid very little to have a lot of responsibility. I was responsible for opening and closing the store.
bad,"A typical day at H&R Block would consist of preparing tax forms and check daily list for upcoming tax clients. Prepare cash drawers, checking waiting areas for cleanness and preparing morning reports of status of incoming tax checks for clients."
bad,"This is a seasonal position. Scheduling clients for appointments, answering tax questions in person or on the phone. The hardest part of this position was learning all the different forms to prepare the taxes."
bad,"I enjoyed working here, but it is seasonal and they didn't give me very many hours."
bad,This was a fast pace job Dealing with the clients who came into the office to have their taxes done
bad,A typical work day was a busy day every clients situation was different and everyday was a learning experience. Not many co-workers small business but everyone was nice.
bad,"Work Taxes"
bad,"A typical day at work was preparing taxes 95% of the time and 5% doing basic office work. answering the phones, and filing.I learned how to prepare basic taxes on a 1040 more complex taxes on 1040 long form. amendment of taxes, I had 6 months of training for 3 years.My co-worker were typical. Some were nice and easy to get along with and others were difficult and anti social. The hardest part of the job was, when someone would lie about their taxes and want to blame you if caught by the IRS. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting someone a refund.."
bad,Forced to sell unrealistic financial products to those who can least afford it. Low pay overall compensation based on how well your particular location did during the season.
bad,It was a faced paced job. Helping people understand their tax returns can be difficult especially when things didn’t work as they had planned. People are allowed to be very mean and the managers didn’t stand up for the employee.
bad,$8. an hour is not enough pay for everything they have you doing.  Than they say you qualify for bonus pay and you don’t get it. In this company they lie a lot to their employees.
bad,Avoid unless you're desperate for a paycheck. No job security. Lame diversity. Hire from outside that promote from within. Sketchy security practices.
bad,"I was either bored out of my mind or stressed. For every two hours of nothing to do, I'd have ten minutes of intense stress. It all depends on the location. If you're looking for a part time, temporary job and want your taxes done for free, go for it."
bad,"I started there as a seasonal employee which eventually became year round.  I was helping clients with their taxes, assessments and adjustments.  Also, I was an instructor at their tax school."
bad,"90% of my day consisted with dealing with corporate fighting with the stores over policies that didn't work and were upsetting the client. This company only looks to make a quick buck and does not care about its employees or the clients they serve. "
bad,"I would consider this a toxic workplace. They lied to each receptionist about our bonus being individual, but ended up being based off everyones performance. "
bad,"I wasn't very impressed.  I only worked here seasonally and it is one of those businesses where the rules don't really match the atmosphere."
bad,Overall not a great place to work. As expected in a tax office many of the clients are unhappy and there's rarely much you can do to help.Moreover the room for pay advancement is minimal to none.
bad,"Most of the time it was not busy.  Enjoyed organizing.  Learned how to manage conflicting egos. Worked with a nice team.  They did not tell you in the interview that if you put down that you were available 7 days that they would be scheduling all seven every week.  The opening season was very busy and had to tell management that I was working another part time job and did not sign up for a 7 day work week.  So I had to ask for days off each week. They do not hire any cleaning companies so the receptionists are expected to do full cleaning and assessing of supplies daily.  Not a high pressure job, so it was enjoyable.  Because of it's temporary nature, it was less stressful that other retail that are always chasing the numbers."
bad,"I served as the receptionist, registrant, servant to the tax staff...There was little respect for this position and grossly underpaid for my experience with people."
bad,"The management treated you unprofessionally."
bad,"Job was extremely inconsistent, very poor communication. Not receiving a consistent schedule, when I was given the schedule it was last minute and undetailed as to the work that needed to be achieved."
bad,"H & R Block is a unique place to work in terms of the type of work that is being done (tax preparation, working with numerous government agencies) but the stress levels can be very difficult to deal with. From October through April the amount of stress is almost unbearable as you are preparing for and then maintaining during tax season. Often times fire drills occur over seemingly minor details. Directors often don't see the bigger picture. There is a great deal of disconnect between the retail (field) side of the business and the corporate headquarters."
bad,"H&R BLOCK Is a temporary job with no benefits, we work there only 4 months, you pick your own  hours and days to work. the pay   is very low we need to do a lot of exams, and have to much responsibilities  and the salary is poor"
bad,they could do better on getting qualified people to deal with the personal information. anybody can work for them and do taxes. they can also offer better training for the job.
bad,"good training on how to do taxes. excellent for learning how to do taxes good experienced coworkers. management is ok depending on site problems with corporate mandates usually just trying to rip off customers such as ira,'s"
bad,"The position was a seasonal position, which meant that there was not an opportunity to establish a career. "
bad,"This was a typical inbound call center support position for the H&R Block software.  Management was uninvolved, training was very lacking, and the location has since been closed."
bad,"Bad Bad Bad place to work if you care about people. Spending time with clients and going the extra mile for someone will only get you yelled at and uninvited to come back next tax season. Its all about the money. This company changed the contract without telling anyone and often go through with illegal tax returns. if you have a conscience, work somewhere else."
bad,"The morale was horrible.  Play favorites.  Poor, poor pay for what is expected.  The hours were long, fees very high.  Some employees that had been there a very long time did things that were against policy and not in the best interest of the company or clients and management even though they knew, kept letting it happen.  A lot of older people set in their ways, continuing to do wrong."
bad,"H&R Block Investment was not a positive place to work at all. Block was in the business for the quick money while the stock running wild and not to stay. They invested little in training, facilities, support, even system needed to provided quality service to customers. H&R Block was all about turning the ""hit and run"" money."
bad,"good job and learning experience, but it was seasonal. march-may, had 1 store that was open year round."
bad,I didn't like how they did not provide security for the people working in their branch offices. they rip people off with the Refund Anticipation Loans with the fees they charge and they exploit the low income neighborhoods with this offer.
bad,"fun work place, everyone is so nice and helped you if you needed help. when its started it wasn't busy but when the last month of taxes the office was full so there would be more than 1 receptionist attending people answering phone calls and making payments."
bad,"enjoy the clients"
bad,"A typical day at work you would make a lot of phone calls for the tax professionals, answer phones , schedule appointments, take messages, and greet customers. You are also in charge of taking payments for services and ensuring the till is balanced at the end of shift. This company does not pay good at all for someone who is handling money."
bad,Employees are not valued. There is preferential treatment.
bad,"H and R Block has a good reputation from it's past it has recently become a corporate culture that doesn't provide good customer service, new tax preparers are used to fill in positions and not treated well, experienced tax preparers are given more opportunities"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I meet people from all walks of life and learn about different industries from them. Being able to help them understand their tax obligations and hearing people say to me that I have not only helped them to manage their tax affairs better but made it all so easy to understand feels great.
bad,You work 2-4 days a week for 3-5 hour shifts. Learned to do tax return. Lack of experienced managers make the officers unfocused. Most co-workers are out for number one. Hardest part of the job is dealing with lack of managers. Most enjoyable part of the job is the clients.
bad,"The culture of the company has shifted to maximize (squeeze) every cent from the client, and not to provide incentive for growth since it is only seasonal. The abysmal management team each district has contributes to a total air of distrust and intrigue where every professional competes for the client so as to make the numbers. Of course, in dealing with other peoples money, such as your taxes, the appearance of customer satisfaction is strong. HRBlock promotes itself as a company full of promise but its new administration has failed the tax professionals with false hopes, poor administration, and simply not caring but for the almighty dollar. Of course, the competition is worse."
bad,Log clients into system for Tax officers.
bad,"Answered phones, set up appointmentsg Greeted clients, kept the lobby and surrounding area in order, made coffeen. I learned I don't want to work there again. Management was very tactful and pleasant in a stressful environment . Some co-workers were pleasant, however most were not. The hardest part of the job was accepting constant criticism from co-workers. There was nothing enjoyable about the job.."
bad,"employees would come in and out of work, no one really running the place or managing it."
bad,"Poor pay, no benefits (except stock option), mostly seasonal. Stressful environment, many clients lack proper documentation, etc. Mgt tough to deal with."
bad,"Management at this company is too concerned with driving profit instead of keeping talented people who care about their clients.  It has become a numbers business driven by desire to make big bucks to feed their big egos.  There are other issues with this company, nepotism, harassment, unqualified good buddy hires.  I could go on but I won't; I've complained about these issues before and nothing changes."
bad,"Majority of employees are seasonal, only working 10 months of the year (i.e. during tax season or in HR, customer service). 10 months means they're not obligated to offer benefits. Even for full-time associates, they never know if they'll make it past May. Big layoffs happen every May and a lot of good, tenured people get let go. Instead of rethinking their strategy, they clean house. They tend to promote from within, and they tend to promote the younger person even if another candidate is more/better qualified. Lots of cliques and manager's pets."
bad,"There was no assistance for tax prep from the office manager.  The OM roles seemed to be scheduling only. That was overridden by District Mgr. Ridiculous measures were taken in Appt Manager to comply with corporate requirements.  Fake appts were made so it looked like the office schedule was better than reality.  Company is run by people who have never sat behind a tax desk.  Therefore, objectives are out of touch with the actual environment.  Poor morale in offices.  Every year the pay formula was changed.  Very low pay for high stress environment.  Clients could be abusive.  Very low return rate for first year preparers.  HR Block does NOT value tax pros."
bad,Arrive at work and make sure there is coffee and water for the clients. look at the days schedule. the employees I worked with were great overall. but this was a brand new venture for the majority. promises of training or calls back turned out to be lies. you cannot serve your clients effectively if you are thrown in an office and are forced to guess because there is noplace to go to get answers. no time to eat lunch. but there is an opportunity to earn a bonus. very unorganized management and procedures in general.
bad,Employment with H & R Block cant be measured as easily at times. My problem with employment was primarily with their franchises who owned / operated it.
bad,"Work environment wasn't bad when I first worked there.  Employees were given a key in case we were early and needed to get some work done.  But when someone else bought it, it really went downhill.  We had to turn in our keys.  If we were a little early we had to stand outside and wait for someone to show up.  Prices were horrible... especially for the elderly.  And the quality went down.  No one seemed to care if their returns were done correctly as long as they rushed through to get to the next client."
bad,"HR Block is a commission/ sales position.  I started at the age of 18...and stayed for 18 years as a season tax professional  "
bad,"Great job unless you don't like your boss.  Beware of pecking order amongst the Tax Pros.  The job is seasonal so by the time you get the hang of it, than it's over."
bad,"* Serviced local neighbor hood clients by preparing their tax returns."
bad,What should have been a rewarding part time seasonal job was instead a high pressure sales position with completing tax returns being secondary to selling H&R Block products.
bad,"Expected to be on call but not paid for it was a huge draw back, combined with unrealistic and often conflicting expectations. The flexibility outside of the 'tax season' was a plus, but the forced work reductions while continuing to expect the same quantity of work to be done was unfair. Many continue to work 'off the clock' so as not to fall behind."
bad,"Preparer taxes.  At the very beginning it was kind of an perfect job, unfortunately, I run into an illed intentioned coworker and that was the end of my career at the company. I left for good and I swear never to come back. Happy withouth them!!"
bad,"Too sales oriented. Tax prep acceptable , excessive marketing for add on products . Too focused on sales and production for a professional company. Extensive training required without pay."
bad,"Fast pasced, very stressful, swing shift schedules, only work during tax season, temporary job, a lot of learnng in a very short time, no discounts, no benefits"
bad,As an employee I saw the owner treat my manager badly not only in front of myself but clients. Pay was not good and I feel that Some people were treated worse than others for no reason
bad,"Typical day includes speaking with clients regarding their current financial status, reconciling accounts, filing biweekly payroll, preparing monthly/quarterly federal and state tax forms.   Gained additional knowledge while attending college for business and accounting."
bad,"H&R Block has excellent tax training. Also they have an abundance of offices that are open duringthe tax season. They over staff the offices during the tax peak and then they fire a good portion of the new hires after the peak is over, sometime around mid February."
bad,H&R Block would be a lot cooler to work for if they laid off the pressure to sell.  I really enjoyed learning and then teaching customers about their taxes.
bad,"Very different business model.  Not for all unless you are willing to do everything with little support."
bad,"No Communication"
bad,"Greeting customers, answering phones, answering questions setting appointments, drawer reconciliation, making coffee, vacuuming, sweeping making packets, brining in sign at end of shift"
bad,The owner (at the time) of the franchise was always very rude to the front desk employees.  He never smiled nor did he say anything positive to encourage the employees.
bad,"Depending on the office you work in, it can be a supportive team building experience or a backstabbing, everyone out for themselves, toxic environment. "
bad,"Great, fun place to work. Seasonal employment. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. A typical day consists of preparing federal and state tax returns and answering questions about filing taxes."
bad,"The owners had tattoo's, yet complained about their employees having tattoo's.  Make you feel small and unappreciated.  Management doesn't work with their employees."
bad,"Do not work here. You will be overworked and underpaid. The company has horrible structure. The only pros are the company phone, laptop, and ipad(s)."
bad,There was flexible hours available. Tons of Customer service interactions that made it a fun atmosphere while meeting new people.
bad,The typical day at work consist of taking phone calls and answering questions pertaining to income tax direct deposits and confirming checking account balances. I learned about the call center work culture during my time at H&R Block.
bad,"A typical day of work began with me arriving at 8 am. With all the preparation we received about the tax software, the job consisted on preparing the taxes of every client. Job environment was good specially because they encouraged team work."
bad,"Worked two seasons. Between the 2, I took 96 hours of training and 5 examinations on my own time to be able to do more difficult returns and make more money. Had to compete with other preparers for clients and was given free returns to keep from paying me commission. Manager would not let me do returns that I was trained for. Did not schedule me except beginning and end of season."
bad,Nothing but backstabbers and liars.  They pay low wages for people that go above and beyond the duties that are set for them.
bad,"H & R Block India Pvt. Ltd. is a very lucky company."
bad,Ready to learn more and more each day as I deal with clients. My co-workers are very friendly and they are willing to help as long as they aren't busy. The hardest part of the job is when it's slow and the time just seems to freeze in one spot. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have clients that are upset and aren't willing to deal with the IRS. I work very well under pressure and I seem to gain a lot more knowledge and it just feels so great when the clients are satisfied with the way I handle their issues.
bad,I would make and confirm appointments. I will assit clients in getting prepared to file taxes. I wish this was a permanet position
bad,This company has leaders that do not want what is best for the customers. Most leaders only care about their own pocket book. I hope Bill Cobb looks at his senior leaders and some of who they listen to and make the company back to its legacy when Bloch had it.
bad,"It is a fun place to work and I got along well with my coworkers. The owners of the franchise is another different deal. They lied to me, didn't pay me the rest of the money that I had work hard to earn, so I am not going back to working for free."
bad,"The only thing I like about H&R Block is their classes, otherwise I do not recomend the company to anybody."
bad,"H&R blocks and I have worked many, are the same. Too many cliches of older women who act like they know it  all and create a toxic work environment, I love the work and the customers. Bad Management. Go learn at their school, get your license and work for yourself."
bad,"The staff is great to work with. Very supportive. Management is excellent and always there for you. They have a great training program that makes you ready to get in there and work,"
bad,Poor wages.. Hires people with no office skills. Employees gossip too much. Tech support is useless.Too many meetings with no hands on workshops. Long hours.
bad,"Good for training. Must be free for 2 months daytime classes to learn and pass the test with high rates!"
bad,"If you are looking to actually make good money, this is not the place. Work tons of hours, 6 days a week.  They offer a salary vs.commission pay structure but it’s impossible to actually make commission.  Hourly wage is very low and then when you work too many hours, there is no payout.  Lots of micro managing...as manager I was not able to make any management decisions for my office.  The only reason most people return is for their clients and colleagues."
bad,"Poor management. Not a team environment. Most,employees are out for themselves. They need to attain stronger team oriented people. The only way to do that is pay a better salary. Some of the seasoned staff are often rude to,other do workers"
bad,An incredible amount of work time was expected from the coordinators without proper compensation.  Great people to work with although there were some office managers that were inflexible and unwilling to participate in marketing projects.
bad,"early in my career, I had a short time working there. I was let go because they were overstaffed. I don't know because I was let go."
bad,"good customer service, learned about filing taxes, work place culture needs to be updated, the hardest part is that sometimes there machines are not working and it takes along time to repair. dealing with customers appreciated."
bad,"This is a seasonal position. He company kind of just hires you, has you take the course and then you are thrown out there. Most of the other employees have worked there for prior years and have most of the appointments. A lot of dead time as most people are switching to Turbo Tax etc"
bad,"Too many mangers, that change too often. In the past 5 years, we've had 5 different VP's. This company reorganizes every year and as a result you get a different philosophy every year. I often spend my entire day in meetings instead of getting to do my actual job, leading me to have to continue to work at home. "
bad,"I worked in a franchise office. My boss was horrible he would come in and yell at me and customers that I would be working with for no apparent reason and I would then have to calm him and the customer down so that they would stay with us (I was lucky enough to save several) He did not seem to really care. The corporate office was awesome with help and any other information I needed for computer updates and upgrades, orders ect. I was pain $9 an hour for 7 years and only got $1,500 in commission altogether and I was supposed to get 25 percent off all tax prep fees that didn't happen."
bad,Very very slow place to work! The women were extremely rude to me. I was the only black worker in the office and always felt singled out and used as a fill in instead of having an actual schedule.
bad,"Low pay first year. When I re applied for the second year they offered me a ""pay cut"". I felt this was unfair since instead of a new employee with no experience, I was now experienced and had  performed my duties. Never late. Never took a sick day or missed a shift."
bad,"Management is terrible. No one is held accountable to performing at a higher standard. The company promises change, but refuses to make the changes needed to retain associates."
bad,this was the second time I had worked for this company. my first experience was excellent this time around not so much. the owner was not willing to spend time with new staff. when asking for advice or had questions on tax laws was told to look It up or was made to feel dumb for asking. I was also cut off from any contact from other senior staff members with any discussion of state and federal tax laws. basically setting me up for failure. this was not my experience working for the company first time around. its how this local office is being run
bad,"Inconsistent application of rules and poor management."
bad,"After working in the office at the H&R Block office in Clarksville, TN. I was miserable at that office because my manager was didn't like me because I did not speak another language. She made my dread going to work on a daily basis. After leaving the Clarksville area I tried working at another H&R Block and the experience was a little better and I actually liked the people that I worked with at the last office."
bad,"Employees are expected to solicit/canvas the area for customers."
bad,A lot of work for very little pay and nowhere to go from there. The training was good and it was alright for a while. They weren't very friendly to people from other countries.
bad,Poor management  Poor training  Great clients great coworkers  A lot of learning while on the job I enjoyed meeting new clients and helping them understand the tax laws and how it affects them
bad,It was a summer temporary job I took working the front desk position. It was demanding and frustrating because the tax accountants were stressed. I wouldn’t work there again.
bad,H & R Block is a seasonal tax preparation.  So during the season you are required to work long hours.  It requires yearly schooling to keep up with tax changes
bad,Pay minimum wage. Staff changes very often. Good for students or as an additional income source. But do support the associates with well maintained tax software and professional material.
bad,"If you are social (like me) you can meet some wonderful people and really learn a lot through training.  However, there was no management structure at all and everything was totally disorganized.  The pay is terrible despite training, studying and testing at your own expense!"
bad,This was a bucket list item that I always wanted to do. The learning experience was the goal. Over the course of three years I was able to become move from a Tax specialist 1 to a Tax Specialist 3
bad,"Interesting for gain experience, and learn: very good Academy on line for improve the preparation at low cost for employees; possibility to make your own clients wallet."
bad,Goals are set by KC based on something - but not by anyone who has done or knows how to do taxes. Management is more interested on measurement than productivity. They seen to think up more useless administrative reports every day. Sometimes more effort is spent working on useless progress reports than doing taxes. Availability can only be change by managers - don't get sick. Do not block out a day for some Dr appointments. Scheduling changes daily with no way to see it from home - best to call in each day to see if you have to work. Appointments are set to 45 minutes even if it took 3 hours to do the return last year.
bad,I could've had a much better working experience but overall job was ok. I love going there because alot of the company store here are nice but the place is way over priced to have taxes done but overall working there was ok.
bad,Was not a team environment. Management not helpful. Had to sign a no compete for two years. Wage was low. Stressful environment. Customers are the best part of the job.
bad,"Over the years benefits have been taken away from employees. For example, stock options were granted. Not anymore. Other benefits no longer enjoyed include dinners at the end of tax season as well as gifts given to recognize longevity."
bad,I have worked for H&R Block for the past 5 tax seasons and probably will not work for them again due to the changes.  The office did not feel cohesive between management and employees.
bad,"Drawn in with promises of quick advancement and good bonuses. What they don't tell you is that the advancements are not constant from year to year. The jobs change, therefore the role constantly changes. This is a seasonal position and as mid-management, it's hard to keep employees motivated since they are only there 4 months out of the year. The best part of the job is that there are lots of training opportunities. However, the position is usually responsible for certain goals before the training actually begins."
bad,"You can learn how to do taxes which is a very nice things to learn, the more you learn in life the better of you are, loved learning constantly, never stop learning with H & R."
bad,"Management was a real issue. The manager was lacking in professionalism, often schedule work only 24 hours in advance. Manager was not degreed, dressed sloppily, and did not convey a proper attitude towards either employees or clients."
bad,Very quiet at times to the point that your ready to just go home. Phones can be a little busy at times. understaffed on certain days. The filing system was not up to par. Too many receptionist for one position.
bad,"Part-time Seasonal with absolutely no benefits at all"
bad,"H & R Block promotes an overly competitive work environment creating a culture of combative employees.  Management higher than local management is not only arrogant, but not available to employees when necessary."
bad,"I was a first year tax preparer and although the job can be fast paced and somewhat challenging, I enjoyed the work and found the office staff helpful and great to work with!  The payment software could be troublesome at times and as a tax pro I wish I had better training with that software. "
bad,"I doubt that many of the long time production workers will agree with your conclusion that this company supports work-life balance. We work long hours for 3.5 months to keep the company profitable for the highly paid full time employees and shareholders. There is no paid time off, very limited retirement savings opportunities and health insurance is available only under government mandate. All while compensation shrinks every year, and local management ranges from great to schizophrenic."
bad,"The training programs are designed by the corporate office and don't actually teach the skills necessary to work in one of the offices.  Every person that you speak with, whether it be corporate, general manager, office manager, trainer, or fellow employees, has a different idea on how things should be done.  There is no uniformity.  Answering the phones required a speel that's 29 syllables long and confuses callers.  Appointment confirmations could be considered harassing in their frequency, and the lack of communication between management and employees as well as not hiring qualified workers is epidemic.  The best part of the job is meeting the clients and feeling that you are helping them during a stressful time.  It's also the camaraderie between other employees who are just as frustrated by the ineptness of management."
bad,"Typical day at work involves receiving moderate to complex tax questions, and then researching to get best tax treatment for client.  Direct management and co-workers are great to work with, build great team atmosphere, however feel huge disconnect with upper management."
bad,"The job itself was fine data entry answering phones, appointment scheduling is easy. Dealing with some of the clients was hard. Seeing people of all walks of life struggle to make ends meet then have to pay hundreds of dollars to have their taxes done didn't seem right. It only took a few minuets to fill out a basic return and the computer did all the work. The best part of the day was knowing I did all that I could to get the most I legally could for them."
bad,I learned a lot working at H&R Block. But i was let go due to cronyism. The management only cares about numbers. Not people. They will throw you under the bus in a heart beat if it makes them look good.
bad,Was sexually harassed by a fellow male employee and nothing was really done about it. Co-worker females were great to work with and were very helpful. I learned how to do taxes on Blockworks software. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who owe money in taxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a lot of new people. The management showed favoritism to their pets and relatives.
bad,"Some times was very busy. I can learn a lots of knowledge from my job and earned much experiences as every case was difference. The hardest part of the job was when there were lack of original documents, like missing T4's or other document."
bad,"not physically productive, mentally draining, not too much information provided on the workers end, a bit too counterproductive, working environment not supported due to location"
bad,"Customers were very rude, and demanding. I got along with all of the employees, easy job, all you did was answer phones and schedule appointments"
bad,"Season job, not many hours is for a single people or if you have a family is good as a second job for extra money, I learned how to prepare short tax forms."
bad,Great place to work. Happy environment and you create a good friendships with customers. Learned a lot about the health insurance reform.
bad,"Although a good environment and nice manager, it does not have any security to the position as it ends after tax season"
bad,"If you are going to work at HRB (in KC corporate HQ), just come in armed with the knowledge that your managers will tell you they want you to think/prioritize everyone else's needs (i.e. the field, offices, tax pros, franchisees, managers), but what that really means is you need to put their (YOUR manager's) needs first.  For example, if you take a position that manages/supports functionality in the field offices, be ready for a constant predicament of leadership priorities vs. meeting the needs of those executing objectives in the tax offices.  There should not be a battle/barrier here!  "
bad,Lots of turmoil and change.  Senior leaders don't seem to have a clear plan and are very reactive and not proactive.  This leads to unstable work environment at all levels of the organization.
bad,"Although I enjoyed this job for the interaction with clients, the description of job duties did not include phone sales. Connect, and Thank You calls were left up to CSP's to try and draw in accounts that had been inactive for a few years or to get current clients to take advantage of the ""second look program"".  In my experience the job is underpaid for that and in that you are expected to correct face pages of COD and HOLD files that had been inaccurately labeled by tax pro's and calling said clients for collections of COD's that lingered, checking claims for completed signatures by tax pros and then filing such. There is no incentive to participate in these procedures other than the meager wage that is paid. Position also includes up keep of the office, trash and bathrooms (if you want to utilize a sanitary restroom facility), and responsibility for store front recognition aka signs. "
bad,"Prepare simple to complex tax returns for individuals.  Use all appropriate adjustments, deductions, and credits to keep cleints' taxes to a minimum.  Interview clients to obtain additional information on taxable income and deductible expenses and allowances.  Calculate form preparation fees accoding to return complexity and processing time required   I learned something new every day about taxes.  Management didn't schedule enough.  My co-workers were great with helping out when help was needed. Was knowing all the tax laws.  I enjoyed the clients and the interviewing of the clients"
bad,A typical workday included customer service and facilitating individual tax submissions.  I learned a lot about different tax situations.  Management was always stressed.  Co-workers competed for clientele.  The hardest part of the job was competing for the customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.
bad,"A typical day at work, greeting people and doing taxes. Occasionally making coffee."
bad,constantly changing rules and regulations by the IRS make this kind of work a challange
bad,"a lot time on the phone dealing with promises made my local tax preparers that weren't right, a lot of customer service cleaning up, company was very greedy and wasn't a stand up company with employees or customers"
bad,Hired a first time tax prep person to be an office manager. He did not know what he was doing and asked other first year tax preps for help. The regional manager did not seem to care about the employees or any feedback they gave.
bad,"My experience there as a whole is wasn't so good .But The Owners are amazing people i feel they deserve better what they ar receiving from some of there employees .The treatment I received there was unbearable ,the experience was amazing and it taught me how the work place can go if there is favoritism.I will not suggest anyone who is like me to work at a sensitive place like that ."
bad,"I have worked for them for years and the chaos was on every level from billing, to customer complaints, to not standing behind their own products, to having to sell products to client that they will never use or need."
bad,Ok work environment. Very competitive with other tax preparers. Not the greatest morale as a result. I also do not think the software is very user friendly.
bad,"The work enviorment is a big issue. As front desk the tax pro's with antiquity in H&R at this location treats you in a improper manner as if you are obligated to obey there every request. And on top of that you will have to maintain your duties as a receptionist and be assigned to cleaning task as well. The pay is not even worth the hassle, drama and stress you undergo at this location."
bad,The branch that I worked for was unorganized and the management was always rude. Customers were not put first and they always found ways to increase the price of the customers return rather then trying to save them money.
bad,They are a nice company  to work for however they do appear to be only out for themselves.  In regards to only making profit and not benefitting/encouraging their team mates.
bad,i dont think they value the hard working tax prepares as much as they should. it seems as if when you go in there and just put up numbers and not really care about the clients they are happy with that.
bad,Peak Season vs Non-Peak Season and your co-workers make the job interesting or just a bore.  The only thing that I liked was working on FT Bragg and earning $30/hr.
bad,"Working at H&R Block was stressful and I feel like I was not given enough training for the amount of customer interaction that I had to do. I was thrown into phone calls without any practice or proper training, and I got yelled at for not doing it perfectly. I basically had to harass people that had already clearly stated that they did not want anymore calls. They bombarded their customers with unwanted calls, phone messages, emails, and texts that I was required to send. I was completely on my own after about 3 days, and was constantly belittled by my manager for making small mistakes while I was learning to do my job."
bad,"not a good company to work for. Prejudice, Management is poorly they don't help when needed. Long hours and not satisfy with your work done. don't work there"
bad,Work environment was pleasing. Yet the Managing part of this company was very disorganized as a Manager. Most of my times were spent in meetings and making work schedules for my office staff. Pricing was outrageous for the clients.
bad,"The pay is not very good, the hours are bad and the managers do not do their jobs. I would not recommend this job to anyone. The clients are also very rude."
bad,My day is to great clients everyday all day. i learn so many things everyday. the management team is great. the work culture is amazing.Nothing is hard its just time consuming to learned everyday. the most enjoyable part of my job is my clients when they go home happy with what they wanted.
bad,"reading a script, finding a certain screen to lie and tell someone their money is coming on a certain day and time is against my religion.headache everyday."
bad,"HR trains well, but the paid is very shocking low. Retention is very low like the hourly rate. Management are elusive and evasive.. Workplace is very competitive and cut-throat."
bad,I learned the governmental rules and law on taxes. I processed different forms of taxes depending on the costumer's needs. Management was fine. The only thing I didn't like was the pay level. They demanded a lot from employees but didn't compensate well.
bad,This was a great place to work. The firm supported us all and gave us the things we needed to get the job done. Overall a very good experience. Recommend.
bad,"I only worked there one season, because I could not get motivated to get re-certified after being treated as a disposable commodity. Maybe it gets better after a couple of years, because many people kept coming back."
bad,"it's ok for tax time but nothing else, so dont hope to be promoted, or do anything of meaning. the managers are only there to grow their books or business, and not yours."
bad,"The best part of the work was that some coworkers were very nice people."
bad,"It is ok to work there but they do not treat employee good or customers"
bad,"It should only be open for tax season. Otherwise, the company model is outdated and its services over priced. I wouldnt reccommend working there unless if you are a student in need of extra cash. I am referring to their front desk positions."
bad,"It was okay to work there. After I took the tax class, I was hired to work one location and place elsewhere. Also, I was hired to do taxes not marketing. If I was expected to do marketing I expect to be paid the same wages at marketers."
bad,good seasonal job bad pay but if you dont need the income to live on a great job for the tax season  good contact with people and friendly staff a good starter potion
bad,"I enjoyed doing taxes regardless, but  was not that happy with HR Block. When I had the chance to move to JH, I took it and have been happy ever since."
bad,"Working here was and is very stressful. You never know when you're going to be laid off. You have no type of benefits, not PTO/ATO. The only advantages that you would have here are that it teaches you a lot about tax laws and credits. Sad but true. It's a new CEO in place so hopefully, things change."
bad,"The environment was not one of enjoyment due to a few reasons, but this my opinion. For someone else could be a good place to work. This was a part-time position with no benefits and very low pay based on sales and customers"
bad,"Corporate: Difficult to advance or achieve in the corporate structure.  Managers are temporary with no authority.  District Managers are rarely professional - oriented.  Opportunities are not equal - favors are the norm.  Advanced education and accreditation does not equal new opportunities or monetary rewards.  Rewards are like Kindergarten ""Star"" games. Compensation is totally commission based, doing a discredit to clients.  Quarterly work."
bad,If you like to keep your job for any reasonable amount of time don't apply to this company. If you don't fit in with groups of people you won't fit in for long.
bad,"At one point with Block we were paid commission."
bad,This is the same position that I have already posted about so everything I already posted about the position at Tax is actually H&R Block. I have worked for this company since December 2005.
bad,job requires for everyone to follow through with their on marketing strategy to build their own book of  business. Focus more on new client base and care very little about their retaining clients.
bad,"-VERY hectic"
bad,"The management at H&R Block made it difficult.  The job, when not doing taxes, was boring.  They did not allow radio or other distractions when the store was empty.  I felt the training and support was poor as well"
bad,"No SOPs, best practices or processes in the field. It is very dysfunctional and deceptive! It may sound promising...don't accept offer...RUN! Run! Run"
bad,"Working as a tax prep. Decent job, learned a lot about taxes and preparations. Also tax laws. Training was good but not much chance for advancement. Decent for a few extra dollars."
bad,"I used to love working there but H&R Block only cares about money. They don’t care about employees. In order to prepare taxes for them the employee must take classes. However, the quality of the individual’s knowledge has degraded, now the management cares for quantity over quality."
bad,I've done 4 contracts with H&R Block and all where pretty good except this last contract was terrible.  They had no quaified staff and office was being ran by inexperianced tech guy.  However the other 3 contract I did were awsome and the leadership knew what they where doing and that trickles down to happy clients.
bad,"Scheduling appointments, reviewing client information, filing paperwork, and minimal cleaning duties were assigned to the Receptionist. Interacting with clients and employees is everyday part of the job."
bad,Very unprofessional would schedule appointments for customers to meet with the tax professionals or for the tax courses sometimes they wouldn't show up.
bad,"Typical office work, learn taxes, a lot of people from many, many countries, the most enjoyable part of the job to help people with taxes, the hardest part of the job sitting without clients"
bad,the office i worked in was a franchise and was ran by an individual apart from the corporate offices. i worked there for 5 years with great customer interaction and clientele. my coworkers were great to work with and provided much help to each other in tough situations
bad,"Working at H&R Block taught me how to work quickly, and efficiently under pressure.  Having clients sit with you while preparing their tax returns allowed me to gain valuable experience in dealing with people, as well as having to master communication skills. "
bad,"Seasonal for most of people; favorites received hours year round. I did learn how to do taxes. We did have weekly supervisor meetings, but most of the time it was confusing."
bad,I enjoyed working for H&R block however I did feel like their wasn't much growth opportunities. I was hired just for a seasonal position which lasted three months
bad,"Interesting and fun to learn the job and work with the clients"
bad,Have done taxes on my own since 1987. Went to work for HR Block for 2 seasons to refresh my education. Company was sold so went back to doing taxes at home.
bad,"I made sure that all forms, folders were in order. Stock, equipment with necessary products for a full functioning day. Unlock front door of business before clients arrival. H&R Block had a mix culture; in knowledge, work style, communication. Working with clients was easy but the actual processing of income taxes was a little stressful because of little training. The work was not hard, we always had references if there was a question or issue. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with. Very friendly, helpful and generous."
bad,"the office manager should not have been in that position.  She had the front desk rep. doing the things she didn't want to tell the tax prepares to do which was there job."
bad,Hostile environment with no communication or guidance. Not a lot of procedures.  The ceo would not talk to you face to face only by email.  Every morning come in and there would be 30 emails.  By the time you answer them the day is half over.
bad,"new owners now are doing the way it should have been done,alot of hours and stress but you do meet alot of nice people,help alot of people out and co workers were all wonderful"
bad,this is a wonderful place to work if you like stressful environments where people like to yell at you for things that are completely out of your control
bad,"This job is for part timers only who already have a second job.  "
bad,"•	Assisted Tax Professionals in their field, train others through manager’s request"
bad,"I was with H&R Block for a short time. Therefore, I can only type a review that is reflective of my time with them.  I only worked the max of 20 hrs per week. They at good with training potential employees for the job."
bad,It is a job especially if you can not find another one for whatever reason. The people you meet are great to work with for the most parts. I I loved each of my co-workers in 2016. They were super.
bad,"It was just a seasonal job, to get more experience in the I.T. field. It was a low paying job. Little to know assistant supporting customer. just learn as you go environment."
bad,"H&R Block as a company is sadly getting worse. The CEO has no clue about the tax pros or the clients.  They're pricing them selves right out of business! The normal person just can't afford the fees anymore. The tax pros make less and less every year. I've never worked for a company that figures out how to pay us less and less every year, vs. Making more money every year. It's crazy! It use to be a great company to work for, but not so much anymore."
bad,Not much room to try new things in the marketing realm. And a lot of unwillingness from Tax Pros to market themselves and the business. Company does a great job of advertising nationally but hard at some regional offices.
bad,"●	A billing questions and making arrangements for payment of services."
bad,Busy from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave on most days. The managers and preparers can be rude to new employees. Seasoned preparers did not like to answer newbie questions.
bad,This was a seasonal position. Very busy atmosphere and consistent customers. This job help with tax preparations and is only for tax season  Its only for temp work .
bad,this job is seasonal and i would not recommend it for a person looking to gain work experience. this job is only about 3 to 4 month long and after that you are lost without a job...
bad,"Don't need to be too smart to work at H&R Block. They hire anyone. "
bad,HR Block - Tax preparation is very stressful it requires to deal with customers on a face to face basis discussing tax and personal matters for IRS compliance. Co workers are great
bad,Great company yet losing business due to cost.  Company has moved away from helping and developing its people which is the reason why the company was so successful.
bad,"Trying to cut costs on backs of employees"
bad,"Enjoy doing taxes and working with the customers, Management not so good. You moved up by who you knew. Enjoyed working with most of the other employees."
bad,Very unorganized!  Nights and weekends.  I did enjoy working with my clients and helping in the preparation of their taxes.
bad,"Working for H&R Block gave me the knowledge about taxes.  Preparing taxes is a challenge when you have clients with a lot of tax issues."
bad,"Enjoyed the work, fellow employees were great, but management is not very good to employees.  One always got the feeling that you were being watched and basically not fun place to work for sure .  Employees were scared and not standing up for themselves."
bad,"I've worked several places since Accolade, and can honestly say this was the worst job I ever had. The management is the most deceitful of any I've ever encountered. Very happy to no longer be there,"
bad,company is great place to work it just depend on the area you choose. Each district is different when comes to District Manager and what is excepted of you.
bad,"It was hard to get on schedule for hours to work, once at work you were overloaded with clients and the offices were not fully staffed. Coworkers were polite and helpful. Pay was not great and no benefits were offered."
bad,Meet lots of great elderly people. I learned a lot about the Tax business.
bad,"This is a job that would have been great to have 25 years ago.  Unfortunately, now they are fighting some very good internet tax preparation programs and it is tough to get new clients to understand why they should pay $500 to have their taxes done rather than $80 to do them through Turbo Tax or H&R Block online."
bad,It is a place where one can learn how to help customers to the best of their abilities but it is often not worth the fees.
bad,"1, Do employee payroll"
bad,"I worked pretty hard there but, once you are sent outside to do marketing by putting flyers on cars in 0 degree weather, without an ounce of concern for your health instead, you end up with frost bites and a fake smile as if its okay or your promised extra pay for but, once you see the paycheck at the end of those long 2 weeks excuses ring like a siren from the dissembler hired by another dissembler to deceive and disregard. "
bad,My typical day was to schedule appointment and greeted customers.
bad,Just what you would think for seasonal employment. work was hard but fun.
bad,"Love helping customer on a day to day basis. I understand taxes today I learned that good. Management was very fear and understanding, worked well with my co-workers. there was nothing hard about the job. most enjoable part of the job was helping the customers daily."
bad,If you love to help people this is a great place to work. I worked for this company for over 6 year and loved it.
bad,"In season is very fast paced with little time for anything but asking the clients questions and doing the data entry.  After the first peak (January 7 - February 7-14), things normally slow down to where you have time to really focus on the client.  This slower period last until about the last week of March and then the second peak starts and it is back to questions and data entry.  Second peak is generally when you will have more upset clients because the ones coming in late generally have more difficult returns or have a pretty good idea that they are going to owe money to the IRS instead of getting a refund.  Most are pretty good about it but, some can get very rude.  Block offers excellent opportunities to learn and progress on to more difficult types of returns.  The work is generally part time and seasonal if you are in a regular tax office.  Opportunities for full time positions and advancement are limited at the tax office level.  If you are looking at positions at the Regional or Headquarters levels, the opportunities are much better.  The work pace at the corporate level is still very fast and demanding."
bad,"Lead 18 tax professionals in the preparation of individual and business tax returns. Review weekly progress of each tax professional and update progress reports for each person. Prepare and analyze all production reports for the offices I am responsible for. "
bad,I enjoyed learning how to prepare tax returns. The manager of the office was wonderful and a sweet lady.
bad,"A typical day at H & R Block was interesting, there was a diverse group of customers and staff from all ages."
bad,This position was seasonal but it was a good learning experience in working with the public.
bad,"Every year everything changes - besides the tax laws - typically what does change is our office manager, our co-workers,  all of these changes can be a good thing and also can be a bad thing. H&R block now also demands that you meet a quota so you must have the time to apply yourself as thoroughly as is demanded, otherwise you're not coming back."
bad,"Successfully prepared individual income tax returns, and reconciled client files"
bad,Sensitive subject on peoples earnings. Seasonal and alot of training!
bad,"I love working here, I just wish it paid more and had benefits. Sometimes it's hard to get a day off when you really need it."
bad,Assist clients or new customers with quality customer service.
bad,"High volume-high stress-something i am very familiar with, however maintaining some kind of control in the chaos is necessary. Hardest part of job was local tax returns(for all of us) and fellow employees not wanting to help with questions"
bad,Preparing individual tax returns. I learned new tax laws and how to find out information when needed. Management was ok but not for me. I loved my co workers though. Hardest part was having to do up selling of products. Enjoyable part was meeting new people every day
bad,"Working at H&R Block was aghast. At first I loved working there mainly because you can create you own schedule and you get to help and teach people about taxes, so it really fit me. I gained abundance of knowledge while employed there. However, I found over the course of my employment there, the management was very inadequate and unprofessional. Because the job is based off commission, a lot of the tax preparers would take another tax preparers' client. The hardest part of my job was informing a client that they owe monies instead of receiving a refund. There were so many things that I very much enjoyed working at H&R Block. One thing in particular that I enjoyed was meeting new people everyday and getting to know them through out the years."
bad,I get to work with all sorts of different people and situations. No two customers are exactly alike.
bad,"Seasonal, no benefits, overworked, underpaid. "
bad,Coworkers and manager were impossible to work with. A lot of drama and very few hours until you build your clientele. I learned a lot about filing taxes. There was a lot of filing. I enjoyed the job until the receptionist and the owner turned into bullies. Not professional at all!
bad,"so, so company to work for "
bad,"My experience at H&R block was honestly, kind of terrible! I was not instructed on when or how to take breaks and lunch, and often ended up eating lunch on the clock. My team members were condescending towards me as the receptionist, and it was just very very stressful! One of my coworkers kept turning down the heat despite it being january and the front of the store reaching temperatures below zero without the heat at a certain level."
bad,"H&R Block is fun to work for and i liked it very much and plane on going back to work part time for them next tax season. However, the at the end of the season i was told that i would get a $250 droller bones and that has not happened and i put in some long hours and weeks as do everyone else there so i think that is very unfair."
bad,The work atmosphere was great.  The co-workers were  great to work with. The work hours are flexible. Management allowed you to take time off if needed
bad,Truth be known I found that they had a strong dedicated staff that was under appreciated. My direct supervisor was awesome but who she reported to was incompetent...embarrassing
bad,The front line associates and tax preparers are top notch. There have been issues with leadership above the DM level. Hopefully that will resolve itself soon.
bad,"Management very unprofessional, the manager that overlooked the office she was very unprofessional. The tax professionals were nice.The company should brush up on its management skills."
bad,Seniority is rewarded with first choice for new customers. A carrot of bonuses is held in front of you but it's almost impossible to get when seasoned professionals get the good customers
bad,I left the end of one tax season a little early because I found out that I had cancer and was beginning chemo . I was promised by the manager that I would definitely have my job back the next season . She did not keep her work and did not bring me back !
bad,Mostly busy position.  Office team wonderful and very helpful.  Enjoyable contact with the public.  Management? They leave a lot to be desired .  Ancient office equipment.
bad,"This was a part-time seasonal employment from January to April.  I only worked 8 hours a week.  I had no benefits.  When all of the tax professionals in the office retired/relocated I decided not to return,"
bad,"Lots of work, little pay.  The Rebots are coming and the stores have started closing, The Business is quickly slowing. I should get a new job before they close my store."
bad,"Although my time at H & R Block was enjoyable, as I loved working with the public, I felt I was not given as many hours as promised.  I did have two weeks in four months that I worked over 30 hours per week, mostly were under 30 hours.  I was even asked to come in for 2 hours a day three days in one week.  The manager of the office was hardly ever available, either by phone or in the office.  She played favoritism and went so far as to give her daughter hours that could have been given to me.  At the end of the season, she hired a new person who worked more hours the last month than I did.  It was very discouraging."
bad,"The position provided me with the chance to meet an array of interesting people in the client base, and the position was not too incredibly difficult overall. However the level of training given to their receptionist staff was very minimal and poorly done."
bad,"Seasonal employment with employer expectations of volume production, customer acquisition, and very low pay to begin.  Your success depends on your location and extended longevity with the company.   Currently working with lower income demographic which results in lower priced returns and ultimately little or no bonus."
bad,"Don't do it. The Business model is designed to take at lest two years to begin seeing any kind of real income. Most TaxPro's Will NEVER see a ""bonus""."
bad,"Too stressful and competitive in areas without control"
bad,relaxing environment. would have returned but pay is not comparable. needs to allow first year professional to receive commission on number of returns plus product sales.
bad,"A good place if you want to learn about taxes, but you have to be proactive. They have the best tax school and tax continuing education classes at a great price. "
bad,I really have nothing to say beyond the fact that this company has poor ability to pay associates. There is an expectation to do more and they refuse to pay tax experts and other associates properly. I found that tax experts' hourly pay had been dropped to one dollar above the minimum wage and they were still expected to work long hours and to try making money from the extra retail based items offered. I find that extremely unacceptable as associates working for rhis company put up with a lot more stress than they're paid for as it is.
bad,"All about marketing and selling, long hours,hard to get new customers due to fees being so high.Very fast paced. Great job if you are looking to only work a few months a year."
bad,H&R Block has been in business since 1955. They are the leader in tax preparation and for good reason. Their tax professionals are highly trained and have strict protocols in place.
bad,Worked with the public during tax time which is challenging itself.  The company was going through many changes and it was very unorganized.  Pay was very low for the amount of work that was expected.
bad,Nice to work with if you are part of a team that helps one another but pay is minimal.  Commission incentives are not truly incentives.
bad,"Take appointments of walk-in clients and scheduled clients and help them filing their individual taxes.  Tax, talk and tell. "
bad,"Between resolving personnel conflicts, instructing other tax professionals, marketing, keeping up with reports and sales goals, I found the workload to be excessive."
bad,You get to do challenging returns and learn new things you make as much as you want to. Management is supportive and a typical day at work is to help clients with their tax needs and do either taxes or estimates. The hardest part is the complicated returns and you have to find the answer on your own.
bad,"Pay not competitive but okay for a seasonal position"
bad,This job was very slow paced and there was never a supervisor around or a trainee to help new associates. I did however learn to use different softwares and improve in my customer service relationships.
bad,"Open Office at 7:00 AM "
bad,The company does  individual and corporate taxes.  The company pays little pay at any level of tax professional.
bad,"I could not believe how poorly the company pays its employees.  They were some of the best people I have ever worked with.   The company charges so much for their services, but pays its employees so little.  They push for numbers, but gave very little incentives."
bad,First Year Tax Preparer don't make more than the minimum wage and do not get commisiion not even after working more than 3 years. Who can survive with that little income and only in a seasonal basis?
bad,"the day would generally start half an hour early if we could get there especially during peak weeks and months. Dealt with clients externally, learned different programs, codes, on the computer, remembered how to file taxes again I filed my own and others while in High school and shortly thereafter, worked with co-workers to learn and to train, worked with the different tax offices throughout the country, I was asked a great deal of tax preparer questions even by tax prepares, the pay and stability was the hardest part of job, the people I met while working there was the most enjoyable part also the award dinners"
bad,"In a typical day I would process many tax returns, the tax course was a refresher for me and I did learn a few things. The hardest part of the job was telling someone they owed thousands in taxes, I enjoyed meeting new people."
bad,Managment changes constantly. a Great place to work if your looking for temporary work
bad,"Usually worked independently, very laid back environment."
bad,"I started this company with a great positive approach. I walked into a huge mess. I worked very hard to organize, straighten and bring order to the madness. I was not enourgaed. I was not told good job. I was discriminated against. The work enviroment was very hostile. I was promised 30 hours a week and was cut to ten without notice and without reason. Overall I was let down,"
bad,"Management really needs to check themselves. There’s too much infighting and ‘silo’ing’ going on; additionally, much of upper management’s approach is “how will this impact me and my career,” instead of, “how can we help/assist the tax payer?” At least that’s the case on the brick and mortar side. Digital side is more progressive and more about the client."
bad,"Managers didn't know how to do taxes.."
bad,"As a former employee, my time with H&R Block was not the best. My district manager hounded me when I left, saying that I wasn't ""hungry enough to advance"" despite being provided essentially no opportunity to move up."
bad,Too many preparers for too few customers.  Inconsistent management meant that following one manager's instructions got you in trouble with another manager.  Lack of follow-through at the management level.  Pay structure encourages aggressiveness.
bad,"My experience was very poor feedback, despite repeated requests.  Commitment to agile was in word only.  Management expected to be able to add work to sprints in flughtdespite defeated explanations of why that undermines the t"
bad,"It wasn't bad, the workers are friendly, everyone understood when things came up. They always had a willing to explain nothing's to you when working an you wasn't sure how to do something."
bad,"It's horrible when your tax pros are paid less than the front desk reps aka CSP's. This may be seasonal. however, if you don't value your tax pro's, you stand to lose them to competition willing to pay. not to mention continuously changing work schedules. schedules fluctuate beyond too much. Leadership plays favorites and not everyone has a backbone. Us Tax Pros are treated like a number. if you're not a top producer, the things you speak to management about don't matter!!! while this is only my opinion for the offices and district I have worked in, I'm sure there are good offices and caring leadership members out there somewhere...Best of luck to all members of the HRB family, no matter your role."
bad,tHIS WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK.  t HE CULTURE IS CUT THROAT and competitive.  Highly stressfull environment.  Pay was just over minimum wage which obviously is not enough for the cost of living in Asheville.
bad,I enjoyed preparing tax returns for clients. Many times during the day there was no client to help and I spent most of the day reviewing tax law. It was a great learning experience for me and helped me greatly in preparing my own tax return. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy when there were no clients to help.
bad,The day depended upon the schedule of clients. If business was slow we would make phone calls and study tax codes. Block often did not provide administrative support so we were forced to do extra duties. It was extremely frustrating to have to answer the phone while a client was at the desk and I was preparing the tax return.
bad,"Although an individual office environment may be great, there is little opportunity for real full time employment year-round. It is way more important to the company to make sales, even to those not required to file returns, than to have competent people preparing accurate returns. The corporate culture fosters an environment of questionable ethical practices from the top down."
bad,There is very little to no opportunity for full-time employment. More opportunity for training leading to promotions or management training should be more simplified and better clarified for those seeking it.
bad,"The people I work with are great and extremely helpful, gracious and generous. Work can be tedious. One must not take the work criticisms from clients personally."
bad,"Depends on job level of where i would rate this job. Corporate says they care for employeea but only care about shareholder profit. New CEO  is WAY overpaid "
bad,"It is a temporary position. Seasonal. I learned a lot, but I am not a tax whiz. I wish I had been shown more and what is acceptable for deductions, how to get the fullest return."
bad,"Enjoyed meeting the Customers and scheduling appointments.  I learned a lot about filing taxes and asking questions to the tax preparers.  "
bad,"Your co-workers are H&R Block offices are, in my experience, very friendly and open. Easy to work around and manage your own schedule, and it is highly recommended that you keep a civil relationship to everyone in your office, as well as out of."
bad,Nice place. Challenging work. Compensation falls short. A typical day involves  opening the office and running reports. Preparing for the clients that have appointments and calling clients to invite them back. Wonderful clients and people.
bad,"The reason I got into tax was for me to have something to do when am bored it was just for fun. "
bad,"District manager plays favorites, has not qualms about saying exactly what she thinks at any time. Continual micromanaging and absolutely no motivation to keep working with this company."
bad,"I used to work for Teleperformance. It was a good company to work for, however, they could be a little inconsistent with scheduling. I liked it there overall."
bad,"This would not be a bad side job, but I ended up in a franchise that had been taken back by corporate, and we were badly understaffed.  60-70 hour weeks were common working seven days a week for most of the season.  Then I signed up for pre-season which I do not ever plan to do again.  The wages dropped, and after less than a month, the office was reduced to 12 hours a week!  On top of that, you are expected to make A LOT of sales calls - to the tune of 25-50 a day somewhere in between serving clients.  Tax season in a staffed office is probably not too bad, but the off-season is dismal."
bad,This employmer gave many youths opportunities in learning systems . Employer was willing to expand company and adding staff accordingly. As busy as company was it also was popular.
bad,it is a great place to learn and grow. the most exciting time was sitting with customers and helping them with their taxes.
bad,"There are few companies that care about their employees. H & R Block is one of the companies worth working for if you don't need much money. The pay starts at $8.50 / hr. No benefits, but overall good place to work for a single person."
bad,I learned to prepare complex tax returns.  The co-workers were easy to work with and were team players.  The hardest part of the job was informing clients that they owed a large amount of their tax return.
bad,"The Training is great but they only work seasonally and then let employees go and hire them back in off season to do promotional work, calls, handle its letters etc. so you do not get year-round work and during tax season the hours are usually kept below 40per week.  "
bad,Enjoyed working with most of the other associates.  Office management was very good.  It was a pleasure to work with the clients that I served doing their income tax returns.
bad,Management should have provided more training. Management seemed unwilling or incapable of doing any kind of real work beyond sending emails and socializing at their desks.
bad,"Enjoyed the work I did and I loved my managers, but the higher up you go the management is less than desirable.  Compensation was not great but had ok benefits as full time employee.  Most employees are seasonal and don't get benefits.  Really hard to move advance.  They will do massive workforce cuts if they do less business."
bad,"Although I did enjoy my work at HR Block, it is nearly impossible to obtain a full-time permanent position with the company, as the high percentage of jobs available are seasonal.  You are allowed to work a season, after which lay-off is imminent."
bad,"No longer a seasonal position. You work many long hours in tax season and in ""off"" season. Count on six & seven day work weeks. Difficult for those with a family. Leadership very reactive to needs of the business; thus, always a sense of urgency in all that needs to get done."
bad,Was a decent start to taxation. No real room for growth or advancement
bad,"Review customers paperwork and enter it into the computer."
bad,Temporary job. Good work/life balance..Work is only available during tax season and must do required courses before/
bad,managers are not interested in you at all and are extremely strict about policies
bad,"I'm sure other H&R Block are more organized and better managed but the one I was in wasn't, scheduling was all over the place and it sucked. That's all."
bad,"I loved working with the ladies at the  office,, I loved the clients that came in but   I did not care for the way Corporate treated employees and clients."
bad,"Good seasonal job - adapts hours to your schedule/availability, but not enough hrs available."
bad,"H&R Block, for me, was a great part-time, seasonal job.  I worked with some wonderful co-workers.  I worked evenings and weekends and basically worked with people to get their taxes done in the most beneficial manner."
bad,"Plus side, lot's of courses to take.  Down side, you take them on your own time.  Arguably could be skirting minimum wage laws, but I imagine the lawyers have it covered.  There's a lot of pressure to sell, sell, and sell.  The biggest problem is that more and more people need less and less personal help with taxes.  Also a shocking number of tax preparers don't even use the products they're supposed to be selling.  They actually pay someone else to do a service they could be getting for free."
bad,"Great place to learn the skills you need to accurately prepare taxes, but if you don't pay for your own training you will be prohibited from working anywhere else for a few years,  and the pay is atrocious."
bad,"I do not think that all locations of H&R Block are necessarily worthy of 3 or less stars, but the location I worked at is. The management was inefficient, showed favoritism, and was not experienced as a manager. The hours were cut throat to obtain. Fellow co-workers and I could not find the help we needed on certain tricky tax matters. It was in general very unpleasant."
bad,"After a 2 week training program, you would think that would be plenty of time to figure the job out. But that was not my experience. During training, you learn a lot about the different products and such, but there was no hands on telephone training so when you got to the floor, it was an adjustment. Also, the experienced employees are instructed not to tell you what to do/help. You are expected to figure it out on your own thru an online ""guide""...basically googling a key word to try to figure out the answer to tell the client, which as you can imagine can take time and be very frustrating for you and the client. The pay is decent if you can deal with the frustration of trying to figure out and help the client. I found it was more along the lines of handling HRB's Run Around Hotline...."
bad,Very fun and interesting place to work . During tax season it was very busy and you can take classes to be able to advance in the company. Your taxes are discounted.
bad,"It is only a season job"
bad,If you love taxes and want to help others this is the place to work.  Pay is not good.  The company can really do something to take care of their works.  Instead all HnR is concerned with is their revenue.
bad,"Love to work with clients"
bad,I really enjoyed working there but it was stressful sometimes my hours was cut very few hours at my location I believe every location is different cause my friend worked at a different location and she had more hours
bad,"Difficult place to work if you do not have any basic computer skills. "
bad,"-The job required a lot of walking and interacting with guests."
bad,"Management was very helpful"
bad,"I learned alot during my time with this company, but am not looking for work in this field at this time"
bad,Company with heavy management turn-over at the senior level. Little regard for employees.
bad,"Working in a office scheduling appointments for tax prepares and answering phones, collecting cash or checks. I learned about requriements for perparing to have your taxes completeed. My co-workers were good to work with so the job could be done and clients are satisified with their results. There was no hard part about the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was see all the client happy when they recieved their checks."
bad,"I use to be happy going to work. Upper management use to be helpful, but with all the changes, they just do not care. There is no benefits with this company, it is seasonal and the pay is not great to start out with"
bad,"I don't recommend this place to work if you're expecting to get real money! "
bad,"I worked here between parts of my school career, and would recommend it as a temporary job, since by default it only lasts the length of a tax season. There didn't seem to be much in the way of advancement though, and the compensation system for senior tax associates seems fishy (a bad deal for the associates, and a bad incentive structure for encouraging good tax preparation)."
bad,Working for the minimum wage when you are college graduate and have being working for the company 5+ years is not a good deal. I wish they pay at least 22 dollars per hour so I can come back for my part time job
bad,"the job overall was ok they did not like for you to work many hours per week they did train you good but the time consuming was not that  long, excelent training"
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people of the company, however I do not agree with many of the policies of this company.   Being unable to tell a client what the cost of there return will be without actually completing it first as well as the high prices that are charged.  As well, I do not believe I should have to pay them for additional training which benefits them while they pay little more than minimum wage.  I also do not like pushing products on people when I don't believe they need them."
bad,"H&R Block has a lot of great people working in it. What makes working at H&R Block fun and worthwhile is the people, so many dedicated advocates for the clients they serve. Truly admirable and while the cost of going here is expensive, in many cases it is well worth it, in others probably not so much. With the advent of great digital offerings H&R Block has tried to position itself so as to survive the digital wave by cutting many resources to the bone including losing many talented individuals who they can not afford to keep onboard."
bad,I enjoyed working for H and R Block.  I enjoyed working with the other employees.  What I didn't like was my district manager telling me I had to sell products to clients that I felt they didn't need.  I have enjoyed preparing tax returns for different people over the past 20 years.  I enjoyed going into work each day.
bad,I learned a lot of my customer service skills from here. It was a pretty easy job. Management was kind of rude though. The best part about the job was getting my taxes done for free.
bad,"The job isn't bad. It's actually really chill and laid back. I applied for a full time position and currently have 14 hours in my pocket for the week. I was scheduled Monday through Friday and was literally just told today (Tuesday) that its not in the budget for me to work for the rest of the week. My bills don't stop. Pay is not great at least not in Lexington, KY. However, the people here are awesome. You don't have a set break. You can take 30 minutes or an hour and a half just depends on how long you need."
bad,"Payroll and tax preparation for individuals, corporations & partnerships. "
bad,it is a fun place to work and you learn a lot about people and how to help them plan their taxes life. the hardest part is when you tell people they are not getting a refund.
bad,"Answered incoming calls scheduling appointments for taxes pros. Anytime a client would call to cancel, an appointment I would offer to reschedule. This encouraged clients to continue with H&R as their Tax professionals. My coworkers let me know they appreciated the attempts I made to keep their clients and that I rotated walk in's with all of the Tax Pros."
bad,Management is great and co-workers can sometimes be childish. Great experience for me as a accounting student to learn to do taxes and answers tax questions on a professional level. They take high standards as a most.
bad,"Working in BPO Industry;call centers made my life up rough. fun as well, great benefits and compensation . I am just having hard time since the time of work will be in graveyard. Working with Americans made me very easy as time goes by because what they want should be provided right away"
bad,"Depending upon the location it can be a very busy day. Bring plus years of experience into H & R there wasn't anything about office procedures they could have taught me.  Only their way of doing things and their product.  The type of co-workers normally have a tendency to get along for the most part.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is opening, getting prepared for the days clients."
bad,From 8:30  am to 10.00 pm  You are seeing clients all day sometime you don't have time for lunch. My goal is to educate my clients on the different tax option and benefit that is available under the current tax rules and procedures.
bad,"In my experience as a CSP, it's flexible. I haven't had many issues out of employees, even customers, because I put my foot down when necessary. Block doesn't pay enough to put up with nonsense. CSP pay is not a livable wage. You must have other income. The environment is different in various offices."
bad,It’s a nice job to start off . It is seasonal work. It does get busy and it’s nice to have co workers help. You start off at 9 but every year after you get a raise.
bad,"Helping people with their taxes and to save money. Teaching people how to better plan for the next year, how to fill out their W2 and put money into their 401K plan, so they will get a better return next year."
bad,Some days were extremely busy.  Others days were slow and boring.  Sometimes it was difficult to finish a tax return in the hour time slot allotted.  I did enjoy working with the public.
bad,This was a good job but you only work a few months a year. They say you will work certain hours but then you get your schedule and the hours are completely different
bad,"Opening the office, checking appointments and staffing."
bad,"Working hours for CSPs are limited and short. The people in the offices are friendly and open, and there are absolutely no issues with the other employees. The system itself seems to be an issue- schedules change extremely rapidly to accommodate for constantly shifting need, as this position is temporary and people constantly leave. There is an expectation to move locations for differen shifts, which is not very optimal. The job itself is easy, and the training is clear and concise, but the hours are what kills it."
bad,"Some offices I worked in were great and the staff was fantastic and seemed to really enjoy what they were doing. Other offices the staff was not a cohesive group, instead, each was out for their own."
bad,"I did not work for this company, rather this was an idea where you played a game and through this game you were taught how to juggle finances on a certain budget."
bad,"Once you become a manager, there is very little chance of advancing within the company. Tax knowledge can always be improved on, and H&R Block does give tax professionals that opportunity."
bad,"Challenging work, kept you thinking.  Office Manager has too much work to do while still preparing taxes.  Don't pay you what you are worth.  But will work you to death."
bad,Put in many hours for little pay.  Felt like the management there was not there to help out the workers only concerned with making the most money they could.
bad,My supervisor was poorly trrained and often unhelpful when support was needed. Regional manager preaches a competive philosophy and is bottom line(money) oriented.
bad,Good workplace to work for. The pace is steady and the co workers are both pleasant and helpful. I am always learning about new aspects about individual taxes. The management is fair. The hardest part of the job is obtaining clients on a steady basis
bad,Really crowded place to work .. good thing is you have a place to park and it was also reall ghetto but hey I work yher in 2013 so thing could have changed
bad,Seasonal employees are used just in tax season to handle as many calls as possible.  No benefits or additional compensation is offered. You have to reapply every year
bad,"Tax knowledge learned"
bad,This job was part time and I did clerical work mostly.  I had less hours n more days off. So I had to take on a second job to make ends meet. It would've been nice if I worked more hour n gained more experience.
bad,"On the upside you get to help people, timing is flexible, and your money per hour is not bad."
bad,"Policies inconsistent district to district."
bad,"Seasonal tax associate/preparer - Dec thru mid-April. But had to self-pay & take/pass HRBlock's proprietary tax course for 3 months before even applying. Course was thorough but attending 3 days weekly for 3 mos. is a bit much, esp. if you have a 2nd job."
bad,"I had a wonderful experience working with H&R Block."
bad,"already reviewed on this company, seasonal job during tax season. no room for advancement. management was constantly changing,  needed a full time consistent job which this was not able to obtain"
bad,"offered many services to help individuals, businesses and families prepare their income tax returns. consumer friendly and customer oriented job"
bad,"Most days were long. Security and privacy rules are strict. If clients were ""new"" to the office, all information would need to be inputted. This action was for all clients that came used a different office location or new to the company. "
bad,"Just short hours during slow season, a typical day of work, I met a lot of clients and new people in this business and picked up management skills."
bad,"Would rather not comment on this employer because every office is different. In addition, office management changes quite frequently."
bad,"As I am always smiling, client service professional enabled me to do so even during working hours!  Although working hours were cut short during certain times of the year, advancement opportunities were available even during the off season!  I enjoyed my schedule and got along well with management!"
bad,"collecting tax info, learned how to input tax data, management is supportive, co-workers are helpful, hardest part was lots of down time between customers"
bad,"Easy job flexible hours. Management does not do an adequate job of conflict resolution. Worst part about job is having to give the tax pro's walk in clients. They will complain, and fight with each other in front of clients. However, they do work with your schedule, and it's fairly easy to accomplish your goals."
bad,"The Building Blocks Course that is required of each employee trains the future employee ""how"" to use the computer system; however, it does not educate about tax rules and/codes. After successfully completing the class, I did not feel as if I knew anything more about taxes, which does not give me confidence in the service."
bad,The best part of this job was my constant interaction with the public and my co-workers.
bad,"as a tax preparer, my responsabilites was help the clients to preparer their tax returns"
bad,The position was interesting as far as work goes but the personal drama at the office was not good.
bad,Working with the elderly! Enjoy helping others.busy setting! A lot of people with a lot of different needs! Must have patience in order to work in this field
bad,"Many of the people I encountered whom worked at hrblock where amazing, and fantastic. They worked extremely hard and often went above and beyond to help clients. They were hard working, good people working for a company that made rules that made their jobs and lives harder. there were at least 3 rule changes in the company while I worked that that completely changed what my job was."
bad,Great opportunity for advancement with continuous education. You are able to make your own hours. The company gives you the opportunity to get the experience of owning your own business.
bad,"I didn't enjoy my time at the company. the culture and compensation did not seem fair. my office manager was amazing, she defiantly made my time there more manageable."
bad,"The people that work there are very good people, the manager was very new and everything was chaotic, example: Schedule, Communication unprofessional Etc."
bad,"good working environment, team workers, reliable helping tax professionals"
bad,On a typical day you could service and care for up to 15 to 20 clients and prep their tax and other tax related services for them .
bad,"Seasonal job with few benefits; deals with many customers on a daily basis and must be versatile, calm, and willing to help people of all cultures; coworkers were helpful in teaching and training; work is mostly competitive-based so must have capacity to market your services to all clients; must be friendly and welcoming"
bad,"A creative, fulfilling place to work with opportunities available. The downfall was certain rules for certain employees. Favortism is never okay. Rules and format should apply to everyone."
bad,"I loved working for H&R Block, but I can't afford to return. Unfortunately, they are not able to guarantee permanent year round work and their pay rates are extrememly low in comparison to the cost of living. If I can't make rent after working 40 hours a week and have job security then I can't afford to work here."
bad,"I only had one season as a tax professional. I went to school and got my certificate, but in the end it was not for me. My boss at the store I was in was so scared to let me do any tax returns, she put me up front at the desk. I did like that though, at the front desk I had many responsibilities and found that enjoyable."
bad,"H&R Block was a great place to work"
bad,"It could be relaxed to stressful depending on clients, The most enjoyable part is waiting on the clients. Taxes can be a stressful situation so seeing the joy that clients get ins a rewarding"
bad,"The most enjoyable part is you get to meet new clients every hour."
bad,"I enjoyed working at H&R Block but they dont give you any hours what so ever. I was only working 10 hours a week as a part time seasonal receptionist. I would only work 4 hours a day twice a week. No more, No less. Management was great that I cant complain. But no hours and very little pay is what made my decision to leave this employer."
bad,There is great growth in this company. The managers are great to work with. The knowledge they provide is excellent. There is room to grow
bad,A great seasonal workplace that has many perks for a second job.
bad,Upset did not receive the card commission as promised and felt unworthy for all the work I put into advertisement. Some issues with walk-in clients other tax preparers didn’t want people doing there taxes even if the client excepted any tax preparer as a walk in.
bad,"This is a place to use for your benefit and know HR Block will be using you for their benefit. High pressure to up-sell products, low level of supervision, no privacy, and pay rate is purposefully complex in nature. Not a career. It can be a good source of additional income, if it can fit your schedule."
bad,"DMC It was fun, I love marketing and meeting new people.  The people were extremely nice, but the hours are long and sporadic"
good,I really enjoyed doing taxes and helping people through the process. It would have been great if there was a mentorship program in place. The most knowledgeable tax agent made the position difficult. It is more cut throat because the ones that have been there get paid by what they do. First years are just learning so it is difficult to know which clients you can and cannot help.
good,Very poor management. Manager was very unprofessional regarding job ethics. No opportunity to grow professionally. Need more supervision. Work for 2 season and was the same environment.
good,"Always busy, fun coworkers, coffee, $12/hr, flexible duties. One thing that sucked was that i would work 8:30am-11pm at night sometimes and i felt like i had no life. Manager always took preference in three girls because they were related to her."
good,The only thing I didn't like was the pay and hours. I was the manager and my boss didn't go up on pay.  And I was there for 9 years and still got pay less.
good,"H&R Block on the first hand is too expensive and I recommend not to get your taxes done there. Second, the tax pros LOVE to talk badly about each other and you will mostly likely hear your name come out of their mouths. Third, it sucks cause I personally work 11 hour shifts here and the day drags on. The management is hardly here and it just sucks."
good,"No chance of advancement, most offices managed by people not qualified to do so."
good,"I worked as a receptionist. I greeted customers, set appointments, called out for appointment and business reminders . I was in charge of client transactions."
good,I loved interacting with the clients. I am a people person and if I could help I did. Even if it was the same person from the year before you would get something new from them. It's about knowing the people and understanding what you are doing so that you can help them understand.
good,"The work was fine, gave me experience.  The employer was enjoyable. I also enjoyed the customer relations. It was not a long term job and didn't have benefits. But they were willing to train for becoming a tax pro."
good,"I would go in hour before the office opened and fix any incorrect return and have all errors completed before staff arrived, scheduling printing checks and having clients files completed and ready for completion and calling scheduling and arranging pickup."
good,"As a CSP(customer service professional) Your job is pretty much that of a receptionist except most of your time will be spent making phone calls to previous year's clients. For the short amount of time the position is held (January 1st /April 15) the hours in my case where lousy because my office gets minimal traffic and the culture for my district was very bottom line oriented. For example if the district manager did not make his/her quota then a negativity would surge down to office managers and in my case panic, for which going to a hour saving frenzy in which everybody who is not essential to the business doesn't get the hours like those who are, mainly tax pros with the most client base because those with smaller client bases tent to be newer and less experienced, same goes with CSP. I did not enjoy working there seeing how the culture doesn't allow for work to be fun. My opinion is that they want to have a well oiled anti-social workforce that its only goal is to push the bottom line which is to make a profit. H&R block is one of those companies where corporate is too involved in the day to day operations which in my opinion takes away the role of the district manager and gives corporate tunnel vision as far as the big picture goes because they are too involved."
good,Seasonal only and there is no growth. Manager is. unsupportive.
good,Did not work there very long time to omit an opinion about H&R BLock. It was a good learning opportunity for being an university student in accounting.
good,"Nice place to work very organized. I learned that people can be so rude if they cant be first, and wait their turn or should make an appointment. keeping customers calm was some times hard."
good,I very much enjoyed my clients at H&R Block.  Many of them I had seen for the 8 years I worked there and have become friends.  I have learned many new things about taxes from both taking and teaching the classes at H&R Block.
good,the job itself was not the problem. It's being given advice to a brand new employee in front of the entire waiting area as well as staff that is over whelming to everyone.
good,Overall company is terrible but people are great. They require a 2 month Furlough every year and then decide to hire you back. The management is inconsistent and unstable. The greatest this is the flexible spending.
good,"Lovely place to work.  HQ bldg filled with modern art on every floor.  Beautiful surroundings in dt KC, but job was temporary, so it was always a matter of looking over your shoulder for the yellow piece of paper indicating you had been laid off."
good,Fast paced work with lots of opportunities to learn Federal Taxation and how it affects the general population. Flexible work timings and great team support.
good,"I would have learned a lot more if I were given more clients. If H&R Block truly would like to help their new employees build competency necessary to prepare tax and provide a complete service, they would give incentives to regular staffers to mentor new people. I also did not enjoy the retail environment where we were constantly challenged to sell add-on products. This gives an atmosphere of selling to customers rather than educating and helping clients by providing a personal service. I worked at a corporately owned store. Individual franchises are probably different."
good,"Typical receptionist role - answer phone, make coffee, make copies/fax, vacuum, schedule appointments, and process payments. Some of the preparers like to take advantage and treat you like a personal assistant and depending on those individuals, there may be power struggles and fights about getting the new clients and etc."
good,"Online appointments are not always consistent and booked off work schedule.  "
good,"Great training - worth going back for year after year.  Good people to work for & with in local offices.  Poor pay, bad bonus structure & seasonal work only."
good,"Must know how to multi task. There will be moments when you have to answer the phone, make a payment, and have a client in front of you asking questions."
good,"Although this is a strong company financially, it does not compensate fairly. You can learn all you want, the schooling is wonderful but the management will hold you back."
good,"I loved working with clients and building that database of customers, but as far as working with my co-workers or management that was terrible. There is a lot of office drama, to say the least."
good,I prefer to know what my duties consist of and I am not a fan of duties unrelated to my job description being expected of me. If I choose to be a janitor that is my prerogative but if I am a tax professional you need to pay me more to perform other jobs.
good,"The direct mangers are amazing, district management not good at all. Training is provided but not enough before starting job. Very poor pay, no job security, barely time to take a break. Absolutely no home/work balance."
good,HR Block is all about money. Taking from the Employees in order for Upper Management to make more money. No benefits. They don't care about their employees
good,"this was a good job for seasonal work,  I worked there after my shift at another job and work until 10pm which was okay but it was just until tax season was over and I wasn't asked to go back"
good,"To much employee/management turn over. Not a very stable work force, no teamwork or support from management. Does not allow for work and school, does not allow for a break."
good,I personally did not like working for H&R Block. They were unethical. The promise that the manager made before hiring me was never meet. The competition was not ethical.
good,Manager usually leaves the office for hours without explanation. The pay is horrible and the hours are horrible. There will be weeks that you only work six hours. This job is really not worth a second look.
good,"H & R Block does not encourage job advancement, they do not promote their people.  The district manager has issues with non-hispanic people.  Although I enjoy helping the clientele, the upper management of this company needs a great deal of scrutinizing."
good,"Gained great customer service experience, not satisfied with the management, the hardest part of the job is to handle a line of angry customers who were late with their tax filing, the most enjoyable part of the job is to talk with absolutely different people and provide them with good advices regarding taxation and after that to see smiles at their faces, liked to handle anger, liked to help seniors and customers with low income"
good,H & R Block is a good place to work if you don't mind seasonal employment and no benefits including holiday pay. Also there is no chance of advancement or raises for employees' who return.
good,I enjoy working with children. However i moved on in my career path and could no longer commit to the job assignment. I worked with infants and toddlers.
good,Handled over 60 calls a day troubleshooting software and hardware issues. The best part of the job was learning something new everyday and working with the public.  The hardest part of the job was that is was seasonal.
good,They didn't care about the customers just hitting their company goals. They took away all the incentives for repeat customers and put all the information at risk.
good,"This is a great opportunity to learn for someone who is interested in becoming a tax pro or accountant, but for the average job seeker- it's a pass.  The hours are ridiculous and there are no benefits and literally no room to advance since you are ""laid off""  April 16."
good,i enjoyed my short time here although there were a few poisons elements that i chose to ignore.  i have always enjoyed receptionist positions where i get to interact with the public.
good,This is a seasonal job with few benefits. I began as a tax professional and then returned as a customer service professional.  I performed all duties expected of me and found links and lists of cancelled and dropped clients which I called on my own to get them back as customers which won me an award at H&R Block.
good,Stayed and did my job.  Never did less than I was suppose to but management wasn't the greatest
good,"Effectuer l'accueil client, répondre aux appels, jumeler la clientèle avec les associés de l'impôt, effectuer l'ouverture de dossier, effectuer la facturation, mise à jour de dossier etc."
good,My experience as a tax preparer was very interesting as well as somewhat challenging. I'm glad that I was able to have the oppurtunity to gain the skill.
good,H&R Block was very fast pased at times. Its a professional setting and customer service orentated.
good,"When I started there they were not a franchise and I loved it. We had an awesome Office manager who was always there for you and the clients were always first and foremost with her and H&R, but last year they (2011) they became a franchise and we of course got a new Office manager. She was a nice lady and did a decent job, but playing on the computer seemed to be her objective. When i was brought back in for an interview to see if I was interested in returning to work for them I was gauranteed full time as I would be the only one with prior H&R experience. I was also sent a letter stating that I would have a 25 cent increase in my pay over the precious year as my experience earned this. They brought in several college students and that is fine, but they all spent their time texting friends and family, playing games on the computer, and doing their homework. Well i ended up with full time during peak season only (2 weeks) and then was put done to one day a week. Their reason for this was they did not want to let everyone else go. The students were given 2 days and more a week. I also never received my raise. I sent several e-mails to the franchise owner as told to. He was the one who gave me the raise and this is why I was told to e-mail him. It came to naught. When this season came upon us I kept waiting for the e-mail to let me know when it was time for the meeting prior to the season. I finally contacted them to see what was going on and was informed that they decided to cut back on staff. They brought back the previous college students. And yes I had excellent reportts on"
good,You can set your own schedule to your availabiltiy and work with great co-workwers
good,"Productive, but the rate of pay is minimum.  If you love the work then it is ok, but clients can be very rude at times. The company charges a high rate for the tax returns and the clients are not happy with that. So you are always at the receiving end."
good,"The corporate culture is preventing continued company and employee growth. There is no acknowledgement of the work by the tax professionals. Every year compensation is reduced and demands are increased. "
good,"Learn lot of thing with the company. adopt new things, implemented in organisation. It was good experience to work there. Got new friends. boost my carrier graph."
good,"I liked working for Block but the work was seasonal, which I regret but understood. It was the nature of the work. i liked working for the people and learning the tax work. going to the classes in the summer and working with the managers and staff during the season."
good,Extensive training and adhering to company guidelines is  very crucial. Assigning a mentor/mentors to all new associates will help strengthen the skills and increase tax knowledge of the associate
good,"You have to meet all of these qualifications, take all these trainings and be extremely  sensitive to customers for ratings with no support from your upper management just to make less than someone  working the register at McDonald's"
good,Multiple layoffs. Individuals left had trippled responsibility with no additional  compensation. Significant travel required. 60 hours of work expected in 40 hour non-salaried position. Lack of recognition and appreciation. Archaic management model causing conflict between business partners due to conflicting goals and direction. Inconsistent communication
good,"Le poste demande une connaissance de la fiscalité et une production "
good,My best advice if you're looking to be a receptionist at any of their locations visit the location. All locations are different and vary in their busyness. Some locations will be complete chaos with the high customer / clientele turn over. the later in the tax season it will become insanely busy and lost of last minute customers seeking to get their taxes done. Be mentally ready for the last few weeks of the tax season as it will progressively get more busy.
good,Dist.Mgr not professional.lets staff say curse words in mtgs & give middle finger.DGM thinks funny for these things and let's them happen.& Ok with it
good,"The owner would only stop by to see if any business earned etc.. just"
good,High stress with low pay. Extreme pressure involved to get tax returns done for clients. High pressure with monetary penalties for mistakes made. Asked to do unrelated tasks such as marketing duties.
good,Started with the company as DM and was responsible for 12 locations by the end of my career with them I was given 23 locations with no additional compensation. Saved money by adding work load to DM's.
good,"Lack of consistency in higher management, resulting in having to do, redo, and undue things.  Minimal pay and constantly trying to pinch more away from employees.  Steady or slow, followed by hustle busy in burst.  Dealing with some stressed out clientele sometimes, which isn't that bad overall."
good,Needs to focus more on a team culture and customer service.  Older employees DO NOT want new employees as compensation is based on commission and productivity.
good,"As a part-time tax preparer, the experience supplemented what I was learning (or about to learn) in accounting classes at university."
good,"Managers needs to be trained and more education with specialization on our field. ( Tax knowledge)."
good,This was a seasonal/temp job. Once the season was over the job was over. With several high peaks-February and the 1st two weeks of April. You get to assist a wide array of customers.
good,"The job was ok. Working for minimum wage was only acceptable with the promised ""bonus."" Unfortunately that bonus is reduced by the hourly wages earned.  So unless your bonus is more than you earned you get zero bonus."
good,This position involved dealing the public either face to face or on the phone.  I feel that I have strong verbal skills so I enjoyed this part of the position.  Also there were times when most of my day involved data entry (that made for a very long day).  This position involved supporting tax professionals and I enjoyed learning a little more about tax preparation
good,"Still not a bad job, it takes a while to get to a high level tax professional to earn money. Lots of continued education sometimes with or without pays. If you're a Level 1 tax associate, and your client have a complicated form, you end up referring them to the higher level tax pro."
good,I Did the Tech support for the Tax Pros. I was  to Resolve technical support issues for Tax Professional’s to support Tax filing. In reality I was forced to learn the Tax rules and teach them to the Pros as they were trained vary badly or not at all.
good,"Long hours in the office as the only tax professional. Didn't have a single day off for 2 months, 12+ hour days. Starting pay is good and if you stay with them it will go up."
good,"If you want to expand your knowledge about taxes then H&R Block is a great place to work. However, if you need a job to support yourself then look elsewhere. The pay is too low for all of the knowledge you are to have to help clients. The only people that make money are the ones at the top, not the ones actually doing the tax returns."
good,"Clients keep leaving because of corporate pricing, but corporate says preparers are not selling the product well enough. Prices increased over 5% per year."
good,The  job  was part  time  good work  environment.  Some of the best coworkers they were  very helpful with  training.  I learned how to file returns  and take care of the clients
good,"This is a great place to break into an IT role. However, since the job is seasonal, they don't care what their employees think."
good,"I worked this position as a seasonal employee. The store manger was extremely under qualified, which caused a lot of friction with employees. I made her aware of any issues I had but respected her as my manager and did what I was asked. Very unique company did not offer much incentives to stay or to come back next season."
good,"Position is good for seasonal employment, and works around schedules.  Good place to work if you like working with clients and building a client."
good,"I enjoy doing taxes and would not do them for any other company. Block keeps it's preparers up to date in their training. Unfortunately they don't pay much, but I enjoy helping people."
good,Answered calls from potential clients and scheduled appointments for tax preparers.
good,"Worked long hours teaching taxes to the public and other tax professionals in the company. I also was the Office Leader of one store where I managed time and expenses. I took every course I could to increase my knowledge to share with my co workers. Tax time is a big push for all agencies and we are pushed constantly to become number one."
good,employees can be good but the company does not pay what the employees deserve.
good,Tax season only...business has been on the decline when I was there...
good,"I believe if your NOT part of management your nothing"
good,"Offer great educational classes yearly both at local offices and online. Good, honest people to work with together as a team. Offer flexible hours on your own schedule."
good,"better hours are needed and not so much competition between larger stores and the small ones"
good,Although they say you will get commission but you only can get when you become senior tax preparer. Otherwise it is just hourly income which is really low. After working for two seasons they offered me 15 percent less even though I was one of the top performer. So I quit.
good,Busy Days during Tax Season.  Definitley need an active manager.  Hardest part of job was the computer programs failing.  Best part of job was co-workers.
good,"Fast paced work environment, multi-tasking a must, interpersonal skills needed, excellent customer service experience needed. Enjoyed maintaining schedules for all tax professionals. Overall enjoyable experience."
good,"Can be a great place to work. Each store has it's own work culture,  and it can be difficult to know.  Training platforms available are awesome and easy to use."
good,"Prepare tax returns and help customers with letters from the IRS. I worked for them for about 10 years and they have continuing education classes that you are free to take to keep up with your ce's. They charge $35. for that. The hardest part is the office gossips. You are either part of the click or not. It is only seasonal unless you are lucky enough to work during the ""pre-season"". The time from the end of tax season until the next season starts. You really need to be on the good side of management to be able to work then. That is when you really learn things. The best part is the clients. Many preparers only come back year after year for their clients. If not for them, I would have left a long time ago."
good,"Seasonal job"
good,"I worked in 3 H & R Block offices. Each office function differently. It depended on the Tax Pros and manager, location and clients. The Burlington office in the mall was upscale and very pleasant, organized and welcomed new Tax Pros."
good,very slow pace at the office I was placed. management wasn't certain on their job. job is not hard at all. started out with decent amount of hours after a month hours were cut tremendously.
good,It was close to home.  It was convenient.  I had good hours.  The others that worked there were nice & helpful.  It was a good experience for me.  It would be ok for someone who wants temporary part time job.
good,"H&R Block is a good career opportunity for people that is single and for those that is want to move up quickly in their job, but it is stressful when people is not getting their money when the due date has passed."
good,I have been working with them since 2006.  You learn a lot about taxes at my office.  My office is an exception.  Most office are very competitive with each other and not helping each other.  I only come back for my wonderful clients and co workers.  Also HRB works with your schedule.
good,Not a lot of support for new hires. Very much a culture of pushing clients through quickly. Pay is too low for first year employees. Not a great place to work.
good,"Working as an Office Manager the job can be very demanding, particularly at peak times when doing taxes. Depending on the office worked, the environment can be somewhat risky."
good,"It was a part time high school job for me.  Not having to work fast food was a bonus.  The job was easy.  Greet customers, check them in or make appointments. Answer phones. Reload the printers with paper. Light cleaning and stocking.  Making fresh coffee.  Evening cleaning and taking out the trash before closing."
good,The culture was very competitive.  The other tax pros were very rude and unfriendly.  They overcharge customers for tax filing and push products on low income clientele.
good,It is best to take the Tax Preparing Courses to obtain a promotion within the Company. Make sure to read the fine print for your job description. Management is not always in tune with the needs of the employees.
good,"seasonal. Provided Client Service offering Secured credit card options available to clients as well as preparing taxes for clients.low pay, poor hours, when working overtime district management became angry due to limited staff in our office."
good,"Spent most days working on tax returns, helping new hires, and setting client appointments. Assisted manager with employee schedule, ordering office supplies, general office needs."
good,Alot is expected from tax professionals and office managers with such a short window of the season. The manager I had put me in the busiest tax office with no experience and did not give me the guidance that I should have gotten.
good,Job is primarily Commission based and not set up fairly for you to succeed. Good if you have nothing else. Not enough hours for you to pay bills off of. People are decent. Discipline is nonexistent.
good,You have to take lot of classes in your free time that you are not compensated for. You have to market on your free time as well. You have to call people over and over and ask them to come in to have their taxes prepared
good,"This was my first job in USA. I met a lot of people, Loved the interaction I had with local people, learnt a lot about the culture and I really learnt a lot about Us Tax laws."
good,The position was only seasonal. Filed tax returns and aid in tax planning for the future if requested. Advise in IRA if the client asked about retirement.
good,"Was not happy. Associates were rude. Customers were always right, when in actuality they weren't. Although, it was a foot in the door, and got me started into my career."
good,"I just didn't like that I was hired as a CSP and given very little work hours. When I asked the office manager,  they just shrugged it off. I thought that I would be working more hours. I lost out on other things taking this  job. My name is on the work schedule but I am not getting any work.  I think it was the company getting gov Tax Credits for hiring."
good,"I feel the pay could be better for someone who has 10 years with the company, I also feel it is the management that makes the decision and it should come from a higher source."
good,"Manager could be more organized and attentive to employees needs. This job is supposed to be flexible, manager needs to commuicate more with employees. Office could be run more smoothly if manager wasn't so on edge all the time."
good,"Seeing as how this position held was a temporary seasonal position, I’m looking for something more stable than H&R Block was able to offer me. Also our schedules were very poorly made and we did not know work hours until the day before."
good,"I liked the clients, love what I did there, enjoyed my co workers."
good,"As H&R Block has declined the past 15 years, executives and managers have grown while shrinking the workforce. Annual changes to ""long term plans"" have crippled the companies ability to make real, lasting decisions. An environment of annual layoffs and budget cuts does not make for a good environment to work in, or indicate a bright future for the company. "
good,I basically was responsible for bookkeeping.
good,selling products and not just doing tax returns was hard and reason I left. I just wanted to help people with their taxes. Only a part time temp job during the tax season.
good,"If you would like to earn a little extra money through out the year, working here is great. The only issue I see is the high turnover rate of  management and short staffing."
good,it's a great place to learn about preparing taxes and establishing relationships with clients.  salary is not great for a part-time position and there are no huge perks.
good,"HR Block is very flexible the office is small so building a family work environment is very possible. Client service professional position is the face of the company. A typical work day is greeting clients. You learn a lot about tax forms and products and services of HR Block. The hardest part of the job may be dealing with an unhappy client.  The most enjoyable part is meeting new faces, a real networking oppourtunity."
good,No benefits and limited advancement possibilities. No CPA's. Forced unpaid vacation was told 8 weeks reality was 13 weeks. Hours were highly unpredictable. During tax season I worked 70 hours per week. During preseason 4 hours a week.
good,"We see clients as walk ins and appointments for any number of tax related reasons. Excellent client service skills are required as one is dealing with money and taxes, two most sensitive subjects."
good,"Working at H&R was meeting all kind of people from different walks of life I enjoyed meeting these people."
good,"First off, you spend a lovely $149 for the H&R Block training course. You can do it online or in the classroom. After weeks of preparation, you take your exam and IF you pass, you're basically hired. "
good,"Basic educational background that you pay for"
good,"H&R Block is a great place to get trained but a bad place to get good pay.  You start out great with a set pay rate but in the 2nd year you get chopped to 80% of your previous year only difference now is they raised the min. wage to 11.00, it was 7.25. I went from 25 an hr. to 7.25, because I caught my office manager selling non company products to every client and reported her.  There is so much learning and training and retraining that it is not worth the hours you get when tax season slows down.  You have to do constant marketing and if you don't increase your client base every year you will get fired.  Tax pros are the only employed group that has to take a test every year and pay to work.  Soon IRS will win and everyone will have to take a special test and pay more every year with the increases IRS will give out in order to work."
good,"You grow close with the people you work with. Clients and Co-workers. My DGM had true passion and dedication. However, the corporate executives stole all of that away. They have the opportunity to truly help people, and employees yet they treat them terrible. Very high turn over rate, constant change and not in a positive way."
good,Company has been performing poorly for several years-lack of communication in upper management. No security within the job-always downsizing. Would not recommend
good,"Pay is not very good but the flexible hours are great and the work is interesting. "
good,Co-workers were pleasant and very helpful with questions and advice. Good work environment. Clients were very friendly and easy going.
good,"some days were not very productive, Boss seemed always stressed out, some staff members were not very friendly. Other people doing each others jobs and not their own. not a very confidential place to work."
good,This was a very busy work place where  there was a lot of  angry customers. They only let me work part time they didn't pay much considering all the work that you do
good,Company is and was asleep at the switch and could not adjust to modern computer technology and changing market trends. Top down management style prevents flattening of the pyramid. Management does not pay attention to suggestions from rank and file.
good,"a typical day at work for me, would start with checking phone messages, uploading daily imports from Office's checking emails and answering the phone as it rings. Dealing with the ATO as it a raise's and checking tax return's and lodging them. This is a typical day for me put doing other jobs as they become available."
good,they could not stick to one way of doing things that kept changing daily the policies made taking care of clients very difficult
good,Very seldom was there a time that one could not learn something each day.  We had software to support our learning needs constantly.
good,Always good with numbers. Was trying something new outside the family business. I enjoyed meeting new people and trying something new. Specialized in small business and farm returns.
good,"I would much rather wait tables the rest of my life than to be stuck working for this company again. I would not recommend that they keep bringing in the training classes and not having the amount of time that is needed to sufficiently train these individuals. The new DIY program came out, and the company did not give us sufficient training material or time to learn how to efficiently do our jobs as software technicians. There were questions we had no idea how to answer, issues that were not resolved before the launch of the software, and plenty of headaches for everyone involved."
good,"Management was unavailable most of the time and seemed to not really care about their job."
good,"My current role assisting the human resources department in achieving its mission by providing project and administrative support to members of the human resources management team as assigned as well as leading a variety of teams in solving complex manager and associate inquiries and issues.  Key areas of my responsibility include responding to complex HR inquiries for a variety of HR questions and issues, monitoring and tracking multiple projects, providing coaching and mentoring to assigned associate teams, monitoring and tracking budgets, working with vendors and assisting with ad-hoc projects as needed.  Also provided exceptional customer service by handling manager and associate inquiries, requests, and concerns via phone, email, live chat, and/or written correspondence.  Process a variety of associate transactions across most areas of Human Resources, including benefits, payroll, & HRIS.  As lead Specialist it was my responsibility to provide coaching, manages workload, train newer specialists, and support my department manager."
good,Hours were short and had a few rude coworkers i had to learn to get along. That was maybe the hardest part of my day only because it made my day difficult and uncomfortable.
good,"They try to cram all the knowledge for preparing a basic return in  their tax course. In reality, you need an overall accounting perspective of the tax system coupled with laws and regulations. The management is incompetent. They treat employees like garbage especially women with children. Many of the senior and enrolled agents are arrogant and condescending."
good,"The manager would change the schedule the day before you needed to come in, and you wouldn't be informed about it. A few workers were often victims of screaming or condescending criticism. Management made employees cry. Coworkers were awesome and fun to work around. I may have enjoyed the job at a different location with different manager."
good,"Hired as a season Client Service Professional.  Basically a clerical/receptionist type position in the office.  Greet clients, make appointments, etc.  Co-workers nice but management somewhat unfocused and makes frequent mistakes with scheduling.  Training should be more precise, organized, and in depth with skills we actually utilize on the job.  Pay is relatively low and hours vary upon the need at the individual locations.  Job is fine for what it is but no real opportunities for growth or advancement.  Perhaps more ideal for a student, retiree, or someone who only wants to work part-time and is looking to make some extra money."
good,This was an average work environment. As it was only a seasonla job I was only employeed for 3 months
good,"Operating all office machinery, scheduling meetings and appointments, handling multiple multi-line phones simultaneously, issuing titles/temporary plates/registration, handled all Secretary of State paperwork for clients, coordinated with the Illinois sales tax association in regards to clients' retail tax, acquired city & state business licenses for clients opening new corporations, following up and maintaining client's annual corporation renewals, collecting office's monthly fees (sales tax, filing fees, soft drink taxes etc.)"
good,The hardest part of the job was everybody quit at the front desk and I had to ride my bike home in the dark.  Everybody was who quit without notice was rehired the next season.  Except me.  Because I didn't own a vehicle.  I got sick and had to have my gall bladder taken out and they let me have my job back after 2 weeks. An associate by the name of Elizabeth helped me get home after the surgery.  She even sent me flowers.  The people who worked there were kind and missed me when I came back to do my taxes.
good,The company always provided new information and classes to learn more about different tax laws. I enjoyed working with my co workers but the compensation was not enough to live on.
good,Great company to work for. I learned new skills throughout my time at the company
good,"My typical day at work consist of answering apr 100 calls per day. I have learned how to produce virtual courses, manipulate spreadsheets and bookkeeping. My supervisor is the best and is very supportive with challenging task. I love my co-workers! They are the best when it comes to catching on to new process and procedures, we pass on helpful tips and not to mention they are great cooks! The hardest part of my current position is giving more an beyond the call of duty and not feeling accurately compensated. I enjoy the flexibility of the work hours and term dates."
good,"After my second season at this employer, I am seriously considering not returning next season. The most influential benefit is the fact that working for this company gives you free tax prep. I was not prepared to be hasled constantly by the office leader, and singled out to do task that were not part of my job. I do not feel that the office leader was fairly treated by her superiors and so she didn't treat us all fairly."
good,"Typically as a client service professional you come to work in the morning or the evening and always make coffee first and foremost. Next you are double check the appointment book to see what the day/night has set for the tax professioanls. Co-workers see you as a maid and a personal assistant. The Tax professionals are lazy and will not assist with office needs such as cleaning, sorting, or calling clients. The most difficult part of the job is not explaining your frustrations with the clients. Many of the clients leave the office unsatisfied and you are not allowed to express you feelings with them. For the most part it is a good job for a few months if you are looking for a couple of extra bucks. Not worth the time for much more."
good,"Despite doing my best and achieving something 3 managers (1 in US, 1 in India and a Sr manager) together could not do, they let go of my department. Basically we were starting to do better than the US department and they were scared they would lose their jobs so they sabotaged us. Apart from that H&R block is not forward thinking. In a market like India they will get killed by competition because people move fast on business ideas. That is exactly what happened. I talked to the Head of Innovation and he seemed more fit for Risk management than innovation as he didn't want to try any idea. Not a good position for him or the company. I predict it will not last and will be bought by another company it is slowly dying."
good,Adults that are all about high school drama them this company is for you! Coworkers love to be in your business even though it is none of their business. Company claims flexibility regarding your personal emergencies but they talk about your problems as if they are public knowledge.
good,I made the same amount as the receptionist. There is not a lot of compensation for working there the first year as a tax preparer. I worked during the day and evening.
good,Seasonal work can be hard... the only time its good pay if you are a tax professional after your second year. The albion michigan office is unprofessional amd they over charge.
good,"OK for starting out.  Need more collaborative work.  Training is great, lots of resources.  Pay is less than average.  Supervision is average.  Competitive and a bit cut throat.  Metric system, and client ratings make it interesting.  Simple to moderate difficulty in tax returns, some higher levels."
good,"Working for H&R Block was not bad at all the pay was fair, the people were great. The job was boring at times, but also pretty laid back and enjoyable."
good,In the end it was not as desirable as in the beginning. We were always told the big wigs will be here today. Never saw or met any of them the entire season.
good,"You control your advancement "
good,"This was a fast paced work environment during the tax season. There was plenty of filing, patient checking in and out, and also register running. Many workers were related so advancement was difficult."
good,You need to be able to multi-task. The office is fast pace and never a dull moment. You need to able to let things role off your back since you encounter people who need their refund yesterday.
good,hardwork don’t be off your pivot when you come in you have to be sharp everyday. Show your responsible and you’ll be rewarded. It’s only hard when you make it
good,"Depending on office location, and the number of client one has accumulated, a typical day is spent waiting for client filing their income tax return. Job entails regular updating on tax law updates and revisions. Learning procedures and tax software that gets revised for reason I can not understand."
good,"I love doing taxes , but the job was very stressful for what you were paid. The tax program was very easy to use, which made the job easy if you understood it . The management was horrible and am happy to say she is no longer there with the company. She ruined my desire to work for H & R Block ever again ."
good,"The company recently hired a new CEO, he is super sharp and engaged, but now the company has transistioned to where you work from 7am and not get home until 10pm every day 6 days a week... most of the time you can't even take a lunch break... I believe that the current format is inhumane and unsustainable."
good,"Management is often unavailable or off the premises, due to meetings or being used at other offices.  Some employees sign in and take off without signing out and get paid for time they don't work.  There is sometimes culture clash with employees - and business etiquette is not always enforced."
good,"District office does not recognize the managers who are working hard to bring in revenue for the district. The District Director has her ""favorites"" whom she recognize stealing ideas from the manager. Shame on them!!"
good,Fun times spent with tax preparers. Fast paced environment. Only a seasonal job. All staff has to be re-hired every year. This makes unemployment unavailable. No benefits available either.
good,"Working at H&R Block had it's perks. There were some days that when there were no customers in the office, we were able to relax some and talk among ourselves. It would also be the tax pro's time to catch up on their ""drop off"" clients taxes. As a CSR, that was also a time for us to scan and verify refund amounts and signatures and to make phone calls to let customers know that their refund check was ready for pick up and or they needed to schedule an appointment to come in to see their tax pro for questing."
good,"Working for HR Block was a good experience for me, gave me the opportunity to learn and understand the Tax policie in USA"
good,"Work for the Company if you can, that way you know what is expected on a day to day basis. I am sure some of the Franchises are good to work for.  My experience was not so good."
good,Need to raise the pay and offer more hours for C.S.P's. I enjoyed the people at my particular office. The higher ups have no people skills and they could care less about the people who work for the company.
good,"H&R Block has a great work environment and friendly employees. However, in order to get a job there, prior schooling with their tax academy is required. To have to pay and complete their course and then to work for them only to get paid so little is unfair. It's only for the tax season so it isn't so bad for resume building/time pass/extra income/experience purposes. Very few people are able to build a sustainable career out of working at H&R Block. Their scheduling is great and incredibly flexible, tough to get a lunch break during tax season."
good,This branched closed a few years ago.  The manager was terrible.  She treated the clients like they were going to give her some kind of disease and once stated that she was allergic to poor people.
good,"quotas, policies and procedures handed down by senior management, who had no knowledge of field work.  Limited advancement opportunities.  Too much work, too little pay."
good,"I learned how to interact with the public, the staff and other personnel from other offices.  Advancing our training and expertise was emphasized.  The hardest part of the job and sometimes the easiest part of the job was not knowing what was going to happen next."
good,Not good top management and does not give Tax Pros or CSPs the recognition for doing a job well done. Management is not organized. They don't train or prepare new tmTax Pros for their first year.
good,"Very hostile environment.  Cut-throat tax preparers taking on more clients than they can handle.  Bully in the office that the owner would not put her in her place.  Because she has been there forever, she felt she ran the place.  No teamwork, poor work environment, mold smelling and rules of protecting credit cards didn't apply in that office."
good,"Management changed and so did the culture. Previous management was exceptional but change to a corporate style. Corporate didn't understand the economical challenges of the area. Caused more stress then what should have been."
good,"I loved working at H&R Block! A typical day at work included answering the phone, making appointments, daily cash reconciliation, and helping clients with tax related questions. There was no hard part to this job."
good,It is just a job to prepare taxes for customers every year... This is a franchise and probably is not the same culture that the one in company stores.
good,"Not a lot of training available for the CSP job. Easy job, depending on your mentality and your work location. I don't have many complaints. Upper management doesn't respect the clients or their time, as they want us to double book. They also have staff names on schedule who no longer work there, so clients show up with appts. to see people who aren't really there!! That sucks! With the rates HRB charges a client's time should be respected."
good,Nothing bad about working here other than rude clients and being really busy or too dead staffs pretty decent though breaks are decent and days can be very long it very short
good,"I will not work with the Hollister team again!  A couple of them were very nice at first.  "
good,"Fast paced during busy periods, but slow most the time.  Management is not qualified.  Compensation is commission minus hourly, so working during slow times and overtime actually cause the employee to lose money."
good,"Was scheduled for 20+ hours a week and was cut down to 7 without any notice. Manager keeps promising more hours but have changed yet. No real training, was thrown into preparing returns without being walked through a full return."
good,"Alright for part time job but not paid enough, was mostly nights and weekends and already had full time job  but help ends meet, management was great and had good co workers ."
good,"Not a bad place to work, if you understand it is temporary. Not really something they wanna tell you, but it is. Nice to be part of such a big company, but no benefits and it is temporary"
good,They really don't make it clear how much they will cut your pay after tax season. My pay was cut to less than half and that is the pay that you receive for 8 months of the year
good,"work day consist of cleaning bathrooms, taking garbage out to completing tax returns. "
good,"You have to take their course to work there. Thats good experience you will get at no charge. You have to make a mininmum in sales, then they deduct your pay. If there is anything left you get a bonus."
good,no trust in owner at all plenty of lies and broken promises. no proof of commission but was told would earn one. paid no mileage for long distance no review of output
good,Working front desk were greet people answer question and take appointments. How many different tax issue. Management is not as good as it was the first 3 years I worked. Is a fast pass work and could stressful. The hardest is having children running around the office and the parents don't stop them.The most enjoyable part is working with good co-workers
good,"only part-time employment. slow business, answering phones, make calls for appointments, take payments for tax service, customer service, no long hours."
good,"Second job wasn't really worth the time. "
good,Company offers great educational & learning opportunities with many courses and seminars. Very poor communications between management & employees. Very limited benefits other education.
good,"Management was never around, to assist me with customers, also she involved her personal life to interfere. Gave other employees full time hours who were related by family or were her friends outside of work."
good,"This is only a part time seasonal position while I am looking for a full time position offering more pay with benefits. "
good,When I started I had very little training. I was quick to learn the new tasks without little assistance. Work hours were amazing at my location. Lack of communication and under staffed made for some upset customers. Got great work experience dealing with dissatisfied customers.
good,"It is a nice environment but office manager changes schedules with no notice and  wonders why people don't show up."
good,"Preparing for shift, sometimes opening which meant checking of phone  messages, making sure copier was full of paper and tax professionals had necessary products to serve clients, cleaning up and making sure that when checks came in to make appointments, set clients up with tax professionals, either walk-in or by phone.  Cleanup at the end of the day and prepare next shift.  Learned to help set up appointments and learned to operate phones with multiple phone lines.  My coworkers and I got along pretty well.  The hardest part of my job was there was hardly any breaks and no benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy clients pleased with either the customer service or tax professional."
good,It is a great place to advance In your career. It has unlimited opportunity. It is very flexible with scheduling for people with families.
good,"My review regarding the clerical work of the H&R Block staff was pretty basic; you answered phones, wrote messages for the TA staff completing walkend and scheduled clients.  We maintained the clients files to ensure that each refund were funded to the correct patron and assigned each  client to a the TA worker."
good,H&R Block has experienced high rates of turnover with the management staff over the past 3 years.  There is not a sense of job security.  Decisions with pricing lost many customers and their decision to hold back tax professional bonus to compensate for their poor earning has lost a lot of staff. I loved the job and the staff at district level however it was very difficult to work for the new management who has now let go of 75% of their field staff.
good,Did not enjoy working at H&R block. Workers were too aggressive toward each others. They don't support each other. Management was unprofessional.
good,I was still in college when I worked here. It was only a seasonal job. The co-workers were nice to me but I didn't learn much working there.
good,"I love meeting new people and working for this company made it easy to do that.  Overall a pleasant experience and learned a lot of information about taxes mostly on I really don't want to be any part of it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm excellent at tax preparation, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did asking them the questions about their family and stuff.  I like watching people open up to me, I guess.  That's the most enjoyable part of the job,"
good,The company has a lot of temporary position and will work with your daily schedule. They will teach you how to become a tax rep.
good,"Every day was excited ."
good,"Most days were spent preparing tax returns."
good,"If it wasn't for the clients wouldn't stay around."
good,"The day was usually easy going unless there were a lot of appointments scheduled. Scheduling appointments, keeping the office clean, tending to clients and answering the phones were the main responsibilities. I also filed papers and made coffee for everyone in the office. The hardest part of the job was making sure to keep clients calm as they were waiting, but it was not impossible. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it is not that hard to take care of my responsibilities. The majority of my co-workers were very nice, but the managers were awful, disrespectful, ungrateful and full of pride."
good,very disorganized and under appreciate employees. pay is very little.
good,"I learned a lot about IT at this job.  Is a great starter job for Tech's fresh out of school, but there is little room for advancement, and the compensation is not good at all."
good,"As a client service coordinator, I scheduled clients appointments for the tax professionals.  "
good,"I enjoy processing taxes.  Customer relations, tax advice, finding the  highest refund available, or being able to lower tax liability."
good,H & R Block was seasonal.  They retained us for 10 months then off for two months.  I did not make it to my 10 months and was put on furlough.  Told when to do overtime.  And also cut hours to save company money.  It doesn't pay the bills.  Also the benefits were less than adaquate.  And that would be if you made enough money to even go to the doctor or dentist.
good,"Typical day involves completing a return for an average person and trying to get them the maximum refund possible and offering products. Depending on the type of return, you can learn a variety of things inculding how to treat different items, during the inetrview process due diligence is very important. Management was acceptable, did not possess good management and communication skills. My coworkers were awesome they helped me whenever I reached out to them. Trying to get information from clients to ensure the return was accurate was probably the most difficult. The most enjpyable was seeing the smile when clients knew they were getting a refund."
good,Made phone calls to employees to get their availability to sign them up for classes. Also had to contact prior clients about payment for prior years taxes processed.
good,I worked for them for 2 tax seaseons and not even half way through the second they stopped putting me on schedule and didnt even tell me or give me an explanation. Managment is horrible they don't really manage anything they look at the receptionist or other workers to maintain and manage everything for them while they reap the benefits.
good,What I enjoy the most is the people I have interacted with. Management can be better. We just underwent re-structuring and made everyone uneasy.
good,i prepared income taxes for customers. it was seasonal and i found out after working there that they hire first year people but rarely keep them on i was very dissappointed
good,No job is secure there. all branch managers job was lost the year I left. 5 years ago it was probably the best part tme job anyone could of had. Like anywhere else the ecomomy has hit and cuts had to be made
good,"Scheduling Appointments, Filing, Answering Phones, Serving the Customer & The Tax Pros."
good,Setting appointments and answering multiple telephone calls
good,"my work day consist of Answering phones,making Appointments and Managering the office."
good,Only work 4 months out of the year and had to pay for your own training.
good,"Employees with experience were not allowed to use their prior knowledge, strict procedures to follow knowledge base created by two very immature young men."
good,"It’s only seasonal,some weeks you may have to work lots of hours some weeks you hardly get any hours! I love doing taxes,good job for extra money! You usually get minimum wage but at the end of the season our office we got a bonus minus our weekly pay for a certain percentage of the money you brought in"
good,Stressful situation because work is performed on a commission basis. Fellow workers do not play fair in assigning new and/or existing clients equally among the tax pros.
good,I am looking for something with benefits and longer term . I love working with different employees and different store locations . I did learn some marketing   skills .
good,"it was very stressful due to the nature of the business.  You are messing with peoples taxes and if you make any kind of a mistake, you just sent them to be audited."
good,"In the amount of time that I am able to work there, which is only Friday nights though Sunday evenings from January through April, there are not too many clients that seem to come through the door anymore.  The managers that are leading the offices tend to be open and honest and will work with the people in their offices."
good,"I learned to work with not only taxes, but also with data entry, payroll. I did not like the district manager who I worked for. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the district manager, many people would say she was half out of her mind. Other wise I did enjoy what I did."
good,"Working at H & R Block was enjoyable because I was able to work with numbers. My job duties included doing tax preparation, and administrative work. Overall it was a good job, but with long hours."
good,I love helping people so this job fit me. The management could be more professional but otherwise the job is fine. It is the best job to learn about taxes.
good,"I worked for H & R Block full time 2 year-round. Great tax resources and training. I quited because of high stress. Poor teamwork, very competitive, disrespect each other. Office manager yeiled in front of every one. Senior tax pros kept taking clients from other younger tax pros, especially high pay clients. Office manager kept taking walk in clients to compete with other tax pros. Very stressful and toxic enviroment."
good,"I enjoyed working at H&R Block very much I was the front office Represetative. I made appointments, took payment, answered phone, and all other office functions."
good,"It was a interesting job, for the short term. Would be great for an accounting student. Its not nearly long enough to support yourself all year. And there are a lot of courses to take in the off time to keep you current in the new tax laws and changes. I'm glad that I learned a few things from it. But its a lot of work doing the homework with no pay for a seasonal job. Not a lot of taxes going on in the month of March and I had a really good Instructor. Not enough benefits from it to make me want to do it again."
good,management and pay was horrible. didnt get paid for hours worked and when brought up missing hours was told that i had to wait until next period. schedules were always changing and management was too relaxed at times and really didnt know what to do
good,This is a good part-time job because the hourly pay is not high enough to live on but the work is rewarding and challenging.  My office is run well and the manager is supportive.
good,"I loved working there. The staff were like family after just a few days into the season. "
good,"Build clientele for H & R Block and sell their products. For $12.00/hr."
good,"Great place to meet new people and do their returns. The location I was at had great knowledgeable workers. "
good,"upper management is focused on production/$$, middle management is in the middle, office management changes every year, or keeps the same managers because of difficulty in finding them, no matter how they manage the offices."
good,"For tax preparers it is a seasonal job. There are opportunities to work off-season, but the pay goes down to minimum wage and there are limited hours available. Culture depends on the office. If there are new employees , the culture is created within the office. Mangement does not micro manage. Hours are very flexible but if you dont produce tax returns, the pay goes down. You have to take tests every 2 years to be able to be rehired."
good,Working for H&R Block taught e a lot about taxes. I have not worked there in over nine years. I may learn taxes again just to benefit myself. I am not interested in working part time.
good,"It varies greatly by the office you work on and the area designated as well as the season you choose to work there. During Tax season is very busy and there is  lot of support although sometimes it seems to be the minimum effort put on tax returns. "
good,It can be  great place to work but have to be prepared to deal with individuals who are unhappy that they owe taxes. Staff and clients are not happy with management who are now putting more emphasis on selling products rather then taxes.
good,"I enjoyed working at Block, but they don’t pay very well. The training is exceptional and there’s a good sense of teamwork. I’d say the biggest downfall is that it’s only seasonal."
good,Ok place if you want seasonal work. Pay is low. Was not given enough hours to work or be given enough clients to work on. The company pushes the other products to much
good,"This company provides really good training to prepare income tax returns. The workload is very low, mostly part time hours. Supervisors on the sites are random unprofessional people."
good,"Atmosphere was nice. I enjoyed interacting with the various people I met. It was sometimes fast paced, but it was good. I learned a lot about taxes and felt comfortable enough to be able to do my own taxes"
good,"Work was stressful doing tax return after tax return. We had too many training classes, none the less they were offered and we were obligated to take so many hours prior to employment. The culture was what the management made it. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people. The most enjoyable was giving someone  that deserved it money back. Having them return year after year."
good,"Offices are micromanaged from district manger on up to ceo in kansas city.  All decisions are made from a distance in kansas city.  No knowledge of client base, economic climate of towns, cities or state only bottom line wanted by stockholders and what hq thinks to do to assure that they receive the dividends and options that they desire."
good,"If is great for peer support, management is somewhat out of touch with employees. There is such pressure to sell products and services to the clients that are unnecessary,  products that come with the standard guarantee."
good,I would prefer to just be able to service the clients that we as Tax professionals have built relationships with.  HR Block has a lot of additional reporting and product pushing that they require us to do in order to determine how we are compensated.  This should be reviewed.
good,Overall I really enjoyed the job.  At the end of the season (only one season job) my hours were cut.  One girl was getting all of the hours.  I wanted to work but couldn't get the hours.
good,I ended up not getting put on the schedule for enough hours to make it worth me paying for the gas to get to the office from my home during the tax season. Training was good but you had to pay for the classes before they would hire you.
good,If you like being managed by spreadsheets this is the place to work.  Hired with autonomy to run my district and all that changed.  company is trying to find its way in a changing industry.  Plans always changing.
good,Definitely a stepping stone for experience. Seasonal work. Independent individuals highly recommended to apply. Prefer corporation owned office over franchise owned offices.
good,Nice place to work just very fast paced at times and some very un-cooperative clients.  Hardest part was telling the costs of the returns to some as I knew them and knew they didn't have it.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my staff, managing two tax prep offices. I did not like the pressure of being forced to become a certified tax professional, managing multiple offices AND being responsible for all the marketing efforts. Having managers wear too many hats makes them ineffective overall. Also I felt the process around anticipating seasonal business was very short sighted - brand new preparers who are only allowed to prepare 1040 EZs are not going to be able to replace the business previously brought in by bi-lingual tax preparers of 20+  years."
good,"they put a lot of focus of education and learning more to be better at your job, it was required but there was more available if you wanted to learn more than the bare minimum to advance. they were very supportive."
good,"I enjoyed my first year with H&R Block, it was a friendly and a learning experience.  Everyone was excited to help one another at anytime.  My Manager was always helpful and gave everyone the tools to succeed.  My second year at H&R Block was completely different.  A new manager who knew very little about our department and it showed.  Make a decision one week and the next change the decision back to the original.  I found that where I worked in HR, we were not allowed to inform associates as to the reason(s) they were termed but these people were told we had they information, we weren't allowed to divulge the information their Manager or Surpervisor gave supporting information of reason for termination."
good,The management at HR Block is awful. They rarely are in office and are hard to get ahold of. People rarely show up for their shifts and their are no consequences
good,"Good people to work with. The Tax pros are great people to work with, very professional. However the pay is very low, I believe they under pay their employees. Specially the 1st years and the CSP."
good,The staff I managed became more of a family than coworkers. Being it is a seasonal job we did not see each other for months. When the season began again it was like a reunion.
good,H&R Block is a place to help others and make a little money.  You will have to have a lot of patience and good customer service skills.  You will deal with a lot of personalities.
good,"This was an interesting job that allowed me to use many of my skills' The work and people were interesting, talking with clients was very enjoyable and informing."
good,I love my job with Block.  I am paid well but there is absolutely no benefits package.  I was sick and had to call off work and was unable to make up the time I lost through sick leave or pto.  Great place for a part time job but not full time for sure.
good,"Pushed for production, overbilling customers, Loved the clients but there was too much confusion from management. No clear direction. No set procedures."
good,The hardest part of the job is learning the tax laws.  I found it to be very interesting.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and helping people understand the tax laws.
good,"This was a part-time tax seasonal job.  I enjoyed working at this company, but was only employed during the tax months.  I enjoy working with numbers."
good,"It's not great when it's super busy but it can be OK sometimes. When mandatory OT gets started and the calls come in back to back, though, it gets rough."
good,h&r block for me was only seasonal. but all and all it was a nice place to work to earn extra cash and also get new skills when it comes to doing taxes.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal tax preparer, my hours varied by the flow of clients. In January when its still slow they made everyone make cold calls and try to book appointments. Once March and April hit we were opening at 9 am and closing at 8 or 9pm"
good,"worked part time as a receptionist. not very difficult. Sometimes the tax agents can get fussy, but if you are nice to people they will be nice to you"
good,"A typical day included preparing federal and state income tax returns. A wealth of knowledge was learned regarding tax exemptions, deductions and various form requirements. As a multi site worker, the flexibility was fun and each office felt like visiting family."
good,management was bad. Some of the employees didn't care about clients just the money that came in for them.  Management would leave us hanging and not take care of the things she needed to take care of.
good,Doing someone else taxes. Had to be extremely fast to get any type of bonus.Had to take online classes during down time to advance. Had to be a people person as well as a salesperson.
good,This position was implemented as a pilot position. Constant changes and lack of consistency with upper management make this job hard to navigate at times.
good,"The culture of the organization is very harsh.  If you are a contractor or a seasonal associate, you get treated like second class citizens.  "
good,"H & R Block is great when you don't need any benefits. However, if you require health and dental insurance you will have to pay for your own elsewhere."
good,"Enjoyed working for different clients everyday.  Met some nice people.  Unfortunately, no opportunity to stay on with the company on a permanent basis."
good,I was in between jobs and this was a short term fill in. Work is easy for some people. the only issues is when someone was not getting as much of a tax refund as they wanted and they would be somewhat rude to the workers.
good,current management is unskilled and lacks motivation and does not seem to support staff.  Pay is pretty horrible for the complex situations that we encounter.
good,"Over all Ok. I was miss lead however on amount of working hours."
good,"For those specialist that have been at location for years, you will notice that clients you pre-booked suddenly disappear. Management seems to not care, only about what they are doing. Some employees do not have ethics."
good,Increased responsibilities for more offices.  Travel has increased and time spent in area decreased due to travel.  Hiring seasonal workforce is a challenge.
good,"While I have a fantastic office manager at the local level, his boss is a difficult person to work under, and his boss is even worse.  The job itself is great - my regular clients are fantastic, and we catch up every year on how their lives are going.  But the nonsense that comes down the chain from HQ is ridiculous.  They rearrange the schedule our office manager sets in order to comply with some impossible objective, scheduling people outside their availability (which is in the computer system for all to be able to see - there's no excuse for this!) and leaving us shorthanded.  District management has a total lack of respect for employees, and routinely threatens to fire people."
good,Knew going in the door it was a temp position and no chance for advancement as an associate.  It was nice to meet all the clients and work with some of the employees.  It was a relatively easy position
good,only like certain types of people: straight married with children and grand children if old enough; gossip but just listen to anything anyone has to say about a hardworking person and then harass.
good,I started with block at 16 gave them 6 years part-time and 12 full time. Loved Block until I was laid off even with a good year of projected numbers targeted plus more as always.
good,Pretty much you work on your own. Management is not approachable and the pay was too low. its hard to work in the invironment that make you feel not welcome.
good,The job was hard to learn and considering you have people money in your hands and if you make a mistake it could be bad is very stressful for what they pay. And they hire so many people and don't give any hours.
good,"enjoyed working there but need more hours/ higher wages . single one income. meet lots of people. experience in fields as administrative assistant. all cultures and walks of different poverty . answering phones, cash, cheques, administrative assistant experience"
good,"I love working for HR Block but I do not feel that this company have my best interest because:"
good,"Tax Professionals fight over clients, in some offices management does not even know how to prepare taxes. Most managers in my district are the race as the district manager."
good,"Although it is a flexible job, the wages are not compatible with the responsibility. Good opportunity to learn and practice before starting applying your knowledge."
good,The Windsor district has a hard time keeping good employees. They do expect a lot from people without providing appropriate in office support for new employees. Scheduling was a mess
good,Greeting clients and preparing individual tax returns. Long hours. Most clients are not sure of what they are able to deduct and what they are not. During tax season the amount of individuals at times can be overwhelming.
good,I've worked @ HR Block on & off since 2005 to the present. They work isn't hard. you should be comfortable dealing with the public. Too many managers are NOT good with the customers. The pay SUCKS. they make way to much money to pay such a very low scale.
good,"I am a current (seasonal) employee. This is basically a part time job. If you enjoy meeting and working with people then it's cool but, It is very low pay with no benefits. It can be a little tricky in the position of CSP because the Tax Prepares kind of are in competition with each other with who does the most returns so, they can be a little back biting and petty. "
good,"A easy flexible job Only part that sucks is its seasonal and part time, definitely cant rely on just having one job while working here. But all together good company and great experience."
good,"A typical day at H&R Block would include preparing Federal and State income taxes. Each day is different, each client is different. You learn how to read people and help them with their situation. You give tax advice to clients on what they can do to improve their experience for the next tax year. It is only a seasonal job."
good,"I work in a franchise.  All the top level Management seem to be from the same family - making it difficult to see  yourself really being promoted very high.  "
good,Company not organized .Tax preparer compensated very poorly.Most employees are not really qualified to work .You can tell that there is lots of confusion.
good,"Even though I enjoyed my job in its essence, I did not care for the unprofessional management and sales system. I was asked to return under different management, but could not due to the fact I had just had my baby."
good,"Tech's were hired for the season. Many dropped out before April1. Which resulted in a burden of 12 hours a day 7 days a week. The work load increased exponentially and the quality dropped significantly. The pay was adequate with OT, but I would not do it again."
good,Very competitive culture.  People are scrounging for leads and clients when they walk though the door.  You have to know your co-workers well enough to know who won't cut your throat.  The best part was helping people get huge refunds.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this position was in aiding customers with little knowledge of the tax world, and seeing the smiles when return was completed to their satisfaction."
good,"Fun to work, direct client interaction so its a Good way to build client relation, but pay is very less for a well qualified person & its seasonal job."
good,I enjoyed this job because of the people I worked with. I also enjoyed the challenges that this job would bring. There was never a boring day!
good,"A typical day at HR Block is answering phones, preparing federal and state tax returns, taking customer payments & dealing with customer issues."
good,"Office Leader is given number of hours to work with 2 - 3 at the same position. The max I had was 15 hrs or less a week. Occasionally I had more at peak but not much. One of the benefit was having our tax preparation down for free, now they will withhold taxes based on the amount of the return, they deduct from paycheck. "
good,Love the Clients and doing the best I can to maximize their return and improve future investments and compromises. Very knowledgeable and considerate.
good,Its really good when its fast paced. Sometimes can be a bit slow. I think that they should do background checks since people are handling personal information.
good,"I enjoy working for this company, I was able to learn more on accounting and working with a diverse population from different countries and cultures."
good,Typical reception position. Very easy friendly people. It was a great experience. I was excited because I got a free tax prep that would have costed $500.00
good,Management should have provided more training. Great job once you know what your doing. Hardest part of the job was telling clients I am not qualified to answer their tax-related questions.
good,"The majority of the professionals were friendly, helpful team players.  The training received before starting my 1st day of full employment was not well presented or informative enough."
good,"Getting trained, a schedule and keeping my hours steady was very difficult. I was switched to 3 locations before I finally got settled and then it was impossible to get my schedule steady. Won't go back"
good,"I enjoy my role as a Client Services Professional. My only disappointments are that the new office in which I was hired to work in never opened, so I have been working in a different office; however, due to the new office never opening, my hours were drastically cut. I am not making it on the few hours I get to work @ H&R Block. The pay for my position is only $8/hr, which would have been okay if I had been working regular hours in the new office in which I was hired to work in. So I have been very discouraged and scared, and I have been actively looking for full time as well as part time jobs and am desperately trying to find something ASAP."
good,Enjoy working with fellow employees and love helping customers. It as a seasonal job. Pay was low and job was only part time.
good,I would work in the evenings after I worked my 8am-4:30 pm shift at my other job.  I also would work on the weekends from 9am until 5pm.
good,The company pays for all your training and classes. The hardest part but yet also the most enjoyable part is the clients and learning something new everyday.
good,"Good part time job, but difficult hours especially if you have young children."
good,"This job is great for ether someone that needs work experience to add to their resume or a second job. In my opinion, it dies not pay enough to survive but what you learn in a lot. You learn how to interact with customers, handle cash and answer phones. "
good,"Typical day includes tax preparation in office environment.  "
good,"enjoyed meeting and helping people, learned about new soft ware and tax laws,"
good,"enjoyable job with nice customers, easy boss to get along with"
good,"You only have a job in tax season, After April 15 you job is finish with the company and you have to wait till next year."
good,Very seasonal and not enough hours and pay to meet my basic needs.
good,"Fun work environment."
good,"As a manager for H&R Block each day was full of stress but very exciting.  My day consists of coaching employees of key behaviors.  Checking daily close out material from previous day, watching schedule in case adjustments are necessary.  Posting goals and expectations for the day.  Client service , in person and on the phone.  "
good,"Greeted clients and met their needs. Answered telephone scheduling appointments, setting client up with proper tax pro, kept coffee available for all incoming clients, filed for manager and proof read forms she requested for filing purposes."
good,They temp agency is good to work for. They do try to make sure you stay on an assignment and if one ends they will do what they can to get you right into another job.
good,I liked this company very much. Unfortunatly it is season work.
good,very busy and a great staff team you can also get overtime in another office.
good,"Provided technical and troubleshoot assistance through remote desktop and server connection, e-mail and on the telephone"
good,"Everyone busy in the office and no one wants help you. Do not expect you will get help right away when needed. Management just set the gaols and look on the numbers only, but not on service. Co-worker can become crazy if they just focus on commission. Perfect software can make your job enjoyable."
good,"Great part time seasonal job. worked here for 10 tax seasons. Liked most of the people i worked with. Great training to be tax preparer, cpoyer etc.Money wasnt great but I alwys had second income."
good,"Check in at 9:00 a.m. sign in on computer and wait for the client to arrive. Answer the phone which will be constantly ringing. print out forms, assist the tax professional."
good,Overall I liked working here. Management was strict but very helpful when it came to questions about the job. There really wasn't anything hard of the job but the most enjoyable part was when I was able to tell our customers their tax refund was higher than what they expected and were very happy and satisfied with my services.
good,Company does great when it comes to educating employees on taxes but its all downhill. Pay is minimum wage and impossible to make comission because managers take all the clients.
good,"Alot of times they are short staffed so you end up taking on a few others jobs as well as working for your money. The pay is really bad so if there are only a few customers you are working for under 4.00 per hour. Also while there are no customers they have you clean walls, floors, shelves ect. They really do work you hard."
good,if u like dealing with angry and impatient people then this is the job for u. seasonal position with ability for alot of hrs
good,"When I started, I was able to do my online training from home, with pay ($8/hr). They paid for the PTIN and I was scheduled in an office less than a mile from my home. Then next tax  season, a new manager took over and all the above changed. I was expected to work a different location. I had no vehicle. Training was now onsite only."
good,"I did not agree with some of the corprate practices. I felt the pay was very low based on my job performance and experience. It is my opinion that this company charges far too much for the products and services they provide, resulting in many unhappy and unsatisfied customers. As an employee that was responsible for collecting payment, this was not a pleasant working environment for me."
good,"The job is not too bad. The pay is not that good considering the importance of the duties. The co workers are pretty nice, upper management is inconsistent, its hard to take them seriously."
good,This company provides training geared to better serves the customers and comply with tax law. Taking care of our customers is a great value and one of the pillars of this business.
good,"Pro: They will hire you without past experience, training provided, and you get to work quite a bit during the season."
good,I feel unsupported at times and felt new rules were made specifically for me that were not enforced with other employees. I feel higher pay could benefit better attitudes of employees
good,"Can be Fun If you are under the right management/supervisor"
good,"In the Hendersonville, NC office once training and testing was complete, there was minimal continuous skill training or performance review.  The office was very fast paced and could be stressful."
good,"I found the work to be challenging but I did learn a lot. If you want a part time job for 4 months with 2 months of training, this is the job for you."
good,"It is what you make it out to be. It also depends on what your goals are. If your looking for part time work for additional money this is o.k. But, if you are looking for fulltime career you need to make a plan and stick to it."
good,Typical day at work included scheduling tax prep for customers. I learned about data entry for tax forms. Management was layered. Culture was highly stressed and fast-paced. The hardest part of the job is learning the scripts. The most enjoyable part of the job is scheduling people and greeting them when they would come in.
good,"The company is divided in two districts within San Antonio area, and I only have experience with the East Side. "
good,very flexible with schedule  this is all I have hopefully it will help Most everyone is helpful and patient. Great job for few hours 4 months of the year.
good,"Refused to hire back Csp’s from previous seasons, regardless of longevity with the company. "
good,Tax season you never know when you are getting home. Lay off after tax season. Company ensure no OT. Limited amount of earning potential - expectation of knowledge not taught by company.
good,"This position seasonal and therefore you work for about 2.5 months"
good,At least in the area I am in -this company has poor management and the employees run the show and are allowed to disrespect management and office leaders. Office leader job is a farce.
good,"During tax season, which is the time that H&R Block hires is the very busy time. I worked here during the slow months in AT&T and kept busy working late at night until all the customers were taken care of."
good,"There was never a dull moment when I worked at H&R Block. My coworkers were always a pleasure to be around, extremely friendly and helpful whenever I had any questions. My manager gave a reasonable amount of independence and autonomy with her subordinates, which prevented people from feeling like they were being micromanaged."
good,"I found the tax preparation job to be very stressful and even with yearly training, the changes to the tax laws made it a difficult job. The receptionist job for H & R Block had it's good moments, and bad moments. Our office was very fast passed for the first month or so and then would die down to very slow. I was in charge of making appointments, handling walk ins, doing filing, answering phones, cleaning the office, and pulling the prior year returns for 6 to 8 tax preparers. It wasn't a horrible job, but it was a seasonal position from Mid January to Mid April."
good,"H&R Block had a to several week course before tax season that cost around $100.  It was helpful for training and knowing to expect on the job.  I passes the final exam with no problem and was assigned to an office that had available jobs.  The employees were a great help when I was new and had questions.  Tax forms chance every year and we had training sessions on the changes.  "
good,Awesome manager but they do not pay people what they are worth. They do not offer longer employment then 3month out of the year and have zero benifits
good,I had fun and enjoyed working with superiors and co workers alike.  The atmosphere is good pay is not.  Wages need to rise in Nova Scotia.  I would work here again if the pay was fair
good,"I like working at H&R Block, it was a temporary part time job. I was able to meet and provide service for a lot of different people.  I like being able to let the customers know what was available for them and help them understand the process of processing tax returns."
good,Seasonal Job but a fairly good one. They offered training if you wanted to do taxes.  I enjoyed the secretary role more but that was just me.  The hours are flexible.
good,"Front desk was rough, you had to deal with the shady deals that tax preparers  made for the customers during peak season. Basic office work great for someone looking for something temporary/part-time,recommend for college students."
good,Advertising creates a difficult tax season for regular tax clients. Advertising creates a difficult tax season for tax payers because advertisement leads clients to online services.
good,it is a great place to gain useful experience and a wonderful company to work for. managers are all friendly and helpful. would definatly like to work there again.
good,"Typical Day: Always busy"
good,"I choose not to provide any comments at this time because I have been hurt very badly by the management.  "
good,"A typical job will be at the office answering the phone lines with questions, set up appointments, interviewed clients to process income taxes, verifying documents, processed loan applications, requested income transcripts and assistance with audit services. Promote and marketing the company goals and values. The hardes part of my job is that it was a seasonal job, I would work full time for 4 months and then I will be on the schedule only as need it 3 times a week."
good,"It was very short period of time but there was trouble from the beginning when somehow my personal information did not get entered into the database correctly so my check was late. That was really a nightmare to deal with. It started out bad, it didn't get much better. Some office drama. But it was seasonal and I really needed the job for my family."
good,"Like most people who give bad reviews, it's not the company that's the problem, it's the people and management within. It's not uncommon for management to act and feel ""entitled."""
good,It was good work except for alot of rude customers going crazy about their taxes. It was an easy job. I did both calls and chat. Not sure if I would do it again.
good,"Just like Block Advisors, it is only seasonal position but office is open all year. It makes it very hard to get another job after working here for just a couple of months."
good,H&R Block is only a seasonal job.  Outside of the tax season there is not much opportunity to work. The customer demand appointments are not a good way to earn money.
good,"Good commission pay if you work as the 3rd year.  It's a nice job to deal with clients to help them to resolve problems."
good,"Relaxed work environment"
good,Each day is very different with meeting new people and constantly learning new things and problem solving. This is also the hardest part of the position.  Taxes are ever evolving.
good,"This is a great job if you don't need a steady pay check to make ends meet. The schedule changed from day to day. The hours were great during peak weeks, but during non-peak they dried up."
good,"All the downsides of retail that are born by employees are present for the Tax Pros at Block. Little support from staff or management. Staffing is neglected, management is absent. Extra duties are added like bookkeeping and housekeeping and telemarketing because Block is too cheap to pay for services or staffing. Pay formula underpays Tax Pros for the revenue they generate. Up sides are scheduling flexibility (if you are firm against pressure to add shifts/hours), relatively laid back work environment (not stuffy or uptight), chance to learn a lot on the job and develop client relation skills by preparing many returns."
good,"H&R Block is seasonal work. A lot of pressure at times due to time limits of business . Overall, not bad for a couple of months work. Compensation could be better for all."
good,"it's a seasonal job. the general public is uninformed on tax topics and forms and are stressed. meanwhile, tax preparers must sell additional tax forms to customers. these extra forms are often unnecessary."
good,"•	Interviewed clients to obtain further information regarding taxable income, deductible expenses and allowances."
good,I would work 4-5 hours in the evening and all day on Saturday.  I had a large client base which came back to me every year.  I also helped train new preparers.
good,"A typical day was to open the store make sure coffee is made, register is open to use, computers are on store is ready to go.  Co workers would normally bring in treats for each other. Everyone was willing to help each other.  The environment was relaxed and excellent to work in.  Everyone got along and was there for each other.. The store was never left alone meaning there had to be at least 2 people at all times to cover one another.  Respect went both ways...on everyone's part.  This is an excellent place to work however the only down fall is that it is seasonal and no long term definition for the average office worker."
good,"Overall being with the customers was the best part of the job. I didn't interact with others I did my job and went home. Some managers were very rude, an had their picks an chooses."
good,"H & R Block is a company that is all based on profit, which is not to the benefit of the clients or employees. The pay is low, the position temporary and the employees are undervalued."
good,"I have worked at two different offices for H&R Block and I can honestly say, your experience depends on the manager.  My first office was great, everyone got along, the manager was always there to assist and help.  The manager was also thoughtful, and understood that everything that comes from corporate is not in the best interest of employees, and so would always advocate for us.  My second office has been terrible, the manager ask things of employees that she will not do herself, such as working on Sundays or closing and opening back to back.  She adds continued stress to the day to day work, but assists with nothing.  It has been horrible and this is why I am not returning next year."
good,a mixture of slow paced work followed by a frenzy of people trying to get their taxes done. manager was flexible but demanded too much during peak. The corporation office is too greedy
good,"Call center position. Mandatory overtime.Very strict work and time environment. Most management was the best part of the job.  Supportive, knowledgeable, down to Earth.."
good,The different jobs that I had at this company gave me a variety of great skills that can definitely further my career. I enjoyed building relationships with all the different people that I have worked with over the last 7 years.
good,"An H&R Block Associate takes a Basic Tax Course, with it is a  mid test & final test.  Year after that an Associate takes advanced classes and refresher courses due to laws changing in your state and federal tax laws."
good,This company has very flexible hours. They offer tons of financial support and informational tools. My manger was not the best in customer service though. Her management and people skill was very rude. The hardest part of this job was trying to meet the company individual goals in order to get a bonus at the end of the season. The most enjoyable part of this job truly you get to do your tax returns for free. I would not recommend anyone quitting there full time job to work here the pay is horrible. I only got paid $8 per hour my first year as a tax associate and was only offer $9 per hour my second year as tax specialist .
good,"I enjoyed the people, learning new systems and my coworkers were very friendly and we all got along very well. The hardest part of the job were the issues in the office that I worked in."
good,"The job was a temporary position. I was excited to work there, but it was stressful and confusing. I started office as a Office Manager and ended with the job title of Receptionist."
good,Seasonal tax preparer.  Company is amount making money rather than serving clients.  They have a great product but need better management.  Managers do NOT know taxes.
good,"Great work environment and settings"
good,Fast paced office work environment. Its only part time seasonal position. Customer service with a smile is key! Customers can panic and may get rude but don't let it get to you its a very busy tax season.
good,It was a Seasonal position. Wish I could have been hired. The hardest part of the day was when coworkers at my job level preferred to socialize when I preferred to do my job duties to prepare the office for when Clients came in.
good,"This is a taxes preparation job. The staffs are very nice, but he customers are not. Sometime they lie to you to see if they can get the best and large refund."
good,Difficult to obtain supplies. A lot of the decisions made do not work in real life. Computer program used for preparing returns was not compatible with most other programs used in the office.
good,"I love my job at Block and the office I work out of is fantastic.  Not happy the way employees are treated by management, and way too much favoritism!"
good,"Not a hard-core environment. When not busy could read a book. etc. to pass the time. The tax advisors were very nice.  If I needed time off for a doctor appointment, I'd just tell her before she made the schedule."
good,"This position was great for anyone looking for just part time work. Though there may have been opportunity to become a tax preparer, I did not look into that."
good,"The manager keeps a lot of items that should have been shared with co-workers.  I prefer not to answer this part.Sometimes it was enjoyable.  But with the changes, it is no."
good,"When we were a franchise it was fun."
good,"its a good job if you have a full time job and want to make extra money. love working with my clients,  Need better office leaders and more experience tax professionals"
good,"The staff around are incredible, if you can find one person to get along with, you will have the time of your life. If not well lets just say the stress and anxiety will probably get to you by the end of the year."
good,The company offers free training and an individual can go as far as certified tax preparer. Excellent in house training. Excellent Marketing and promotional opportunities to get entry level experience. Excellent customer service opportunities and training.
good,"Working for H & R Block during tax season can be busy at the end of the season, slow at the beginning. Lots of learning done when it comes to the way taxes are handled in locations such as H & R Block."
good,"Tax season is a stressful time, working at a tax office during that time can be very stressful. It tended to be a lot of trial and error, even with the training at the beginning."
good,The CEO putting more emphasis on attachment sales than service and preparation revenue has hurt the company as a whole. Need to return to primary value of tax prep as primary purpose.  Attachments secondary.  Attachments do add value depending on client needs and should be offered to all but not as a rating of the tax pro. Some clients do not qualify to purchase an attachment.
good,"Work with Spanish speaking customer and assist in the tax returns. "
good,All I can say is that the only enjoyable part of the job is working with the tax accountants.The manager was new to the branch and felt that I was not working up to his capabilities. Most of the job training was answering questions on the computer and very little time in an actual working environment.
good,A very relaxed environment but as times could be very busy as others it can be very slow.Co-workers are friendly and it's an easy way to make money since its only seasonal.
good,for the most part they are a good company to work for. I had a really good office manager that I got a long with. But did not get a long with the owners wife she had a tendency to put me down as well as others making it hard to work for her.
good,Working at this job you are the first person costumers see you are also the person that gets to get things taken out on when customers are not happy..
good,I worked as a tax preparer and managing the processing center many many years ago.  I am sure the entire process has changed since I worked there over 31 years ago.
good,"I used to have a great deal of respect for the Block mission. However, in recent years they have become overly focused on sales. I believe this has been to the detriment of both clients and tax pros. Discounts, coupons, and other gimmicks are used to attract new clients, while prices go up for our regular repeat clients. I've lost many long time clients these past two years because their returns have become too expensive."
good,"In my view, the issue affecting the company most is that people have fundamentally changed the way that they prepare taxes, and the company has not reconstructed its business model to adapt to these changes.  As a result, the client base is dwindling and aging, and younger taxpayers do not see the justification for the fees that are charged, as opposed to DIY software,"
good,"If you are not in a local office with a manager that promotes all tax preparers work together and help one another, the work atmosphere is poor.  There is a lot of pressure from upper management to make certain sales numbers each day, yet the pay for seasonal tax associates is terrible."
good,the taxes are the easy part of the job.    had problems with management changing schedules the day of or the day before a shift.  not scheduling appointments inside of available hours. cliens were nice but the management made it hard to enjoy the tax season
good,"Zero work-life balance.  You have only 3 1/2 months to earn so you must work as many hours as permitted before getting laid-off."
good,"management was awesome, vey understandable, the most fun was always eating together the food that the manager would make and doing the filing and paperwork for taxes was enjoyable for me"
good,"If you like to meet people, assist people with the financial and tax questions, then preparing taxes is a great place to be.  I like this as a part time supplemental job to earn more money and be able to schedule my own hours."
good,"I enjoyed the coworkers, however management was too focused on marketing and amount of money made per return rather than assisting customers. I joined the team in hopes of helping customers, instead the focus was profit, profit, profit and upselling several unnecessary products."
good,"If you work at it and put yourself first, plan, sell, you can subsidize your income. Block takes most of the pie tho, Company is becoming must more professional at the corporate structure and support level locally the staff is hit or miss"
good,"a typical day at work is very fast working, what i lender is daily new cases every day, management cant complain about it, hardest part of job its getting new challenges every day, the most enjoyable part of the jib is having co workers help out with any part of job if you get stuck"
good,"Its a great place to learn how to prepare taxes, make a decent salary, have fun and meet new people. You can learn a lot and eventually start your own tax business."
good,Learned a lot about the tax laws and taught classes for the beginners.  The management was not reliable for the last 5 years or so.  The co-workers were easy to work with and train.  The hardest part was passing all the testing for the IRS.  The most enjoyable was getting to know all of my clients year after year.
good,Worked busy time for taxes and off the rest of the year.  Enjoyed helping clients learn to prepare for the next year and also to utilize all possible deductions.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block is this:"
good,"Prepare returns for clients. Balance cash drawer at the end of the day. Prepare bank deposit and take it to the bank. Typing, filing, answering the phone, and questions."
good,my co-workers were a great bunch of ladies.They were funny and always try to help me to be a tax professional.  The hardest part of the job were learning all the tax laws
good,H&R Block is a good part-time position. If you are looking for a position to support yourself or family you will need to look elsewhere.
good,"Every year there is a new management team. This makes it very confusing for education and knowing what to expect from year to year."
good,"Typical day consisted of preparing tax returns for clients. I learned to prepare tax returns that were complex and challenging. Management helped only when they wanted to. Hardest part of the job was having to ""sell"" products that did not have anything to do with preparing taxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping returning clients each year and meeting new clients, also."
good,"My experience at H & R Block has been for the most part enjoyable. My staff is very professional and I have learned a great deal about tax law these past two years. However, for all of the tasks associated with being a client service professional (receptionist), the pay rate it not worth it. There is also a lot of pressure put onto you by management and corporate officials to advertise and sell their products. There is also little to no growth in this position unless you become a tax representative. At that point, it is still very challenging to grow. This is an alright job for seasonal workers or those looking to get some side income if you're going to school (as I am) but it's not something you would want to do for years to come. The stress associated with this position is not worth it."
good,"H&R Block gave me the opportunity to regain receptionist experience, answer multiple phone lines, manage reception area and appointment calender"
good,"I only worked at H&R Block during the tax season (February to April 30). "
good,The atmosphere with the other employees is always fun. They are upbeat and caring. They will work with you if there is a problem and make you feel like family. You learn to work with other employees and customers.
good,"Ideal for learning to prepare taxes and for a part time, seasonal income.  Convenient for part-timers, students, retirees, and self-employed individuals looking for tax knowledge and additional income."
good,"Preparing income tax returns for clients.  Establishing relationships with my clients on a one to one basis.  Unfortunately, the hardest part of the job is not being able to satified clients tax return outcome.  In other words, clients that had a balance due on their tax return."
good,"There might be days you might do only one tax return other days you might be doing 3 or 4 in hour. My office had great co workers, heard about other offices that are not professional"
good,"Good training, poor follow up.  Poorly used scheduling system and work notification.  Everything is up to the organization level of the office manager."
good,It was a great Job. loved working with the clients and would like to do it again.hours were 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to saturday. for three  months. As it was my first year i was restricted with the level of paper work. I was more frustrated when my CEO then held me back from getting work done because she was busy. She is not there now.
good,I had help people with their taxes. Different forms for different situations so I was always learning something different and new.
good,"enjoyable part: a client leaves overjoyed since you found more refunds that did not know about."
good,"H&R Block was fine.  I was hourly as I was a new associate, but once you're in the field for more than three years you are 100% commission.  "
good,This was a seasonal job taking calls for tech support. It was a great learning experience and I was able to experience a call center environment.
good,"I signed on as a seasonal receptionist.  I am working irregular hours, 6 days a week but still only 39-40 hours, so some days are short and some are 8 hours. The pay is lame."
good,Learned tax information that was helpful for my personal taxes.
good,Learned a lot about preparing taxes. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed tax season with H&R Block in Talihina, OK...I would have enjoyed a better rate of pay, however."
good,Life work/balance difficult. Client service focused. Performance based.
good,Company became more interested in sales than in tax preparing.
good,Get lots of clients as a first year tax pro. Paid decent as a younger person but not as well if you have many bills to pay. Definitely make a lot more working as self employed doing taxes but it is hard to get as many clients.
good,Assisted new and previous clients' with completed his or her yearly tax return. I learned how to complete different type of federal/start tax return - Example. Clients with social security income and business income w/ expenses. It was important the office work as a team to assist the clients more effective.
good,"Met alot of great people."
good,"Seasonal positions"
good,"Great work environment"
good,"Learned how to deal with clients, tax preparation skills, good work environment"
good,"This is a good job for someone that just wants sonething to do or wants to learn about taxes.  You cannot live off the income. You need other employment. This is a cut-throat position where other tax preparers might still your clients.  It is only seasonal.  Your commission is based on a 300 return completion with which I found unrealistic unless you have a large client base.  When I started there was no on-line testing. Testing was done all on paper.  You have to pay for classes, gas, materials, IRS tax preparers number. I think the cost out weighted the benefit."
good,"On a typical day at work, we would place calls to clients and schedule appointments for them to come and get their taxes done."
good,"I was the District Bookkeeper doing Accts. Payable, Payroll, & all Regional & District reports. I learned to handle multiple offices in this job and gained payroll experience. This is the first District title I had and the coworkers were very nice, even in a fast paced tax season environment. Sometimes my 12 hour days proved stressful while I was pregnant with my daughter my last year there, but management backed me up to help with large work loads. The off tax season reduced the stress for the bookkeeper after long hours 7 months of the year. "
good,Good seasonal job...didn't pay enough though...very flexible
good,"A typical day at H&R Block was very overwhelming at some times. You have to make sure you keep the clients happy and very understanding of their needs. As, well give them the most accurate information and what they should expect."
good,"This job is seasonal. Pay is not commensurate with the level of work. If you enjoy working with people and having flexible work hours, this is nice job."
good,"A typical day at work would be busy, it was tax season and I was only there for a couple of months and I learned alot. I learned how to file, greet customers, fax and organize. Oranization was a big key in this company, taxes and file folders can not be lost. The hardest part of my job was the stress level of it. Customers would be stressed because of tax season and some people wouldn't have any patients, so I'm going to be completely honest it was a hard time handeling that preasure, but besides that it was an alright job. The co-workers there were fun to be around and very friendly."
good,"There is a lot to be said, I enjoyed my time there."
good,Helping people deal with their taxes. Harderst part of the job is to explain to people why they have to pay taxes on their return. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see people smiling and thanking you for doing their tax return.
good,"Opening day with flag ceremony, report to unit command for assignments. Working with other reservists to get the assigned task done or by myself, reporting with work finished and getting new assignments."
good,Great training program. Probably would have picked a different office.
good,I have prepared taxes since completing a course in high school. I received certificate of completion from H&R Block after completing their tax preparer course. Worked on a part time basis while attending graduate school.
good,The company focuses strongly on the clients which is a very good thing.
good,"It's a good place for student who want to gain experience on tax. I have learn more stuff at work than just studying in class. I enjoy spending time in the office helping clients. However, the compensation is minimum for 1st year associates. Also, the advancement takes years to come. The commission they promise is confusing. They give you either commission ""or"" base salary. So you either work yourself off to get clients or just settle down with the base minimum wage salary. There has been a lawsuit against this policy going on right now. None the less, I've learn what I need to learn."
good,"helped clients with easy to complex tax returns. enjoyed the clients, helping them get the best tax return legally possible. Didn't like the fact that we were required to get more clients every year and then the company hired more tax pros and then the new tax pros would try to take the established tax pros clients.. push push push get more clients.. but yet not enough work space for the tax pros we had why hire more?"
good,"H&R Block provides excellent training in tax preparation and in business management, marketing, and customer service techniques. Must be willing to build a client base in order to provide tax preparation services and to market H&R Block products."
good,Good people great learning experience the company micro manages every step if the way.
good,"Great service and dedication from tax professionals however being a seasonal job.. for managers & receptionists high turnover, low pay, no benefits, but overall honest place of employment"
good,"Very stressful job with not enough hands on training when new tax rules come into affect."
good,"Working at the front desk, your best wasn't ever good enough for upper management.  It was unnecessary pressure from upper management. Even the Tax Pros were pressured to perform and increase productivity with previous and new clientele."
good,I would say it is a great place to work until they changed. The management once they changed who was the site manager it ruined everything other than that it's good place to work
good,Great knowledge base however wanting to push their products on the client. Instead of focusing on the tax experience. I feel they should get back to basics .
good,"Fun work environment ."
good,This company has the culture of most corporate giants. There was a lack of consistency when it came to training. The work you put out was not compensated sufficiently.
good,You constantly learn new things.  The fellow workers are very helpful a lot of the time.It is enjoyable to meet new people all the time.  It is difficult when you don't know the answer to something.
good,"Good coworkers. Funky managers are enough to make you run. Help! Flexible shifts. Clients great, but ones didn't get refund. Busy day poppin' fun job!"
good,"Pros: "
good,"Tax preparation is a very intense environment during the primary tax season from January through April 15. For rest of the year, office operates on abbreviated schedule depending upon client needs. I enjoy the tax preparation process and the interaction with clients. It is personally satisfying to help a client with their tax issues. No two clients are alike. Every client has there own unique set of tax issues. Position requires a working knowledge of the constantly changing tax regulations and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve the clients tax issues."
good,"some parts to the job are not ideal but if you enjoy people and helping them, you will like the work"
good,"Excellent training program for anyone who wants to do taxes.  Management gets in the way in their scheduling with an overlap that forces a tax preparer to change desks when other person comes in."
good,It was great to meet new people and learn new things about the company. financial learning was great good until new changes from other locations that were not from military towns and did not understand new clients moved yearly
good,Tax preparations and tax planning.  Dealing with client on there tax needs with forms or schedules.  Answering questions on the new tax laws.  Handleing itins for people who there spouses have working visa and in needed of itin for tax purposes
good,"I felt the pay was low compare to the revenue being brought into the company.  For people also working another full time job it was difficult.  The managers pushed you to work more, and the day shift looked down upon you because it wasn't your full time job"
good,"Co workers at Specific location they are great , free tax return  for employee and family is a great thing   , i wish if they Kept front desk  People during Peak season.."
good,fast pace for a short time other staff friendly. good place to work for extra money seasonal employment you could choose the hours you wanted to work  most  years I worked you had to be available to work peak  time about 8  hours total you wanted more hours great
good,"Good opportunity to start up in the tax field. Good work environment but stressful too, especially  on busy days  (Jan 30 to beginning of March ). friendly and helpful work team"
good,"I enjoy my job, but I don't always agree with management regarding customer service. I believe that we should do what is best for our clients. "
good,"Typical day at work is messy and quiet ; rules always changing; never a set schedule, you do learn more about taxes as the tax season go further but the hardest part of the job is accuracy , if you make a mistake it affects everything . Do not try t be your manager friend either. They stop after tax season is over. The manager can come and go as she pleases but make rules for your break like you a child."
good,Office manager is a great boss and tax professionals are enjoyable to work with.  Enjoyed the job and the work. Wish it was a full time job with this office manager.
good,H&R Block was my first tax preparer when I started my first job. I have been loyal to them since. They are really good at making sure the tax preparers are updated on all new tax information. I enjoyed working there. I left to work a full time job. I still do my taxes with H&R Block using their online software.
good,"While there's little job requirements to start, there's no advancement opportunities for employees. "
good,"I would love to work for them again seasonally unfortunately they did not have any openings at this time."
good,"I am grateful for the knowledge, training and Education "
good,answering phones setting up appointments that is all for the retail position too many restrictions and rules installed and changed on a daily basis when it gets busy thats when you have to stick with it and stay focused
good,The pay was not commensurate with the duties and responsibilities. Too high of expectations with little money to show for. The work is seasonal so it is not sustainable and it leaves you with seven months of little or no work at all.
good,Seasonal business means you have no life from December through May if your job involves supporting any of the income tax software products used by preparers or consumers.
good,If you enjoy having the summer off this is the job for you.  You have the freedom of working during winter and then being off in the summer months.  This is beneficial for those with children and/or who enjoy summer travels.
good,"Your days vary, especially dependent on your location."
good,Company was OK as a whole but different locations have different management issues.  I happened to be at an office where the employees did not work together good as a team.
good,learned how to better do taxes and how to help others on tax issues. enjoyed seeing the same clients from year to year. being able to help others save more at tax time
good,"Fighting amongst staff, hours not compensated properly. There was a lot of confusion on who did what. No help when needed and favoritism."
good,"just not for me, different management and different issues and no one to ask question about the problem. too much favorites in different offices and over all."
good,The company tends not to follow labor laws such and breaks and lunch periods. Also they ask you to put in your committed days and hours when you apply. Once you are employed that goes out the window. They schedule you 7 days a week some times 12 hours a day and frown on you if you complain. 
good,"Some offices are really nice and cooperative that work as an office team. Other offices are more cut throat and will try to steal clients to get ahead. And other offices will try to break your spirit by using racial slurs and personal defamation to break the moral of others out of spite. This region has all office managers split between two offices and have multiple company managerial meetings so sometimes it is hard to get a hold of the manager if there is a problem. But if you get a manager that cares, they will try to keep communication open between all employees of both offices. "
good,"A good business model that will, unfortunately, disappear due to tax reforms."
good,The company offers a flexible schedule and continuing education to their employees. The continuing education is the best part of the job because it gives you an opportunity to develop your career.
good,As a whole the company is a great company. The office I worked at was personally owned and the owners were not the kindest people. I would try a different franchise however.
good,"A typical workday begins with an early arrival at the office by up to 30 minutes to:"
good,"I worked for H&R Block for parts of 3 tax seasons, and I enjoyed the work.  Most of your time is spent with clients, and as you gain experience, you often gain a client base for future tax seasons.  I originally took the tax class for personal reasons, and stayed on as an employee for the prospect of future discounted classes, but I enjoyed the interaction with clients.  I did not see a lot of pressure to sell specific products, but the pay was based on revenues generated. I eventually stopped working for H&R Block because the district office was disorganized and I ended up working without pay when they could not get my payroll information processed even though I had been there for 2+ years."
good,"H&R was changing management when I joined. The ""new"" rules at that time were strange and hindered productivity. New employees would be given accounts that were outside their skill level and even be made to take over a secondary office giving the new clients the feeling we were unprofessional."
good,"Several different tax preparers made it sometimes a bit competitive, however most of the time they were gracious about the appointment of customers.  Some tax preparers are more experienced than others."
good,"Good work place , good management and training but low salary payment. branch manager and the tax professionals in all levels receive the same salary that is not fair."
good,"The manager I worked under at H&R Block was very unorganized, she did not pay me for my training, as a matter of fact she made me do all my training at home on my own computer, but she paid two other women for their training.  Also the manager failed to make sure that the receptionist knew all of her responsibilities, we were being taught by other people in the office that had been their longer."
good,"Was hired as tech support, quickly found out that tech support was also in charge of customer care since they didn't have a separate call center to handle those calls."
good,"I enjoyed working this seasonal position. Nice people to work with. "
good,The system utilized for scheduling clients is unreliable. And the time restraints for the calls are stressful. One is still expected to make a call less than 7 minutes.
good,"OK, but would like a better comp structure...very closely run and managed with the shareholders' interests in mind first...run according to the numbers, but perhaps the industry is headed off a cliff"
good,"Greeted people as they cane in, talked a little with them til they were called by tax preparer. Answered phone, made, rescheduled, canceled appts,  When customer done took payment for serviced."
good,Fast paced and not for the faint of heart.  Management is inconsistent but employees help each other out.  Get to meet all kinds of people when preparing taxes. No two returns are alike.
good,H&R Block is a company that's fine to work at as a foot in the door but it doesn't offer great advancement chances.  I would describe it as the fast food of accounting chains.   As long as you go in with your eyes wide open it's a good introduction into accounting but once you've learned the basics you should look to move on to better operations.
good,It's really hard to advance at H&R Block. Everything you do will be repetitive. Majority of the workers there are petty. It seems as if they do everything backwards.
good,"Typical day consisted of manager calling multiple times demanding tasks, and if present he was hovering over the shoulders of employees. Making everyone in office including clients uncomfortable."
good,"Overall good place to work.  Most management is good, there are a few bad ones, but overall good.  Tax season, and the ramp up to tax season are very hectic."
good,prepared taxes all day. you were either busy or slow when slow you did not earn any money. everyone was competitive for the clients which made for some hard feelings between co workers at times.
good,"It was a learning experience. I believe staff needs more time to become proficient.  "
good,"H&R Block makes sure their new CSPs have all the information they need to be ready for their first day on the job. The thing I don't like is they consistently change how they want you to do things as simple as appointment confirmation. I'm okay with change but there also needs to be some stability in the way things are done. H&R Block is an okay place to work, but in my opinion, I wouldn't work there with career goals in mind."
good,"When I first started in 2003, it was a great place to work. I was able to pick my own availability and had great leadership. The industry was booming and we had lines out the door. As time went on our marketshare dwindled and it became very difficult to make any money for the hours required."
good,It can be stressful to work there.  But you can meet new people.  I like helping them.  I work as the receptionist.  Need more hours.  Pay is very low.
good,The company seems ok.  I am part time seasonal employee.  This is my first tax season.  The staff are friendly but at times seem protective of their clients remaining their clients.
good,"H&R Block only makes money about three months out of the year: during the tax season. So seasonal employment makes sense for the tax pros and CSPs in the local offices. It is the nature of the business."
good,"Depending on when in the season you will either be calling on previous clients, Marketing to get new clients or fighting with other tax pros to get the walk in client first.  During peak times of the season you may be busy and then have it dry up."
good,"I thought this was a great full-time, permanent position but found I was only working until a past worker was re-hired. I was very disappointed as I looked forward to learning more than I already knew about preparing Business & Personal Income Tax Returns using the H & R Tax "
good,"Its a temporary job where you can learn the basics of income taxes. The great part is they give you training, which could place you in a full time job if you continue training."
good,"Huge responsibility for tax preparation;requires a lot of learning.Might be hectic sometimes and always work under customer's pressure."
good,"During tax season it can be hectic."
good,"Arrived early morning started coffee and got office ready for the work day. Answered telephone, waited on customers, set appointments, shredded papers end of day."
good,"A fast paced environment! You can learn something new with every tax return you complete. H& R Block has great tools and classes to keep you update in your position. "
good,While it is advantageous to work convent hours it takes several years to make sufficient earnings.  Senior Tax Professionals who have been in office for more than 10 years tend to make the expected income as they have acquired the clients from Tax Professionals who have left.  Thank goodness it's only 3-1/2 months a year.
good,"I prepared taxes for single individuals, and for not complicated returns, also did filing and weekly reports keeping track of the types of complicated taxes that were done weekly"
good,"Great first job opportunity for a single mom in college, I did not have many options and it allowed me to get work experience and earn money for my family."
good,Top level management has changed multiple times in the past decade which leads to standards that are not kept uniformly. Top management has no experience in every day work.
good,"There was constantly one employee stealing another employee's work, or else abusing priveledge to steal from clients. Managers didn't know how to handle this, which is why I resigned the company."
good,"This was a good job, it was very stressful at times, tax pros competing with each other for the clients. I was happy with the hours I was given. I enjoyed greeting the clients."
good,This is a good way to earn some extra money if you like doing taxes and meeting people. I enjoy seeing clients from a previous year come in and catching up with them on the significant events and changes they have experienced during the year and helping them work through the tax implications.
good,Seasonal employment with low wages for skills required.  Theey do provide good training and updated skills training on a year rounnd basis.  Enjoy interaction with clients and seeing clients who return year after year.
good,Had a good time helping those in need of completing their income tax returns. Was able to teach clients how to optimize their tax returns for the following year. Had many return customers.
good,"Typical shift is completely booked solid with appointments every half hour. In which time you are expected to interview the client and extract all the information required to complete their income tax return and complete the return, "
good,"First year review - minimal salary, flexible schedule, great branch management (varies based on location). Manager was extremely understanding and flexible with scheduling - even with last minute changes. Office environment was friendly. Salary makes it impossible to make a living. Even second year salary is $9.50 plus commission with a draw - which basically means it's commission only. I'm almost done with my enrolled agent certification and will be exploring other opportunities."
good,Management's knowledge of my work was limited. I was not challenged all the time in my work. The hours required to get the job done in tax season were not appreciated and just expected.
good,This seasonal job was a great experience and if you want to earn extra money through the tax season. It can be cut throat with other preparers for the most part.
good,It is a great company but poorly managed at certain locations.  Management is not a constant. Pay structure only favors associates that have many years of experience.
good,The co-workers were great to work with and very knowledgeable and helpful. Feel as if the company machine itself just looks at its employees as someone to crank tax returns out for them.
good,Sit in booth for 6-8 hours a day answering tax questions and doing taxes for clients. Management was willing to help and so were the co-workers if there were any questions. The hardest part of the job was some of the tax forms. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the friendly tax clients.
good,"you would prepare taxes for clients and some would be easy and other hard but with experience you get to learn how to do the harder returns, the commission sucks!!"
good,"You need to be able to deal with extreme stress,multi tasking,angry clients, angry coworkers. "
good,I really enjoy working there. I learned a great deal working with some very seasoned tax preparers.  We got a new OM this year and she was awesome to work with.
good,Salary is too low.  Not efficient in customer service as well as to its employees.  No benefits.  Schedules are flexible though according to their availabilities.
good,"When I worked for this company, things were good, except when I took ill with pneumonia at the end of tax season and because of that they chose not to hire me back the next season."
good,"I held a seasonal position. My job duties changed from day to day. There were to many managers and lead people, and they did not have much organization."
good,"I had several excellent office managers during the six years I was there.  This job was very busy and I enjoyed working with the clients.  "
good,I enjoyed working with H&R. The hours were great and had a great pay rate.  I bonded with my co- workers and was able to create a great atmosphere. The work was challenging and interesting and I was able to grow my brain.
good,Learn about taxes but not a source of income unless you have more experience and your own client but it is a good start and keep you updated with the tax law
good,It was a nice place to work. The pay for a receptionist and the work asked of me was acceptable. Work was usually stead. Everyone I worked with was nice. The only downside was that the position was only seasonal.
good,"A good place for non-accountants to break into the individual tax preparation field and for people who don't want to work year-round."
good,Block is like many corporate cultures. You burn the candle at both ends. A ton of work gets done but it is not always strategic. Advancement can be tough as the company is always cutting back.
good,"This was a very intense job. The provided a lot of training to learn about tax situations. You could advance several levels a year, after working the initial year."
good,H&R block was a great company to work while I was in school for accounting. You will have a lot of clients which allows for exposure to many tax issues.
good,"This was a low-pay, low-demand job assisting the HR manager.  Small office, insular environment, detail work.  I did enjoy conducting phone interviews and training follow-up."
good,"hours varied, usually worked 20-30 hours per week,  occasionally was called in to work when someone was ill or unable to work"
good,They are great at what they do and I believe in the products and services they provide. The office management is Amazing as a team! It is a fantastic company for seasonal employment.
good,This is a seasonal position. Great for extra income after the holiday season if you can pass the tax course you will do good here.
good,H and R block is an ok seasonal job. Don't expect to make much money and if you don't make a bonus expect to have you're pay lowered to minimum wage. They are normally short staff so expect to work doubles. DO NOT WORK YEAR ROUND.
good,My manager was awesome! I liked that they pushed me to do more difficult returns that I thought I couldn't do. They had confidence in me when I didn't and after I saw that I cold I was so proud of myself.
good,"H&R Block is a very good company to learn to start. From them, you  can learn a lot, from professional knoweldges, software, cultures, to professional mannus, they will teach you everything. But somehow, the pressure is high, and you have to adapt with."
good,Depends on the location where you work. Some locations are relaxed and some are like factory. They company under pays well below market value and the commission is laughable at best.
good,"Clocking in and setup new folders for clients appointments.   Check with the tax professional about how to manage their appointments for the day.  Pleasantly answer the phone while setting appointments for the clients with the tax professional of their choice."
good,A heart for public service has to be the forefront when working for this company. They are not partial to many perks or fringes that I know of. The team that I have worked with for the last 5 years have been amazing.
good,The new management has no experience and is set to become a failing company. Loved my co-workers but there are many of us not returning this year due to the way it now pays and the attitudes of those in command.
good,H&R Block is a good place to learn how to prepare tax returns and interact with clients. However due to the nature of the job the work hours and employment period is casual and seasonal.
good,"I enjoyed working at H and R Block World headquarters in KC,MO It is a great place to work if your into taxes and helping your co workers and assist the millions of customers in need for tax help.  There is a lot of opportunities there."
good,"A typical day at work involved me opening up the office, checking voicemails, booking appointments and trying to accommodate as many clients per day as possible. The hardest part of the job was just trying to keep up with the busyness of peak during tax season to make sure each client was served on time, and being the only one running the office was a of of responsibility but I appreciated the experience and I learned a lot and enjoyed it"
good,"Its great for people that love a challenge, but it is a challenge. People are great to work with. long term type job for the good fit."
good,"* I managed the store in Polaris. "
good,"Lots of work to keep you busy."
good,Minimal work life balance both during the season and in the post season. The company goes through a restructure almost every year.
good,"Manager is a little way too laid back"
good,"Very nice job security, lot of projects to work on, Good learning growth but Compensation and benefits are less. Minimum Compensation given, growth is very slow."
good,A quiet place to work. Not a busy or fast-pace environment. Coworkers aren't very social or pleasing. Tasks are extremely easy to get a hang of.
good,"A lot of training, a lot of responsibility, yet there is room to learn and grow.  Lots of gray area with taxes!  There is support from other associates, but commissions are cut throat!"
good,This position was seasonal and seasonal employees are not treated well.  HR Block is behind the time in a dying industry.
good,"You can pretty much set your own schedule, it is temporary tax season and some part time during summer. "
good,"Great to have worked for a company that had amazing potential for advancement, The daily interaction with people from diverse cultures and the people that i worked with were more that willing to help should you have any issue to discuss. As for management, federal and state laws prohibit speaking of that issue."
good,The hardest part is dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable is delivering a good product for customer and making sure that they are happy with results.
good,Look to see who you have schedule for the day if you have any open times you can take walk in or call customer to set appointment. The day would run great it depends who is working that day. Some employee keep up mess but some keep the office running smoothly.
good,They provide systematic training before tax season starts but the on-job training is not sufficient. Good start as a junior tax professional job
good,"Tax season can be very stressful when computers go down and you have to revert to paper returns on the end of the season."
good,Typical day was helping people out with their taxes. Would help them depending on whether they wanted to do office return or online.
good,"•	Prepared tax returns for individuals"
good,Always have done taxes.  Like learning the new yearly updates. I learned a lot every tax season. Met many different people each year.
good,"I loved working for H&R Block. It was a wonderful experience, and I do believe it helped me succeed in education. Lots of people from different walks of life, always meeting different clients with different needs, creates a great learning atmosphere and most tax professionals with more experience are very helpful. Only employed for 4 months, as tax season is only 10 weeks and the pre-season training is minimal. I would go back, but unfortunately was time to move on and explore more career focused opportunities."
good,"In Alaska I  worked over two seasons as a customer service professional, which is basically a secretary. I was place in the very busy district office but my fine skills promoted me to the premium office. The 3rd season I took the Block tax preparer course and placed 98% in my class and became a Tax Preparer. 2013 I worked for myself out of my home with the skills I obtained at H&R Block."
good,"I worked for this company 22 years.  Over that time I held a lot of different positions, from Data Entry Clerk, Editor,Assistant Supervisor,Messenger, Computer Technician, ending with the position of Office Manager.  overall I enjoyed meeting and helping others with their tax situations."
good,"the customers are the worst and very illed manner and disrespectful"
good,Great learning experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and processing tax returns. Taking  various tax classes was the best part of working at H & R Block.
good,"The people are wonderful!  "
good,"•	Greeted customer in a professional manner."
good,"H&R Block is a high past environment that company culture and dynamics has changed. There are plenty of meetings, and some travel depending on ones position. A typical day for me was a conference, meeting, project, presentation, event, emails, and travel. Days do differ depending on the short term goals set. The hardest part of the job can be the tight deadlines, the best part is the flexibility."
good,"Making and canceling tax appointments, asking general questions, preparing files for client appointments, answering phone all day, greeting clients, etc ."
good,"H&R Block is seasonal work so compensation, benefits and job security is not a selling point.  As a part time job there are a LOT of unpaid requirements like 15 hours of Continuing Education every year at a minimum.  Certification progression is also unpaid.  Compensation advancement is tied to certification progression so your commitment to learning more and more about our country's tax laws and policy is critical as well as time consuming. There is a lot of pressure to market (again unpaid) and bring in more and more clients as the number of returns you do in a season also determines if you will be hired year over year.  Management is constantly under pressure to keep under budget while doing more and more returns (??).  This pressure often results in management jumping the gun and blaming/pushing employees without bothering to analyze reasons or developing trends while looking at performance reports. The unending and constant pressure is easily the worst part of the job."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,Wasn't the best. Not a lot of hours offered. Before offering position they tell you a different salary.
good,"I prepared taxes for individuals during tax season."
good,"I learned a lot and I loved the people I worked with and for."
good,I was paid by hour. Job is seasonally. it is good to do as temporary job and part time job. No stable income.
good,"H & R Block is a huge company so prepare yourself to be a tiny man on the totem pole. Most of the positions are seasonal, so this isn't anything you'd do for a career. It was still a fun place to work, and what I especially liked is you tell them when you are available and they will work around your schedule. They are by far the most flexible place I've ever worked when it comes to scheduling."
good,This is a good company and they offer a lot of tax knowledge that you can apply to your everyday life.
good,"My primary responsibilities in this position are to greet clients upon their arrival, match them to the tax professional that best suites their needs and schedule appointments. I will keep clients apprised of their wait times by communicating with their TP's, stock office supplies, record information & file accepted returns as well as accept payment for services and handle client questions and/or concerns."
good,This was a cool job. I worked by myself and got a lot of things done.The co-workers were a riot. I loved the extra money.
good,I was able to carry my customer service experience over into this job. Allowing me to know how to greet customers and doing any clerical work that was needed.
good,"A typical day would be that I would show up in the office and work on my practice forms. When a client would come in if I were available I would prepare their taxes asking pertinent questions to get them the best return possible.  It was challenging for the reason that I was new and a lot of the veteran tax professionals received the most clients.  I enjoyed learning to do taxes however H & R Block was not the place for me at the time because i did  not receive many hours and was not able to support myself.  I opted not to return to H & R Block however, I still prepare taxes for family and friends during tax season."
good,"I like the ability to define the hours that I am available to work, because that allows for great flexibility around other obligations."
good,Seasonal job during tax season.  Co-workers were great but I found the company as a whole very disorganized.  Enjoyed working with the different clients and being able to guide them with their future savings/retirement.
good,I assisted customers in the preparation of their income taxes according to H&R Block guidelines. The work day varied but was constant during the tax preparation season.
good,I liked working with the clients. Enjoyed my coworkers and my direct manager was wonderful.
good,Work independently.  I enjoy the flexibility. There is alot of travel and most meetings are via conference calls.
good,"Spend 4 days in training and when you finally get onto the floor it is hardly anything like what you learn. You start off with one manager and end up switching to about 3 or 4. Co-workers are generally nice and polite to one another. The hardest part of the job is having to adapt to new areas of work that trainers didn't tell you, you were going to have to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the other people who work there. "
good,"Assist customers with complaints. Also help process orders for branches. I learned about banking, ie: IRA. The most enjoyable part is that we were rewarded for  our hard work. My co-workers at the time were very easy to get along with."
good,"I was blessed to work for this co. for 19 years.  The family I worked for was wonderful.  I was an office manager for 6 years, it was stressful due to the type of work we did.  I prepared tax returns for individuals and businesses.  I was also doing bookkeeping for several clients.  The best part of this job was all the clients I got to work with and grow care for greatly.  I love working with people and helping them with their tax and financial problems.   "
good,"Answered phone calls, scheduled appointments for tax preparers, cleaned the office, made coffee, kept the reception area clean.  I worked closely with the tax preparers, befriended them, and enjoyed my job.  I had a medical emergency in the office and they assisted me.  The hardest part of the job was scheduling because of loyalty.  Customers wanted to stay loyal, but other associates would take their customers because of time restraints.  It caused animosity in the office.  I stayed when others left because of lack of hours.  "
good,I enjoyed this job very much. I loved meeting new people every day and working on a computer.
good,"it was fun for a couple of years but the new managment brought not so positive changes, room for learning is great, co workers the best,company made drastric changes, noat good for the seasonal employees"
good,prepared taxes. helped other tax preparers. helped the public with questions.
good,"Arriving at 8:00 in the morning answering phones and assisting with clients questions and setting up appointments in the computer. The hardest part of the job was dealing with complaints. Working in a fast pace environment is what i enjoyed the most. Using my office, clerical and computer skills (Data entry, Word, Excel, and 10 key knowledge)"
good,"Assigned to an office that did not need the extra help and offers to move ignored. Good people but not people oriented,"
good,Must have been pretty good at it they opened up a new office on the eastside and ask me to operate it
good,The Management structure did not allow for awarding very good employees.
good,Built Customer Service Skills. Lots of direct customer contact.
good,"Comfortable atmosphere for employees and customers. The various levels of experience for the tax preparers makes for a very diverse knowledge base. Due to IRS compliance issues all the training for tax preparers will have to include the testing for future positions with the company. Their training is intensive and continuous. Peak, which is mid February, is the most stressful and customers want instant service and may have to wait for 10 minutes to an hour for service, but for the most part customers come out happy."
good,Flexible hours .... you can choose to work full / part time.
good,Pretty good place to work. Management is OK. They value work ethic above all else and this is what will get you promoted.
good,"Training with H&R Block is pretty extensive. If you have a real interest in the area of income tax, this is a pretty good place to get your feet wet. You will get a lot of practice preparing returns, honing your customer service skills and gaining experience in how an office is run. The drawback for me was the time committment. If the office wasn't busy, I felt like I was wasting time. I needed more flexibility. Otherwise, I enjoyed working for them."
good,You in to this job knowing that it is seasonal and that you won't necessarily make a career out of it. I learned a lot from preparing other people's taxes and for that I am grateful.
good,"New challenge for every cases different. Make sure did interview accurately with the clients to get a great result. "
good,"I worked the front desk, years ago when it was a Franchise operation and again in 2019.  I made coffee, cleaned the restrooms, then when the office opened I greeted the clients, answered the phone, scheduled appointments, checked in clients and walk-ins.  Accepted drop-off returns and gave them to an appropriate Tax Pro.  Processed payments for services, etc."
good,"Very good culture and approach but your direct manager can completely control and/or negatively impact the experience, as you would expect. Corporate challenge participation is high."
good,"This was a temporary position, so I don't really have much to say about it. For what it was, it was okay and it was very easy to acclimate, due to the sheer amount of repetitive taskings."
good,"fun place to learn about taxes"
good,I started my day at 9am and gave service to each client that cross my office's door and make sure they have the correct information for they tax preparation my day ended at 5pm
good,Learned a lot during the classes and the job was often  stressful; but wasnt paid fairly for the work.  A lot of good people quit to find better paying employment.
good,Worked there for 3 years the only good thing was I going on only when I had appointments really laid back but the pay is not good and for the 3 years there I was only getting paid mini and not that good comisión
good,it is a very fast pace environment to work in. multitasking is a very good skill to have when on the job. the co-workers are very helpful if you need it.
good,"I loved working here...one of the few places I ever felt liked I fit in. My co-workers were wonderful, and there was plenty to do when the busy season hit."
good,"Checking staff and client schedules.  Opening all tax portal programs to use.  Check on Manager, to see if there is anything need doing.  Check status of lodgements of clients."
good,"Initial training was great. Once in the office felt as though you were on your own. Took a while for others in the office to want to help the newer associates, even then you could feel the competitiveness."
good,"Recommend anyone seeking employment with H&R Block to apply with a local franchise owner rather than through Corporate. Generally, the franchise will pay better and there is more flexibility with work and dealing with your clients year-round. "
good,"Good company if you want fast paced,  long hours and few to no breaks offered.  My manager was awesome but district manager not great.  I keep going back just for income"
good,OK company. Some of the tax pros are to be desired.. I enjoyed a few ladies. It's really easy work. Just stay busy. Keep your head up. And I think the dm has changed. He was a sight for sore eyes.
good,"Taxpayers are delight to work with.  Frustrating work schedule, changes made too frequently. Pay not commensurate with skill requirements.  Corporate management  focuses too much on analytics."
good,It was hard working in the office I worked at because the people their were experienced tax professionals. The more clients you have the bigger your commision is so the old timers were only interested in getting the most clients they could get. They were not helpful friendly when a new tax pro had questions.
good,I only worked there for a short time during tax season. Unless you are a tax preparer you don't have many chances for advancement. Constant changing of employees was hard at times
good,Its a good place to work they just don't pay enough for all you have to know. They put you with clients that should be given to someone with more experience.
good,"Charge clients too much, pay employees too little. No incentives, no team building, not a happy place to work. Just come in do your job and leave. "
good,I working for H&R Block for over 18 years.  This was a good seasonal part time job working around my schedule with my full time day time job.  I would recommend this job to my friends and family
good,"I start by performing opening duties: making sure inside/outside of building is clean and presentable, turn on outside light and putting the sign outside, and making sure bank balance is correct.  The rest  of the job entails filing, taking appointments, cancelatons, and rescheduling .  I'm also responsible for maintenance/filling of copiers and fax machine. The closing duties are thwe same as opening duties."
good,I was there for only a short period of time. I cant really say much about H&R Block because I worked there just for a short period of time and I did not have time to learn to much about this employer.
good,It was so long ago i dont really remember. I had just graduated high school and that was my first job. It was good experience for it to be my first job. I was a relaxed enviornment.
good,"Every office is different. Depending on where you work, your coworkers could either be friendly and helpful or turn the office into a competition and a backstabbing reality show. "
good,"Call Center work is different in that sometimes you work directly for the corporation and this is the ideal scenario but sometimes you work for the middle-man and it's not always ideal or favorable. Bonuses, overtime, and incentives are great but base pay needs to improve."
good,Good place with a relaxed atmosphere amount coworkers. Location great to grab food and return quickly. Very self supervised flow of the office and great second income opportunity
good,A typical day would be getting coffee made for clients then sitting at the front desk answering calls /setting appointments. Didn't really learn much.  No hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Tax preparation, if there are no appointments or walk-in clients, the day will go very slowly. Going to lunch at the required hour is not always possible. Dealing with unhappy clients is a challenge."
good,"Productive environment, learned a lot about taxes and how they affect our lives.  Helping the clients  to understand their tax situation is a positive."
good,"It is a great company to have your taxes done here, but it was the best place to work.  Taxes can be a complicated process and the average american does not necessarily understand the process which makes them angry and irritable and difficult to work with."
good,"The job was fairly easy. You got paid minimum wage as a receptionist which I felt was fair. At my location, it would only pick up whenever it was closer to tax season."
good,"In a typical day in my last position tasks of opening and closing the facility as well as throughout the day including answering phones filing greeting customers appointments"
good,"This is a fast paced company, with opportunities for someone who enjoy working with the public and taxes.  There is training available if you desire to become a tax pro.  The job is stressful, but can be very rewarding."
good,More retail oriented than tax oriented.. focused on the low end of the market.. meaning little operational support for field preparers doing higher end business returns.  Generally staffed by nice people most of whom try their best.  A significant part of the field staff are somewhat insular and not inclined to work with other preparers.
good,The company is more concerned about getting new clients than serving the clients they already have and keeping them. The management at the district level is not in touch with local offices needs.
good,Work environment was friendly and Co-workers were helpful and fun to work with.  The supervisor was partial in scheduling work hours and distributing work. Happy helping customers.
good,"H&R Block is a seasonal employer for tax preparers.  They hold us to a high standard for education and update of current tax issues.  They have quite a high volume which requires us to fully prepared for processing many returns.  I work in the Paradise, CA office and there is very good rapport between our 9-10 preparers.  We are paid on a commission basis, a percentage of revenue, so your pay is based on performance."
good,While moving up in the company you have to fight for clients because more experienced tax professionals will take a new client off your schedule and put them on their schedule or another tax professionals schedule without consulting the manager. It has went down hill the more I have leveled up.
good,"Excellent team work, respectful environment and a good place for advancement. Low salary, but it is a really good experience to work in any company with a related field."
good,"Even though there is room for advancement, there is not many year long positions available unless you want to drive constantly. Pay is not great considering the risk you take every time you do someone's taxes."
good,The quicker you pass through their training to become a senior tax advisor the better. Highest commissions are here. You can take courses online during the off season.
good,Very busy most the time. Long wait times. People were nice. Could pick up extra hours if you wanted to most of the time. Management was nice and understanding.
good,You must like taxes and everything that comes with it. This was not the job for me and I would not work here again. There is a lot of change in the industry and they are still trying to figure out how to deal with the online services.
good,"The day start out with scheduled clients or walk ins, preparing state and federal tax returns. Answering phones and scheduling appointments. Filing papers, speaking with IRS daily. I learned daily that each clients return is different and lives are different. The management was great and the other employees were helpful and willing to help at anytime.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the new tax laws each year and the new insurance laws. I enjoyed working with this company because the owners were personable and very caring."
good,I liked it because of my major was accounting. You can advance But it is hard especially upper level classes. Too many misunderstanding with doing my continue education hours.management was terrible from corporate to the store managers. Prices are high too. But we are compensated well for the stress of continuing education hours.
good,"In H&R BLOCK. Since is a seasonal job, it was always busy and very different every day. I was always interacting with customers, helping them to receive the most refund they can get on the taxes. The environment was very competitive and the most educated you were the most client you will help."
good,"At this job everyday is a challenge because you learn a lot . Tax regulations and laws change frequently and we have to be updated. Besides, the daily basis work is very complex; therefore, every day is a challenge."
good,January to April primary mission is to prepare taxes.  There are online opportunities to improve your knowledge and advance as a Tax Pro in the off season.
good,"The job is fine, but the sporadic, non regular hours make for a difficult few months.  The pace can be extremely slow. The receptionist is expected to clean which isn’t a big deal, but you are required to dress like a professional then clean toilets."
good,"My typical day would be arriving to work looking to see if there was dropped of taxes for me to do. I would always help as many walks-in as I could for my own person daily goals, The people there were always willing to help me if I ran stuck which to me is very important since it was my first year with the company."
good,"As a first year tax pro, your hours are few and your pay is only hourly. However, for the couple dollars you're paid, you have a huge responsibility to the client because their taxes are their real life, you can't mess up- and to yourself because on every single return you do, you run the risk of finding a penalty that comes out of your pockets. It's like up to $1,500 per return if you don't get all the notes down or answer all the questions right. It's just seems like a lot of pressure to put on someone after they finish your mediocre tax course and find themselves over their heads in tax laws for 10 hours a week or less sometimes."
good,"Would give the location but I'm trying to be anonymous out here, lol. Honestly, the upper management are full of it. They've been taking advantage of the hood for tax purposes for years and pretend like it's not a thing."
good,"Previous and current job experience, dealt a lot with analyzing, researching and problem solving of medical documentation, provided by Patients or doc"
good,"This job is great if you're looking to gain a little more money in your pocket or a job to fill in between jobs if you're desperate. Training is time consuming but once finished, the job itself is relatively easy. Day is primarily filled with answering phones, scheduling and/ or rescheduling clients. Scanning and filing of paperwork that has sensative information. Completing client payments... Basic receptionist requirements and responsibilities. Fair warning on particular employees, there may be some disagreement from them if you're offered a full time job and you take it. Was told that it was ok to keep loking for a full time job and when an offer came, the office manager as well as another CSP became slightly disagreeable."
good,I pretty much stay bored.  I do not get very many clients and the office is not very professional.  You also have to study so much and take so many tests that it is not really worth it.
good,"I enjoyed this position because it provided many opportunities to work with the public, learn new software, and overall improve my clerical skills. I would recommend."
good,This job is really nice and it prepares me for my future in dentistry. I really like everyone and the job task at hand. Not to bad of a job. I would recommend to friends
good,"There is very lazy management culture on its front end while communication and collaboration is in a state between weak and non-functional.  The company pushes universal-plans for every aspect its business that create a lot of friction between upper and lower management.  Office managers and district managers should be ready to spend long hours to overcome discrepancies between national data and local data but virtually all managers seemed to think that they were not getting paid enough to do that.  Because there is no effort to collaborate or improve communication between two layers of management (corporate v. operations), fixing the discrepancies would have never been an option."
good,"I am having a blast working at H&R Block! I just don't appreciate it when tax pros get offended and rude because you accidentally moved their client to another tax pro. Some of them even hover over you when you're on Appointment Manager to make sure you don't purposely move their clients. Some of them repeat the same thing to you 4 times in 10 minutes like you're a mentally disabled child."
good,"I was part time, i honestly wanted the job to get more educated in taxes and help the Latin culture do there taxes easier for them. The workplace was ok, nothing specail. Honestly i realized  that H & R is for people that are retired and can work there."
good,"This is ideal for new comers to Canada or somebody who wants to enhance their taxation knowledge though classes and on job training. It will build solid foundations for the tax knowledge. The hours could be flexible but if you don't take enough shifts, you won't finish many returns for practical experience. The cons are that the pay is low for starting and the hours  sometimes are not enough at the beginning. Depending on office locations and the office leaders, the experience could be different. Definitely cannot make a living though it before turning to senior level. If you are only looking for part-time, this could be for you but you have to look for another job in May every year unless you are hired as year-round emlpyees."
good,The job was okay for a part time seasonal position.  I would liked to have had more time there to fully enjoy the job and the people more. I would liked to have also learned more about the tax business
good,"Good place just management had no clue what she was doing and had her picks. Good experience for front desk, learning new  job titles, The most enjoyable was time to leave"
good,I loved the people I worked with.  I did not like that we would always be low on office supplies and we limited to them.  But overall enjoyed my time working with the company.
good,"I love the people and the clients. Management is seasonally as are the employees, which makes it hard to make a consistent environment from season to season."
good,"Personal and Business Tax Preparation, Good Team Spirit in the office, Happy to see clients, good information, no advancement offered, Classes are good."
good,Always classes to take to improve you skills. Always new tax laws to incorporate into returns. Very fast paced environment in January when w-2's first come out. Hours are good during that month after January it really slows down. Great if you want to pick up a little extra money. You can schedule when you want to work which is a plus if you are a busy mom.
good,"I have an excellent office to work in, very laid back and a super office manager. It is an office with a total of five employees, and there is no fighting, back stabbing, gossiping, or competition with or about each other. I work in an amazing office!"
good,"Our department was alright, but never felt compensated in accordance with the on the job performance. Not an overall fan of the seasonal employee structure at the company headquaters. However, I could understand the reasoning for using the method."
good,H&R Block is in management turmoil as the CEO was forced out.  The new CEO will likely (and should) bring in a whole new team. They are struggling as the industry is moving to free.
good,"Office managers are very revenue oriented. They neither care about their tx professionals nor the clients. Tax prep fees are very high but nothing is done about that. District managers are very numbers focused that if you escalate about the manager, the district manager turns a blind eye. If not for the small money that they offer and wanting to hold a job, this is not a preferred job location."
good,The company was okay to work for except they don't handle  harassment cases well at all. nothing happened to the manger. which was a bummer. i would work for again at a different location
good,H&R Block is great as a second job or supplemental income. Hours are inconsistent if any outside of tax season. Pay almost always starts at minimum wage and expectations are very high.
good,"The office I worked for wasn't too busy, but every now and then it got really busy. Management could have been better, but the office ran smoothly even without the manager. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers who owed the IRS and HR Block, the most enjoyable part of the job was solving a customers tax situation, and seeing them smile."
good,Worked 20 to 30 hours per week. Enjoyed meeting clients and scheduling their tax appointments.  Worked all shifts and loved being back in the workforce.
good,"Middle management doesn't know what they are doing and treat employees like idiots. If you are salaried, they want you to spend long hours at the office so they don't have to pay an hourly employee."
good,"I worked for H&R Block right after taking the tax prep course. It was the most stressful 4 months of my life! I should have been given easy returns not the advanced ones, they really should have been filtered. Not fair to the clients!"
good,Company needs to support personnel more with better pay. Compensation has gone done but job requirements keep increasing. Upper management does not seem to be in touch with the customers we service.
good,"At this job here, it was very difficult to work with everyone due to the manager having specific favorites. She also was not professional as well. She would take behind everyone's back and then make very rude comments. This job is not as stable as I would like. It's seasonal, so they're always trying to look for somebody every year."
good,"As a newbie without any experience, they do let you take baby steps if necessary.  But are fine with someone rearing to go, to take on as much as they can handle. Suggest a willing mentor/coach as a go to person, but must be willing to do the research themselves."
good,"Opening Greeting clients, preparing paper and computer files for clients. "
good,"Management did not have a proper knowledge to operate "
good,"Meet a lot of nice people. Nice atmosphere, Easy fast cash as a short term secondary job. Schedules are complicated do to the fact that they are change everyday without notice."
good,"Staff is good to work with. Management seems to never be around or communicate on the same level. Other wise its a great place to work, during tax season is the busiest time and where you have to comment your time 110%. Sometimes personal family issues come into play or may inter-fear and management make you chose your job ( especially during peak tax season which isn't fair) Any other time of the year they are ok to work with"
good,I think the company needs to put more effort into help associates know how to move up in the company. I think the manager also need to listen to the associates more about the hours they can work and not push for everyday.
good,Good training.  Gain thorough tax law knowledge.  Learn good financial advise.  Need to update certification every tax year in order to keep employment.
good,It is a very professional and busy day at work. Clients come in with an appointment already or I would set them up with one of our tax professionals. I handled private personal information and files. I would also cash people out and file their documentation away. Sometimes we would see between 25 to 100 people with in one business day.
good,"Get your PTIN, learn what you can and get out. No room to advance enough to make a living here. Excellent work environment, but the pay is a bit above minimum wage."
good,"HR Block offers training and support for you to be successful as a tax professional. Your hours are flexible and you are responsible for marketing yourself. You can move up in the company with demonstrated"
good,"A typical day at work would generally include assisting clients in filing their taxes, filing the paperwork, and answering an tax questions. I enjoyed meeting the clients and learning new things. Some days were busier than others but it gave me good experience."
good,"I like working at h&r block as a receptionist. Easy pay, easy work, easy money, Schedule appointments, call previous customers, print out paper work for employees,& clean work area. Very easy job. I would work there just need to be more organized as far as the receptionist position."
good,H&R Block is the job that has only given me the time or day to hire me I been applying so any places and no luck. I'm so thankful for that. But I do not get enough hours to live on. So now I  have to look for another job. Other than that I do like working for them.
good,"I was initially hired as the Gainesville Office Manager, however, changes in the office schedule between the interview and start of tax season prohibited me from being available to manage on new the days required.   "
good,"Each day was on a normal basis busy, where customers would come in to have their taxes completed. Most of the coworkers were very friendly towards each other. Management was very kind and helpful at all time. I was given the nickname ""Iron Lady"" because of how hard I often worked. The hardest part of the job was having to help multiple clients at one time. The most enjoyable was having kind coworkers who helped each other."
good,"I liked this job. I worked only during active seasons for two years. I had a manager who worked with my schedule, but left the company when hours were cut."
good,Management isn't bad but they pay way too little especially compared to the amount of work they expect from you and things they expect you to remember to do on a daily basis.
good,"Provide great customer service, manage office and had very nice co-workers. Enjoyed the years working for the company."
good,"Preparing State and Federal Tax Returns, answering phones, open store and system, problem solving, and customer service."
good,I enjoyed working here because it allowed me to make a difference in peoples lives. I was able to show many clients how to retain or increase their refunds because over paid taxes.
good,This job is very flexible and great for part time and side job. It is seasonal job and only available for tax season and it can get very busy during peak season
good,Its great if you need extra cash and just want to get out the house. If you like meeting new people this is definitely the job.
good,I managed and did tax returns on a daily basis.  I believe that H & R Block has the finest education for tax preparation around.  Upper management is not always on the same page as office management and that is the most difficult part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and interacting with clients while preparing their very personal income tax returns.
good,Good for learning new tax law and to keep adding more customer service skills and knowledge each year. Enjoyable meeting new co-workers and interacting with new and recurring clients.
good,"great days, met a lot of people, most co workers were great and really nice to work with. The job is really easy nothing hard, the enjoyable part is the quiet time in between peak times."
good,"this employer provides little to almost no benefits and very paltry compensation - in fact, the pay is scandalous"
good,"it is ok doorway to other things"
good,"Good experience,sure helped me learn a lot and use it for my own knowledge. I enjoyed being able to help people."
good,This was my first job that I took serious.  It taught me a lot.  Great staff great supervision
good,Nice place to work for seasonal employment or if you only want to work 3 months out of the year.  CE is affordable thru the company but is slack on leadership after an advanced stage.
good,"I met lots of people and improved my people skills here, only thing I didn't like was that they need you almost every day for four months and then not at all until the next year."
good,Management was very helpful and so were my co workers. The hardest part about this job was all of the arithmetic involved the good part was that I learned a lot and met lots of nice people.
good,"- As a Branch Manager, leading my team, in my own office for the most part was a fun position to have."
good,"There has become a constant changing of direction in company senior leadership. This is hard for middle management and Tax Pros. Over all culture is good, pay and benefits meet the job requirements."
good,"Working in huge corporation like this, you meet many different people, experience alot of politics, etc. etc."
good,"Generally relaxed work atmosphere.  Good support from manager and other employees.  There is a lot to learn and know about federal income taxes.  Training is good, but there is a lot to remember.  Reference materials/books are available."
good,"A typical day at work included waiting for customers to come in to get their taxes done. Then completing the taxes when customers "
good,"I enjoyed working for H & R Block with the exception of the Office Coordinator. She wanted to be in total control, she scheduled her pets and dogged everyone else out. She took it upon herself to shut the office down early and give clients already booked to other preparers even if they were scheduled for me. She could not stand that I had a good rapport with my clients and it was a hard ordeal at times but I managed to finish out my season with minimal bumps and bruises."
good,"Delivered an outstanding client experience by creating a warm and welcoming first and lasting impression that exceeds the unique needs and preferences of each client."
good,"Block disables games on all computers which is a problem during the March doldrums when no clients call or come in. It has been run in the recent past by folks from McDonalds and Target. These people have a focus on clean surfaces and no regard for private information, so no cabinets at tax desks that lock for their clients, only in one area - the back room, where we have a mini fridge and a microwave since management says we can't eat in the other room. There is no place to sit in the back room, except in front of the Rapid Refund computer. The ledge is about 3 inches long."
good,"Seeing clients, preparing tax returns, dealing with co-workers"
good,Great company to work for but salary is low and tax season are overwhelming
good,"Answering the phone ,filing and preparing a diverse number of taxes."
good,Clients can be irate and demeaning. The job can be very stressful and overwhelming when it is busy.
good,I enjoyed my job and most of the people I worked with. We would assist clients by phone and in person. Both are at a very high volume daily. Most of the associates were team players. 
good,"Doing taxes was the best part of the job, management was okay, there was several transitions in this department during my time with the company. Interacting with the customers was nice, I learned to troubleshoot many real life experiences during my time with the company."
good,It was a great experience to learn and work with this company from preparing taxes to marketing
good,"Some days were slow and other days very busy. There were people to help you, when you did not know the answer. Co-workers were friendly and we helped one another . The hard part of the job is when clients were upset, when they called and you did not even know why. There were clients rude and they were using inproper language. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you had a downtime you can relax, breath and ready to take the next phone call. Not all my call were bad, I talk with a lot of patience clients, respectfull and at the end of our conversation they were please with my services. "
good,great seasonal job with low pay and high expectations. I enjoyed working with the co workers and management.
good,I love working here. I had some the most educated managers and was always willing to teach and in courage advancement. The most memorable part of all the people I interact with. I enjoy meeting new people.
good,I enjoy being a marketing coordinator for H&R Block. Its exciting and I am always on the go. The only negative I have is that my position is seasonal.
good,"Meeting clients, handling their taxes, finding returns."
good,"Very fun people to work with. In my position, I was the person who cleaned up the mess of business so that offices can keep on going. I had a great time here but the seasonal nature of the business was not advancement friendly. Great management team, productive meetings and family-like coworkers."
good,"I prepared federal state and local income tax. The scheduling was nice, most of the coworkers were great. Hardest part was learning everything."
good,"I use a computer at my workplace. I learned about tax credits and deductions. Some of my managers have been courteous and others not so much. I've worked well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job are the angry, hot-headed customers who come along once in awhile. The most enjoyable part of the job can be summed into these four words, ""an honest days pay."""
good,I liked working at H&R Block. I would do it again. I would get up and open the store.
good,Fast paced in the winter but really enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"Assisted clients with financial advice and planning while providing education on various tax deductions for the current and the future income tax returns. Prepared Federal, State and Local Income Tax returns and provided a second look for returns that where nonprofessionlly completed"
good,I would be doing general office work ranging from filing of respective clients' files to dealing with information that clients need to bring in getting their taxes done for that particular tax year. There is some downtime in working as a receptionist at the H & R Block Tax Office Branch location.
good,"greet customer, cashier ,light filing, light cleaning duties"
good,Loved working with clients and meeting new people. Learned how to prepare taxes for my first time.
good,"Prepared client's income tax returns and assisted with other financial needs. Printing of all refund checks, general office duties, and customer service. Excellent education program."
good,I learned a lot at HR Block and learned how to do taxes well enough that now I own my own company doing taxes.
good,"Typical Day - Consisted of coming in to your desk, getting all systems needed pulled up on your computer to start your day. Answered inbound calls, assisting clients or potential clients with issues pertaining to H&R Block. If the issue could not be resolved, then it would be escalated to a higher tier that could resolve the matter."
good,"High stress and low pay. You must be skilled in tax preparation including hundreds of hours in class. Also, your must be a marketer, loan manager, work in an intense environment under poor management for a rate barely above minimum wage."
good,"I enjoyed this job as this was very interesting to me, filing paperwork, filing taxes and just learning about taxes in general."
good,Everyboy is always helpful. I enjoy working with people in this office.
good,"H&R Block company itself is a very good company to work for, but when a subsection of Alorica company, it is pretty much a nightmare from start to finish."
good,Good for seasonal work. Flexible work schedule. Limited opportunity for full-time employment.
good,H & R Block gave me a chance to work independently. Serving the clients and satisfying their needs was a rewarding experience. The goal of perfecting customer service is the goal of the company. Customer Service with excellence was kept in the forefront of this company.
good,My experience at hrblock is great . Tax pros help and manager works with me when needed. Location not the best but a great experience for receptionist to start off .
good,"There’s a lot of studying, marketing. Plus keeping yourself up on tax updates. There were days that I went out marketing. I mentored new tax pros. Opening & closing of the office. Do clients tax return with the best of my knowledge & research. The company pays the tax pros hardly anything for the amount of responsibility you have. If there is a mistake, it’s on you."
good,"good job, was only seasonal, flexible hours, fair pay, discounted taxes, good office experience, confidentiality is a must, organizational skills required"
good,My experience was great. I was trained really well and the management team really care about the staff. It's a good starter job if you just need something to get by. It's seasonal so not long term.
good,"Company has been around since 1955 and was a private company. Company went public and is now a much larger corporation.  The main office is located in Kansas City, MO."
good,"The job is not hard.  You get a great opportunity to work with different people.  The schedule was very flexible and family friendly.  If you are only looking to make some extra money during the tax season, this is the job for you."
good,"This job is services the public.  You see a variety of clients of all income levels come in.  It can be very stressful at times, you either love it or hate it."
good,"It is seasonal work. When tax season is over, everything is packed up and removed. I was hired again to work in their head office one year. Just worked and finished more returns. Seems management changes every year."
good,"Very outgoing and encouraging. It pays to learn, Always looking for ways to market the company and bring in more clients. Its really great. I enjoyed the tax prep class, it was flexible with my schedule."
good,Typical day was meet the customer needs and seeing a smile on their face knowing I serve them well. It was all about the customer and making them happy.
good,"A great place to learn and gain a new experience. However, not the immediate management but the top-level management does not seem to be bothered with efficient staffs. Felt as if there are no progression opportunities and you are just a number."
good,"A typical day at work included me reviewing taxes and always interacting with the public.  "
good,"H&R Block has great values and ways of working, if you take initiative you can be part of a lot of new challenges and you can grow really quickly. Within 3 months you can easily gain a year of worth experience. It is up to your learning pace, development opportunity is there."
good,"My overall work experience at H&R Block was positive, due to two awesome managers, to whom I reported and who were always available to assist in whatever manner necessary.  As the company's systems of operation changed, one of my managers left the company, but my experiences remained very positive with my remaining manager's provisions of communication and assistance to enable our team's success.  However, as the culture continued to change, other levels of management became only concerned with communicating with a few (how the company's changes would affect specific current employees), which caused many to fall by the way. I often witnessed unfair, unexplained favoritism, which impacted team members and myself."
good,Nepotism abounds.  Was told my education in accounting did not help me even tho I've been doing taxes 40 years. They want dummies to do janitorial & answer phones.
good,Entire team works together to achieve the goals and targets that we share. Most enjoyable part of the job is the associates of my own team. Client centric and very behavior  orientated.
good,"Spent several tax seasons working at HR Block. I found the office I was working in a fun and pleasant place to work. My fellow employees were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was productive but generally fairly laid back."
good,"training  was excellent  teacher was excellent,  classes was ok, give enough time  for you to adjust  to the material. hours where good. Material was very good"
good,"A typical day at work was answering phones, assisting customers, tax professionals and management.  The culture is professional.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  H & R Block does not pay well.  It could be that it is a seasonal, temporary position but some companies pay more for that very reason to attract people."
good,"This was a slow paste environment and did not require much knowledge of computer or secretarial skills. This would be a good first time secretarial opportunity for anyone that is looking to get into this kind of field to gain experience. This is also just a seasonal employment for someone seeking part time or temporary. I trained in October of 2016 and actually started on January 2017, so I technically only worked for 4 months until tax season was over. Walk- in's were welcomed but, we did not have a whole lot of tax prepares available. A lot of employees did not take the job serious and would be late or not come in at all with out notice. If they had apt we had to cancel or reschedule. Management was not stable. During this time we had a manager quite without notice and was without local manager for the remainder of the tax season and everyone was doing their own thing. Over all it was a good experience."
good,Someone without any experience can get a start with company provided training. Advancement is up to the employee based on time and effort to receive additional training.
good,"Before the office was opened we down loaded all updates to the computers so that we could do all returns. After all returns were done, those that came into the office and those that drop them off, we did all reports, deposit slips, and after hours we went to the bank to deposit."
good,I worked part time just during tax season to make some extra money on the side.  I like helping my clients.  It was a challenge to work on commission.
good,"Need to get in early, as someone can be waiting before their appointment time!  Walk-ins welcome, but priority is given to appointment. Co-workers are friendly and willing to help out when needed."
good,"This seasonal job is good as supplemental job, and if you have  interest on how to learn how to do taxes. In order for you to make decent money you have to work there several years."
good,Typical churn and burn type shop.  Office managers are 100% married to making numbers.   Depending on your assignment the manager experience can vary widely.
good,I was very happy to work at H & R Block and I learned a lot knowledge in that 6 years. it was good part time job when you still have to take care your kids.  I do need full time job when my kids are older.
good,Doing is a fast pace business because most people don't want to do taxes  so they want to get in and out of the office. You have to know how to work with the customer so they do not feel stress about the outcome.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was all the staff can easily work with all the other staff.The culture was fine, the management we can   always deal with them. I learned a lot at the office.Every day was a different day and we can always do whatever it takes. Work Hard, Play Hard."
good,this company for most of its employees is an introductory employment opportunity for aspiring accountants. the work always keeps you on your toes but the pay is not amazing.
good,"interact with clients is the fun part but should be confidential all personal information, tax job is the most honorable jobs for any us citizen in america"
good,This is a great place to work for if you want to work with numbers and clients on a one on one basis. They have flexible work hours and Superior training to learn tax preparation.
good,"You're not going to get ahead by working here. if you need an average, seasonal job I would give it a try but other than that it's just average. the company overall is about making a profit and not about the actual clients."
good,"Like most corporate businesses in this day, H&R Block squeezes all the value it can from its employees while providing the least benefits possible. I found management to be amazing but overall benefits lacking."
good,"I loved the first office I worked for. They had a relaxed, collaborative atmosphere and everyone seemed to care about one another. Learned a lot.. Took the tax course and worked as a Tax Pro my second yea, but I did not like the emphasis placed on upselling other products.. We always had time for fun in this office and I was made to feel important and needed."
good,"H&R Block is a good company, they are having growth issues and this is causing a save your own tail mentality at the building.  DGM's are scared to try things that might work for fear of looking bad on reports and this again hurts growth."
good,"Unless you’re an experienced tax preparer, I wouldn’t work at the H&R Block’s in Hattiesburg. They will promise to refund your tax prep class money and then they don’t do it. And they have a few employees that do some shady stuff. If you’re a good Christian person with a moral compass, you may not wanna work there. Js...."
good,Love working with numbers and client to help prepare taxes and make sure they pay the right amount or recieve the maxium amount allowed by the federal government.
good,The owners were phenomenal however the humans I worked with who oversaw what I was doing were not. The owners took care of things but it was in the middle of tax seasonal unfortunately it was after I left.
good,I enjoyed working at H&R Block. I learned the in and outs to file income taxes. The moral was so calm and great to work in. It was a good place to meet new people.
good,"I received customer service experience and tax training at H&R Block. Unfortunately, the training requirements were not worth the part-time work and schedule."
good,I respectfully decline to provide a review of this company.  There are resources available through which prospective employees can find information about this company.
good,"The majority of employees are employed elsewhere so flexible scheduling works great. They Work around your schedule. During peak time and end of tax season can get crazy busy. It’s not like that all the time but if you like challenges, and Learning new things then it’s a great match. The best part for me was reaching out to clients for a more personal visit.  It’s sad it’s only min wage."
good,My co-workers were pleasant to work with. The manager was very slack but outgoing. A typical day was easy and laid back. The clients were very respectful.
good,call clients to make or confirm appointments to complete their taxes.  Offering information so that they may lessen their tax burden for the 2019 tax year
good,Found that micromanagement really prevented me and many of my coworkers from becoming more confident in there jobs. Wish I had been given much more responsibility.
good,I loved working for H&R Block and was sad to leave the company but it was beyond my control. My boss was professional in certain aspects and it hindered my ability to continue working for this amazing company.
good,"To assist tax clients with scheduling appointments for the current tax season, chart maintenance and filling while keeping the reception area neat and clean."
good,After taking a lot of time and spending money on the HR block course I was disappointed with the amount of money that I was able to make.  I worked there for 3 years and then gave up.
good,Long days and hours w/o any major benefits. Would not do that kind of work again. I helped to make sure that our client enjoyed a great customer experience while managing the Block office
good,There is a lack of training from office level to executive level. process and procedures are implemented with lack of training and execution is delivered by untrained or partially trained reps.
good,"A great job for someone looking for a seasonal position. Answering phones, scheduling, some filing. Greeting clients etc. Overall a pretty nice place to work."
good,"scheduling could change overnight and the employee may not realize they do not have a home computer.  No call is made to advise of the update.  favoritism  is rampant.  "
good,"Open the office, start coffee,restock cream, sugar and supplies.  Check in clients scheduled. Make appointments with former and new clients, including explaining fees.  Float between 2 offices as needed."
good,"As long as you keep yourself busy, you should have no problem working for H&R Block. You create your own clientele, so the more approachable you are and have great understanding of taxes, you will be recommended to many and will have a name with the company."
good,"When I worked at H&R Block, they were rebranding and moving away from the core tax business.  They did this aggressively, and it resulted in some very poor business decisions, and eventually, the expansion resulted in a complete overhaul of employees and resources."
good,Great place to work. Great people to work with. ITC is taught by great instructors. CE's are also available online and instructor lead. I encourage anyone interested to contact HRB.
good,"I don't want to it was ok call and reminded previous customers and tried to get a scheduled appt "
good,"seasonal job. tax season. easy money. flexible schedule, fun people."
good,"HR Block has a long history in the community. It provides stability in the job market for the Kansas City job market, however the nature of the company gives no job security. Its core is seasonal positions, so therefore the majority of employees are hired to accomplish those needs."
good,"Take the good with the bad. The job itself is mentally stimulating and challenging. Sometimes interactions with the public aren't pleasant, but generally it was a good experience. It is a seasonal job and has low pay with high expectations such as schooling every year and hours of training every year for a position that lasts only 4 months. You're also not guaranteed a job the following year. There is no feeling of loyalty or appreciation for the workers."
good,"Clock in, log into computer and begin to contact customers about upcoming appointments. "
good,You have to take their tax course.  Pass the test and then apply for a position online.  Most workers are part time seasonal workers.your expected to build you own clientele without marketing help from the corporate.
good,"Fast paced environment. Interviewing clients, performing tax filing documents and education clients on up to date compliance issues year by year. Scheduled all personal appointments.  Marketing and crossing sale of financial incentive offered to clients through H&R Block ."
good,"I worked here as an seasonal employee, I enjoyed my time there and learned a great deal about taxes. After the 1st season, I was eligible to take the classes to prepare taxes for the following season. I completed the class with great success and know I have a more solid understanding of the tax codes we use.  I would recommend this company because there's ongoing training and its a franchise, so if you're interested in owning one, it possible."
good,"Great company flexible hours. Best benefits and greatest group of knowledgeble people of all."
good,It is good to know someone who may be able to assist you with moving up throughout the company. In my department we have a high level of expectancy to put your head down and get the job done.
good,"It was an experience working here. It is a seasonal job, so if you want a full time job year round this would not be for you.  You have to start out as a receptionist then you can go on to tax training."
good,I love the challenge of taxes. I like saving people money and the flexible schedule helps me still be at home with my children. Hardest part is telling people they owe money they may not have.
good,"Set goal and challenge game to motivate employees.  It's the best working environment and team work.  Good that the company constantly looks for new hires with the hope to solve problem.  However, the problems cannot be solved if it's not detected.  H&R Block needs to hire more educated personnel specially in the management team."
good,"I would wait for my client and ask them a set of common questions. I would look at the appropriate files that the client had brought. I learned about the different characters in people. All of my coworkers were very helpful and easygoing. Doing my prior year tax returns were hard. I enjoyed knowing about how to do the tax returns of students, families, and seniors."
good,It was an okay position. It will highly benefit those who been in this work filed for a while now. since I didn't have much experience I also didn't have many clients.
good,"Long hours, great partnerships with counterparts.  Meet great clients and great people. Love the people, easy operating procedures. Well lead training."
good,"The position was part time, was hard to get new clients, the staff had been established and most of the clients were already accounted for. My education  on tax law was increased. The workplace was friendly."
good,Learning opportunity everyday. Flexible hours. Happy to serve clients. Maximum refund guarantee.Helping client make you feel happy.Sometimes its hard to make client understand their own situation. Fund working with people.
good,H&R Block provides great training and tools to handle every possible tax situation. This made surpassing client's expectations somewhat easy in our well presented offices.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block was assisting clients in preparing and filing their state, federal and local income taxes. H&R Block provided me with a strong knowledge of tax principles and regulations. Because of the training I received from H&R countless clients have thanked me for helping them to save on what they owe or for finding innovating ways for them to receive greater refund."
good,"lots of travel/driving "
good,"interview walk-in and appointed clients to complete tax return. answer inquiries and tax questions in person and via phone. follow up on discrepancies related to tax filing and return processing. Participate in monthly meetings to enhance client retention, satisfaction and marketing strategies."
good,"Input customers information about their taxes into the computer. Followed through if a problem occurred. The best part of the job was seeing customers get money back - Always happy with the result. If they owed, went over the return and tried to explain the reason way"
good,"I enjoyed who I was working with, I felt great helping out our clients, but the way management was handled was just too much for me to handle. I don't know from how high up it came, but the scheduling and season-preparedness measures weren't handled efficiently. Personally, the good feelings I got from, again, my coworkers and clients, could not outweigh the stress and negative feelings that working there elicited. I do still highly recommend their service, though, as the amount of information available to, and the amount of training required of the tax preparers is top-notch."
good,This is a great place to work if you are recently graduated from High school.  They pay minimum wage.  They offer training in taxes to advance levels.  This is only a seasonal job.  A person can not live off of just H&R Block.
good,"Good place to begin as a first time Tax Preparer and to gain experience working in an office."
good,H & R Block is exactly what you see in their commercials. Tax professionals sit at their desks and help people file and understand their taxes. It is a good company to work for if you are looking for a seasonal job. They offer training and classes each year for those interested.
good,"Simple tasks"
good,"All my underwriting team complies with the goals, objectives and standards of the organization in order to meet customer satisfaction and deadlines..."
good,It is a seasonal job.  I only worked there 4 months for the tax season.  I do not know much about their company culture.  I enjoyed my work when I was with this job.
good,"Great training program pre-tax season to prepare employees for software and company procedures."
good,The company had a temporary call center staged in the back of an HR Block office. Was back and forth between St. Pete center and Tampa center.  Met people that are still friends with to this day. I will never forget my experience working at that call center.  once in a lifetime opportunity and i was proud to be apart of it
good,"I worked here when i was 16. it was an okay job, nothing bad to say about my experience there. the people i worked with were very nice and helpful and were very welcoming!"
good,"learned the basics of tax preparation. low salaries, decent education for newcomers. flexible work schedule. friendly environment. the 2 year is better than the the 1st."
good,"Hiring process was awful-upper management lost my paper work."
good,Typical day at work slow over December but pick up March to the last minute of last day of due. I work as a part time and seasonal job. Your managers are helpful especially it's your first time working as a Tax Preparer.
good,This was a seasonal job so compensation and benefits were not attractive. However the training courses provided each season were invaluable. Helped advance tax knowledge each year.
good,Ditto. Same story. Have nothing to hide; don't know who will see this. Will say the same thing again. I will say it again and again. And again and again.
good,Average. Good for building your administrative experience. The pay is good enough to start your feet on the industry. But no benefits due to seasonal only.
good,"The real benefit of working for this company is the ability to gain experience, should you receive a full time position. I became a part of the leadership team and received training from time to time and valuable experience to go with my degree. There was only $1500 tuition reimbursement which did not pay for one of my classes so the experience was my main focal point. The management team I worked for was great and easy to get along with. However, I cannot stress just how important it is to notice the amount of layoffs the company does. I, myself, fell victim around a year after my promotion. Hopefully the new CEO does a better job."
good,Good relaxed position for the extra money to pay for gift during holidays.  Just needed a little extra money and this helped out in a crunch.  Was an easy job to learn and maintain.
good,prepared simple tax returns. hours were very long during tax season. liked my supervisor in the office. She was very understanding and helpful. Ok pay rate.
good,Need benefits and paid time off and sick pay. Need health insurance benefits as well. Other than that the job is very pleasing to work at. There is a lot of training available.
good,I am glad for the work experience and with today's economy I guess I am thankful for the opportunity but I have to say it is a bit repetitive and I don't have any interest in making a long term career out of this current job but I am nonetheless very glad that I have a job but I am going to find something that I actually enjoy doing
good,Seasonal tax preparation support staff. Great customer interaction. Management made the job enjoyable with great support.  Workplace culture well balanced.
good,"The way H&R Block calculates your pay is 80% of what you made the previous year!  When you work full-time it's hard to make Bonus.  During slow times, you have to be the first to speak to a walk-in customer to do their taxes.  It can be cut-throat. You have to really like what you are doing to keep coming back or build up your client base so you make Bonus each season."
good,"is a good place to learn!!! but full time positions never available , but is u love learning and education continuing it's a Good place to u."
good,"It was enough hours to get me away from the house and make a little money while doing so. I wouldn't work there seasonally if you are the only income/as your only job. Be prepared to have another part time job with it. Management is great and the H&R Block site is great if you are sick or need to call in for any reason to accommodate finding someone to cover your shift. They do accumulate sick time over time, however if you don't use it, they won't pay it out at the end of the tax season."
good,Leaving this company was a personal decision I dont want to fill this out.  I just want a temporary job that is not related to hr block and I don't understand why I Have to answer this
good,"HRB is a tough environment because we are very lean at the WHQ. We are expected to be available at all hours of the day and to put as many hours in as required. The work/life balance is very lacking. That being said, it greatly depends on the department in which you work and it is a great place to begin your career."
good,My duties included scheduling appointments and calling customers to remind about upcoming appointments. Interacting with my fellow co-workers and they were kind to answer my questions.
good,I learned a very useful skill which can help me for years to come. I appreciate the ongoing courses offered for maintaining tax information. You have to be a people person to work here.
good,I am a seasonal employee for H&R Block for 50+ years.  I am very involved in a tax returns with a specialty with working with farmers.  I plan on to continue to work with Block as long as I can.
good,"The company treats commission as bonuses, paying them out once a year and taxing them as bonuses rather than commission earned. That means that the IRS takes more in taxes than necessary and the preparer has to wait until the following year to recoup the extra taxes when they do their tax return. The IRS would allow the company to report these earnings as commission, taxed at ordinary income rates, but the company chooses to do otherwise."
good,"I enjoyed 8 tax seasons with H&R Block.  I worked very hard and was allowed to hold positions in multiple departments.  The work is very fast paced, chaotic maybe sometimes, but is very rewarding.  Rewarding meaning that I felt a sense of professional fulfillment - not that I felt that I was properly compensated.  HRB pays lower than average for the same work elsewhere.  Also, be advised that in the IT departments of HRB the tools used are proprietary.  The concepts might be universal, but the tools/utilities are mostly unheard of outside of HRB.  Not great when you seek another IT job elsewhere."
good,"Checked people in to get there tax's done. "
good,It was fun helping clients. HR Block is a rip-off though with the hefty fees they charge. Tax Professionals had very little experience to help their clients in a positive way.
good,"File paperwork, answer telephone, make calls in hopes of returning clients, handled personal information."
good,"I just this this job for extra cash.  "
good,"greeted clients, organized tax papers, prepared office for the day and closed in the evening. its a fast paced job, also very busy. i enjoyed working here, the people i worked with were very helpful and very patient as i was barely gaining skills."
good,Second job. Was part time and work was boring. Good place to get customer service experience. Hardest part was dealign with rude customers.  Was enjoying for the most part.
good,"Customer service, very professional. relaxed atmosphere, I like answering phones and making appointment. Filing is my real strong point. Good Coffee. Clean Office"
good,I worked in the call center for a bit and at the headquarters. Both were good learning opportunities where I was able to enhance my skills in computer hardware and software troubleshooting.
good,"Seems like shareholder needs come before client needs. New CEO though, who appears to understand that staff and clients are pretty important, too. Looking forward to seeing where he takes the company."
good,"this was a  great expierence to work.  the co workers and managers were excellent.   i have learned alot working for this company,  doing  taxes has taught me alot and gave me a deeper impact on how to prepare taxes."
good,I truly learned a lot working at H&R Block as a Client Services Professional. I learned a lot about taxes and the environment was very relaxed and productive. I also became more organized just from having to file client's tax information.
good,I was working independently at their satellite location. Did not have any interaction with the other employees. The CEO was a good person. Answered any of my questions in a timely manner.
good,Our front end staff needs a lot more training before the next tax season to carry forward what is implemented in the tax office. I love working for local residents in Somerset county
good,"H&R Block is a good company to work for, they are accommodating, they want to further your education, and they have classes you can take at no charge or at a reduced cost."
good,"The difficult part of managing the front desk solo is when there a lot of clients lining up and the phone ringing at the same time. It can be hard to do it alone because you have to work with the people in front, but having to take in calls at the same time."
good,"The branch staff was excellent to work with. Although the regional/district supervising staff were difficult to please, the job itself was enjoyable and flexible."
good,"Basic office job, i did enjoy when the clients came in; i would offer them coffee or water, i had the appointment folder already to walk them over to the tax pro too let them know the client was there or their appointment."
good,"Did not care  about doing taxes, I found it very stressful and not confident about my own skills and knowledge but did enjoyed the 2018 as a receptionist."
good,They provide good customer service. A typical day at work was helping clients with their tax issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer is pleased with the end result.
good,My job was to prepare taxes for individuals who walked through the door. My training allowed me to see clients with various taxes situation. Overall if you find taxes interesting you will get the training you need.
good,I learn how to set some appointment. The Workplace culture was nice. The hardest part was the appointment and get phone call back. The must enjoyed part was the people.
good,"Great job to gain experience in tax or office work environment but the pay is terrible, and no permanent positions or any desirable future prospect aside from continuing to work seasonally for extra work or fun retirement hobby!"
good,lots of work February thru April.  low pay asks a lot of managers  willing to train and move you up in company if that is what you want
good,a typical day at work is 8-5 monday through saturday. sometimes later.  the hardest part of the job is selling extra services to clients. management was fien.
good,I worked as the receptionist for the Tax Professionals.  Tax Professionals at H&R Block for commission only after their first full year of preparing taxes.  Working with these Tax Professionals is like swimming with sharks - beware if you schedule a past client with a different Tax Professional!!!
good,The job is very easy yet there is no flexibility in hours or requesting off. The pay wasn't too good either. Much rather work for myself in preparing tax.
good,"A typical day for me was to answer phones  make appointments, help and answer question to clients as much as possible before transferring to tax preparers."
good,HR Block is a great part time job. You meet so many people and learn about their cultures. I enjoyed my time spent as a seasonal employee at HR Block.
good,HR Block is a good place to work with many duties and interactions with the public and coworkers.  Each interaction is different and requires different skill sets for the particular interaction.
good,"Not a terrible place to work. Easy job in general, with no degree required. The other people are nice, the clients not so much. Sometimes can be fast paced, but not unmanageable."
good,It was a nice experience. I did face to face interviews with my tax clients and worked on their tax returns. I gained a lot of real world experience. Learned a lot.
good,With new company policies it made some offices susceptible to theft with not implementing proper security protocols first. like the deposits someone in our office took the opportunity of the deposited being kept until they reached a certain amount. Should of supplied the office with a safe at the beginning
good,"I liked working at the company since it provided Great tax education classes,  as a result quality of education. I liked flexible hours. Minus -  low pay,"
good,"Come in and open things up and take care of the clients and make appointments for the new clients. Also call clients to see if they need an appointment."
good,"Working at HRB is quite easy, the only thing is it is seasonal.  You do get good hours while you are there and the money is good.  The job itself is not difficult some people just make it out to be harder than it is or they just don't want to work."
good,"Although I enjoy the type of work I was doing, the work itself can be quite stressful. The managers are very smart and helpful when they want you to learn something new."
good,"Filed tax returns for individuals and small business."
good,A typical day would e spend practicing and reading over the updated tax laws. Each office suppose to be different. Employees have regulars but everybody mostly waits on a client to come through the door. Coworkers try to take each other clients. Employees talks badly about each other and the clients. Too many unprofessional employees in the office.
good,"Not pleased with current immediate supervisor.  Scheduling is done by favoritism not seniority or work performance.  Co workers are great, very relaxed working environment."
good,"Nice people. lots of different cultures. Good start for the accounting and understanding taxes in Canada. But management sucks. Overall, good experience."
good,I had an interesting time working there.  It was challenging because I did not receive much training but overall it was an okay experience. Very busy place to work.
good,"Great opportunity to learn, bad opportunity do grown. If you are looking for learning experience this is a good place, not a good salary or schedule.."
good,H&R Block was a stressful time consuming job with customers that are often disrespectful and emotional because of tax delays. It is also rewarding because of the potential to help customers
good,Seasonal job was good work experience. Lots of interaction with clients. Tax Specialists were nice to work with and hours were decent. Low paying job with no room for growth long term.
good,"The company does not compensate new hires very well."
good,"a good stepping stone for tax industry, but if you want to work where you want to have a comprehensive working experienes. This position might not be working for you."
good,This job included me working as a Tax Pro and a help desk person. I enjoyed learning the many aspect of this profession. I moved to Florida and did not take up the same job when I moved.
good,I don't really like they way they eat away at your bonus in the down time part of the tax season.  They need to get the old office managers out of there.
good,Fast paced. Traveling and marketing were a large part on the job while continuing to do tax work.  A good place to work it you are looking for seasonal work.
good,I get to meet a lot of different clients.  Each one has their own unique tax situations.  It's a pleasure to get to work with the public.  Income Tax time is a very busy time here.
good,"Pleasent working conditions, fast paced, not so great employee relationship with company leads to high turnover of employees. Internal Revenue Service has better pay and working conditions once all the federal ""wazoo"" stuff is passed. H&R Block is ""high stress"" environment no matter how cool the job site looks.Founder and CEO at Corporate Headquarters has a $1 million buck painting, a ""Monet,"" hanging in his office, but can't make ""a silk purse from a sow's ear"" and company is losing business as it expands into a ""software"" company."
good,"H&R Block was a relaxed placed. AS the receptionist all you had to do was make appointments, take payments and such. At times it was slow and at times it was quick paced."
good,"It was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with clients and helping in their specific needs. Fast paced environment for tax season, coworkers were nice."
good,H&R Block tends to switch managers from team to team. I worked there four years and had six managers. I had to train four of them. It's irritating when the person you're supposed to go to with problems has no idea what your job entails.
good,"it was very rare evirement i mean it was calm but it was a type a job that you should only be there for a little , we did have fun office parties and everyone was really nice"
good,Management is very nice and knowledgeable about the company and how is run a successful company. Learning new things about taxes is a typical at work.
good,The work day was fair and we had a nice lunch break I did quite enjoy working there. the owner sold the business to some one else who had there own sectary which is why im not working there but the place and the people were all pretty nice.
good,Very professional and enjoyed my time. I was able to use my skills very well. I was put in a different environment and learned a lot. I would love to go back to work for them again.
good,"Worked around any schedule. You could work any days and times, they were very flexable. The job did require alot of studying and certifications but could be done anytime."
good,"I do not have any reviews because i only worked here for 1 season only and i just wanted to know how to do my own tax, so i did not come back the next year."
good,"H & R BLOCK:"
good,The office that I was located at was extremely slow. My manager was always all over the place and was not very reliant. I was only there for one tax season and it was not my favorite.
good,"for the tasks and demands the pay was extremely low. very hard to pick a time to go to lunch or take a break. other than that nice manager, but like i said too demanding for pay rate."
good,I was only there a short time. I was there after the busiest part of tax season so it was not high stress for me on the job. The rate of pay was fair. The people who were in the office varied depending on the schedule. For the most part I enjoyed the people who I worked with. Some days I had more hours than others depending upon extra training time if needed. I enjoyed meeting different clients also. I could get more hours if needed to contact clients who hadn't scheduled an appointment yet that season.
good,This was just a second side job for me but it was fun and insightful when it came to the tax prep.  I would recommend this to people just starting out in the reception area and looking to advance
good,"is great friendly environment and great work with customer."
good,H&R Block is a company that is worried about their numbers than their employees. The pay was only minimum wage and it was not enough for the work they expected.
good,It was a great experience learning how to prepare taxes and working with the public. Even though this was only part time I met a lot of people. This job was seasonal but we work as a team and we did what we had to do to get the job done.
good,I liked working with the community and preparing their taxes. It let me work with numbers and people at the same time. But towards the end of the season it gets really slow
good,"Overall it was a great place to be. Met new and exciting people and had to be on top of my game managing people and relationships. Customers came in and met you for the first time and two minutes later they're giving you their most guarded secrets and information saying ""make it go!"""
good,It was a great job with good pay but I have kids and was being forced to choose between my kids and my work and was pushed to give hours over those that I has committed to.
good,Became knowledgeable of the tax laws and procedures and the various deductions that would benefit one in receiving the best refund possible in a fast pace multitask environment.
good,Great seasonal job hours are flexible gives you great training on and off the job. The offices are very comforatable and the systems are very easy to work with
good,"Once you pass the classes and are hired, your first year is supervised by an experienced tax preparer. Unfortunately some employees preferred to take the clients for themselves instead of assisting the employee being trained. Then the new hires were inadequately prepared for the clients they handle on their own."
good,great company but training could be way better and also better organized. I feel that they rush you through the training and do not give you a chance to actually really learn the material.
good,Managing the front end during tax season can be fun and stressful.  Lots of happy and unhappy customers during this time of year. Loved working with all the preparers.
good,H&R Block is a fun place to work with great people working around you.  No stress on the employees.  Plenty of snack breaks. Great working environment
good,"The education is the very best thing about this company as well as their dynamic business culture. These factors make you want to come back each year for more training and more work. "
good,Prepared tax returns for individuals. Spent a lot of time calling former clients to book appointments. Light administrative duties. The position was seasonal with no opportunity for advancement.
good,"No growth within company.  Favoritism to spanish employess, lack of work. No benefits such as healthcare and retirement benefits for seasonal workers, no vacation pay. No pay increase."
good,It was an okay place to work.  They pay was not enough to consider it anything more than extra spending money.  HR block does not have a progressive policy that would truly benefit its employees.
good,Managed the tax office. Prepared income taxes for new and returning clients. Handled the payroll for employees. Printed refund checks. Handled all activity that happened through the day.
good,"very friendly people, every now and then you wouldn't be as busy but it was a nice pace, manager was as friendly but she was under a lot of stress when i would get to see her"
good,"great place to work , very friendly , it was only part time but they are very fun and easy to get along with really I  enjoyed working there . very professional ."
good,A typical day for me started with making coffee and answering phones. I made appointments for the tax pro and followed up with there clients. I greeted every person that came into the office and was warm and friendly to the clients.
good,Every year you must go to unpaid classes and then hope that there aren't to many changes to handle. HR Block continues to create different programs to create income for the company.
good,"It was a fun job, but it was only temporary.  I had gone to the tax preparer classes and learned a lot.  However the office I was placed in had preparers that had years of experience.  So for the most part I did more receptionist duties.  After the tax season, they will ask back the preparers that did well.  I only did a handful of returns, so I was not hired back."
good,"The district manager was an individual who was only after money.  He had no tax background and I do not believe knew how to give the clients a good service,"
good,They have too many untrained people that are handling very sensitive information. They are all about quantity and not quality. The company has a company because of past clients and service and now that has all went out the window. The only present concern is a positive line for the stock holders in company.
good,This was a very stressful and demanding workplace that is extremely centered on making as much money as possible for the company! Many times the other employees make it hard to work effectively!!
good,"Not much to say. You stand at the reception desk and answer the phone to get people appointments to do their taxes, or you transfer them to the person that did their return if they have questions."
good,"It was a okay place to work, multiple tasks to perform.  This was the district office and they have moved it down south so they do not have an administrative office here anymore."
good,"During the Tax Season I usually work at the same office and the team there is awesome. I enjoy my job and the work environment, plus is close to my home."
good,Productive company for employment and challenging to implement promulgate pertaining to taxes.  It was enjoyable employment in a diverse culture. Sale.
good,"that's it. nice place, nice people. A lot of return customers returning to their previous preparers, walk-ins, people forget so we call them to see if they want to come back..."
good,"This is a great secondary job, there are no benefits and after you have reached senior tax analyst there is no opportunity for advancement. It is a great job for parents with daycare issues because of the flexibility."
good,"I did not a have a very positive experience, I was grateful for the opportunity. However; my boss made it very difficult. My advice to the company would be to build a much more positive environment and take care of the workers."
good,Ended up being more about upselling to the customer than actually taking care of the customers' needs. You take a lot of training just to basically become a salesperson.
good,"Excellent staff and employees, great benefits, loved the atmosphere. Management was ok at times but was able to communicate with them in a positive way."
good,Reasonably friendly work environment. Hours can be long from time to time. The most rewarding part of this job is helping the customers to get the best  possible return.
good,It is a good place to get started in the business world.  By being Seasonal you can learn while you earn a living.  If it is necessary to relocate this is a great place to work.
good,Evening shift preparing tax returns.Always updated tax changes to associates. The hardest part of the job was bad behavior from clients. Most enjoyable part of the work was helping clients understand their tax return.
good,"Very satisfactory when you help a client. You get to learn a lot tax related laws while working with H&R. If you like marketing, you will like the job as you get to sale financial products of H&R"
good,"Answering phones, face to face inquiries and scheduling appointments is a typical day,  This leads to actually preparing  an accurate return for the customer."
good,The company is nice to work for. The season just go by so fast. I've been with them since 1999. you can meet alot of great people. they are really easy going as a company.
good,"It was very repetitive type of work. I learned a lot about the different forms for taxes that are needed if ,say, you own a business or have an investment."
good,"was intersting talking to different people while filling out the forms, schedules, and credits, was a cold place to work,  started out as delivering refunds"
good,I learned a lot and continue to learn each year as the continuing education hours are required. I enjoy helping the clients get every deduction possible to ensure a great tax experience.
good,H&R Block has strict rules and regulations and these must be followed by all managers and employees.  The tax filings are very important to be compliant and produce a solid service for the client.
good,Due to seasonality of business it creates leadership challenges that occur every year.  The best part is that all U.S. income earners have to file their taxes so their is a large target market.  The associates genuinely care for clients.  Tax preparation is a crazy business model and attracts all types of clients.
good,"This was a seasonal job, so I really don't know that much about full time paid positions at this company.  The pay was low for seasonal employees and no benefits are offered."
good,"It was a pleasure working for H&R Block, although the work is seasonal. You get to work with the same people most of the time and its like a mini reunion. The company is fair and I would not mind working there again for seasonal work."
good,I enjoyed working for hrblock. It allowed me to interact with clients and gain better experience with customer service. I did not hate my job and i felt very productive.
good,"Training is not adequate, clients had to wait in my office while I did the tax return and it got approved for sending to CRA. They should have been able to drop off the information, and come back & pick it up when it was done."
good,"ok for some extra money, good after the Christmas holidays. Not a career that's for sure. Most of the people are ok though. If you want to learn how to do your own tax they offer good courses."
good,"The calls where very high volume with not enough agents to support the incoming calls. "
good,"Meeting customers and assisting them with their tax needs, issues, and concerns. Showing customers tax breaks that they did not know they were entitled to and saving customers money."
good,They were ok to work for.  They have had a lot of turn over during the time that I left.  They company took a whole new approach on the industry.  With the changes it made a lot of people look for new work.
good,great people with a smile. use computer to do work . check in people at the store location. ask if they want water. make sure everyone's ok. answer phone calls
good,H&R Block was a nice place to work at especially for entry level seekers. Working there you will learn the basic skills to work in an office setting. You must be organized and ready to go because the whole office depends on you for their day to go smoothly.
good,I learned a lot about doing taxes and have continued to do taxes for myself and on a professional basis ever since working there.  It has given me a strong foundation in tax preparation.
good,"Again, another company that was fine to work with, the pay schedule was a little strange, but good experience, good people in my office."
good,The team work at H&R Block is amazing. When I started out at H&R Block as a Tax Professional one of the thing that impressed me the most was the team work in my office and other departments in the organization.  This is because the organization's common goal is customer satisfaction.
good,This job was always exited and challenged.  we encountered many different situations which needed to be resolved on the spot.  Overall this job was a very good experience
good,"I answered phones as well as making phone calls and scheduling appointments. I passed out checks to customer as well as passing out checks to staff as well. I was the first person seen when you walk in the office and the last, it was my job to leave the best impression on the customer as possible. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer their money was not in yet and dealing with the reaction of the customer. It was fast paced but not overwhemling."
good,"One worked on commission and I didn't like how they were administered."
good,"Great support team, but the training was a little too much too fast.  Even though I got 98% on my final training exam, once on the floor on on the phones it was somewhat overwhelming trying to lean on the volume of information given in the 2 week span."
good,A typical work day would  be steady. I learned that being a Tax Pro takes a lot of work and knowledge. My Office Manager was a pleasant to work with and for. The hardest part of the job was not having enough work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff.
good,Receptionist Great way to learn the H&R Block company great opportunity to be a tax preparer. You only work four months out of the year great way to balance life with your family
good,Very focused on client satisfaction and quality. Also very sales driven. Professional and knowledgeable tax preparers. Very ethical company. I look forward to tax season.
good,The day may start out slow but increases as the scheduled customers arrive. I learned that the filing of taxes is not something I want to manage for a living. The hardest part of the job is demanding and difficult customers. Everyone is supportive in helping to resolve the issues to have a positive resolution for the customer.
good,H&R Block has a great training program and has some great instructors who are passionate about there work. Due to the over head expenses tax professionals leave due to pay rate bonus model.
good,"Friendly environment, as well as productive! The work place was very organized. The other employees greeted you with a smile. I also enjoyed being off on the weekends."
good,"Need good communication and teamwork from the upper management. typical was busy and stressful during tax season. "
good,"•	Computed taxes owed by clients, individuals and small businesses, by following federal and state tax code."
good,Everything depends on the location you work. I had a great manager and my location was not busy so I did get to do little more complex returns. If you work in busy place then they won't let you take care of complex returns.
good,Hard work will be beneficial to all.  Your bonus could be great as long as you work steady daily bringing in revenue for the company. Be steadfast and unmovable.
good,I really like the people I worked with they were very helpful in understanding procedures. very educational in learning how taxes are prepared but you have to pay for the classes.
good,was seeing the disappointment in clients faces when uncle sam took all their money and they were not getting anything close to what the needed or expected.
good,"It's convenient and if you stick with it, it's good income. Hours are flexible but you success depends on your availability. If you like working with the public you will get to meet a variety of people. If you don't like working with people this job is not for you."
good,"It was good working there. Not a lot of coworker support, and doing taxes isn't easy. It is very slow paced though. The hours are good because you can choose when you want to come in."
good,"The culture at H&R Block was very warm.  The staff was very friendly and willing to offer assistance whenever needed.  However, they were over staffed and were unable to offer new employees hours.  There were times when I would not be called into work for a week."
good,"A typical work day would include lots of travel. I learned how to best serve the needs of clients indifferent markets. The culture needs improvement, but can be great at times. The hardest part of the job is that its seasonal. The most enjoyable part is that I can be in a new area everyday."
good,"Provide tax related services to the public.  Training hours are critical to success in the offices.  Variety of customers from individuals, small businesses, corporations and farms."
good,"Nine Years"
good,"Asked to do double the work with no raise, when interviewing for the next season, no raises were given. Difficult to want to go back when they want other people's work covered, but, no compensation."
good,i was great working there because I was able to get my first experience as a tax professional.  it was worth taking the classes to learn about filing.
good,"This office is nice. Many of the team members I worked with are extremely nice and dependable. Although, it is a little unorganized, its easily fixable."
good,"H&R Block is losing market share to new competitors, and every year the company tries some last ditch strategies to pull in clients. This company's focus is too much on costs and not enough on values. I don't see the company remaining the giant that it was, but with better leadership and a steady plan, H&R Block can hold onto the share of the market it currently has."
good,This workplace is very inconsistent in how they do things. the expectations are not clear and it is very exhausting trying to guess at what your job is.
good,"My position at H&R "
good,I enjoyed work here. I liked all my coworkers we all got along very well. I liked answering the phones and scheduling appointments I feel i did very well at this job. I also trained receptionist at other offices.
good,I worked there part-time.  I learned how to prepare Income Tax Returns.  Management was friendly and was willing to help staff and clients in whatever way.  The schedule was flexible.  The hardest part of my job was not getting enough clients to do their returns.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the satisfaction that I helped clients get the maximum refund.
good,"H&R Block is a great company to work for. Unfortunately, I worked under a manager that was not qualified to lead. She was not professional and would cause dissention in the office among the tax representatives. She was mostly a scatterbrain and had to rely on others to run the office. She had been a former daycare manager and had no experience in managing adults."
good,"Get to create bonds with clients and networking at all times. This job does have it's up's and down's, but I have learned a lot from it. I have learned time management and how to balance my work and everyday life."
good,"Would enjoy going back, just needed a job with benefits that they don't offer seasonal employees. Enjoyed interacting with all the clients and employees. Wages are very low for all people there, that is another draw back,"
good,It was interesting to learn the new tax codes and customer services was awesome. The computer set up was difficult to master along with that. But we had good company to enjoy it all with.
good,Meeting people and a very personal manner and some days is very slow since most people is doing themselves online.  It gave me time to study and learn more of tax laws.
good,I was a part time receptionist. The job was very easy for my evenings hours that I had. Not much paper work that you have to do. Mostly answering the phones and checking in customers.
good,Not fairly compensated for the work and money that we bring into the corporation. Paid a minimum wage salary for something that you bring in over $100 per return to the company.
good,This position was seasonal only and the work environment was effective.  This position gave my self the opportunity to interact with all different types of personalities.
good,"HR Block works on a bonus system of tax returns done per hour. It works well if you have a steady stream of clientele, but not so good if you are filling dead hours. The base pay is very low, so most people want to only work during the more lucrative hours."
good,"The very nature of the work is seasonal, and likely won't lead to anything full time. In addition, there's quite a bit of push for first year preparers to bring in their own clients (and hours are reduced if they don't). There's also some emphasis on pitching additional products and services that the job would likely be much more enjoyable without."
good,"Answer the phone a lot, Take appointments, And do little paper work."
good,This was a very good and fair place to work. I learned a lot about being a receptionist. A typical day at work was to answer incoming calls and schedule appointments for clients.
good,I cannot comment on any work related issues since there was a contract to be signed. But I can say that during tax season managers have to be able to work hard and lots of hours.
good,"Coworkers were friendly and willing to assist me with customers."
good,"Getting to know taxes if that's the background you would like to learn about and also, meeting and greeting new people, learning a new language and meeting people."
good,"large variety of work performed, many opportunities for continuing education, can be very hectic and end of tax season, diverse team, with many levels of skill"
good,"Great environment, i enjoy working here and with my current co-workers, only con is that in fact it's a seasonal job until April only open during tax season."
good,The fact that they only allow you to work seasonally and the room to grow was not there to be full time with them.  Boring work environment.  Managers need to loosen up a bit.
good,"It was an interesting opportunity. I was able to learn some things that I didn't know about taxes. The Manager was the worst part. She would often times not come in and when she did, she was always barking orders."
good,"Friendly atmosphere, work independently, teamwork hard work and stay busy.  Assist co-worker if needed.  Do what it take to get the job done.  Always be dependable."
good,"* Responded to customer, vendor and department inquiries via telephone, email or fax. "
good,Informative for various income tax issues along with various retirement possibilities to help you with the long term investments. Friendly and helpful.
good,Was good for a seasonal job.  Is a busy place during tax season.  Very friendly people in the office that I worked in.  Love working and meeting new people.
good,H&R Block was a good job for me to do as I was working on my AAAS in Accounting Technology degree. The people were friendly and the hours were flexible.
good,"Loved my job, but with sadness they without any notice, let all of the Marketing team go. The job was very flexible I loved the people I worked with, the values of the company."
good,A fun family oriented place to work with a great group of people.  Help is always available when needed. Plenty of training available.
good,Overall experience is positive.  Learning alot and treated well.  Decent bonuses when we're doing well.  Typical day is very busy.  Lots of layers of communication to get things done which can be frustrating but often necessary to make sure things get done right.  Co-workers want to do the right thing for the most part.  Great to work with.  Hardest part of the job is supporting the seasonal aspect of the business. Ramping up to support an extremely busy 4 months and then ramping back down for the remaining 12 is challenging to say the least!  Appreciate the people and their willingness to get things done.  Biggest concern is that we're losing good people because of layoffs and concern over job security.
good,H&R Block allowed me to grow in many ways mentally and professionally. It helped me to be more communicative with customers and learn the wants and needs of others. Some of the staff members  were very helpful while most were too advanced to care. I was a TP1 at the age of 21 hired as a manager many were very mean because of the age difference but that did not interfere with my work ethics. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining new relationships with my clients and bringing a new improved and positive atmosphere.
good,Lots of experiences. Managers were helpful and kept the office in form. Got to improve my tax knowledge with yearly continuing education courses by the company. Increase certification.
good,This is a good job I just wish it was full time. I work with some good people that enjoy what they do. We all do the best we can very day to help our customers.
good,I really enjoyed interacting with the clients.  The staff was very kind.  Unfortunately it was a seasonal job and I had to find full time employment.  Overall it was a good experience.
good,I love the work schedule flexibility! I love the fact that you can work a few months and be off for three months...especially during the summer.
good,"Prepare taxes. I learned the tax system that the company used to prepare the basic taxes. The kind manager, the responsible and united co-workers. The hardest part of the job was with complicated clients. The most fun part was sharing"
good,"Set appointments, answer phone, update database and keep tea, coffee, water for clients.  I also filed returns for pick up and did marketing for office."
good,I worked here in high school and the days were pretty boring except during peak season when every day was incredibly hectic. The office environment was nice because of the tax professionals.
good,"First location I worked had great coworkers. All but one who had a reputation for being that way for a long time yet there'd been no reprimand. "
good,This job was ok. Management could have been a little more organize. I did not return because during bad snow days you still have to be present. I would recommend this job to anyone as long as during bad snow days you have a baby sitter.
good,Answering phone and making verification calls and scheduling clients for appointments to have their taxes done. Making coffee and restocking the bathrooms
good,People are constantly in and out the office. High turnover. Nicely managed. Sometimes lucrative. Every place has their good and bad points.
good,"I did like working here, the only thing that i did not like about here was that in some cases we had to lie to our costumers, and that the people that were supposed to help us, would not be there, or complain."
good,I enjoy working with my clients to achieve the best possible results for their situation.  I do everything I can to make the tax process as painless as possible.
good,"Answering the phone, taking payments, scheduling appointments. Working with excel and scheduling app. was the new thing I learned. The co-workers all kind of did their own thing."
good,"This job for me was seasonal and is very busy from Feb to March, I enjoy work with the public one and one the hardest part for me is that  this job by itself was not enough to provide for my family so for me was a part time."
good,"A typical day at work was that work with client, I have learned that how to do the Tax return, management was fine and my co-works were very good, the hardest part of the job was that the salary was very low. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the time was flexible."
good,The hours are flexible.  Compensation is based on production.  Interacting with clients is the best part of the job.  Block does not discriminate in hiring practices.
good,very laid back seasonal job. I had amazing co workers and amazing costumers. I loved my job but need something more perment.
good,"I like the dress code. I learned how to deal with hostile people. Ay the time I was working, were going through a change in management . all my co-workers were nice. The hardest pert of my job was getting the public to understand my job."
good,"There is always something to do, most of all help clients. It is a fun and challenging environment. The hardest part is knowing if you did a tax return correctly with no mistakes."
good,Good training to employees to provide excellent service to clients according to updated tax regulations. Deadlines for tax season very accurate according to national schedules.  Research tools on specific tax topics available all the time. Work developed in a good environment as a team player and supported by management
good,i spend over 12 years with this company and I was honoured to work with many of the fine and dedicated staff throughout the various tax offices.
good,"Prepare tax forms on H & R Block software.  During a lull, keep up with changing tax information. Educate customers about how tax laws & policies effect their income."
good,"I had a great team of ladies. We loved to help our clients get the most of what they deserved on their tax return. The ladies were also very helpful with each other. Because I had a great team of ladies, our days would go by fast and joyful. We worked as if we were family, so we grew as a family."
good,IT is a good experience if you are planning  to tax. ive learned alot and work under pressure. I have enjoyed it alot got a long with most of the people I worked with at H&R block. District Manager is great though I didnt work much with her throughout the season
good,"During the peaks times, it can get very busy, but that is to be expected.  If you have a good manger, it will be okay.  If the more experienced people make themselves available to you, it will go great."
good,Overall a great company to work for if you are looking for a flexible schedule and a good place to get work experience. Tax season is crazy with little to no work life balance during those months.
good,the place you can learn more and help people with tax. you will gain more experience and knowledge through the education classes they provide yearly
good,"H R Block is very flexible with scheduling and accommodating individuals with other employment schedules and family. They take family priorities seriously,"
good,"good temp work, nice people, fun atmosphere, professional services, tax education was extremely comprehensive and valuable to performing accurate work."
good,"They work around your schedule. A lot of improvements could be made, as well as better client service. Co-workers are okay, upper management are quite arrogant."
good,I enjoyed helping and taking care of customers but i didn't like that they didn't give many hours here at all. and they always wanted you to work every weekend and when you have a family & kids that's kind of  hard.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a seasonal job with flexible hours.  The pay structure is very low. No scope of growth.
good,"I love all the day to day activities being a client service representative at H&R Block.  Answering the phone and greeting customers are just some of the perks of working here.  I love to save the client some money and I also like to help them with questions they cannot answer.  Working with the public is such a joy, we all are just like a family here hate we only stay open during tax season."
good,Would have liked a bit more collaboration and attention from upper management. Would have appreciated more planned out course of actions for system failures during a work day.
good,"Not secured position, only seasonal position, very little compensation hourly wages, be prepared with another work position to help you out"
good,Enjoy working with people and helping them with their specific tax problems and helping them to understand the IRS requirements.  Education in the tax code and knowledge of tax preparation is a constant learning experience.  The tax pro can make as much of this work experience as they choose to.  This can be a very competitive environment and can be very rewarding.
good,While working here I enjoyed helping people to save money and invest in their future as well as get the most money they can get back.
good,"Nice place to work.  People are nice and the boss is great with a lot of pressure. Working hours are up to you.  Some sales responsibilities are required as well as marketing.  Lots of classes are also required, A lot of your own time is required to study for tests."
good,"Busy, meeting people, lots of variety, continued learning, co-workers easy to get along with. Hardest part is keeping up with changes. Most enjoyable part is the busy season."
good,You have to answer the phones and check people in. Depending on the office you get placed in sometimes you have to act like the boss.
good,"Nice office work setting and good co-worker support.  Just a seasonal position, but the job helped me learn a lot more than just the tax code."
good,"Seasonal position preparing tax returns for H&R Block clients. This was my first time preparing taxes professionally. H&R Block provides exceptional training, making it easy for a first-timer to feel comfortable doing the jov."
good,"Accepted this position on a part time temporary basis.  Very fast paced greeting clients, phone calls.  Short term position, will not be returning."
good,Answering phones making appointments and filing paperwork is what i did on a daily basis. I would help prepare things for the tax professionals on a daily basis.
good,Great and helpful staff.  Loved meeting new clients and creating professional relationships for repeat customers.  Very knowledgeable staff.
good,"I start with a greeting and letting people tell me about what they have before I get started on their taxes. I show them what I am doing and answered any questions they may have. Also, offer them suggestions for the following year."
good,"Daily tasks included paper filing, preparing individual tax returns, answering multi-line telephones, setting client appointments and interacting with clients and co-workers.  The most difficult part of this job was having to inform clients of any tax penalties that they may have incurred throughout the year.  There were two things that made it worth my while to work for H&R Block.  Listening to clients excitement of their refund and reoccurring clients who have had the same tax preparer for a number of years.  I only worked for H&R Block for one tax season but I will continue to have a friendly relationships with the office employees who I worked with the most.  Office management are very fair and impartial to staff concerns and acknowledging outstanding work performance."
good,"Office would have been nicer to work in if it were maintained by a maintenance service"
good,Worked for quite a long time for this company and to be honest they did not impress me in the least. I did not feel that they cared about the employees at all. Very minimal compensation and expectations are very high. High stress and lots of favoritism.
good,"A good workplace with congenial colleagues.  Work atmosphere is casual, but professional.  Environment with guests arriving for their appointment can be challenging at times.  Job requires a very pleasant demeanor at all times as this is a service oriented industry.  Clients can be hostile at times when dealing with their taxes."
good,"HR Block is a great company but the pay at the seasonal capacity is  low. However, the allow opportunities for advancement by offering professional development courses."
good,H&R Block has a very friendly and customer driven mindset. They do award bonuses to people who've worked hard at their jobs and people who do well do not go unrecognized.
good,"Fun, exciting work place.  Always learning new and interesting tax theory's.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the client's to maximize their refunds."
good,Great break from the winter. Excellent seasonal position. Engages the mind. Opportunities to meet a wide variety of people and help them with their tax situation.
good,"It was  a pleasant place to work co-workers were very nice and helpful.  For me it was very uncomfortable to call an old client three to four time a month to see if they wanted to schedule an appointment to complete their income taxes for the year."
good,Great friendly staff who takes pride in helping clients with their tax-returns. As a customer service rep. greeting the clients in-person and over the telephone was very important. Over-all a great learning experience for me.
good,typical seasonal work place. good for college student or stay home mom but not to have a living out of it. pay wise is not the best either
good,"Very good training on tax preparation and enhances your analytical skill, people skill and customer service skill. No work after the season, only higher positions on tax level get's the chance to work after the tax season."
good,A great opportunity for someone who loves to work with finances and work one on one with clients.  It was a franchise and there were many changes when it changed to Corporate.
good,"This is a good company to work for.  The environment was friendly, helpful and the experience was great.  I was recommend others to work for a company like this."
good,"Really love the job and really appreciate my coworkers;  and hope to return next season; but it's a seasonal position, without any benefits."
good,I was young starting off in this position but it was a good experience. It was a few years ago but they had a great staff and awesome management.
good,"Well mainly all positions are seasonal, there are no benefits available and no recognition. Coworkers are okay if you get along otherwise it would be a lot of people throwing one another under the bus. The offices don't like to cooperate with our department which can make the resolutions rather stressful. "
good,Fun staff full of energy. Fast pace n enjoyable office. Dealt with friendly and upset clients which made for a great new working experience.
good,I worked only 1 season as a level 1 tax advisor.  The training was great although you pay for it out of pocket and the management was very supportive.
good,"Though I learned a lot in a short amount of time, this in fact was the problem. Compensation does not fit workload. As a Manager you are not prepared fully for all the system challenges and work arounds unless you've been there for some time."
good,Good company great staff.  I work with amazing people within the company.  I would work for the company again if the pay was higher.
good,Great co-workers and flexibility. Get to meet all kinds of people and help them on their taxes to make sure they got their billions back.
good,"Taxes is a difficult business, you must be customer focused and sales driven.  The company makes many changes year to year so you must be able to adapt.  I find most people shy away from taxes because it seems so complicated, but in reality it is not that difficult to comprehend."
good,"*A great deal of clients, while a long weekend crowded shopping center keeps very busy until late evening. The telephone ringing the hole day, while some people came into the office to look for information before the day goes to the end and another regular week approaches and also the busy routine."
good,"Was a great learning experience. Thought the training could have been a little bit better, but all in all it was a great learning experience"
good,Learned about preparing tax returns. Met a very diverse group of people. Helped me to prepare my own returns and of family members.
good,"They are always changing things for the better, improving they way that the customer is serviced some work and some don't but they never stop changing sometime at they expense of the customer with the rising of the cost of tax prep fees."
good,"Compute taxes owed or over paid, following tax form instructions and tax tables."
good,"A typical day in an H&R office is rather enjoyable. It is a strong positive environment with the perfect model of team work. We are all here to assist one another. At times it can be very fast paced and others rather slow paced but there is always something to do."
good,"Busy time of the year - needed more stability in shifts, but otherwise cool. Application process was difficult. Employees were fun and great to work with. Easy job and fun"
good,"In a typical day I would open and close shop, greet and inform clients, direct them to the appropriate professionals, schedule clients, and prepare and organize client portfolios."
good,"Learning new job skills every year"
good,"Deal with taxes and people always wanting money or trying to figure out how to get over on the government."
good,"The only thing that H & R  Block had was that they paid 1st year tax pros very little. Besides the fact that the tax pros had to pay for their own H&R Block education, the return on investment was very low. The say they're basically paying you to learn the first year but the amount of work that you have to do is not fair compared to others and the compensation is not enough to keep pros around for the next tax season, unless they don't need the job to survive"
good,I opened and closed the store. I answered and scheduled appointments for tax preparation. I answered questions about taxes.
good,"this job is seasonal, and after every season they would call and ask for me to return. unfortunately the third year they called me i registered for school and was unable to return but i really enjoyed it and if i werent in nursing school i would go back."
good,"•	Deliver Outstanding Client Experience"
good,"I ran a very busy tax office and helped with many others, I was directly involved in the mass hiring process. I worked in the main office as well helping with booking. I really enjoyed the marketing aspect. I loved my employees. The hardest part is when you can't help someone. I love meet people from different walk of life."
good,"I enjoyed this job because I received more experience in office work. The most enjoyable part was meeting different clients everyday and learning new systems and somewhat how to prepare taxes. The hardest part was juggling the busy days and keeping everything calm and manageable. Without a doubt, that's how I learned to multitask."
good,The most enjoyable part of this position is the concern and care the professionals have for their clients. It is also the deep relationship that is forged between a company and their clients.
good,I loved to work here.  I interviewed the clients and verified their filing status in the computer. It was fun and enjoyable experiences.
good,"I greeted customers, obtained documentation, prepared tax returns, and explained the return to the customer."
good,Primarily a part-time position company. Ideal for people who are employed elsewhere and are looking for that extra paycheck.
good,I worked one tax to gain extra experience. Needed something more full time.
good,I like the job so far it is full fo good information great people to work with hours seem coll pay is wonderful. Only if it wasn't seasonal :( You get to enjoy independence while at work no mangers hoovering over you. If you need anything everyone is so willing to assist I never feel like I have just been left in the dark about things I did not know.
good,"Was not a stable job."
good,"Overall the work-place was a very friendly environment. Everyday was filled with hard work, however, I looked forward to going there every morning, it was a very interesting place to work."
good,"You have to work all the time. Yes, co-workers are cordial and helping as we share information and help each other. Management style is proactive. The hardest part of this job is to phone calls to old clients and most enjoyable part is appreciation form clients as well as from management."
good,"Major downfall was seasonality of position but that is expected working in tax."
good,"Working with my employees at HR Block was awesome"
good,Worked with wonderful people who helped and guided me through some difficult entries.
good,everyone working together during tax season to get taxes processed in a timely manner in order for clients to recieve their refund.
good,Preparing income taxes and working with the public. Working with a team of professionals.
good,They worry about how much money they are missing out or that they will own and that can be confused as them being aggressive but it's a good start.
good,"A typical day would be answering the telephones, setting appointments, filing and helping clients."
good,"Work as a Tax professional since 2007"
good,This was a seasonal job during tax season. Scheduling appointments and answering phones.
good,Seasonal opportunity is always great for the extra $$$ and knowledge
good,"H&R Block – Ashbridge Square, Downingtown, PA   Associate – Seasonal                  2011, 2012 & 2014                                                     "
good,The taxpros are nice people. This is a good office to work in - management cares about the staff and customers.
good,"Tax preparation"
good,"when I use my knowledge, I can help my client make more money."
good,"I worked at H&R Block as a CSP for one tax season. Tax prepares will many nights sit doing nothing, yet expect you to clean up after them. Even the manager dropping food in the floor and asking you to pick it up. Managers should have more respect for their employees."
good,"ouverture de l'entreprise et parfois il y a déjà des clients qui attendent.Ouverture de la caisse et mise en marche des machines et ordinateurs. Enregistrement des clients et orientation. Répondre au téléphone et prendre des rendez-vous. Parfois il est un peu difficile de démarrer quand il y a plein de monde qui attend. Mais une fois démarrée, la journée est plus agréable car on rencontre de nouvelles personnes qui sont plus ou moins aimables."
good,"Enjoyed the work, learned a lot about Canadian Tax Laws, and co-workers were great and helped one another. Always felt the fee charged to do a tax return was a little high, especially the fee that seniors had to pay. When you consider the knowledge required to complete even the simplest tax return the remuneration was not all that great."
good,"open office, make coffee for clients,  straighten  front office chairs clean floor turn sign on (open) check drawer for cash needed for payment transactions. sign on computer sign in on time in site. I learned that which is people that was from other country's  always bring someone with them to translate to us what they wanted and needed , which made my job easy. they just don't show up. wanting taxes done unprepared. sometimes on down times close to tax seasons whine down,  the hardest part was told to go outside and do  marketing . and solicit people to come in and leave flyers on cars to advertise  tax business . never ready for that, and  the weather could be bad.....the most enjoyable part of my job. meeting people, working with the tax professionals ."

good,Good company with many opportunities. Staff was friendly and pace was consistent.
good,There was the balance of the new trainees and the long timers. Some old timers made it all the way up to top management. The environment of the offices became controlled by the standards and ideals of the cliques of long time workers. And they could very competitive and closed as to who would become one of the long timers. But that's the way most job places are.
good,"under the old management the workers were more relaxed, and more passionate about their jobs, and the products we had. Now that I'm no- longer a worker their I can see it more and more how much the tax pros are not as friendly, All they care about is doing your return as fast as they can so they can hurry up and get to the next customer."

I learned a lot of valuable life lessons in dealing with people as well as tax information through this job.  Each office was run differently and one was much more enjoyable to work at than the other for this reason.
good,Working at H & R Block was hectic and challenging. Over all it was a good experience.

good,It was only for tax season but it was great learning in customer service and clerical skills.
good,small office setting greeted clients answered phone scheduled appts filed hrs worked great around my schedule
good,It is a fun work environment. Employees are very motivated as the DM. The management team (WHQ) is not connecting in the right way with employees and clients.
good,Being a client service professional was very easy. It is a glorified receptionist. Scheduling appointments was the only real job duty. Not a bad gig.
good,"Since is a seasonal job, the opportunity to advance is short."
good,3 months of training for all new updates in tax laws and the actual tax season so short

good,a typical day at work
good,"Daily, I administered operations in a fast paced environment. Track and Measure forecasted budgets and goals daily. Prepare tax returns, address and resolve client concerns along with cash management."
good,It was a new experience in a call center during tax season. I was a contractor at H&R Block.
good,A typical day was answering numerous phone calls as well as greeting customers on a walk-in basis. All staff kept extremely busy and worked together to make the day run as smoothly as possible.
good,"I got along with my coworkers well. It was fun meeting the taxpayers, educating them by answering their questions and making sure their information was transmitted correctly to the Internal Revenue Service."

The most enjoyable part of my job is serving the clients and working with my H&R Block team."
good,"Very diverse cases involving tax preparation, and tax and financial planning for individuals, estates, pass-through entities and other business entities. Client spectrum spanned from most diverse incomes and from different nationalities - including (remotely) overseas clients. A very stimulating environment of collaboration with specialists in diverse areas of taxes and finance."
good,"Friendly environment and a lot of help from employees, I learn a lot of techniques to handle customers."
good,"I did not mind working at the place, but found it unfair a receptionist with no experience earned more hourly than a tax specialist. Also most of the co workers had more seniority and earned a commission so getting clients to a desk with you would be impossible as management only listened to seniority."
good,Helping clients and other preparers in tax office procedures and tax stiuations.
good,"Jobs are available during the tax season which is generally January 1 through April 18. The hours vary anywhere between 6 and 30 hours a week, with the busiest times in the first two weeks of February and April. Employees indicate when they can be available for work, such as days or evenings, week days or weekends, so it is a good supplemental position for someone who has another job."

good,this is a great company to work for I really enjoyed myself I wished that I shoud have replied for the company but the future for me is always open
good,Learned a lot and enjoyed the opportunity to showcase what I was taught throughout my time there.
good,"H&R Block is a good seasonal job. The hours are flexible and the people I work with are fantastic. The company is committed to providing great client service, from reception to tax prep. Because there are many H&R Block offices throughout the city, the chances of you working in your own neighborhood are likely. They are also committed to retaining seasonal employees for the next tax season."
good,"I enjoyed preparing taxes, assisting clients and building my client base. New prepares have less opportunity to work. Maybe due to the economy and seasoned tax prepareres that have been around HR Block"
good,"a place where little is much when it is an extra income to aid you and your life style as long as you are able to get hours to work. Therefore, more hours will make up for lack of pay."
good,Great place to work. Long term employment. work with you around your availability. Lots of training is provided to new associates entering the company.
good,"Most employees and field are focused on serving clients.  Good company culture. Good pay compared to market, benefits are average.  Despite efforts to create new revenue streams and improve existing core services, there has been no significant improvement for years.  Expect ongoing reduction in force efforts to continue."
good,"I enjoyed filing taxes for people, especially families got big refund. The fees HR Block charged way to expensive, I got sad with families struggled. I like my manager, he was a good manager and very supportive."
good,It is a seasonal job.  Does not pay well.  Need to spend 3 month every year upgrading with tax guidelines and changes.  Great experience and gain lot of tax knowledge.
good,"Very fast-paced the closer the April 15, got crazy fast.  But I loved it.  The skills and knowledge gained helped me in my own filings, as well as friends and family."
good,Flexible schedule with pay commensurate with cumulative results. Requires yearly interview for rehire and CE education to stay current. Recommend as much additional learning as possible
good,"Meeting many people. Enjoyed helping them help very comfortable about there visit, Learned that each person has many different life styles.Keeping the office clean and schedule appointment to help very busy tax advisors to have breaks and better work schedules."
good,"What I like about this job is contact with clients, independent and teamwork, working in a fast-paced environment, good organization and workplace culture."
good,It is fun and competitive to gain clients trust as we all earn by commission besides hourly rate. We gain lots of knowledge and can definitely use the experience in life decisions.
good,"Colleagues were great to work with.  Everyone had everyone's back.  Management was nice and approachable.  We had one-hour lunch breaks.  Answering phones and making appointments filled our day, along with creating client folders and providing great customer service."
good,"I've worked for H&R Block for 10 years now and have been through 3 district managers, 4 regional managers and 3 CEO's.  I've been an office manager as well as a tax pro and find that each year the changes in both those positions are generally detrimental to the financial health of the employee.  Communication company wide is not timely and is poorly expressed.  Changes are made in such a manner as to leave employees with a take it or leave it attitude from upper management.  I enjoy working with my clients and have a great team of tax pros in the office where I work. I continue to put up with the upper management glitches because of  these benefits."
good,"Good journey I was pregnant and everyone was very understanding,  we made a good team,  bad part job is only seasonal and they kept on relocating the office"
good,"H&R Block is a great place to learn the basics of tax returns however, the company does not reward tax preparers with much in terms of compensation and often the jobs at local offices were ended after tax season."
good,"Seasonal positions make up the large majority of the staff.  Because of this, the employee benefits are scarce.  There is health insurance, but that is about it.  Expectations are high, but very achievable.  Rules are bent for some, while others are held to them very strictly."
good,Solid Company policies with out benefits due to being classified as Seasonal employees. Great company partnerships for staff development and training.
good,"I love working at H&R Block, my tasks are easy enough to do and I enjoy my co workers, management and clients.  I really learned a lot about taxes as well as how to handle upset clients."
good,"Block is an awesome part-time job for the beginning of the year. There are tools to help learn more but they are difficult to find.  The hardest part of the job is to tell a client they have to pay, rather than receive a refund."
good,"This is a good job for retired people or others who can put other things on hold during tax season (especially Jan-Feb).  You must be detail-oriented, good with math, and be willing to invest a significant amount of time Aug-Dec in training."
good,"I hate I accepted a management position, I made more as a preparer unless you have an extremely high volume store. I did make a bonus but at the end of the season, just not a big one"
good,"This job is one of the most stressful ones I've had so far due to it only being a ""seasonal"" job for the upcoming tax season. The environment is very laid back but the people aren't so much."
good,I would say this is a good place if you don't want a career. Alot of drama at times. Most everyone is easy to get along with. Clients can be demanding but that is with any work place.
good,A typical day Helping both customer with appointments and walk in's doing all federal and State tax forms. Calling customer and setting up appointments
good,I just wished I could of gotten more hours and worked longer days and longer opportunity to work all year. My office was good to work in it was like a family atmosphere.
good,Make sure office is staffed and aware of what the goals and changes are for the day.  Resolve issues and customer complaints.  Prepare tax returns.  Coach and train new hires.
good,its a franchise office so they don't do like corporate offices.  they don't offer benefits or believe in pay raises.  but overall great people to work for. they are understanding about family issues and don't mind when you have to take off to take care of things. they offer tanning and gym for free
good,This is a great place to work during tax season. Lots of hours for a few months. Work with nice people. Flexible scheduling. Minimum wage though. But overtime during busy season.
good,I enjoyed working here and helping people with their taxes. Just being involved at the office and with the community was a rewarding feeling. I did not like the cliches and bickering between co workers about petty stuff.
good,My work for H&R Block is seasonal.  I have enjoyed my time working there every season with the exception of the last tax season.  The manager didn't put me on the schedule and a lot of my clients were given to other people.  One young lady was pregnant and she was able to come back and work  one week after delivering the baby.  Laws and policies weren't carried out.
good,"In a typical office setting you have the tax preparers who are driving the business in for the company, as well as the income for the shareholder. The hardest part of the job is the tax preparers are not paid accordingly for the job they are doing. This is a seasonal job but if it was not for the tax professional but since the company pay at such a low rate sometimes that is the quality of work a lot of the tax professional put out. I enjoy the enter action with clients and seeing the end results when I am finish with my client. You have many opportunities to educate your client and gain their respect."
good,Good place to work if your entry level and looking to gain experience in Front Desk/ Receptionist positions. Wish they paid more and schedule better with more hours.
good,"This was a temporary job, during the tax season.  Most of my day would consist of answering the phone and welcoming clients.  I would screen their tax needs and assign them with the appropriate tax preparer.  I would also verify their identity and provide them their tax return checks that may be at the office."
good,It helped to understand US taxation and also my interest get me to do volunteer hours with UW for Tax seasons as free tax preparer. It was fun to meet diff people
good,H&R Block provided me with a great experience. Being a tax professional helped me put my foot into the business world and learn valuable skills in Tax and accounting. Being finance major I hope to translate these skills into Investment Banking and Equity Research opportunities.
good,I loved my position at H & R Block.  The majority of my coworkers were wonderful to work with.  I was able to obtain my Enrolled Agent license through Block.  All around good experience
good,Fast paced place to work. I managed 15 people on a daily basis. Most of my team were team players. I gad a few bad apples. The culture was mixed. The hardest part was getting people to follow directions
good,If you like doing taxes this is a great place to start. They provide lots of training and support. Managers are very knowledgeable in taxation. Everyday was a different day. You need to have tough skin with certain customers because if they are not receiving a return they will be very upset and blame you.
good,Receptionist position is entirely too much work for $8.75 an hour. Good if you’re using it for a second job because hours are limited. You are constantly calling clients to set up appointments if they haven’t already. Hated that part felt like I was working in a call center.
good,Awesome. I do like working here I just wish I could get more hours so I can make a good amount of money. Other than that it's not a bad place to work.
good,"The atmosphere is very busy and stressful. There are several challenges faced daily. There really is very little home life til after april 15th."
good,This is a company that works with mostly tax returns. It is a seasonal position for the tax preparers. The more returns they do the more money they make.
good,"Great growth potential with the right training and motivation.  Staff members very friendly and supportive. Not enough hours when ‘rush’ is over. "
good,"always learning and great satisfaction knowing you help someone"
good,"Working here was pretty cool. It's a good experience. I learned a lot about tax laws. The only thing I did dislike was marketing. It was just not for me, but I had to do it."
good,"Learning to do taxes and serving clients was challenging, rewarding and interesting.  The starting pay was low, considering the amount of training and responsibility needed.  However, as you build your clientele, I am told you can make decent money within 3-5 years.  Learning tax rules can also benefit your personal tax situation, so your time is not wasted."
good,Needs better management and less favoritism. Overall a good work place to start and learn something new about taxes. If you love helping clients this would be a good job to start off
good,Nos sommes souvent seul dans le bureau et on a de grosses sommes d'argent.
good,"Loved working at H&R Block as the receptionist, Very great working place with lovely people. loved assisting customers and helping them getting there taxes done."
good,"very fast paced work environment, great learning opportunites."
good,"Good place to work is you if you only want to work 4 months out of the year. There is no path to full time year round work for most employees, pay is OK, it's a commission job, if you want to make more $ you can, its up to you! I'd like it as a job in retirement but it'll never get you there by itself."
good,"My day at H&R block usual starts with me greeting my co workers an making a pot of coffee, we all pitch in to get the office ready for the day. After the normal routine is done, I start with reminder calls of clients who have appointments coming up, as well clients who may need appointments changed for that day. After phone calls and customer contact has been made, We really just do what needs to be done after that, could be anything from greeting a new client, to taking a payment or my manager giving me paperwork to file,"
good,"Preparing tax returns for clients, arranging appointments for new  and returning customers.  "
good,"super busy during the tax season with not much financial benefits, very close to where i resided so it was beneficial for me but not much to do after the tax season was over"
good,Great Seasonal job if you are looking to do something for a couple months. They are willing to teach if you are willing to learn plus you get a discount when you need to do your taxes
good,The position I held was really an easy one. I made sure that the clients were contacted in regards to appointment times. The material used was ready for each appointment. Calls answered in a timely manner. The atmosphere was friendly.
good,schedule was for seasonal employment. company was very flexible with scheduling. however during peak time they need to have more than one CSR working in order to provided optimum service as required by this company.
good,"My coworkers were great, but the tax side of things was not where I wanted to be."
good,When your district operations coordinator talks down to office mgrs; is hateful to everyone she speaks to; fails to do her job and when her mgr and upper mgmnt are told and do NOTHING it is a slap in the face and brings down moral in the office. Upper Mgmt needs to listen to the ones that work to pay her or his check. Poor confidence in upper mgmt
good,l feel the company is about making money and does not show appreciation for employees.  Goal accomplishments are never enough they become more interested in raising the bar to make more money.
good,Good job -you get to meet new people and help them with something that is usually a daunting experience.  The  employees really care about each other.
good,"I loved it. It does take about 4 years before pay is decent. Must constantly take classes, no pay for it, done on your time. Pay is based on education level, how many repeat customers, and what you sell."
good,Great place to gain experience in taxation since the company provides training and a job placement. Friendly and helpful management made the work environment very pleasant.
good,It was just a part time job. I like the company policy but they are having troubles trying to get new customers ant keep it. I do my best with my customers and I will keep it like that
good,It was fun when I first started because it was more about the clients and their needs than it became more about the money. Finally we were not able to help some people that needed help because of the money
good,You are able to work according to your availability. Every tax season there are courses available for your own personal advancement in the company. It is really rewarding to help people get the most out of their tax returns.
good,"The hours are great and they let you set your own schedule.  The pay is based on previous years sells numbers, so if your office is slow then your pay is low.  Too much pressure to sell extra add ons at the end of the tax interview.  The prices they charge are really high especially for low income clients.  They offer great classes and education opportunities to become more knowledgeable to prepare more complicated taxes, which will increase your pay."
good,Work life balance is very good. It's responsible work so the salaries should be higher. But overall a decent respectable place to work. Upper management is knowledgeable and friendly.
good,The hours were cut when the office was slow.  Their bonus package is difficult to reach.  It was temporary seasonal work.  Have programs and practice taxes to help you learn.
good,"This job is more for someone who is looking for something temporarily/seasonally. I think that the training could've been a little better. But as for my co-workers, they weren't as outgoing and upbeat for me. I'm sure that isn't true for all H&R Block offices."
good,"I thought this was a full-time permanent position, and it was temporary and part-time for tax season only."
good,"A Typical Day in the office starts once associates walk in the door, with a smile from the front Client Service Professional/Receptionist, and a hello from the Office Manager, if they're present in their front office space. "
good,"•	Inquires incoming and outgoing calls."
good,"The manager I had told me I did not need to sit there and chat with the customers. She just wanted me to get them in and out. I did not agree with that. If I am going to be handling someones taxes, I want them to be comfortable with me. The hardest part of the job was while everyone else was rushing people in and out, I was the slowest. But I had less mistakes, and the people were comfortable with me and the information I provided them with once they were done. The easiest part of the job was working the system used to calculate the taxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to spend time with people from all different lifestyles."
good,I believe in the company but more attention should be paid to fair compensation. I have learned skills that will be very useful in the future.
good,New and older tax prepares.  Very busy just before taxes were to be filed.  Went to all training sessions and received top grades.  My co-workers were great.  Enjoyed meeting the same clients year after year.
good,I could be asked to travel to anyone of my 192 offices if I was needed to resolve a serious problem. My coworkers were all great people. My managers were a joy to work with also. The hardest part of the job was traveling and working late at night sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that we had a family atmosphere in our work environment.
good,"As a tax preparer, I enjoy meeting with clients and helping the with their questions and concerns to maximize their returns.  I enjoyed the opportunities of working one-on-one with clients and manipulating the numbers to work for clients benefits (legally, of course).  "
good,"Seasonal job, very responsible, customer service at a very high  level, training starts in September, four month before Tax season, because Tax low changing every year. You do not get paid for the training"
good,"I am fine with seasonal employment because it allows me to take 8 weeks or more off to do home projects and/or travel.  However, Seasonal positions benefits are non existant.  No Vacation, Sick accrual, or Holiday pay.  If not for ACA, there would be no Medical Insurance.  Vision or Dental is not available.  Seasonal Associates are just as accountable as a regular associate who enjoy all the benefits listed above.  However, I do agree that Seasonal Associates should perform the job that we are hired for at the best of our abilities.  The leadership is great, as are the coworkers.  The Position I hold is Front Line Support which is challenging because we answer calls for all the Reg and Seasonal Corporate and Field associates who have questions about payroll, Benefits, HR Status and want to report an Associate Relation Position. We have to have some knowledge about everything HR.  This is the hardest part of the job.  The easiest part of the job is repeat issues that you already know how to answer or resolve"
good,This is a good company to work  for it is chance for advancement and the pay is great you are just spread thin because there are not enough workers.
good,This is only a part time job starting late December or early January through April 15th. You will learn how to prepare tax returns which is very useful. Work is scheduled based on your availability which is great too.
good,Great chance to learn and apply tax law. Great educational and continuing educational classes. Not a great place to earn a living. Compensation is not in alignment with job responcibilities and time invested.Good seasonal job if that is what you are interested in. A number of retired individuals become tax pros.
good,Tax preparers are selected by the complexity of the tax returns.  As first year preparer I did some returns and learned due diligence by working with fellow tax preparers.  As receptionist I asked questions to match the tax payer with the correct tax preparer.
good,"Wonderful place to work. I was able to create my own schedule, which at the time with a small child was helpful. I was able to learn the tax codes for individual and small business tax returns. The people I worked with were wonderful and easy to work with."
good,I very much enjoy the work I do helping clients deal with tax issues and submit their annual tax return.  HRB is fairly flexible with work schedules and pay during tax season is competitive (100% commission).  Pay during off-season is poor.
good,I would come in sit in my assigned area. If I received a phone call I would instruct the customers how to handle certain process in the tax software. I would also wait for clients to come in. From there I would complete tax returns then follow up when the process was complete. I essentially learned how to use tax software to complete returns. The hardest part of the job was initially learning the software and the hardest part also became the easiest once I mastered how to use it.
good,"I worked in a franchise for a variety of different locations. The training was excellent, though the hours varied each week."
good,"I love doing taxes and helping people and learned so much working for HR Block."
good,My office manager was very critical of every single thing I did in the office and I started getting sick all of a sudden so she mad my life miserable so I left.
good,My typical day at work is sitting at the computer answering phone calls and giving the clients their money. I also organize the folders in alphabet order.
good,"Work at the peak of the season is very stressful; however, it gives you a sense of satisfaction. the rest of the time, time at the office passes by nicely and smooth. a lot of team work involved and good communication between employees and the manager. the pay is the least fun part there!!"
good,"To make sure each client is satisfied with their taxes, the goal is to educated each client about there taxes and help them get the maxim amount of refund. Or if a client pays taxes help them to understand why they had to pay. The environment is very relaxed and calm."
good,"Prepared tax returns and successfully managed the office located inside a very credible store in the mall. Client interview, organized and filed documents, coordinated work betweeb=n two offices, good team work with the coworkers, hardest part of the job was when returns submitted electronically would get stuck and glitches with the software, The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and interviewing new clients from different background, and delivering good services and satisfaction of the clients."
good,"A normal day of work in this company is making income taxes, answer CALLS, serve customers, advertising ... etc"
good,"Developed and Managed a Military Tax office located at Naval Station Newport for the last 4 years. Prior to that Managed two different type 3 Tax office {Larger client base and revenue generating offices} and for five years. Started working for H & R Block in December of 1999 as a tax Associate, and as of the end of the Tax season in April 2014 was a Senior Tax Advisory 4 and Office Manager. Developed and implemented marketing for the Office at NavStaNpt for the last 4 years. Set up Work Schedules, client service satisfaction , tech services, fiduciary responsibility, and developed and maintained close contact with our clients and our hosting sponsors."
good,"A typical day at work is to meet with client with a positive and know it attitude. I learnt how to handle clients in a very professional way. My co-workers were God sent, atleast 90% of them and they were ever ready to teach me what I was willing to learn. The hardest part of the job was having to clean someone else's mess in the bathroom and the most enjoyable part of the job were the new clients I met daily. That really was AWESOME."
good,"Prepared and assisted in completing tax returns for individuals and small businesses"
good,"I love working for H&R Block, the only hard part is that if you're a new preparer with no clients you will get BORED, there is not much to do if you're working 60 hours a week with no days off and your boss snapping at you to do something. In the beginning of tax season its awesome, in the middle its pretty tedious. Once you start getting regular clientele then your days go by pretty fast."
good,"At H&R Block, I learned a lot about handling a variety of customer service situations. However, the pay and benefits are poor, so this company attracts a lot of people who are desperate for a job and not necessarily skilled. The staff who have been there for several years were a pleasure to work with and we learned each other's work habits and requirements and hence, worked well together. The unskilled staff made the job very difficult, because those of us who are experienced usually end up making up for the mistakes of the others. Training left much to be desired. What I learned, I did throughout my years of on the job learning from others. Formal training never really prepared you for real time situations. This is very discouraging to new hires and most do not come back the next year. "
good,"Due to a short season, tax preparation is hectic and requires long days in order to best utilize the compensation plan. This job can be really rewarding if you like working with new people."
good,"Low pay for high customer service, seasonal, wish I had more time there not just four months"
good,"After successfully completing my tax classes, I was hired by H&R Block as a Tax Associate. During the first tax season, I had the opportunity to be in contact with clients of different origins and educational background. I learnt a lot from them while going through my on the job training."
good,a typical day at H&R Block was coming in reading all new consona topics regarding changes within hr block. Also I would log into the phone and be ready to make outbound and take inbound calls to deliquent clients. What I learned is to be more patient and everyone must be treated with respect. I worked on a wonderful team of 21 of my peers. The hardest part of my job was when our campaign was low and very little work available. The most enjoyable part of my job being able to educate clients on products and services HR Block offered.
good,"Marketing Professional with experience executing various marketing and public relations activities in order to build strong internal and external professional relationships.  Works well with all levels of employees and management.  Results oriented leader who integrates problem solving, communication, and analytical skills to achieve maximum customer benefit while achieving business objectives."
good,"Best thing about this job was the benefits, 401(k), health/dental insurance, ESPP discount, bonus checks."
good,A typical day at work is to prepare tax returns for many people and get pay $9 an hour
good,"answering calls, greeting clients, explaining tax laws, product services and doing taxes. Great manager and co-workers. The hardest part of the job I would have to say the tax laws because they are always changing and you must stay current but I enjoy it all."
good,"The job is okay, management is great! But the flexibility and the factors of working schedules at the time of employment are not taking into consideration later on down the road. When you are expected to take a shift that not only conflicts with your livelihood of raising a toddler but also you schooling to maintain a degree. Other than that i enjoied my time with co-workers and management very friendly and supportable"
good,One of the most interesting job that I enjoyed.
good,my duties were to answer customer calls regarding technical issues that were caused by the product .. more like a supply and demand type of environment
good,I worked with customers to meet their tax needs. Also advised on what to do for next year. I have to train from Sept to Dec every year. I was able to manage my own clients. I was able to assist my co-workers with their questions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,Tax preparation is an interesting job.
good,Supported 40+ offices throughout the tax season.. Everything IT related was covered.
good,"Typical day scheduling client for tax preparation, registering clients for tax preparation courses. Answering multi-phone lines and entering demographics into the system."
good,H&R Block is a great company to work for and hone on your leadership skills. It provides extensive amount of coaching and training while providing you the tools to be successful. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all your Associates and building a relationship with them. The Associates care about what they do and their clients. The is a great deal of team work at H&R Block.
good,"I found it a joy to be welcomed so warmly every single time I came in to work. I was appreciated and treated great. We all worked as a team and everyone helped each other out. Customers came first, but immediately after that, your fellow workers. Clean, professional office. Work days and hours were mostly set by you. The only reason it wasn't rated higher overall was because everyone was underpaid, especially the tax preparers who went through lots of training to do what they do and know what they know. Way underpaid for what Block pulls in on a yearly basis."
good,I think H&R Blook has been the best company to learn about the tax system in the United States.
good,"The company provides the BEST in training for federal and state tax preparation, and has a set standard for promotions. There are no financial rewards so you have to really care about providing your clients with the best service available."
good,Very good working enviornment but stressful because you have to deal with different kind of people with different tax returns.
good,fun place to work at. My co workers make my job easy they also make it easier to come into work the next day. They are very helpful and try to make sure you are happy while taking calls.
good,Good experience of work in providing financial services. Communication skills along with client handling is learnt well. There is great support from the team and seniors at work.
good,Only busy a few months of the year. Laid off most the year. Pay wasn't good. Long hours during peak season. The manager was my mother so...I mean it could have been alot worse I'm sure
good,"Servicing Clients is the most enjoyable part of my job. Educating clients how to make tax laws work for them is satisfying. "
good,Face paced great managment hours are great. Room for advancement. Hardest part of the job is when it gets busy. But iver al it's a great environment to work in. Mostly for retirement Seniors looking to supplement thier income.
good,"A typical day at work as a Client Services Coordinator consisted of taking calls, greeting customers, scheduling appointments, cleaning, organizing office supplies, and working directly with the office manager."
good,Experience working here will depend on where you are in your career or life. Great people to collaborate with and opportunity to meet and serve clients. This is not a place to work to provide for a family.
good,"This company will fade into obsolescence in as its customer base dies of old age. The two types of customers are: people who cannot figure out turbotax, and people with truly convoluted tax returns."
good,"HRB is a seasonal job that requires their employees to treat every day as 4 days. While most companies require monthly or weekly performance reports, HRB reviews daily production. This creates one of the fastest paced environments iv ever worked it. It was very challenging and while at times very stressful it created a self sense of accomplishment. HRB also offers a very generous educational program on all aspects of Tax Preparation. This allows its employees to go from novice to government certified Tax Agents. The office environment can become very competitive as everyone fights for clients to get the largest bonuses."
good,It was a good place to work.  My management team micro managed people.  Favored men.  It depends on your manager and who you work for.  They lay off people allot since they are a seasonal business.
good,Started as Customer Service Professional in field office. Ended up as First Year Tax Associate. HR Block has paid training if you are an employee so that is a bonus.
good,Working together as a team and training needs improvement from when I started over 10 years ago.  There needs to be more in person training instead of mostly all online training.  Some people learn better if there is an instructor and other class mates to bounce questions off of.
good,"Good place to work, fairly simple, also you work with a good staff. Offer you to take a class to advance your knowledge in tax preparation ( voluntary )."
good,Overall it's a pretty cool laid back job! When peak season hit it can be a bit stressful. Also when peak season ends your only working 1 day a week until the end of tax season then hours slightly pick up. I wouldn't recommend this job as a full time position because if you have bills to pay you will definitely be looking else where for income. Great job for someone who's looking to make extra income with a full time job.
good,"I worked for this company for 33 years. I was a franchise owner of 5 offices. I loved my job, I just needed a change. I was burnt out after this many years. It was time for a career change."
good,"My first time working as a tax professional was okay. I was able to learn a lot about the industry. I successfully completed training and was encouraged to apply for the job."
good,"Enjoy the people that I'm working with, don't feel the company it's receptionist enough. The new manager so far is good to work with, whenever I'm scheduled, not getting any hours."
good,"Working at H&R Block overall was a great experience, My manager was great at her job which made being a part of the team easy. My co-workers & clients were also very nice people to work with."
good,"The tax pros get paid off commission so they would try and bully the receptionist into giving new clients to them first. My manager was never there, I believe he ran three stores. The work was easy but could get boring."
good,Atypical day at block is very fast paces because when the doors open we have clients all day i learned to be very patient with people and make them comfortable. If there's a problem in the office immediately get my supervisor and assist her or him if needed.the hardest part of a fast past job is keeping up with the demands of the office.
good,"Enjoy the people I work with and I understand the company doing hiring on a part time seasonal basis. would like to do this job as a full time employee, which Block doesn't do."
good,"some customers can be irate. some weeks were busier than others, but could always take a break to get some food from the surrounding area. Was able to always make changes to schedule."
good,Great history at H & R Block but the company went public and the management style changed many times over the years.  Job function changed from the basis of the company to a sales oriented job.
good,"Helping people with questions and concerns.   Gettin a tax tax refund for someone that wasn’t expecting one is great."
good,"Flexible place to work...with lots of room for growth. Pleasant place to go to, people were great-especially the office manager. This is more of a part time job/seasonal position than a full time career."
good,"I enjoyed working at HR Block. They were very flexible and it was a good seasonal job. When the pay scale changed which decreased my bonus, it was no longer worth my time and effort to continue with the company."
good,H&R Block is good for a beginning tax preparer.  The pay is mainly commission based.  It is hard to build a following because of the fees that H&R Block charges.  Also management is not consistent so you are not guaranteed certain hours.
good,"I didn't like the fact that when tax season is over, you're out of a job. They also laid off a lot of CPS's this last year because there was not enough work. I feel they should be more cautious about that in the hiring process."
good,Seasonal Job so seasonal attitude of many people. During slow days only a few people work so you may only work 1 or 2 days a week. Hard to get commission when client decide not to return
good,"The day consisted of assisting many clients as well as filing personal documents. The pace effort was manageable, as well as to what was required of us as CSP's."
good,"This job was super chill. There were things to do that kept you occupied, but hardly any of those things required you to leave the front desk. Everyone was super nice and would come and talk to me at the desk. This is a great part time job for students, who only have classes on certain days or for half a day. The management was also very easygoing."
good,"Fast paced, stressful as the tax season progressed.  Taxes are a stressful situation for many people. I learned a lot from my very helpful, knowledgeable Manager.  Working with the public takes a lot of patience and tact."
good,Loved my job didn't always agree with the rules or how they wanted things done the flexibility with the schedule worked great for me got treated to meals when quota was met and for a job well done.
good,i enjoyed my time at Hr Block.  I wound up with a full time position at another company that limited my time i was able to devote to them so i left the company
good,"Some days were busy and productive, but the slow days were boring.  The people I worked with were great and willing to help with problems.  The hardest part of the job was learning the new appointment manager software. Working hours were not fixed, but varied and inconsistently scheduled from one day to the next.  I learned the importance of meeting and greeting people each day."
good,Becoming a tax professional is very time consuming and at the end to find you are not getting many hours or much pay.  It is not worth it since you have to pay to take the courses.  If you are looking for extra cash I would suggest being a greeter. It does not require the classes and you would get more hours since there is only 2-4 greeting scheduled for each location and you can go to other location to get some extra hours.
good,The only complaint that I have about working for H&R Block is the way commission is paid...other than that...it's a great place to work to learn tax law and the proper way to prepare all sorts of tax returns. The education acquired allow is priceless.
good,Friendly and fast paced but sometimes people would get angry if I scheduled them too many appointments. I found it hard to find a balnace there. It wasn't terrible though
good,"I have been working for H&R Block for more than 20 years. My office is fun, fast-paced and we work as an equal team. Our Manager knows her position very well follows the rules and regulations that the company sets forth for all of her employees to follow. I would follow her anywhere, I am so happy she is here."
good,"There's only opportunity to advance [become a manager, etc] if one takes the tax classes as you must be a tax professional to work higher up in the company. There's nowhere to go up for client service professionals unless they want to take tax classes and be required to do returns, regardless of if they have the skill to perform well as a manager or not."
good,"I enjoy working the clients but the job was only seasonal but everything was unorganized"
good,It was great when I was there.  My supervisors were really knowledge and hard working.  It definitely feels like a team environment.  I wasn't too please when we had to start selling the H&R block refund cards it felt like a scam.
good,It's a very laid back environment. Dress was very casual. People overall seemed pretty positive. I met a lot of nice people there. Everyone there has mixed emotions. You will either love the place or you won't. There is really no in between. If I had the chance to work there again I would definitely do so.
good,they say on 2nd year you get a commission but didn't say they taken away the pay they give you from your commission. I did enjoy working with the my coworkers but some of our clients could be very scary.
good,"Great coworker, but poor management. Upper management has no ideal what is actually happening at the local level. Declining benefits (what little they had for seasonal employees) doesn't attract anyone to stay."
good,It was a good company to work for. A lot of support and training available.  Very limited advancement opportunities and full time positions available.
good,"Was an interesting experience. Learned a great deal about the tax process and met many interesting clients. The culture at HRB really supports their Tax pros and recognizes success. That being said, their goals are strict and their pay is quite low for a company earning what they do; and my personal opinion is that their service is overpriced. Overall a decent environment with good people. Definitely worth doing for at least one tax year just to get your taxes handled for free."
good,Check in clients for answer appointments. Answer busy phones. Take payments.Management is fair. The hardest part of the job is squeezing clients into the schedule that don't have appointments.
good,It was a temporary job for a little extra income - the supervisor was great and co-workers were friendly.  I learned a lot.  Hours were flexible and worked around my f/t job and family.
good,"I learned a few things about the tax business but then again I wasn't really interest in becoming a tax pro. Its hard work. "
good,"I liked working for H&R Block as a receptionist because that position allowed me the freedom from the cattiness and competition for sales. I do not think they fairly compensate their employees, and especially not their tax professionals-- which I think contributes to the overall tension caused by competition."
good,"seasonal, flexible schedule, stressful during high peek tax season, employees generally work together well and help each other, excellent training opportunities available,"
good,Great tax learning experience.  Management is great and the most enjoyable part of the  job is consistently learning of new tax laws and always challenging.
good,"I love solving problems.  Most returns do not require lots of research but those that do can be very complex."
good,"I've been at this job for 11 years and plan on starting there. I love doing tax returns, always learning new things. I can advance as high as I can go and have support to do so."
good,Great staff and management. Can be a very rewarding job as we have some amazing employees and returning clients. Upper management is always willing to help and guide us should we need it
good,I do not want to rate my previous employers.  I have been satisfied with each one. My experience with each is listed on my resume' along with references.
good,Changeing constantly continuing education helping people navigate the tax laws for their specific needs and explaining possible ways to help for the coming year
good,prepared clients tax returns.  I learned a lot about taxes. Management came through the office ev3ery few days.  Allowed to work on own.  Workplace culture was were team oriented.
good,"Job is very nice; however, wages are close to minimum.   Tax season is very intense and stressful, but manageable.   Coworkers are very nice, as well as management team."
good,I enjoyed working for this employer because the beneifts and pay was great but it was only seasonal and last on 6 month depending on the position your applying for.
good,"It was a family owned operation, very fun work enviorment, never a dull moment, they worked around your schedule, i enjoyed everyday working there, i would work for this company again"
good,"You are able to set your own hours"
good,"good customer service experience, tax courses available for continued learning, the management is ok, good work place culture, get to meet new people,"
good,"I am assigned clients to prepare their tax returns.  Taking classes with HRBlock, I haved learned many of the new tax laws.  Management, I really have no complaint.  "
good,"I have learned a lot since I started working with HR Block. I have valuable information by listening and learning from the tax professionals. I have gain more confidence since I started. I have decided to take tax classes, so that I can learn to do taxes for 2017."
good,"It is a fun job, everyone is like a family here. A typical day at work for a Receptionist is coming in and getting everything ready for the day, cleaning up making coffee, and getting register ready. You are first point of contact so you are scheduling appointments answering questions and phone calls. You file completed tax returns. The day goes by fast because you always have something to do which is what I love. The hardest part of the job is that you get use to it and start to enjoy it and then get let go of because it is seasonal which also means no benefits also."
good,"The place is at a nice location. Manger is very friendly and understanding and customers are always happy. A typical day at work is making calls to customers to remind them of their appointments, answering calls, and scheduling appointments."
good,Not enough clients in the office and the office did not advertise for new ones. Whatever available clients were given to other employees. I would have done more business in a larger office.
good,It was a temp job for me but I had fun at the office I work and the people I work with was great. The pay was ok but it was more than what I expected and hopefully has changed since I been there.
good,loved working here customers were great management was great overall great experience working for this company... I would love to work for this company again in the near future
good,"Most of your co-workers there are high aged group of people. If you were a young university student or a new graduate, it is a little bit boring to stay in the office for a whole day without filing tax for clients."
good,"Always challenging, very competitive."
good,I greeted clients.I managed all tax pros calander.I passed out tax checks and also filed and copied documents for tax professionals.i loved working there everyone was very nice.
good,"The clients are the best and most important daily experience working for H & R Block. I also enjoy the work ethic of my coworkers and their dedication to quality work. The work schedule can get intense during tax season, but then you have the off season and continuing education training opportunities are abundant."
good,"My hardest part Managed a high-volume workload within a deadline-driven environment"
good,"I loved my coworkers but the pay was very low and no benefits were offered.  I spent the bulk of my day there working with the public, helping them to determine their tax liability.  Tax code is very complex, so every day was a learning experience.  My coworkers were like family and spending time with them was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Days at work could be very hectic at tax season.  Continuing taking courses to keep up with the lastest tax law changes. Long late hours.
good,"Sometimes fast pasted, other time slow paced.  Depending on my shift."
good,"Very comfortable work setting, the roles are well distinguished, and communication is great. There were not many hours available for this position, but I enjoyed the experience."
good,HR Block give the opportunity to have management skills. It allows to meet new people.
good,"Working with the customer is the best part of my day, I loved giving good news when they have a refund, hate giving bad news when they owe."
good,Job was very stressful during tax season and prior. I was in charge of all contracts getting them signed and all personnel paperwork done correctly according to compliance. The hardest part of my job was hiring and keeping good seasonal employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the travelling. I learned a lot about taxes and the laws that govern them.
good,"I learned everyone is in a different place in life, and things aren't always what you expect. The hardest part of the job is dealing with competitive co-workers. The most enjoyable part is helping people save money."
good,HR Block provides excellent training for new tax specialists to gain the functional knowledge they need to begin in the business.
good,Working here was at the height of the mortgage industry and success followed. A lot of fun with my co-workers and developed some long term close friends.
good,Your typical front desk position and tasks. Great environment and colleagues. Overall fun seasonal position.
good,"H&R Block is all about the Tax Pros and their ability to grow a client base. "
good,"Job was okay. Work load was pretty constant, I stayed busy. Coworkers were easy to work with. I gained a lot of clerical skills. Hardest part of the job was knowing that it wasn't going to last long lol. But other than that it was okay. Kind of boring at times, I was the receptionist. I'm sure the tax pros weren't as bored as I was. Overall I enjoyed my time there, wouldn't mind going back. However, this is the type of job you would ocnsider for some easy part time cash. NOT A long term career opportunity."
good,very good management and a solid retail based tax business.
good,"Compute taxes owed or overpaid, using adding machines or personal computers, and complete entries on forms, following tax form instructions and tax tables."
good,"Some days at work would be slow and some will be fast pace."
good,"A typical day at work would be immediately answering phones by the third ring. "
good,"Excellent group of people to work with daily"
good,H&R Block is a company where you can advance as far as you would like or perceive yourself advancing.
good,Learned much about management and operations of a service type industry company.
good,Enjoyed helping others by giving tax advice and helping co-workers
good,staff and emplyoees were very helpful. and company was fun overall.
good,"Excellent district manager. She knows how to fix everything (computer problems, jammed equipment, people situations), not just the usual figure head."
good,"Very good continuing education program but the company could ease up on pushing our clients to accept certain options such as ""Second Look"" reviews."
good,"H&R Block is, speaking overall, a great employer. Compensation is more than fair and coming in there was room for career advancement. The culture of the company was overall good, morale was high and I would describe the relations between employees and management (for what I knew) as ""high trust""."
good,"This job will definitely prepare anyone for more. I don't know what the corporate side is like but I can say that I do love my job and co-workers, but the fact that it's seasonal makes it difficult to commit. Also, the fact that lower management keeps changing, creates inadequate staff placement, due to lack of familiarity with the way things generally function."
good,It is a great place to learn and grow.  I learned a lot - you have to go through some classes every year - kind of like re-certification which helps.  It is very time consuming for the compensation though.
good,In H&R Block they give us the opportunity to learn more. Their training classes are one the best. Their self improvement courses also qualify for CE credits with the IRS. Exelent training enviromnent. Recommend if you are starting a career in tax preparation.
good,Largest part-time employer in the USA. Seasonal from January through April. Highly qualified preparers may be employed beyond April up to December because they keep one office open all year.
good,"Seasonal employment offers a nice work life balance.  Most season tax professionals are knowledgeable and helpful.  Newer tax professionals are trying to learn themselves.  There are times when it is overwhelming with ringing phones, appointments walking in & matching the needs of the clients."
good,Worked here in two different departments seems like they develop clicks and if you're not doing what they want you to do as far as the click they will definitely leave you out in the cold even when you need help with serious situations the atmosphere when you first start is great but unless you get into a click it won't be comfortable
good,I was cross trained from receptionist to manager duties to preparing tax returns. Kept count of the cash drawer and handled debit and credit cards. Also kept track of clients that dropped off their taxes to be done.
good,I enjoyed client contact and the ability to start and finish tasks.  Good communication from management to the team.  I worked there many years and was updated each year about major tax laws and how they would impact returns.
good,"They take pretty much anyone as a receptionist, which was good for me because I was able to add it in to my resume as work experience. But the pay is minimum wage, even as a first year tax professional. And the wage you earn after the first year is commission based. "
good,Good job for self motivated people.  Continuing education classes are available & mandatory every year to prepare for tax season. Experienced co-workers.
good,Was a easy job at times but can be difficult when trying to schedule with demanding tax pros. Like my boss she was nice but some of the customers were caught off guard with pricing.
good,I did get raises each year working there but the job is only seasonal and just wasn't stable for me as i was working full time but it was great while I was in college and provided me with flexible working hours.
good,I learned a lot from from working at H&R Block.  I learned how the Tax preparation work. I learned how to deal with clients pertaining to their tax status.  Not all clients were nice.
good,"Review clients tax documents, prepare the tax return, review the legal deductions, credits."
good,"Tax training was well worth it, very informative, teacher was well spoken and answered questions as required. Office culture was very nice and rewarding, management was well informed and accommodating."
good,I loved working at H&R Block. I felt that I learned allot. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I loved getting to know people and seeing the results of my job.
good,"This job is so not in my field, but it was such a joy working there. If you get a chance to work there, you can really learn quite a bit!  There is a good bit of cold calling, greeting clients, and paperwork, but it is very worth the reward."
good,"The compensation is horrible, The Tax Preparer is not compensated well. The work schedule is very flexible and allow you to make your own schedule. The management in the individual offices are poor. They need to do better with providing classes and workshops for management."
good,"SEASONAL POSITION - 4th year of increasing my certification level that is free, but time consuming.  You get back personal satisfaction for the effort you put forth.  Minimal issues with clients. Corporate goals are clear.  Feedback from staff has been acknowledged and executed."
good,"Closing and making sure nothing was forgotten. Had to ensure that the draw was closed out, that everything was cleaned and put away correctly. As well as making sure files and paperwork was correctly locked up."
good,"You had to have patent, you had to use all of your customer service training or you will go crazy. Tolerances is the key to tax preparing, an the customer is not all ways right."
good,"Lots of training available.  More phone calls than desired.  Flexible hours available."
good,"Learn the process and like dealing with people and this is a great place to work.  You must be willing to build a ""book of business"" to make money.  The first year you make very little money and are clearly low on the totem pole.  However it is fun work if you like interacting with people, can remember the basic tax rules and understand the computer program.  I recommend it if you are looking for seasonal work.  Many people come back year after year.  Others become managers and work year around with benefits."
good,"Manager can be less rude to her employees, would not let me do my job at closing time I felt I was being rushed and then she balanced out for me. Did not like that I wanted to learn how but she would push me out of the way I did complain to the district manager but nothing was done about it"
good,"Great training. but HRB is more interested in keeping Stock holders a steady revenue, at the expense of the Tax Pros.  Constantly reducing the payouts for the work to generate lower incomes for those generating the company revenue."
good,This is a good opportunity for anyone looking for seasonal work. There is a short training course in the fall that is required before anyone can work as a tax professional.
good,Worked with clients and other tax preparers. Also worked with the IRS for specific tax situations. Required tact and personal skills to meet expectations and complete tax returns correctly
good,"I came on job and do tax return. Dealing with clients wasn't always fun, sometimes you have very difficult client that destroys   your day. You have to know a lot for small money."
good,"excellent work environment, great management, flexible work hours, offers great continuous education. Easy to get hired after the Beginner's Tax Course."
good,"It is good just dnt pay enough they work with your availability . The people you work with depending on office are great,interesting, people   but just need more pay."
good,"The workplace is great and you learn a lot as a tax professional, especially if you are lucky to be placed in a great team of helpful senior employees. The biggest drawback is low pay. Hourly wages are minimal and the bonus is fairly low, especially in comparison to the fee each client is charged for a tax return (typically averaging at $120)"
good,Compensation compared to the prices charged to customers was shameful.  I found that the clients were basically kind but upset at the prices that the company charged.  There was a lot of pressure to sell the additional products to clients.
good,"excellent job to learn how to do personal income tax returns."
good,Learned basic computer skills worked with new programs slow paced easy going and lay back not too busy but good and friendly environment to work relaxing area of wrok
good,"lower level employees are paid minimum wage. The company expects so much but is not willing to pay based on your knowledge and commitment to the company. They designed this overdraw pay system which keeps employee at minimum wage, people are working doing taxes for only $8.10 hr."
good,Laid back environment with very little stress as far as work load goes. Management was very helpful whenever you needed questions answered. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people wanting their tax return.
good,"I just submitted my review and everything I said is still true. I benefited from learning more about the tax code. They are a professional company which a lot of people trust, and I strove to do everything I could to maintain that trust."
good,Their pay could be better but they do encompass an organized and fun environment to work in. It is a high demanding job as it is during tax season but you also learn much needed skills in the business field
good,The office I work in is a close nit family atmosphere. I love working with my co workers who are aging and will be retiring soon. Once they are gone my clients would be the only attraction to staying. I have many loyal clients but keep loosing more each year due to the pricing structure of the tax returns. I make decent money in a short period of time but do put in many hours during tax season. The rest of the year there aren't many hours available to work. I enjoy instructing tax courses for my peers.
good,I only did one season.  The office I worked in was slow so as a new tax preparer there were few opportunities to practice on walk ins.  Hardest part was gaining the experience to take on the harder tax clients.  The most enjoyable part was the training course.
good,"The managers I had were outstanding which help to create the ideal atmosphere. I have learned about taxes, what information is available to the public, the in and out of their peak season off season classes offered, scheduling appointments. I've had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of individual and we all communicated."
good,"I enjoyed my time at H&R block. The management was a little chaotic, but over all it was a great experience. Working there was a good practice of clerical skills and interaction with people."
good,"Company culture great. Department great. Being a seasonal associate not so great and should be considered a ""intern"". If you're looking at getting into a new industry or love having 2 months or more off from work, I'd recommend H&R. However, if you're looking at establishing a career this might not be the place."
good,Fun work place with many enthusiastic people that are able to help and share their experience with the new employees. Decent payment for first year employees.
good,"•	Answer phones and transfer calls"
good,"Na. I rather not give a review on this topic. Everyone must gain there on opinion on working here. It is good job to work partime for extra money and to gain experience in he tax world,"
good,It's a great company to start with taxes preparation. They don't pay commission for the first year taxpros. You can manage your time and co-workers help you a lot.
good,HRB provides all the education you may want at a minimal price and allows a very flexible environment in which to learn. Most of the tax preparers who work there are there to help clients undertstand their taxes and help them plan for the future and are a great group to work with.  You set your own hours.
good,Excelente oportunidad de desarrollar atencion y consejeria impositiva al cliente
good,"You have a chance to learn individual income tax in details, which is very useful for you personally. Colleagues and management are extremely nice and helpful, general atmosphere at work is very positive. Unfortunately, the job is seasonal and the pay is too low."
good,"A typical day at work was answering phone calls ,answering tax questions and preparing tax returns computer based . I learned how to interview clients to gather the correct information to accurately prepare the clients return. Worked well with other co workers small office so got to know them well. The hardest part of the job is the disappointment of the client when they owed money instead of receiving a refund. The most enjoyable part of the job is the continuing education classes there is always more to learn and i liked the opportunity for advancement."
good,Perfect job except for the seasonal aspect.  I would prefer a job that lasts longer than four months.
good,Greeting clients and preparing electronic tax forms.  Entered information into the computer as provided by the client.  Submitted tax forms electronically.
good,"H&R Block provides employees the opportunity to learn as much as possible about taxes. This is a company that employs intelligent, hard-working people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that clients get when they get help with their taxes and the employees who get rewarded when they do a good job."
good,"My days work long but fun, I got to meet from all walks of life. I learned how to prepare taxes and customer services relations. Management was helpful always. Co-workers were also helpful. The hardest part of the job was preparing taxes that were 3 more years overdue because it took a lot of time to prepare. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the client a refund more than they were expecting."
good,"The office manager was a great gal, as were most of my co-workers. The job was interesting because of the diversity of clients we served; however, it was not so pleasant when they became upset due to wait time for a specific preparer."
good,I miss my Eastern Regional Manager Christine and my remote helpdesk staff.They where all great-even the difficult one's.
good,As long as you realize this is a seasonal job you will be happy with what is provided as far as compensation. If you work to increase your certification you can make very good money during tax season. Block provides great training and paid for my review course to become an Enrolled Agent.
good,"Good part time job, great training opportunity but poor pay structure and no benefits. Great work place culture of customer service. Flexible work hours."
good,"If you don't like change this is not the place to work. Starting out it's tough you make minimum wage and have to work up to something better which can take a long time. It's a great company but the pay does not match the demands. Managers coming and going, would be nice to have more stability there."
good,"The office I worked at, the tax professionals lacked proper Time Management. Sometimes they were late and missed appointments with clients. Sometimes they went over the allotted time with tax appointments forcing a client to wait longer than necessary. Sometimes, they didn't show up for work basically a no-call no-show. However, it is expected that the receptionist working that day show up to work. "
good,"Flexible scheduling, excellent participation from team members, and excellent continuing education.  District management is very supportive and team members are focused on the mission."
good,"If HR Block could change anything it's the compensation system. It gives commission on individual basis which only serves to promote cannibalism between tax pros. Countless times the first year tax pros only make a handful of returns because the priors are hogging all of the revenue. Sometimes tax pros take clients from other tax pros because of their greed. Each office has its own culture depending on the Manager, I'm lucky to have the best manager that let's me develop and do all kinds of difficult returns. Others are not so lucky and can only do Child Tax Credit or extremely easy W-2 only state returns. It's honestly pathetic. Very toxic environments in some offices full of greedy unethical tax pros. Managers also have daily reunions and are bombarded with emails. The company structure is far from decentralized and D.G.Ms are just a messenger from their bosses. So many unnecessary positions and fake inspiring messages. I would hate my job if not because of my manager and coworkers."
good,"H&R Block, I am responsible for delivering an outstanding customer experience by creating a warm and welcoming first and last impression. I review YOY reports to identify business opportunities and collaborate with the District Manager and Office Manager to achieve company initiatives."
good,"I worked for them last yr, since then they changed ownership so my seniority went out the window & they want me to work for less this yr than I made last yr"
good,flexible schedule to work. advance opportunities. pay rate is not based on years of experience is based on productivity. management is not the greatest since you are seen more as a number to company than as an employee. great as part -time only.
good,"there were waves of clients, and waves of stress levels. this kind of job requires that you can handle stress, handle angry clients, handle clients that think you are wrong. must be very confident in your work and knowledge."
good,When we were not busy we was able to do cast studies.  I really enjoyed talking to clients. I builded  a relationship with them and would look forward to the next year.  We would talk about their families.
good,"I very liked this job, preparing income taxes. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes the routine job and communications, relationships with new clients."
good,Nice good seasonal place to work for a seasonal job as a client service rep. Every was very helpful but you do have to be able to multi-task and now how to use a computer and do filing and cleaning. .
good,"J'ai travaillé chez H&R Block sous une autre administration, ils ont changé la structure après 2015, je suis retourné en 2017 pour la saison d'impôts de 2016, mais je n'ai pas apprécié mon expérience en tant que réceptionniste (Ils nous donnent encore plus de responsabilités, mais ont baissé notre salaire.) En bref, j'ai aimé mes premières années, mais depuis le changement d'administration, je ne vois plus cet endroit comme une place de choix pour travailler."
good,October November and December you were taking classes on the new tax laws for the coming year and tested rigorously. Starting January 2 through April 15 you were preparing taxes for your returning clients whether in person or drop off and picking up new clients.  Excellent management team always willing to help you. In season we worked long hours but the manager was always there as a proof-reader and a second set of eyes.
good,"This position is seasonal. You can work as much or as little as you would like. The support from the other preparers is unmatched. The hardest part of the job is getting new business, and the most enjoyable is when you can teach a client about ways to keep more of their money."
good,"H&R Block is a great place for an accountant to work that loves processing tax returns. the people I work with in the office is great, but the company and filed managers lack employee care. they do not listen to the team that actually deals with the clients and has a poor ability to change upon request of ideas on how to improve."
good,Thanks to HRblock I learned how to prepare a tax return. I even help my family and friends with their tax return every year. I even use my knowledge and assist my student with general tax questions.
good,I was fun working with different people. The co workers was very helpful and respectful. I learned many new skills such as cash handling and product selling
good,"Working for H&R Block is great but there are times during tax season where the expectation is that you put in 80 Hours+. This isn't such a big issue but if you have a family, it can interfere quite a bit."
good,It was a great experience being able to work for H&R Block as the marketing coordinator. Everything changed quite a bit and it was a requirement to be on top of your game.
good,I have come to enjoy working with my tax clients and my co workers.  I have been blessed with an amazing manager who understands juggling family and work.
good,"Fun staff and fast set pace makes the days go by faster! Job duties included, but were not limited to, answering phones, taking messages, checking in clients, and assembling packets."
good,"A normal day for me is always being early,so I can have the time to clean and make coffee for the clients and co-workers. To learned all that I ca to help our clients and co-workers,the hardest when we cant help a client,but happy because we did everything we could."
good,"Free tax repair. It was only during the tax season so I had to find a job after tax season ended, However I was able to work and attend school at the same time."
good,Although it is a Seasonal position you have no life outside of this place so you will be counting down the days until April 17th from the first or second week of January.
good,I really enjoyed this job all though they relocated. We were a nice team
good,"The company makes a very conserted effort to keep all of the employees up to date with current and new tax laws to be ready for anything. With that being said, I have an eclectic array of clients that I service from year to year. Some of my clients have been with me for more than 5 yrs with continuous contact throughout the year. The best part of the job is the challenge of the tax code constantly changing from year to year but the hardest part of the job is trying to convince clients not to wait till the last minute to file their returns."
good,There was potential for growth and advancement with in the company.
good,"I have worked for a variety of H&R Block offices. Locally, I have had great managers who have trained and managed well while encouraging advancement. However, sometimes the corporate issues impede upon the day to day management of an office"
good,"A typical day at work included the satisfaction of the clients. Each time the clients saw what the return looked like they got happy. Team knowledge was required to give the best outcome to the customer. If someone did not know about a certaint tax credit someone else would come and help. Many times i had to take tests, and the manager was very flexible. There was no hard part of the job only that I had to do alot of research."
good,Like for work to go smoothly but life isnt always perfect. Just get through it and start another day. Ive learned that things dont get done unless you follow through. I do have management experience and I enjoy doing my job well. Im pursuing my BA In business Management right now. Hard part of a job is letting people go from there duties. But work must be done by the rules no exceptions. Most enjoyable part of a job is the satifaction of doing a job well. Plus getting paid.
good,I loved working here during three of my four years in college. I was able to get an understanding of tax preparation and some tax law. Great co-workers and friendly environment. Clients can be stressful when they aren't satisfied with results.
good,I worked 6 years for the company. It was a great company to work for all employees and supervisors were very family oriented. Great company to work for.
good,"I love my job and my clients and the flexibility I have with my hours, our upper management team needs a little work and corporate decisions don't always benefit the employees."
good,"Enjoyed greeting the clients and working with my coworkers.  My computer skills were limited to the job training given by the company, repeated from year to year.  Not a computer person."
good,"I started my career as a Tax Preparer at H & R Block. They offer a lot of different classes. I was also a teacher for the beginning students."
good,"Lot of paper work. Attention to details all penny count."
good,great clients; great & challenging job- every tax situation is different and therefore  this job requires lot of  tax law knowledge; free tax training; 
good,I honestly like my job it is a very stress free environment which I haven't been able to say about a lot of jobs and the manager is very nice and understanding all around great also great coworkers which makes the job 10x better
good,"This is a great company to work for. If you are willing to work, they are willing to compensate you. All tax preparers should work here. Are you ready to join the team?"
good,This is a great company to work for. They offer discounts on their tax training class to their current employees. They understand that this is temporary job and are extremely flexible in regards to scheduling. They also offer many opportunities for career advancement.
good,"This is a pretty good job to have. The atmosphere is very nice, and the colleagues are very helpful to those who are just starting out in their first year."
good,"class was very informative, office atmosphere was awesome, depending of time in season was work as fast as possible while being detail oriented and supportive.  Hardest part of job was at times waiting for next client or dealing with secretive type people that aren't always upfront with information.  Most enjoyable aspects were always meeting new people that are genuine in needing assistance, Always something new to research and learn about."
good,"Unfortunately they have gotten away from their primary purpose over the last decade.  They have fostered competition in the pursuit of other businesses."
good,I learned a great deal from this company. Even with just being the customer service professional I learned so many things about preparing taxes.
good,"preparing taxes for clients"
good,"Not enough hours, hours are based on appointments, also pay is very low. Typical day is calling clients, and checking clients in."
good,"Be polite"
good,"With tax season, there's no such thing as a ""typical"" day. Clients would come in with different situations and we had to be flexible enough to handle their tax returns efficiently and professionally regardless of their individual situations. "
good,"This work was for two tax seasons.  Lot of phones, appointments, taking payments, entering payments and all other admin front desk duties.  Very busy!  Everyone was easy to work with, management was great.  "
good,was a very productive and fun place to work meeting different kind of people and dealing with lost of different changes in the government field. Most day were very heck  with all kind of problems and trying to get in contact with  government office I learned that you need to have alots of patience my co-workers were good people the hardest part of the job was trying to help some many different people
good,"Satisfaction at work when you get returning customers"
good,"A very laid back place to work, involving cleaning and vacuuming the building as well as washing windows, wiping desks and other small tasks. Would work again"
good,"At H&R Block there was a diverse group of people, no discrimination and they were very flexible with hours. Every employee was polite and always happy to help when available."
good,H&R Block offers a very flexible work schedule and helps train their employees. They offer continuing education and allow for advancement. It has a professional atmosphere and the managers help anyway they can.
good,"It is possible to make a good salary for a seasonal position, once you build your client base and certification levels, but the administrative and pre-season wages are minimal."
good,I learned a lot from managers and coworkers at my short time. It was an opportunity for me to grow as employee in this financial industry. I believe that my experience at H&R block will suit me well in my desire endeavors.
good,I enjoyed interacting with the clients by phone or when they came to the office. I found that my compensation didn't begin to meet HR Block's demands. I have learned a lot about the filing of taxes. Most of the tax professionals did appreciate all I did to make there life smoother in the office.
good,"Pleasant working conditions.  Office managers are very supportive and positive.  The regional manager is a exceptional person who is always upbeat, positive and available.  The working hours are flexible and some employees hold a full-time job besides preparing taxes."
good,"H&R Block is great to work at for tax season and the people become more like family. However, it is a stressful job knowing there is so much responsibility in your hands for each client which made the job stressful. Tax laws change yearly as well as the computer program."
good,Assisting customers was extremely fun and loved that they worked with my schedule as a student. This job was by far very easy to learn and extremely interactive.
good,"A typical day at the office begin making coffee for clients and cleaning the office. There' I'm improving my English skill and my tax knowledge. I'm very proud of my co-workers.They are very efficient. In my opinion there is not hard part in this job, The most ejoyable part of the job is when you are talking with the clients traing to do the best job possible."
good,"The company is a great company to work for, and the people are really nice. There is a chance for advancement within this company."
good,"I enjoyed working there because I could always find something to do, to make time go by faster. I enjoyed almost everything about the job, except some days were slower the others."
good,"I really enjoyed working for H&R Block, it was more like a family environment. The atmosphere and energy was such a joy and blessing to be apart of. I enjoy my time and experiences"
good,Was good with old manager and they would work with your schedule. Now that there's a new manager it's just not the same any more .
good,"Working in my department during tax season is very hectic and essential to H&R BLOCK locations. I communicate with counties, cities, and townships all over the country in order to keep H&R BLOCK locations open. I also communicate strongly with Accounts Payable department in addition to opening daily mail. I have learned PCI training and tax laws pertaining to business.The hardest part of my job is dealing with high stress levels and no employee benefits. The most enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing goals set in my department. I will not review my management because they have undergone a lot of changes during my time of employment there. In the work culture there is high moral for each other and ver much support. Working for this company provides a lot of knowledge and future opportunity."
good,It is awesome schooling procedures in order to get certified to do taxes for the IRS. Great resume builder. Just no permanent position year round all the time unless there is a all year round office.  Not enough pay offered for your experience.
good,Job advancement is constant relating to annual changes in tax law; classes are offered on site; certificates of completion is given and documented. Productivity is high during peak time; fast paced environment.
good,I would come in a couple to a few times out of the week to train. I learned a lot about taxes. The management did not schedule accordingly. Manager made no effort to keep in contact with me after I reached out for work. I enjoyed working with and being around people.
good,"It was so fast paced, and really knowledgeable. Loved to learn new things about the tax life. During the fast season it kept me super busy but afyeards we got a break."
good,It all depends on what office you work at.  Very dependent on the ego of the manager.  I have workedin one excellent office and my experience with the Wixom office was below average office.
good,H & R Block hires only seasonal people and there is no advancement for full time employment.I have worked for them for almost three years but there is very seldom and full time jobs opened.
good,"nothing bad to say about this company.  It was a great place to work when I was in college. "
good,"Wish I could work year round. It's only seasonal, so it's hard to make a living with just seasonal. Enjoyed working with the public. Never missed a day while I was employed there. Received a bonus for that."
good,This was the company that I wanted to work for my whole adult life and I am very disappointed! I was a manager for 4 years and the pay is awful. The upper management uses you to make there bonuses larger. You can work your butt off and not get the bonus that you earned out right.
good,"this is the food industry, always busy, when I was there management wasn't the best but the employees helped make the work environment great. not a bad job to have while in highschool"
good,"IT issues"
good,worked with clients on their taxes at tax season. was only there to prepare taxing during tax season. This was a season position could not afford to live on the seasonal work.
good,I love doing taxes and working with numbers and customers.  I learned a lot working for H & R Block.  I feel they have the best software for tax preparation.
good,"I worked there as a csp last tax season at the La Cumbra Plaza and the people I worked with was Awesome. Did start off slow but, when it picked up It was on and popping. I loved every minute of, If I am not working regular full time job I would love to go back and work with them again at that location only!"
good,Would work seasonally wish there had been more of an opportunity to be a permanent position. When the on-boarding process was moved to corporate it became increasingly difficult to get hired for a position going forward.
good,"Got to work and help people solve problems with IRS. Got the monies they wanted back legitimately. Solved computer problems. "
good,"- Scheduling appointments "
good,Ok place to work. You only get full time hours during their peak times then your hours get cut. There is alot of continuning education that takes place in the off season that you dont get paid for but is required if you want to come back.
good,"I would of preferred a 25 hours work week and the salary to be more than was expected for the responsibilities that was required.  I learned a great deal of contacting customers on their software system and how incoming clients were being wait on.  The hardest part was trying to working on incoming calls while assisting clients coming in at the same time.  Otherwise, I enjoyed working with customers and with very courteous employees."
good,The people who work for the company are generally decent.  They have been a good fall back job when I've been in between jobs. I would recommend it for that.
good,"Great company to work for temporarily, depending on the type of manager and the staff you work with it. Some of the are helpful while others treat you like their personal assistant or slave."
good,"Its a high paced job, with harsh customers at times, lots of public contact,  but no room for advancement. Large working stations, lots of training and requires self confidence"
good,"Working at H & R Block is enjoyable because helping people with their tax returns is rewarding.  Resolving tax issues for clients is one of the best rewards to achieve."
good,"I needed as many hours as possible in a short period of time. Started the day running and not stopping. Very intense. One perk was getting my taxes prepared at no cost. Tax time is not a happy time so I dealt with many unhappy people. Learned that once you take the mystery out of the process, it's easier to deal with."
good,"only interest in bottom line, no caring for staff. running off all good associates. cut long time employees to save money, hired people not qualified."
good,"I love working with numbers, solving problems and making people's lives better."
good,"Work is almost always reviewed by surveys. You prepare taxes and add attachments, compel to make your business grow, but are cover by their rules and price model. Meaning you are hurt by their price tactics while making your business grow. Pay is cut out of bonus and overtime if occur is half of what your pay is because you are part time or seasonal status employee thus treated with less value for your work."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is making clients smile and making their tax return work for them.  A typical day is twelve hours long without breaks or much time to breath but I am so busy that is doesn't even matter and the clients I see are happy to see me as much as I am happy to see them.  "
good,Flexibilty and work life balance is great. It is a seasonal job but still you get hours you are available to work on weekends. Minimum fee for next levels if you are employee to the company.
good,Great place to work seasonally. Fast paced and the training you get is limited. You will learn as you go. There is just too much information to learn everything at once. First season is always the hardest for new employees in the support position
good,"Assess each client's tax situations and analyze the most beneficial way to file tax return complying with tax law."
good,"It's a good place to learn but they do not provide any benefits or good compensation, they tried to not pay commissions and compensation at the end of the tax season"
good,H&R Block is suitable for the time being but the work is very strenuous you'll have to stay at least 10 hours a day during the tax season after the tax seasons over it is seasonal they will let you off until the following season
good,"not a bad place to work"
good,"You try to make your money here by building your client base.  However, it is very difficult to maintain customer loyalty because they keep increasing there rates substantially each year."
good,"It is a professional place to work even though it is a seasonal position.  The tax professionals are well educated, as I have only observed.  I do believe that I would trust my, my family, friends or other work associates to their qualified and knowledge tax preparation abilities."
good,They don't take you seriously and expect you to be there at their beck and call at any time. The way their pay and compensations are set up is an absolute joke.
good,My role of Office Manager for four of my years with H&R Block I had nine employees.  I managed the office making work schedules and helping them as problems came up.  I also was a Tax Preparer helping my clients.
good,"getting folders ready for customers to do their income tax filing"
good,"You can be trying to answer 3 phone lines at once, helping several people at the same time. The work is only during tax season. I found it a challenge to keep everything moving smoothly."
good,Learned different Laws concerning different state taxes and Federal taxes. Learned the more you do Marketing the better your company out come will be. Everyone you work with has a number of years experience that is willing to help. The hardest part of the job is trying to explain to a client the reason they can not claim certain deductions. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people in need.
good,"This was a seasonal job, but did not fit my personality at all. Having the customer sit over you and wanting to carry on idle chatter while you are preparing their income taxes was very stressful for me. I feel that tax preparation should have the preparer's full attention, to lessen the chance for costly mistakes."
good,This was a great job where I was able to receive some administrative experience. I was the first person to greet the clients and the first impression of a company is the last so I had to make sure that I was friendly to every client all times. I enjoyed this job because I gained so much knowledge about taxes that I didn't know. The hardest part of this job was dealing with irate clients and trying to please the clients in the store as well answer the phone according to the company standards.
good,"I loved the diversity of this job. I was a front desk coordinator, Accounting assistant, Warehouse/inventory manager, Education coordinator and caterer."
good,Perfect job for the tax season. Good way to learn taxes and to keep up with the tax laws. Also excellent for the person who likes to help the customer.
good,"Since the season is from January to April 15, it is required to work during this time.  Usually worked full time then was let go for the season.  I felt it is better to work all year round."
good,When we hit peak it was insane otherwise it was a very laid back job. My office had a new manger in place that didn’t know what she was doing and no one seemed to like her.
good,No review. Take your chances. Some offices are more fair than others. This has been going down each year where it at one time was stable or rose. Not good anymore.
good,"I really enjoyed working at H&r block. There were issues with the management staff, as well as some of the customers and the way some of the things were being done."
good,"You will work excessive hours during peak weeks, scheduling can be flexible depending on management. Pay is fair for seasonal position.You will gain great customer service skills."
good,It can be very high stress but I liked working for my boss. The office I was in was great and had a good location. Some offices are not as lucky. Receptionist job is easy and enjoyable.
good,i enjoyed working at H&R block. it was a great learning experience. it a company with a unique profile that utilizes the experience of its staff to enhance the performance of new hires.
good,I learned a lot about tax preparing and the different changes in preparing taxes that will or will not benefit people. I met some interesting people and learning how to deal with different personalities.
good,I loved the job. The other employees were great to work with and very helpful if I did not know how to handle certain clients with tax questions. I did not take lunches or breaks so tax pros did not have to cover my job. The only real problem I had was other employees not arriving on time for work.  I learned a lot about taxes and how to handle more than one client at a time.
good,as being a client coordinator for over 10 years I have learned how to do taxes and also my people skills have gotten better with the clients very relaxed place to work
good,This job can be very enjoyable for people who love other people. I am a peoples person. You never knew who would walk through those doors. I met some of the most pleasant people there. Coworkers where very nice.
good,It's ok--just wish they'd let me know in advance there would be NO hours for working during most of March. Most of the local management and associates are ok to work with.
good,"A seasonal job"
good,Very relaxed setting.  It was very organized and structured which made it easier to provide impeccable customer support and assistance directly or via phone.
good,"My job was mostly as receptionist. Check clients in and determine which of the Tax preparers were available for customers who would walk in."
good,"Temporary seasonal employment does not meet all my financial  needs. My compensation varies because I am paid commission for the tax returns that I complete. Depending on the complexity of the return I may have to do additional research to supplement my  basic knowledge,"
good,"This is a seasonal position for tax time. Employees are fine, but parent company does not keep up with technology making work harder. Company raises rates yearly with little improvements in products or services."
good,"Before everyone left there, it was a great place to work at.  They could have done better if the Conroe office was not so angry we were doing better than them."
good,"seasonal work, constant relocating, but worked with a great bunch of people, hours and days depended on which location I was working , most of work was over the phone public relations with both clients and tax  pros."
good,H&R block is a good company to work for but there is lots of room for improvement. Unless your willing to pay out of pocket to become a tax pro there is no room for advancement in this company.
good,"Great coworkers, greet clients as they enter and make sure they are matched with the correct tax pros and make sure the client has a good experience while dealing with the company"
good,Great atmosphere meeting new peers and staff.  Learning experience was optimal for someone returning to the workforce after spending time raising children and re-entering management/office environment.  No options for advancement to full time opportunity.  Upper management hired outside of Company.
good,"This was also one of my jobs I enjoyed the most. I enjoyed working with so of the nicest people around. Most of them were the type to if you had a problem or weren't able to answer a question for a client, you could go to most of your co-workers an get help. What I liked most about this job was being able to work on computers and learn new things. But also was able to get to know the yearly returning clients."
good,"Fantastic people with the best training in the industry. Fast paced, ever changing environment. No two days are a like."
good,"Tax prepares are very competitive especially dealing with prior or new clients."
good,"assist customers with tax questions, set appointments, answered 100+ calls a day. Made some outbound calls for scheduling, did some cancellations."
good,"A temporary seasonal job working in H & R call center at its HQ in Kansas City, MO.  A call representative must field questions from tax preparers and office hardware / software administers."
good,"The running of the Office, daily report's to head Office preparing tax return's for client's answering the phone enquires and client's dropping in to talk about there tax return's. Bank reconciliation banking, opening and closing of Office."
good,There is not typical day at H&R Block with the various client interaction no day is the same. The hours are flexible which benefit for college students and those seeking part-time employment.
good,The days of work were irregular due to the scheduling.  The training was very good and we were given the opportunity to keep up on the new tax laws--The reason that I am looking for other work is that I no longer agree with the direction that the franchise is taking with its prior tax pros.  It is reducing my annual pay 20-30%.   The co-workers are good to work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing old clients and making new ones.
good,"A typical day at work was to prepare income tax returns. I learned tax laws, rules, and regulations.  Management was ok, and co-workers was ok.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changing tax laws, rules, and regulations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to get tax refunds to the clients."
good,"mostly customer service, giving tax interviews to clients regarding their yearly incomes & some personal questions were asked, but kept confidential."
good,"A typical day at work includes dispatching anywhere from 25 to 400 cases. I've learned to be strict on maintaining schedules; improved my ability to multi-task, handle stressful situations, as well as, pick up the slack where team members fail to do their part. "
good,"25 years working for H&R Block has been so much fun. It's hard work keeping the Tax Preparers happy and the clients content at times, and handling the phone, setting appts, and basically doing marketing over the phone. I Love my job."
good,"To make short, I'm in hospital for illness spread in training. People were not allowed to miss for any reason, even illness. So, these 2 spread the germs because h&r training more important to some instead of health. How many others are going to become sick when working in public because some only dedicated to hr & concern of well being is no concern."
good,Abilities to help clients understand the tax system and help them in planning the financial future. Very Friendly workplace and helping workplace culture .
good,"Not a hard or stressful job. However, $9 per hour nowadays is not realistic. Really nice bunch of ladies that I worked with. Still hard to believe for only $9 per hour. Laughable...Overall pleasant experience though..."
good,Friendly environment where teamwork was encourage great group of employees who have been in the tax business for years!!! Knowledgeable and take their time to teach you.
good,Good place to start or make extra money on tax season. No growth. Only a tax season job. Good for students because of the flexible time schedules and not a lot of work load.
good,"I like to work at my office because it was small and starting off , I think that was what I needed. Now next year I think that I will be ready for a lrger office setting."
good,"Everyone was helpful, and stepped up if I needed assistance.  I ran errands and staged office for various promotions...loved that job. Worked 4 months..collected unemployment for 6 months"
good,Good job for seasonal work.  Pay is not good.  Loved working with the public and enjoyed helping people.  Hardest part of the job is that it is seasonal.
good,"Enjoyed working with my fellow employees. Customers were usually amazing. It is a ligitimate company to work for, part-time/seasonal for those that would like to make some extra cash during the tax season."
good,"It was very pleasant place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at H&R Block.  Enjoyed helping clients and potential clients best I could.  I learned so much when working for H&R Block.  I would go back to work for them.
good,"managed two locations"
good,At first it was a good experience with good people. They randomly started letting people go and promising to rehire at another location. that never happened. i believe there were some issues on the manager part that was dropped on workers. at one point i was the only one there.
good,"It was a temporary job.  I worked from December to April 16th, "
good,Enjoy working with staff and meeting new people.  There are numerous locations that make it more convenient for customers throughout the community.  Give you reminders of your appointments.  Work to schedule appointments with customers whom have busy schedules.
good,Very fast pace I learned how to do federaland state taxes  poor mangement. There was no hard part I enjoy doing taxes. The most enjoyable part happy client when they leave my offoice
good,I loved work for h&R Block.I return every year for 3 seasons. I love some of my manages. This was also a great stepping stone in my life for learning.
good,This is a good company to work for when given the opportunity. Management is friendly and everyone is always willing to help coworkers that may be in need.
good,Great training program each year you can progress and learn more and grow within the company.  Fast pace Helpful staff al around a enjoyable place to work but it’s only seasonal
good,Management changes to often there isn’t stability managememt isn’t well trained they don’t have basic tax knowledge they should have and most skate by on the coat tails of family
good,Block has changed it's education program. New Prepare-rs don't write any returns their first year now as they have to train in the office with a seasoned preparer.  This actually slows down the new person instead of giving them valuable interview skills.
good,"This job  comes with high energized customers who may be in a good mood or a bad mood, depending on whether they have to pay or receive a return."
good,"The day gets started working on taxes for clients. I learned people have different needs and wants. I had to listen very carefully because the clients were not forth coming with vital information. The manager in the office that I was employed was not very knowledgeable.  She had to call another office or the owners for questions she didn't know the answer to."
good,"My day was usually a 4 hour day at this job. All I really had to do was to make sure the clients were satisfied with their visit to the store. Even though there was a wait for the next tax professional to be available I tried for their wait to go as fast as possible and made sure they had what they needed during the wait. I learned how to use the software they provided, I learned how to make appointments. Also, I brushed up on my customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was to make sure the clients didn't have a long wait in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and getting better at the things I already knew."
good,"turn on computers, fix coffee, check in customers. I learned to check-in customers. I learned what was need for people to bring in to do their taxes. The best part is meeting different people."
good,The people were polite but cut throat. I loved being about to help people with their taxes. Hated the required classes. Hated having to tell people that I could not help them. Hated to turn anyone away.
good,"Job was fun, atmosphere was friendly, but then they just throw you away when the season ends. Coworkers were very cliquey, felt like high school, pay is acceptable."
good,I loved working there but it was a temp position and was sad to leave. I would recommend working for H&R Block to anyone. The people I worked with were very nice and it's a great company to work for.
good,"On a typical day i would answer the multi-line phone and schedule appointments, file, fax, type, make coffee, make copies, make up client folders, handle mail, and greet all clients that come in."
good,"Entry level personal income tax preparation is not for everyone but the extra experience and seasonal check are nice. ""Block"" as it's called offers advancement with no degree, though you have to be patient and put in two seasonal years of returns before they will offer any meaningful position for advancement. A typical day is spent alone with H&B Blocks office cubicles waiting for walk-ins. As you gain experience and a couple of seasons behind you, clients lists are transitioned to you. Bringing in your personal network of friends and family is encouraged and looks good for you since your driving business. Without a bachelors degree in accounting or taxation or a CPA, moving beyond an hourly associate can be a challenge. Block Advisors are in need of experienced preparers since their business services side is growing."
good,"Working for H&R Block is very enjoyable as I personally enjoy doing tax preparation and educating clients to make wise choices in their financial futures.  I work at my own pace, have my specific clients and make my own hours."
good,"Very Secure job. Has plenty of opportunities to advance your career."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my four years at H&R Block was working with my clients. It was quite satisfying explaining to and helping my clients with their current and future tax issues. I was also able to help clients with financial assistance and mortgage advice. "
good,A good seasonal job. Can fill in if you have a part time job. I don't have anything else to say. Your hours can be made to fit any reasonable situation.
good,"Many people work there so I think its good for them but I am just not meant to be to stay."
good,"Great opportunity to learn new skills and be trusted with many responsibilities. This is a season position for most, which can be good or bad, depending on your needs."
good,"Typical day 9-5.  Answering phones , scheduling appointments, taking payments.  I was able to improve my people handling skills.  Hardest part of the job was having to empty the trash in the outside dumpster in the cold of winter.  Most enjoyable was meeting all kinds of people and in some cases being able to help them."
good,"I like to inter-act with Spanish Customers, and the working Scedules are flexible."
good,I truly enjoyed working for Lifetouch Photography.. Capturing those smiles of every child was awesome. I enjoyed working with my co workers and we all got a long very well. Team work was truly there at this company.
good,Worked with very knowledgeable people in the area of taxes.  Was able to learn the system of electronic filing of state and Federal tax returns.
good,"I love working for this company, except for some people there. I had a bad experience there but over all with out that person it was nice working there."
good,"Greeting new clients daily, Using a point of sales system, very friendly and helpful co-workers. Dealing with clients. Very friendly staff."
good,I enjoyed working with all the different clients I had to deal with. Each one had a unique tax situation and it was a challenging job.
good,"Long hours, good pay, no breaks. This is a temporary position. No benefits provided. Understaffed and overworked. Undertrained."
good,"It is a nice job and the employees are very helpful , accomadating and nice."
good,"client bring fraud slips."
good,Good seasonal work. Very professional place to work. Enjoy it so much I go back every year.
good,"The offices that I have worked in during several tax seasons have varied from nice and friendly with tax pros cooperating to high stressed with the tax pros cutting each others throats (so to speak).  The management in the district office is good but they are not always able to oversee issues in the various offices.  A typical day would be opening up, greeting clients, setting appointments, accepting payments and preparing bank deposits, filing and answering phones setting appointments and cleaning the waiting area.  Closing the office includes cleaning waste baskets, bathrooms and vacuuming the floor.  I learned about how taxes are prepared."
good,"I always liked to educate clients about how to manage their finances and investments, co-workers were always there to help if questions came up, I found it very enjoyable to inform them of areas of tax returns they did not know."
good,"Same as previous review, I already wrote a review or H&R Block"
good,Working at H and R Block was interesting.  I met a lot of nice people.  I enjoyed talking to the customers and making them feel comfortable when they came into the office.
good,"Love to learn more each day. About a Job"
good,I learned that the values of the company don't always show in the individual offices but the overall feeling is expressed on a Corporate level.
good,"Assisting the public with thier tax returns could be stressful, but the smiles from clients made the stress and long hours during peak week well worth it. The hardest part of this job was dealing with stressed out people worried about thier tax situations. Helping find solutions and watching the relief smiles made this job well worth the stress."
good,I have been doing taxes now for 7 years it has always been extra income after the holidays.
good,You work hard and fast. There is constant client contact and you upgrade your skills all the time.
good,I kept exremely busy and interacted with all sorts of different clients. I had to multitask and was responsible for large amounts of money. My management was good to work for.
good,"Answering inbound calls. Assisting with customers needs. Finding locations,problem solving in accounts and answering any questions or complaints."
good,Well organized company and had a good staff they have many office every where and so they easy to reached  the pay rate not equal to my qualification but still professional company
good,"They offer continuing education, can test up as early as you want, enjoyed helping clients and other tax associates, your own cubicle, hands on training."
good,"I would like to come back to only the long branch office working day time only hours. Working the front desk."
good,"I am a seasonal field employee, not a full time/perm employee at HQ."
good,"I learned and gained tax expertise with different situations. "
good,You are allowed to make your own schedule depending on your availability. The managers encourage you to increase your certification to better serve your clients
good,taking care of people is my specialty.  As a customer service representative I met people and helped them make appointments with the correct tax professionals.
good,"Loved working with the people and clients. The company had a great training program for new people. "
good,"The eight years I worked for this company was awesome! Each manager was in tune with their employees, and like any office you have a few bad apples; but they didn't rot the overall experience. The past five years the new District Manager poisoned the work environment and employed those who shared her same toxic views. I no longer have people apply for any position at this company in the Genesee County area."
good,"The recruiting department had been a revolving door before I started. I figured out why in my time there, the manager at the time was a very mean spirited woman, and thought she was above everyone. I would recommend working here in any other department as the location, building, culture and people are great."
good,"This company was a great opportunity for me. It gave me many options to learn and developed different skills, such as customer service, organization, team work and others valuables attitudes during all these years working with them."
good,"the sad part is it is seasonal work. Al lot goes into learning the job, and opportunity to return for following season is strong. i do not have enough experience with this company to give much additional information.  the company is well known."
good,Good place to start and work your way up. Classes offered to promote your knowledge into a more seasoned associate. It's a gradual process but is worth it if you put in an effort.
good,"Fast paced, customer focus, team collaboration, daily goal updates, hard working.  Hardest part of the job is the long hours.  Most enjoyable part of the job would be the client interaction and OM support and collaboration."
good,"Met many new people,  slow and fast paced depending upon time of year, new experiences daily,  docked for lunch whether was able to take one or not. Very routine"
good,"This was a temporary seasonal job.  At times it was busy and fast paced while other times it was slow and unchallenging. I met some great people and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, there was no advancement during the time I worked there but was called back to work for them the following tax season. I did not go back because I was able to find a full -time job."
good,"I worked in one of many offices in the city. I was a receptionist. I could not live on the salary that I was offered. I was not always happy with the lack of hours. The hours fluctuate from week to week. Some days were not full days, and even during the peak part of the season, I rarely worked 40 hours per week. I had a good work environment and most of the staff were very kind."
good,"very hostile and stressful profession.  Since its a commission based service, tax preparers can be very hostile toward each other. also the tax laws change every year, so there is a lot of continuous training."
good,Preparing taxes for clients was interesting and I learned a lot about doing taxes since we always had to take more classes each summer to prepare for the next season.
good,"Clean bathrooms, waiting room and all the employees desk before we started work. (Done in the morning and at night).  I leaner how to talk to clients and explain what they needed to bring with them for appointments. Scheduled appointments, call clients to remind them or change appointments if need too. I went to class to become a TAX Professional, but didn't pass the test. I think some of the management needed to realize that you can't show favoritism to one employee.  I worked as a Customer Service Rep. Sometimes working with clients that were upset they owed money to the IRS.  Getting to meet different people talking with them about where they came from and what they did for a living."
good,"While the job was exciting and the people were great to work with, upper management is disconnected from the field and does not understand what is needed to achieve corporate goals."
good,"Unfortunately, due to the nature of the season, there is no real advancement for regional/district/seasonal hires. As Tax professionals, you can increase your education and continue to earn a higher salary but in other roles, there is no upward advancement."
good,"This place pays the bills, and gives you experience. They provide on the job training. You handle sensitive information so they do not allow phones on the floor. You take calls all day and it isn't too bad."
good,I like working at HR Block because of the knowledge I gain. The one thing that doesn't make a full working day in the online tax programs. The hardest part is telling someone the owe rather than getting a refund or their refund amount is not what they'd expect.
good,"Great place to work as a Customer Service Representative (receptionist). Was able to practice my organizational and communications skills working with seven tax pros. Welcomed taxpayer clients who walked in, make appointments for call ins, and helped with payments as clients left the office. Supportive staff whom I got to know over the course of three tax seasons. It could be fun, humorous, stressful and hectic at differnent times, but I would go back next year if asked."
good,Will go for another season next year. Some of first year experiences not professional due to weak management. Will work in another office area.  Long time employees look out for own profit.
good,The management is not good at my place of work. Never get feedback on anything. H&R Block needs to return to the old way of managing. I think we would have less of a turnover if the manager was more interested in what worker have to say.
good,The location I was placed at the older employees do not like new people. So they refuse to help and guild new comers. They would not give you correct information so they can steal clients. They are more worried about there own income.
good,I enjoyed working with the senior tax pros. They were very knowledgeable and willing to help if we needed it. I would have cheerfully continued working there if the office was open year-round.
good,it was a good job but you only work 5 months out of a year and the pay is not very good.  the people are are nice and easy to get along with. I enjoyed working there just not enough hours or money
good,Block has encouraged their online program so that it hurts the hurts the office preparer. They put high stipulations on the prepares that it makes retention hard. Pay for 1st years is awful. They don’t even get commission.
good,"I worked up front at the reception desk using a phone that had to be held with my head bent over my left shoulder. Upon receiving customers at the front door, I directed them to the seating area and offered them coffee or water. I took it to them if they were in need of assistance. Upon returning to the desk, I answered incoming calls requesting appointments, verification of tax preparation forms, verification of preparation appointments. The call completion was done by entering the request in the H & R Block multitasking appointment programs. Outbound calling was done to reschedule or remind clients of pending appointments, sometimes resulting in rescheduling (multitasking program to complete reschedule transaction). At the day's end I cleaned the office, coffee and water dispensers, supplied napkins and cups to the beverage area, locked the front desk."
good,Management is wonderful. Just seasonal work. They offer all courses you want to take for $20.00 per year. Offer on the job training with pay. The hardest part of the job is giving clients bad news of owing the government.
good,I loved the competitiveness of trying to make sure our company got our clients back more money than any other competition out there. My longevity speaks for itself.
good,A typical work day may or may not be busy all depending on what was going on at that time.  I learned a lot during my time there.  Management was very good.
good,I enjoy doing peoples taxes for them and helping them out.  I do not like the prices that we have to charge them.  I like the flexibility of this job but i have no benefits at all here.
good,"Enjoyed doing taxes.  They changed the way they pay.  No longer pay per return, pay less than minimum wage and no benefits.  A lot of classes to take to stay up to day with the laws."
good,"Good seasonal job could give benefits and paid time off . Management could be more involved with issues, the floor walkers could be more professionals."
good,My job was a front desk greeter for customers.  I would pull files of clients  and put them in que to be helped.  I also entered things into the computer and collected money.
good,"I liked it here.  it was great.  Management sucked, but other than that - GREAT! Not much else to report on really.  Too bad it is only a seasonal job!"
good,it was a temporary job to a buyer and it worked well and liked the owner of HR Block and the tax preparation job and like meeting new people all the time and scheduling to get in to their tax return
good,If you don't have any kids yhen this is a good place to work. They dont care about your outside life. You have 12 pts to get fired. They are pretty good with that. If you cant keep up you are out.
good,This is an environment supporting several tax professionals.   Their was a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  As April 15th approached the pace became very fast paced!
good,"Good place to work.  Had the privilege to work with a wonderful boss in Trevor Combs and with that learned a lot dealing with organization skills, dealing with different departments and having an idea or project assigned and bringing everything together for a successful assignment."
good,"Higher management then just store managers are the problem. No one has a straight forward answer. But the job is not that difficult, you greet, and answer phones and limited questions."
good,I believe that I did a lot of work for the pay. There was lots of colleges who were treated better then others. There could have been more incentives to show appreciation.
good,"You are preparing people taxes and all the problems that come with "
good,Nice environment. Great people to work with. But was part time seasonal. I needed something that was all year long.  There were no benefits or possible advancements.
good,Observing a company that basically shuts down and reopens 90% of its operations every year was inspiring. The organization of such a machine was impressive. It is very time consuming during the tax season.
good,"I really have nothing bad to say about the job; I will say that there is more marketing for business than anything, pretty slow for the most part and a lot of down time."
good,It was a good job over all but the pay was not. Being a Customer service representative is who the customers meet first and preps for the tax provider. I think the pay for Customer service representatives should be improved.
good,"I worked there for a few years and it was the perfect seasonal job. But as the years went on, I just did it for the money. I stopped enjoying the job. I enjoyed seeing some of the people i worked with and some of the clients, but I disliked my last district manager. How you come from Starbucks, thinking you know all about taxes and the tax customer, especially when you could not complete a return yourself. H&R Block as a company did a lot of stupid things and lost a lot of good people and going to continue to do so."
good,"I was an first year office manger expected to manage staff, schedule staffing by prior year stats, market the local are to bring in new clients. Open and close the office 7 days a week, often 10-12 days. Assigned goals in selling add on products."
good,good company for seasonal work. fast paced once tax season gets rolling. if you have a client base it is easier to make money. have been doing it for year.
good,H&R block is a great job for experience. The Street team Is a fun experience to get out and interact with the public about a great company. The Job is a very hands on job.
good,"love the job they really need to work on who they hire as office management. It is my favorite job, just wish I had more hours. but they are great at working around any schedule"
good,"It doesn't have any benefits and is only seasonal and part-time. "
good,"For the amount of work that is expected, the pay is way to low.  One of the downfalls, it is just a temporary position.  Job is very stressful and you must be very upbeat with customer service and accuracy which is definitely a plus."
good,If you are looking for February to end of April work and School to refresh your learning from September to January this is the place for you. Most people are ok to work with.
good,"Typical day starts with signage and balloons, answering phones, greeting clients, scheduling appointments,maintaining waiting area, accepting payments and evening shift end of day cash closeout."
good,A good company to learn tax preparation however the ever changing structuring in the company compensation and demands provide challenging for earning growth. Management tends to favor certain professionals over others.
good,"Good company with professional staff, good management. Possibility to continue your education for the small fee. But very small hourly rates. No benefits for tax preparers."
good,"Doesn't pay very well and not much in the way of benefits. But it is fun place to work and meet people.  Greeting the clients, scheduling and confirming appointments for tax preparers. The hardest part is when it is slow and trying to keep busy."
good,My experience with H&R Block has been a pleasant one. The management helped me to get settled in very quickly. I was able to get the hang of the job quickly.
good,I believe this was a good learning position for me and a door that I needed to take at that time.  I am glad to had the experience.
good,"Occasionally fast paced and challenging working environment. Very welcoming and comfortable environment, can be very relaxed. Great experience with customer service."
good,The pay was very minimal for the amount of work that we did. Very busy office. Formed a great bond with my coworkers and the management was great(former manager).
good,"1. Assisting clients with their concerns about their personal taxes"
good,Learned a lot on my own since management was in a different state but still didn't mind since I worked at my own pace. It was very enjoyable I loved it.
good,"I have no opinion of this company at this time, just needed employment when moved to Hawaii, this was not my chosen field."
good,"As a tax specialist I had a lot of my own clientele that I prepared taxes for among which were small business owners, I gave tax advice, issued checks and received payments."
good,This was a good job and I enjoyed working there for the many years that I did. I never truly felt respected or taken seriously though. It was hard to work only 4 months out of the year and have so much training to do without compensation.
good,Pay attention to the pay of long time employees compared to new employees. You will realize being a long time employee you make significantly less that new/no experienced employees. You meet people from all walks of life!
good,"It closed its local center the people where great, great invective pay."
good,I loved doing taxes and working with my clients. I recall every client coming into the office and I did my professional best to complete their return with a favorable end. It was not always possible to meet with every client that I had prepared a return in years past; this was disappointing and I worked for my client's loyalty.  Co-workers worked together when a situation arose that was different and needed assistance.  My leaving H&R Block was health issues.
good,"A day at work is busy , deal with a lot of tax Questions, put folders together for the clients to get their taxes prepared, answer the phone and also make appointments."
good,"Scheduling employees, training, handling complaints via phone and in person. Performance Reviews. Some tax returns and auditing some work. That I wanted to move up with this particular company, but found they do not like to promote from within. I had great management team and could easily talk to them at any time. The hardest part of my job was the performance reviews for those who were not living up to the standard. The best part was the Potlucks and the many lunches we enjoyed together as a team."
good,During my time working at H&R Block many days were spent sitting waiting for customer to walk in to have their tax returns completed. When you are not a seasoned tax preparer you do not have many scheduled appointment unless you 'take to the streets' and advertise yourself to your clients. You must school yourself up to at least 6 months of the year and must be tested by the federal government in order to be employed to prepare taxes. Its a lot of hard work and dedication. There was no health care package because you are a seasonal employee. The coworkers are friendly however competitive for customers. Hours are flexible to your schedule and customer appointments.
good,Very Hard working support specialists. People are great to work with
good,"income driven environment. seasonal work no job security"
good,Clerical in addition to opening and closing. Handle and determine the best match for the client and preparer.
good,"Good seasonal job, has many different locations to work. Can choose location near home. "
good,"My typical day at work is very busy, dealing with multiple things at once, answering phones, scheduling appointments, taking payments for income tax returns, computer skills, andswering many tax inquiries and dealing with people."
good,"During this seasonal assignment, I was responsible for running two separate offices. My daily duties consisted of supervision, scheduling, marketing, and staff development."
good,"I learned a lot is a good company, but job is seasonal. There is a lot of learning and requirements, also meet IRS and CTEC compliance."
good,Served as a great second job. Co-workers were wonderful and just good all around.
good,"The work is exciting, each client is different, with different problems,"
good,A day at work is like feeling confortable with the people that you work for. I learned that you can help clients as well as having to learn about what the company actually does. The co- workers are helpful and friendly. The hardest part about the job is to talk to the clients that is having a problem. I must say the enjoyable part about the job is knowing that you have help at least one client to understand the end an out about taxes.
good,h&r block is a great place to work if you are only looking for a temp position. you can gain lots of experience.
good,"A day at work consist of a revolving door of customer and learning the office and how to make it run smoothly. Management was not where is should have been, but worked for the office. Co-worker, everyone has there days. I just try to keep work with work and home with home. There really wasn't anything hard about the job or position. the enjoyment of getting up and working everyday."
good,"I learned a new software, peoplesoft. The co-workers and management were good. The hardest part was that this job was only seasonal. I enjoyed preparing tax returns."
good,As a CSP you market for a couple weeks and I feel like i didn’t compensated enough for the running I did.  I’m gonna get $20 of the gas I paid out and that’s it. So I say other than that it’s a good temp job your not going to get full time hours or a check but it’ll get you though.
good,"This is a  good job for someone who likes repetition. But, be careful, tax preparers can get a little  bogged down come April. A lot of work crammed into a very short season."
good,"I truly enjoyed most of the time I spent at H&R Block. I'd like to continue working there, but I moved to another state. I've applied here, but haven't been contacted."
good,"I enjoyed my 10 years working for Block, I met some wonderful co workers, as well as great customers to assist with their Taxes. Did not like Franchise."
good,"This job is best suited for someone who has a second source of annual income whether it be pension, SS, full time job, or spousal income due to only making respectable money during tax season"
good,An excellent team collaborative and supportive environment and the office manager offers a lot of flexibility with the work timings. Overall a great place to kickstart the tax accountant career.
good,"Lots of favoritism.  Mgt is more of a challange than clients  when they feel the heat of trickle down mgt."
good,Fast paced office with long hours during peak times. Great training! Try to remember that people get upset over having to pay taxes not at you.sometimes take it out on you. Must have great customer service skills.
good,"It is a good company for work with . "
good,Salary not good but overall good place to work.   Seasonal job but really enjoy working for H & R Block and enjoy greeting clients and making the office neat and organized.
good,"It was a little crazy at times, but overall good staff, and great clients."
good,"Management at H & R Block was amazing and very helpful."
good,"I managed my own clients and prepared tax returns, assisted with business to business marketing, and completed CPE hours and mandatory training courses.  I learned Blockworks software for personal tax preparation, various tax codes including the Affordable Care Act, and customer service skills.  The management was not available very often so many decisions had to made among the staff and the workplace environment was friendly but competitive.  The hardest part of the job was managing various rolls due to under staffing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients."
good,"The leads could be more helpful. The male lead was kinda a rude. However, the female leads were awesome. Manager was amazing. Very good for full time student to gain experience."
good,I have been with the company working on 15+ yrs. I enjoyed working with my colleagues but the training process is too complex and less flexible. The training material is not user friendly.
good,"Most people juggle this stint with their regular jobs: working evenings and weekends to make some extra money. "
good,Yes I would recommend H&R Block it's a good learning step for beginners coming out of school I was the only team where you work 6 months on 6 months off which is okay for beginners
good,"It was really a nice experience working with H&R block  all the Staffs specially the manager is very helpfull, this is an easy job  snd convenient for coz it’s also near my place."
good,Typical day at work was waiting for people to come in and do there taxes. Busy at times where you were going through one tax return to the next. All different places so work culture is professional but different.
good,"I have been a certified tax pro for 13 years, but this was my first year with Block. They provide excellent tools for training and education. I was given all the hours I wanted. I was very pleased with my manager. I worked out of 2 offices and there were different levels of tax pros in each office. My co-workers really helped me to learn the computer program and they were always available to answer questions. My only complaint is regarding the incentive bonus program. I think it needs to be restructured so that newer tax pros have more of an opportunity to earn a bonus."
good,"It was ok but is not my carrer. I study to do better in life this is just a temporary job."
good,This job was always seasonal for me.  I enjoyed this job a lot.  I started as a tax specialist and then to a tax adviser.  I enjoyed serving my clients and assisting them with their financial needs.
good,"And I did attend a course to prepare taxes, so I've come away with a lot more knowledge, but mostly the ability to understand how to read a tax form. Really, it's just following the instructions in order."
good,"it is a good place to work with to lean everything about Tax field, but they hire people like me just during the Tax season so that is why I am looking for a full time job."
good,Wouldn't recommend working for an CORPORATE Block. Try and find a Franchise that values the employees above all else. Typical day is answering phone calls and pricing points.
good,"HR BLOCK has allowed me to learn federal and state taxes.  It has provided me with the opportunity to expand on my knowledge with taxes and client relationships.  "
good,I enjoyed ever aspects of this job was challenging but i learned alot i got to meet exciting people very faced paced and had to multi task which is one of my strong points. It made confront issues that i had to be strong and know the proper procedures.
good,"I was literally just a last minute hire to help rope in former clients to get them to come back. I only did this a few times and once everyone on the list had been contacted, they no longer needed my assistance. The only problem was that I was scheduled via text message, and I wasn't notified when they no longer needed me."
good,"Free coffee"
good,I really enjoyed working at H and R Block. however the owner of the H and R Block wasn't very nice at all.  Sometimes he would be ok interms of reconizing people when they made his quota look good. I remember one time that our store had the highest.  That time was on of the only times that he was happy.
good,"A typical days work would include turning on all computers and printers; Making sure the printers had enough paper in them. We would do some light cleaning such as dusting, wiping down desks.  We would welcome each client as if it was their first time with us. Made phone calls to previous clients. Over all, I enjoyed working for H & R Block."
good,The job is seasonal so it gives employees time to break away and then come back next year.  Most people have other jobs or businesses.  It is not a place to make big bucks but it is a place to better your tax knowledge.  The company has great training so you will always learn something new.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block was working at full steam ahead.  The office I worked in was a very busy office and it made the day go by fast.  I was able to learn the management portion of the job the last year I worked and was able to work with the District Manager with marketing, reports and scheduling employees.  The hardest part of the job was working the schedules and trying to fit the right people in on days they wanted and did not want to work along with changes made after getting the schedule set.  I enjoyed working with the clients that came into the office."
good,Buen ambiente buenos compañeros falta más enseñanza
good,"My job with H&R Block was only seasonal but I enjoyed every minute of it, I learned so much from the people I worked with the ladies were amazing and allowed me to put more hours in if it was possible. I would totally recommend this company and it's people."
good,"Ok for a seasonal job."
good,Seasonal  with free training for advancement.  Friendly environment and flexible.  Good workers.  Very knowledgeable and experienced. Clean working environment.
good,"Fun work place, but only minimum salary with unsecure job environment. People around the environment are nice and willing to help new emplyee,........."
good,"The first job after graduating from college was challenging.  Some of the older co-workers were apprehensive about training a new graduate.  However, management was very supportive and provided me with the tools I needed to be successful in my role."
good,"I enjoyed many of the people I worked with sometimes. Managers of Franchise were great! Some over you in the office don't like questions. Managers do! Customers are usually nice, except those few who don't like the outcome of their taxes which can't be helped, only can give advice for next season preparing. Slow period can be REALLY boring! I enjoyed being busy."
good,"It was a good company to learn more."
good,"Great work environment, co-workers, ect. I really enjoy working for H&R Block. The thing is I'm a single mom with a morgage. And the work is part time and seasonal. I don't make enough to be able to draw unemployment. So I have to look elsewhere for the mean time or if I'm lucky I'll be able to find a permanent position elsewhere."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the amazing clients.  I also hit the jackpot with co-workers I was blessed to be matched up with some very talented senior people.
good,"This is a sales oriented, accountable culture, but is a seasonal position. You need a strong work ethic to work here.  You must be able to talk to and interview people and be responsible for all due diligence."
good,"H&R Block offers employees training to ensure we prepare an accurate tax return. This is a high stress fast paced business, employees need better support from management"
good,This place is good if you are in need to get back into the work force or for additional income. There is a place for advancement if you are going from answering the phones to preparing taxes.
good,"Very busy reviewing reports, marketing, scheduling, responding to client surveys and resolving client complaints.  many meetings concerning total product revenue."
good,My employment at H&R Block is very confidential and assuring customers their personal information is safe with us.  I feel very productive on a daily basis as a Customer Service Professional.  Assuring customers that their appointment's are on their Tax Professionals schedule.  Also assuring the office personnel including the management that the office is running in accordance with our office policies and procedure's.  The most enjoyable and  important part of my job is assisting the customer with first time quality service via telephone as a Customer Sales Specialist or in person as a licensed Tax Professional in 2017 and a Customer Service Professional in 2018.
good,"Nice people to work with but can get stressful at peak time of year."
good,"Short staffed on CSP's, usually worked 9:30am-9pm with about 3 hour break in-between, between two offices. The one office manager was hardly in our office, the other was very competitive and took others clients. Slow work pace when it was not during the tax season."
good,It can be stressful at times but also really rewarding. It is a fun place to work and there are fun people to work with. They are really good about training you for what you will need to handle.
good,Everyone here is friendly and patient. Learned how to do various administrative tasks and was good for an intro in the administrative field. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers
good,I received the best development. Learned about multi unit leadership and building business partnerships. Leadership is very hands on. Company believes in its people and strives to make the environment a good one to work in
good,"Its a good job to have if your looking to learn, it can become difficult depending on if you want to make it a career or just a seasonal job. I have learned many new things working at HR Block."
good,Handled tax preparation for customers efficiently. Ensured tax preparation was completed in a timely fashion.  Certified tax documentation was accurately completed to expedite customer’s tax returns.
good,Loved job but it’s ridiculous that office staff need to stand entire 8 hour shift.  Staff was great though and willing to help you transition to be successful at HR BLock.
good,"Great place to learn about taxes in general. You get to do all different kinds of taxes from individuals, small businesses, and corporate taxes. You get a lot of experience when working for Block."
good,"Working at H&R block is a great first job to have if you are looking for a front desk position with some computer related tasks."
good,"starting a typical day at work you need to do call backs per call logs and previous clients"
good,It was great experience my manager was the best. While I worked there I never had a problem. Since I only worked seasonal I didn’t get any benefits. But other than that at time it did get stressful but that’s any tax season ! But we always tried to make it a fun place
good,"Working for H&R Block is only a seasonal job. Usually you work from Jan to April during the tax season. There isn't much in the way of benefits unless you're a Tax Pro. But it is an eye opening job to see how much work actually goes into getting taxes done, and the amount of knowledge these Tax Preparers actually retain."
good,"Greeting clients in a personalized, friendly, and inviting mannerMatching clients with the best-suited tax professional for their needsScheduling clients how they would like to be scheduledHandling client exits by ensuring all current and future needs are metMaintaining office cleanliness and organization of resources with team membersOther duties as assigned and you get your taxes done for free"
good,My first year was amazing. My Team Leader and Co-workers worked as a family. When you needed help they came to your rescue. The second year was not organized nor managed correctly. The office was unbalance when it came to number of year experience. I would work for H&R Block again. Over all I did have a good experience with them. I value my time with them.
good,Was a seasonal job only there for a friend needed my help. But a nice place to work. I loved the people they treated me well. I enjoyed working there and would work there again if I could.
good,"Fast pace environment, Need ability to work around hard to deal with clientele. The hardest part of the job was going between irritated clients and irritated tax professional that were keeping it together for clients with complicated returns. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the team learns to work with each other and leans on each other more like family. there was good days and bad days but it was never so bad that it could not be left for the next day."
good,"I enjoyed  working with the staff and managing the numerous offices.  However, the amount of hours and time spent was not compensated by monetary or benefits as should have been."
good,"I only worked through 2 tax seasons  so no benefits. Greeted clients, called and confirmed tax appts. Kind of stressful at times keeping track of clients waiting for tax professional. Training classes were beneficial in knowing what to expect daily.  Very fast paced at certain times. Worst part of job was repetitive calling past clients."
good,"it was great place to work for the first 17 years "
good,I help take in tax work from clients.  I learn about preparing taxes on computer.  My manager was helpful as needed.  I enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to prepare more complicated tax returns due to lack of knowledge.  I feel I needed more training for the more complex tax returns.
good,"This was a relaxed, yet structured office environment. I greeted the client at the door, channeled them to their individual preparer, answered the phone, made appointments, kept up the office equipment...it was a busy place, especially as April 15th loomed near."
good,I like working at H&R Block but it is just seasonal.  The pay after 10 years should be more than a first year Customer Service Professional makes.  I would recommend this job to someone that is a people person and likes to help people.
good,I enjoy working for H&R Block I have been with them for 13 years now but I do have to say that I wish we got a bit as they took away the employee free tax return.
good,"It was very nice,professional work environment. Excellent traing schedule . Must maintain a certain number of CEU's to remain employed , which can be demanding while not being compensated."
good,"Laid-back and slow paced work environment.  Hours and days varied by the week. Answered telephone, greeted clients, scheduled appointments, and did light housekeeping duties."
good,"Prepare and consult on tax matter. Very relaxed and slow paced. "
good,Surroundings and people I worked with were great.  Hours were as needed except during peak tax time. Manager was a personal friend and had good rapport with them and clients.
good,"I am retired so it is a good place to work.  It is only for a few months a year, the hours are flexible and the work is very interesting.  Good learning opportunities available if you take them."
good,This was a really good work experience. I didn't go home stressed. Just wish it had better benefit options for seasonal workers. They seem to appreciate all of their employees though.
good,"-complete flexibility in job schedule"
good,I enjoyed working for H&R Block for the short time I worked there. I like accounting very much. My supervisor was great to me so I was fine with the job requirements.
good,"The company has no benefits for seasonal employees.  A typical day at work, this last season our manager did not respect the hours of availability and change these without a request.  its competivie"
good,"During employment you will answer phones, emails, fax, make copies, schedule appointments, and must be available from 9 am to 9 pm.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get someone to help you when you are stuck, no one wants to take time away from their clients to help you with yours."
good,Was encouraged to learn complex tax preparations by office manager.  I enjoyed working with clients in attempting to get them the best return possible.
good,It's a good environment & respects both clients and employees. The season will have it's hight and it's low. Be prepared to adjust. The training does help.
good,The classes were good and the employees were fun to work with. It was easy to schedule around a full-time job and family.  I enjoyed meeting the clients and seeing familiar faces year to year.
good,"Worked this as a second job, in addition to my primary. They have a good flexible schedule. The work is challenging but they have technology in place to make it easier. Good training, etc."
good,I was treated as a professional. Management encouraged me to take the course so I could be come a tax professional. Very rewarding position. Great co- workers.
good,"Pros: Set your own schedule, meet some great people"
good,"Great opportunity to learn as much as one desires from continuing education. People are great to work with. Challenging returns."
good,Every year we had to update our tax knowledge.  This allowed us to be ahead of other tax services in our ability to help clients.  I found this type of education very helpful season after season.
good,"typical day is doing taxes, always room for improvement on skills, most enjoyable part of job is helping people hardest part is trying to get an issue resolved that you have absolutly no control of . the culture there is very fast paced at times."
good,"my position is a year-round management position that is very challenging during the tax season, and has many other roles during the off season.   Company leadership doesn't focus on the right things, leading to difficult results.  prices are too high and value for returning clients is poor, which makes retention very difficult.  the company has lots of tools at its disposal, yet doesn't use them effectively and, in my opinion, they decide to focus on things that do not actually drive a strong retail and client experience to get people to want to come back year after year."
good,"I enjoy working with numbers and helping people, this job helps me to do both. It is very interesting learning all the different tax codes, and being able to help clients in ways they are not aware of."
good,Lots of unpaid and required education. Lots of up-selling. Tax work feels secondary. Usual corporate pros and cons. Great place if you have an aptitude for math and need seasonal work.
good,"As a Client Service Professional (Receptionist/Scheduler) working for this company on a seasonal basis was ok. Sometimes I would get nice hours, other times, not many at all, but it was rather a fair experience."
good,"I enjoy preparing the tax returns and helping the clients.  Answering questions is a consistent focus and learning all the time of tax knowledge."
good,The available trainings are great learning tools. My role is seasonal and remote. Hours are flexible. Company provides necessary resources and tools to perform.
good,"H&R Block is, overall, a fairly good place to work. The work environment is positive, the tax professionals are easy to work with and helpful, and the clients are much different from what I expected. It would have been helpful to be informed in the interview that there would be weeks of little to no hours due to clients not making appointments for those weeks."
good,"Management does not know the job. All employees should work and be paid all year, you can't keep employees if they have to look for another job once tax season ends. Upper management does not understand what tax Professionals have to do and should have to do one income tax class a year to understand the job. No work life balance."
good,My personal experience was not the best. I loved the district manger and the job itself. But the office manager (supervisor) was very rude and would not aid anyone.
good,Company has not had bookkeeping in their offices before and has bought a office with it. But expects the same type of gain on bookkeeping as the get on tax returns.   Corporate does not understand bookkeeping issues.
good,"Like working with people, answering phone and data entry and computer.  Management was hands on to help what we needed.  Great co-workers.  "
good,"Great company with regards to up to date tax information and filing always, but is not lucrative. Spent 2 years and pay scale keeps changing to avoid you making money."
good,"Being a receptionist for H&R Block has definitely opened my eyes to the corporate lifestyle. Management is wonderful..but the steps above management?...Not so much. Couldn't get much help from them. Hardest part of my job was telling our loyal clients we hadn't a promotion for them, but that all the promotions were for new clients. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and being able to put my administrative assistant skills to work."
good,Loved the ratio from work to home it was very convenient with scheduling! The management had its flaws and the staff had their bad days but they were great to work with!
good,"This is an awesome job, very demanding. The most enjoyable part of my day is moving from task to task. The hardest part of the job is the hours during tax season."
good,our office leader was so helpful... I learned a lot from her; co-workers were easy to get along with and the clients were varied but so nice ... the job itself is nice but the facilities need some work - the washroom is so far away from the office/unit
good,"Enjoyed being a part of the team.  It was like an extended family.  I love working with people and enjoyed the contact.  There was a great pleasure in being able to help all types of people and circumstances.  As an instructor, it gave a level of accomplishment"
good,"I enjoyed working with the hispanics, but they had their own clique.  We werent even allowed to sit on their row.  Work was basically one question.  When will I get my tax return?  or setting up appts with Tax pros.  working downtown was different for me.  Not as bad as I expected.  Some of the sups were really bad."
good,"answer questions for tax"
good,"Only worked for H&R Block for one season so far and it was not as productive as I would have hoped. Hope to get rehired for next season which I am confident I will. "
good,"Process Tax returns for clients, make appointment phone calls and work some case studies."
good,"I managed two offices my first year and prepared taxes.  In subsequent years, I managed the district office and prepared over 200 tax returns/year."
good,"In the office my first activity is to review and reply to emails."
good,"This is a temporary work, it is only on tax season. Although the majority of the taxpayer returns are similar, everyday someone bring in a new document or situation that's offer a opportunity to learn. We works in an empathy and friendly ambient. The most hardest part of the job is that we have to offer products and convince the client. The most satisfying is when I finished a return that have a combinations of documents, troubles, situations and etc."
good,I started as a front desk coordinator my first year and then was promoted to office lead the following. During the off season I did district employment assistant. Overall a good company to work for. You can sometimes feel like management doesn't have your back. It is an amazing feeling to help good people get money they need and there is alot of room for growth whether it be internally or via additional tax training to be able to handle harder cases. I do not believe the pay is good enough for what is asked of employees and I did feel like it consumed my life during the season. It would be excellent as a part time or secondary job. A major drawback would be the competitive nature of the office between tax professionals which causes extreme stress and an unfavorable environment. This is due to them being paid commission on their returns. Perhaps a higher rate of pay based on tax knowledge and no bonus would make it less crazy.
good,H & R Block is a great company to work for and to learn about taxes. The receptionist position can be demanding at times. You will start working in the end of January and hours will be full time for a couple weeks. Your hours will drop drastically after the first Peek.
good,"My typical day at work.."
good,"* Daily review of the number of tax return filled with management."
good,"Depends upon the office, staff, and management team in the office. They are flexible with hours since most people who work here do it as a second job."
good,"H&R Block was a really fun place to work. I love working with different people all the time. The managers were very nice. I took a three month class for this job and learned all the new laws of taxes. The co-workers were people that I already new from the class, this made it easier to work with everyone. The hardest part of the job were unsatisfied customers. We can only be nice but we cannot control the IRS."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work and I love it, it was just hard because of not having benefits. At first it was hard looking for a job. It was hard to not have benefits. I used to come in really early, before anyone else and clean the entire office, and pull the files for that day."
good,"The positions are seasonal. If they start to have a low call volume you can be chosen to end season at that point. great way to start customer service experience. Answer inbound call, data entry."
good,"H&R Block is very conscious on family matters and are very flexible."
good,"•	Prepared over 300 Personal tax returns across a variety of forms "
good,Please to work for them. Just need a more steady job. Everything here is seasonal and never guaranteed.
good,"You pay for the course for the first year and are offered employment if your grades are well enough."
good,"Working for H&R Block is best suited to the marginally retired or the financially secure. If you are looking for a full time position or want long term steady employment this is not the job for you. If you want a little something extra and some wonderful people to work with, then hey! You found your home. I love what I do and who I work with, but I am looking for a career, so I guess this isn't the position for me, even though they have been my only employer for the past five years. I have held something like 19 different positions and signed at least as many contracts in the past five years. Which seems crazy to most. I will tell you that if you are lucky enough to be able to try this out for the purpose of having a little extra on the side while you moon-light then what a treat. You will learn about yourself, about the country, and about taxes, but you will find new friends as well."
good,"Responsible for preparing taxes on a daily basis."
good,"I liked this job a lot. Got to meet and greet a lot of customers, and interacting with them was even more fun!"
good,Job was dealing with clients who wanted to come in and get their taxes done.
good,I enjoy working for Block.  I am looking for a permanent position that is year round.
good,My typical day at work was busy. I learned a lot about doing taxes. In-house management was great. I absolutely enjoyed all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was not having the resources to place clients with the proper tax preparer for their level of complexity. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people from other countries.
good,The workplace was okay. I got to interact with a lot of people on a daily basis. I usually the first contact person when someone walks through the door. It was an awesome experience. Management wasn't so great at the location but the employees were very productive.
good,"I have worked for this company for 6 years."
good,"It can be a high pace work environment.  The outcome of helping the clients and working with the staff makes it worth the out come.  Always have positive, friendly atmosphere were we like to be in a comfortable work place."
good,"Stable company with good coworkers.  Pay is good, but health benefits are not good.  Company is always on the cutting edge of the tax market."
good,During tax season you work your tail off then you are dropped like a hot rock. The pay for the first two years is minimum wage and you are expected to like it.
good,"I work at H & R Block for the people that I work for. They are a great group, and I love meeting new people with the customers."
good,Great one on one experience with clients. Very nice and helpful employees.
good,"I would come in clock in, after clocking in I would walk over and check to make sure copiers were full with paper. I would double check to make sure that clients were confirmed for the next 2 days. I would also have to file, If they need confirmation # that the IRS received their taxes I would put that on a certain form with their information on it."
good,Nice people and place to work.Learn all aspects of preparing taxes and senior preparers were excellent in helping you when you needed help in preparing a tax return that you had trouble doing.
good,Overall a valued experience but not something I would stick with in the long run when it came to tax preparation. Management and overall team wasn't the easiest to work with but managed through it even though I had a second job.
good,Loved thos job but the pay could've been better and its a seasonal job.
good,"Part-time seasonal. Management may get frustrated and criticize tax pro. in the presence of clients, a no no! Salary is very basic."
good,"Worked with many different clients, getting them checked into have their taxes done, booked appointments for people who came into the office or who phoned. Dealt with angry impatient people."
good,"During the intense season the days go by very quickly. I learned so much every day about taxes, people, how lives are effected by money."
good,Arrive at work at 8:30 AM and work through the day until 9:00 PM or some days later during tax season. After 11 years I was pretty familiar with IRS tax codes.
good,The job was always different due to personal income tax differences. Always learning new things and requires a significant amount of thinking outside the box to ensure the clients are getting the maximum return possible.
good,"Overall I have learned a lot from this company overtime. The experience was a great one,including the pros and cons. I have learned a lot of virtues as well."
good,"Really enjoyed working here. Easy, fun to do, you get to learn new people, encounter all types of people, etc."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to have strong views. it was very boring, however."
good,"I am too new to give a substantial review.  I'm just starting the job as a Tax Professional.  The Income Tax Course has been great.  The continued training is always available and useful.  So far, the culture has been positive and everyone is professional."
good,Good helpful co workers variety of personality of clients 1st Year Tax pro was able to do easy clients taxes couple times I had more challenging ones and the office manager sat with me and walked me thru it with me
good,It was a customer facing position with  tax preparation for individuals and companies. It requires training and continuing education. It was very service oriented.
good,"I was  asked to come back the following year but I took another job and wasn't able to continue working there. The pay wasn't great but the people I worked with were awesome and made me feeling included,"
good,"It was a great opportunity to improve my customer service skills, I loved it because it was a part time seasonal job. This job allowed me to learn a lot.  Every year I looked forward to returning.  Here I learned the importance of customer service and how it impacts a company."
good,Generally a good company. Some offices are obviously better than others. Mine was great. Seasonal but really busy during peak times. You're given the opportunity to grow within the company as a tax preparer (level-up and do more complex returns that pay more) and all classes are provided. Always a lot of support from more senior associates.
good,"For the most part employees work well with each other."
good,"A typical day at work would be to set up the office, unlock doors, pull files and look over the schedule for the day. I learned about some tax filing paperwork. Management was friendly, easy to talk to and understanding. Workplace culture was relaxed. The hardest part of the job was not having enough to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was pulling files and scheduling."
good,"H&R Block has very decent culture overall, but cultural experience is highly dependent on the team you work on.  I had many great opportunities to learn at H&R Block.  However, the company suffers from an overdose of meetings.  Very hard to make progress when random meetings constantly occurring."
good,"You meet people everyday, I enjoy helping people with their taxes, if you are a people person and if you enjoy numbers you will enjoy the job. A great part time job."
good,"My experience at this company has been great.  I noticed room for growth for those who are interested.  Only downfall is that it’s a seasonal position.  My manager as a tax pro was great.  "
good,"Great learning environment, very good quality training, helpful and supportive co-workers to help with new questions and situations. A steady and clear path to advancement. A positive and friendly office. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the software- it takes some practice. The most enjoyable part of the job is problem-solving with your client and saving them money."
good,This job helps improves your knowledge of basic federal laws and your state laws as of other states too. It also builds your communication skills with costumers and improves your computer skills.
good,"seasonal work.. Opportunity to work with the general public and help people with a stressful situation. company has good educational program"
good,I love working with my clients.  I love the challenge of finding the biggest refund to which my clients are entitled.  I love to learn.  Every year I take tax classes to increase my knowledge.  I just wish we were paid more for what we have to learn.
good,I worked as a first-year employee who didn't have a sales goal and didn't work on commission. My particular office had long-time employees with established clients so I didn't have much to do but study. You have to bring in your own clients. It's not like the old days where people are just waiting for the next preparer.
good,"The organization allows work-life balance and seeing that the position is seasonal, it gives you the chance to seek out other jobs.  It also gives training that allows for growth.  However, the internal management of employee schedules and other administrative details need improvement.  Confusion arise in regards to schedule.  Some employees quit mid-tax season."
good,"I studied for and took the initial tax course with H&R Block in the fall of 2018, doing taxes for customers in the spring months of 2019.  It was a good experience, but my growth for the season was definitely hampered by having an inexperienced manager.  He was incredibly kind and aware of his knowledge gap (I enjoyed him as a person) but that fact put all new tax professionals in our office behind on the learning timeline."
good,The H & R Block crew in green river are amazing! The management is great she works hard for her education and staff! The job ends after tax season but you are always asked if you would like to come back next year! Always nice to have that little bit of extra income.
good,This is a job for a person who has some knowledge of taxes or is willing to learn. It provides a good atmosphere to learn taxes. I learned more about taxes than I did at school.
good,Great Team Support. Our office works together well. Always hlep eachother and tap into eachothers tax knowlege and cutomer service expericence to benefit the client.
good,"Provides lots of opportunity to learn. Earning power increases with testing level in the pre-season. The only downside is that it's only a full-time job for the first quarter of the year, even for managers."
good,"The working day is is productive, extremely busy at times. I enjoyed my Customer Service role over my tax preparation position. I just would rather organize and be aware of the whole office, problems and calls to be returned."
good,"H&R Block provides lessons, training, hands-on experience, mentors and a collegial environment to learn the tax business."
good,They are horrible. They make you wish you flunked the first training test before you get on the floor. Very unprofessional and for the time I was there it was in between the government shutdowns with Trump and all the changes in IRS forms made it very difficult to keep up with company standard's when the customer's were beyond unprepared for the constant changes in that tac season.
good,hard to get a long with every customer but the perks of having a supportive group of colleagues made life much easier and also taught me a lot of people skills as well
good,I really love my staff and clients.  They change DGM's often.  Need a better training program for the accountability issues.  Managers should constantly be in training prior to season.
good,"I hated the job, and I don’t want to be a receptionist ever again. But the tax pros were very nice and so was the manager. They wanted to hire me back, and I know I’d be able to work for any of them again."
good,"H&R is great place to work at with a team of wonderful coworkers and managers, having the opportunity to meet new clients, and learning and improving your knowledge of tax preparation. The support of senior tax preparers makes it possible to get the job done in a fast, accurate, and professional manner. The offices that I had worked in and all others that I had visited during the tax seasons while working there were pretty clean and organized. The hardest part of the job was when during an appointment while preparing a client's tax return revealing some unexpected information by the client that was requiring additional time was causing the next scheduled client to wait for their appointment too long and of course becoming unhappy."
good,Nice office work environment in a clean facility with air conditioner and heat. Great coworkers and management. It's a seasonal job for that reason had no benefits.
good,"H and R Block is a seasonal company so a lot of the things mentioned like benefits do not apply to regular employee's, I can not speak to the benefits given to management."
good,"Good people and not difficult work load. Must be friendly and have good customer skills. Temporary, short season. Doesn't pay well though. Didn't get bonus promised."
good,Lots of team work when something was not clear. Learned how to assist with scheduling clients. Helped clients to feel welcomed as they waited to be seen.
good,"I handled credit debit and cash transitions,  in and out bound calls, schedule appointments.  Make coffee kept the tidy appearance of the front office. File type and handle sensitive documents."
good,"It was great for me i worked there for 3 seasons while working my other job full time. Flexible work hours fast paced so time always went by fast."
good,"great seasonal work. great boss to work for. If you like meeting new people, this is the job for you. pine city H and R Block is like working with family. Everyone helps out each other ."
good,"Is a good seasonal work, people are friendly and hard workers, professionals and truly honest in their performance. I found it very interesting and helpful for my personal and professional life."
good,I enjoy working with all my fellow co-workers and dealt with a high volume  of customers.  I enjoy working in the office enviroment and look forward to working with H&R Block every season.
good,They provide good pay and benefits and provided a team based environment. Their training program was great and I learned a lot from being able to cross train myself.
good,Software application made tax preparation easy for customers to understand.  Online training classes offered in office and via internet.  Easy access to IRS documentation via internet.  Well structured and rewarding place to work.
good,"Scheduling is very flexible but hours for most associates are not full time. "
good,"I greeted clients, prepared tax documentation, set appointments, and assisted various clients with tax documents and tax related inquires."
good,Enjoyed working for this company very forward in learning to apply that knowledge with hands on experience that was a necessary component in performing the job.  Interacting with the public and learning how to navigate different tax situations with various clients proved to be challenging but an enlightening job experience.
good,"I know it is dependent on the specific location that you work at, but my experience was very positive. Had a great team to work with and never felt stressed or overwhelmed. Pretty relaxed environment. Would do the job again!"
good,"Working in an H&R Block office will not make you rich but it gives you something to do during tax season.  Lots of good training is available each year and employees are encouraged to take classes and move up levels to prepare more complicated tax returns and make more money.  "
good,"I would make calls for management to get people to come in from last year to come back to get taxes done.  I would come in early to make coffee, unlock cashier drawer and count the money in the drawer, check the appointments of clients to see what the work day starts."
good,"This was a part-time temporary posittion with employment ending abruptly on April 15, the end of tax season. It was fun. You took a class and learned all about income taxes, then sat back, did some data entry, and let the computer do all the work. The hard part was organizing all the customer paperwork.  I earned well over minimum wage.  Some customers did not like me because I would ocasionally say ""oops."""
good,"Greeted customers, scheduled appointment, coordinated incoming phone calls.  Processed mail, organized correspondence and collected tax payment from customers.  Followed all company policies and procedures while maintaining a positive and professional image."
good,"During tax season especial during peak time there is no time to even breath, but it is so rewarding to process taxes and educated our clients on their return and future planning.  It is a family at the office with the staff and clients."
good,"As a seasonal worker, the hours were long and many during the tax season.  Preseason work was fewer hours and was a great learning experience.  State and Federal training requirements are such that you are always learning of the tax changes and how they effect H&R Block"
good,"H&R Block and in the office where I mostly stayed, I can genuinely say it was great in working with my colleagues. It was like a happy family, each day you learned something new from each other ref. computer software,  tax laws, etc. and the environment was quite positive."
good,A great experience for a short term job during the tax season.  Staff were supportive and friendly and interacting with clients was very enjoyable.  Great place to work.
good,"This was an interesting place to work and a way to meet a lot of different people. Employees as well as clients for the company."
good,I was an experienced manager and to prepare  taxes to be paid because I only had one office. I was led to believe the bonus in the end would compensate me up to a decent dollar amount. It did not.
good,H&R Blocks a great place to work.  Schedules are flexible and the employees work great as a team.  It is a seasonal position that can be very profitable if you are willing to work hard.
good,"My day has a variety of jobs. Tax preparation, e-filing, faxing and scanning. In this type of job patience is the key. I enjoy interacting with different clients"
good,"A typical day of work is filing different kind of tax returns,meet and greet clients. I learned about tax rules and regulations/procedures. The environment is okay.The hardest part of the job is make your   client to pay back your tax owing amount to the government of canada asap. The most enjoyable part is when you make your client happy and satisfied."
good,"its ok you just need more money and more hours it ok job to work for when their not change your schedule when they want to."
good,"Every employee is encouraged to learn and grow in order to better the client experience. Client retention and growth are the number one priority of the company. They value the advice of the tax professionals and encourage their opinions to be heard, so long as it is done in a professional manner. "
good,Loved working at H&R Block. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with some of the nicest people that I have ever met. Also enjoyed meeting an assortment of new people.
good,Employees in H&R Block are nice. Good customer service. We helped each other. Managers are supportive. Learn a lot about tax and legislation. Pay is less.
good,"You learn a lot from working at H&R Block."
good,"This is a seasonal job from January to March or April basically. Much of my workload were people who walked in rather than making an appointment. Some days were very busy and others were quiet.  After the end of March, the taxes become more difficult and workable hours  for newer employees goes way down."
good,It was a great experience working as Tax Associate. Interviewing clients and preparing their income tax returns professionally and confidentially was very worthy.
good,"Being a CSP at Block taught me so much! The managers are always understanding of life situations, and are flexible. The only negative thing I would say about it is that it can be quite slow some days. Like, stare-at-your-own-hands-for-hours type of slow. Though other days are so busy you can barely breathe! Just be prepared for the contrast."
good,"Just working seasonal part time and so far I like it. Answering phones, making phone calls, greeting clients, making sure my work space is clean. File away charts etc"
good,Some employees are hard to work with and some are very helpful the owner of franchise is very good to her employees and helps where she can they try to help you advance in your knowledge of the tax law
good,"Was not employed long enough in 2012, to be familiar with their fun events. However, I did reapply for the same position in 2017, I learned the duties had tripled involving my previous position in 2012, but at the same (2012) hourly wage. H&R Block in the last five of the seven years; the work load was tripled and the hourly wages were still the same."
good,"H&R Block is a good option for a part time, second job, or supplementary income for a retiree.  Being in my prime working years at this time it unfortunately does not have competitive full time wages for this region, this is not unique to HR block but reflective of the tax preparation industry's seasonal nature."
good,"Casual place to work. Fun, good spirited people to work with. customers were always nice and appreciative. I would recommend this job to people I know."
good,"Doing taxes for H&R Block has similarities to being self-employed. You still have to follow the schedule and show up on time, but training, research, and helping your clients is up to you. You are responsible to the federal government for the tax returns that you prepare, and H&R Block is more than happy to let you be the one to worry about the requirements. H&R Block does provide tax classes, but they're mostly online and you end up teaching yourself.  The work is seasonal and you get rehired every year, which means you go through the entire hiring process every time. You are required to get 18 continuing education credits every year in order to be rehired, and you are not paid for those hours. Those of us who stay do it because were huge tax nerds, and we like to be able to sit down with people and help them with their unique situations."
good,Good training. The best part of the job is the customers. The company is dedicated to providing a great experience for every customer. Company is great to reimburse for certifications.
good,Great place to work and gain experience in a short period of time.  Learned how to file my own taxes and work in a fast paced environment.  Met some great and important people along the way.
good,I liked working her there it is a very Layed back place I was able to study and I even watched tv while doing it. I got to help the tax preps and never was rushed to do anything.
good,I like the fact that they pay me unemployment benefits.  I make a lot of calls and receive a lot of calls but it’s OK. Not a lot of hours to work but I like the job
good,"This too was a challenging job, there are so many different aspects to know and cover in such a short season. A typical  day was never as planned, everyday was a learning process, the management was very minimal, there was a vast workplace culture,  The hardest part was dealing with upset clients. Getting the job done at the end of the week and making quota."
good,i was a temporary employee from what i experienced was a friendly environment sometimes stressful during tax season. i enjoyed coming to work it was pleasant
good,As and employee of H & R Block you are constantly learning as the state laws are continually changing.  The hardest part of the job is working with the public who have unrealistic expectations on what is lawful because their friend said it can be done. The most enjoyable pat of the job is watching someone's face when they get a large refund and they were expecting to owe the IRS money.
good,H&R Block had a management team that stood behind its workers and would make sure they were taken care of.  I was treated well and was always respected.
good,"The hardest part of the job is to make the clients knowledgeable of their part in getting their tax returns processed truthfully.  I admire the individuals who depend on us as preparers, because we want to do the best to make their tax life easier."
good,"This is a good part-time job, but if you are looking for a career, this isn't the place for you. Good position for someone who is retired and likes helping people."
good,Learned a lot while I worked at H&R Block. would keep working there but it was a seasonal Position. I would have liked to have worked more hours a week than what I was given.
good,H&R Block was a great place to work in my particular area of the business.  Compensation was fair and most of the people I worked with were terrific.  The only thing people need to understand before hand is that this is not a 40 hour week job.  The demand on time is far more than that and requires a great deal of time away from home.  For those reasons it might night be a good life work balance for many.  The job did allow for some flexibility in work days part of the year but you must be a self starter and be able to work independently to get the job done.
good,"Great working environment with friendly and helpful management!  You can personally create your work schedule so it a very flexible position, and can be balanced well with personal schedule."
good,"I managed an office for 2 years. The company has pre-set standard and goals that need to be met each Tax Season, which lasts 16 weeks per year. Its a very intense 16 weeks"
good,working at h & r is fun and enjoyably. the environment is very friendly which lead to high productivity. The people are very and very interactive . The best place to be
good,"It was great opportunity for my start in my career. I have gotten excellent tax preparation skills and knowledge in tax law, but my compensation was very small."
good,"Enjoy your time working here"
good,Great opportunities for education and advancement.  I only wish there were more full-time permanent positions available.  I really enjoy working with the public!
good,"Every day I am in the office working with a client on thier tax return,  I enjoy being able to say the out come of your tax return is better than you thought it would be."
good,"If you are looking for seasonal job with flexible schedule definitely, H&R Block is a goof choice. You could get lots of material to study at their website with a low cost, $20."
good,Its a fun rewarding opportunity. You get to work with all kinds of people and help them make decisions that will help them and if I couldnt i could tell them where to look or go for the information required. The managers that I had while working there were the best ever. They were understanding willing to listen with any concerns/ questions that I had. Hardest part of my job would be not being able to file taxes for someone as I know it would be fraud and having to let them know I couldnt file taxes then having to alert the other offices with clients name and let them know they are trying to file a fraudulent return.
good,"Meet and greet clients daily,  answer clients questions, schedule appts, Work  for a respectable manager, pleasant co workers, at times stressful during peak season."
good,H&R Block is a flexible part time job.  I love working with my clients.  HRB gave me the opportunity to obtain my Enrolled Agent status which increased opportunity to make more money.
good,"I enjoy being the first point of contact for clients. In my role, I was responsible for placing clients with the tax pro that best suited the individual client needs. I learned various tax laws as well as how to itemize deductions in order to receive the maximum refund. The most difficult part of the job is keeping updated with the ever changing tax laws. The most enjoyable part was the location, I was close to home and management made it easy to pick up and drop off my children for school even if I'm scheduled to be at work."
good,being a tax preparer consist of a lot of patience and time to help people get he most out of failing there taxes with any mistakes it also gives the  feeling of being appreciated and trusted by your clients
good,"A typical day at work keeps one involved with clients and tax preparation with little time to spare. Professionals are very knowledgeable and helpful. "
good,"Everyone was friendly and I was actually given a small bonus, but a year later because I forgot to update my new address with them. Since business was slowing down for the season and it was my first year, the rest of the tax season being business taxes which I was not certified for yet I had to stop and go back to my regular hours with my second Job. So did not work the last month of the tax season."
good,"The position as CSP (Customer Service Professional) was perfect for my needs.I enjoyed the structure to my day, and meeting and assisting new clients."
good,I enjoyed working at H&R Block.  The hours are flexible but you can work a lot of hours around the peak times.  I would recommend this job other than just tax season if it were available.
good,Work all days everyday.  Good place for learning and networking .  Visit a lot a places and get to know their clients and their business operations.  Big opportunities.
good,I liked working at H and R Block.  The biggest issue that I have is that  preparers are not allowed to work for the full year.  I enjoy tax and will look for a more consistent way to work with it.
good,"It was a very good learning experience. The staff took the time to train me well, so that when I started I knew most of what I would be doing. If not, I knew where to research it."
good,"Responsible for conducting tax interviews and for preparing tax returns for various clients."
good,I loved my repeat clients you form relationships watch children grow. It makes you feel like your part of they're family because you help them get there tax breaks.
good,"Having a degree in accounting, the training for becoming a tax preparer was somewhat second nature.  I enjoyed the hours spent helping clients with their tax prep, but my working schedule was often at night, which was not always enjoyed, as a parent."
good,"This was a seasonal part-time job, where I was able to apply the material I learned from HR Block Tax class."
good,"This company offers a great deal of unpaid training with possibilities of increased compensation. The tax season itself is very diverse, never boring. Opening the office, busy season and closing of office. Hours and duties can be very flexible according to needs of the employee and the office."
good,"If you are looking for something to make the winter go by faster, this is a good place to work. The money is not great, and it takes a few years o build your client base up,but the work isenoyable and satisfying."
good,When I applied for the position I had no idea how taxes worked. I have a better understanding of tax law and how it is applied. There are some really good people that work with H&R Block and they are willing to teach you as much as you want to learn. I can proudly say that I can fill out a 1040 ez form by hand and understand what I am doing. I love learning from my co-workers. Knowing the difference between 1099 A and 1099 C is really exciting.
good,"Would open up register at beginning of day, check messages, check in customers for appointments, schedule appointments for customers, answer phones, assist Tax Preparers when needed, close register at end of day"
good,"I knew a Tax Consultant at H & R Block.  I liked working at H & R Block.  I would work at this company again, if I have the opportunity to do so.  I enjoyed helping the clients that came in to the store, to get their taxes done."
good,The people in the expat division were great. They are very helpful to new people and very friendly. Management could be curt but overall they helped when it was needed.
good,"You provide high-quality tax preparation service and hopefully your clients would come back to you next year. You can build your own book of business, but it is not as easy as you thought.  However, it is always fun to learn tax laws and mingle with tax professionals during tax season."
good,Very impressed with the dedication and patience tax advisor's had with their clients.  I also enjoyed the comradeship amongst employees and clients and the fact that you could get a discount to attend classes to become a Certified Tax Advisor.
good,Opportunities for rapid promotion are limited.  The company has a lot of seasonal workers working for up to 10 months.  It's difficult to progress from seasonal to full time.
good,"fast paste, working with costumers both upset and happy. Learned great problem solving skills while being here and helped improve my costumer service."
good,My experience was really great because of the office I was placed in. All of the older tax pros were always very willing to help me learn something new and were more than happy to share their wealth of knowledge. It was a very collaborative environment.
good,"The employees at H&R Block were very hardworking, helpful people who took time to assist the customers and aid fellow coworkers. A community oriented working environment."
good,As a part time job it was great meeting different people in a quick paced environment.  Any one wanting to work part of the year and make additional income this is the job for you.
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with people and managing their expectations.  The most enjoyable part is when you discover someone has a refund from taxes.
good,"A typical day at the office was outgoing with tax professionals, clients, scheduling, and managing the tax professionals."
good,The office leaders I worked with in MN wear very helpful in advancing my knowledge to prepare the best possible tax returns. The owner was great to work with. One WI office leader has been hard to work with so I stopped working in that office to work without stress.Overall a great working environment.
good,H & R Block trains you to be a tax Associate. The pay for the 1st year is not great considering you have to learn and remember syllabus to prepare tax returns accurately.
good,Very professional and friendly workplace. Provided good services. Staff are nice. Efficient in providing services and good management. I learn how to do individual tax return
good,good place  for  seasonal employees to work   for  taxes every year  they  give overtime  good training. nice  pay   for  work  done. its  only bad part is you have to apply every year
good,"A typical is coming into the office, making coffee, checking any voice messages, looking at appointments for the day, checking with the tax preparers to notify of new clients."
good,But the corporation doesn't pay attention to what clients really need and want in order to compete with other in todays market. They can do better to listen to clients and other companies competing with office site.  They have online service for free and it seems they are competing with the site office locations.
good,"prepare taxes and many stuff in the office. I had to call customers , clean the office and the bathroom . giving up flyers. we also had to go to different business places to talk about H&R blocks products and services"
good,Good place to work for a seasonal position. Hardest part is the fluid work schedules. Most enjoyable part is the people who you work with and a lot of the clients.
good,Great company to work for! if you take their tax preparation classes and do well they will offer you a job! I loved it! however there were some discrepancies in scheduling and class times
good,Worked with customers providing information about their tax situation. the company provided trainings in the summer and last quarter of the year. Worked through tax season.
good,"The branch I work at is kind of laid back, but the employees are more like family, they never hesitate to answer your questions, teaches you new things, helps each other out, is each other's positivity and support. I love the branch and people I work with."
good,Very productive and great environment to work. very satisfying. Lot of encouragement to work better. Loved my coworkers. Job satisfaction is great and rewarding. I worked seasonal.
good,"Enjoyed working at H&R Block.  Very relaxed atmosphere except tax time (January thru April 15th).  Great people to work with, the hours were awesome, met a lot of people."
good,"The individuals who taught us about taxes were really friendly and provided an environment that was welcoming for everyone. Due to some tax filing issues from the previous year, I wasn't able to go full-time."
good,"I enjoyed the work I was presented with while at H&R Block. The reason I left was the unpredictable hours, ranging from 40 hours one week to 12 hours the next week, and the inability to stay on as an off-season employee during my first year. I intended on making a career with this company, but they made it into a side gig for me."
good,"This is a great seasonal/part time job to have, you can come back every season or even take a season off if you would like. I have been working here for 10 years and only took 2 seasons off. I enjoy coming back to see all my great tax pros who I have built relationships with."
good,The class overall was very comprehensive however the last couple of weeks were jammed together making it difficult to assimilate.  I was impressed by the content of the text books.
good,"starting at H&R Block was kind of interesting the first year is incredibly slow, but picks up if you're there for over a year. The second year is when you start to work."
good,"I was just a temporary customer service gal. While I enjoyed the new experience, it was very stressful and busy at times. I felt I couldn’t quite keep up with learning material and filing. Tax season can be crazy."
good,"There is nothing great about working there, there is nothing terrible.  H&R Block is a solid middle of the road, temporary seasonal job that is good for making a little extra money and padding out your resume. "
good,Great temp work as you get to meet many new people. pleasant atmosphere. Fun place to work and learn new tasks. Easy computer system and pleasant atmosphere.
good,"This was a fast paced, fun environment to work in. Annual raise was not much. Management for my specific office was very awesome. The only problem I had with working here were some of the stronger personalities that were vindictive."
good,This is a good place to work. I am only part-time seasonal but I'm impressed so far. The other employees are nice and helpful. The work is fast-paced; the days go by quick.
good,"Great company to work For with flexible hours. Working for Hrb is a wonderful experience, especially with clients different people different scenarios."
good,"I absolutely love my job with HR Block, I think it is a great way to earn extra money and stay on top of your taxes. You will always be learning new laws every year"
good,"Tax season was a very busy time, but everyone worked together to make sure things went smoothly.  There was always a lot going on and different customers to see every day."
good,"Some days can be slow, but overall the best place to work for a student (gives you a chance to study/do homework). The hardest part of the job was near the end of tax season when a lot of people want to do their taxes last second. Most enjoyable is that the manager lets you study during times when it wasn't busy. I learned that no matter what you do, you can't please everyone."

good,"This place was a gossipy and judgemental place to work. Never have I seen grown educated people act so childish. And clients are expected to trust these ""professionals"" with their tax preparation!"
good,It is a good place to work but in The first year there is super low pay. Very good second job and extra money type of job. Unless you have been there for years it is hard to get proper work and compensation.
good,The job was fun and provided new job duties to employees. I was able to utilize my vast office techniques and customer service skills to provide quick and friendly front office reception area.
good,"High paced and always different, a wonderful environment to work with these particular coworkers.  High management stays away."

good,H&R block will give you all of the necessary training to be a competent tax professional.  It is very meticulous work and you have to place close attention to details

good,"Our customer service people up front  have better wages then the tax professionals that do the work for our clients. No benefits,  no pay time off,  only seasonal, and not well pay.  I think most stay around because we enjoy working with each other and 85% of the stores do help each other when in need.  In my area my manager was awesome."

I first started out working for the Tax Identity Shield department. I loved what I did, it as easy work and the hours worked out great. I then moved to the Social Media department, and i think that was my favorite department. It was very relaxed and and the work was very exciting, seeing how I was interacting with the clients via Facebook and Twitter. I now work in Client Services Escalations. It's a bit more stressful seeing how the cases deal with client who are frustrated and have problems and sometimes don't agree with the solution we provide."
good,Need to offer fulltime position instead of seasonal position. I really do not have anything extra left to say about this company. It was a great company to work for.

I prepared several tax returns, sometimes working was easy and sometimes Management made it very hard, with all the paperwork we had to keep up with, when and when not we could work.  For the most part, I keep going back to work for H&R Block because of the clients that I meet/met that keep coming back for my service."

good,Good company to work for.  Top notch training programs.  Great working environment.  Pay is not bad for work load.  Learn valuable knowledge to keep for years to come.  Hours are good.
good,Answering phones and scheduling are easy enough. Its juggling tax pros because they are understaffed that gets to me. The tax pros we have are great and very helpful. The store leader could be better.
good,"Working as a Client Service Professional (CSP) allows me to practice interpersonal skills. I have to greet clients with a friendly welcome and help them arrange an appointment with the tax professional best suited for their needs. Daily tasks include things like ensuring the waiting room is orderly and comfortable, printing and posting daily office reports, organizing office supplies, filing and mailing tax returns, and contacting clients to manage the daily schedule. One of the most important aspects to this role is communication. It is important to communicate clearly and efficiently not only with calling clients or walk-ins but with the tax professionals in the office. I have been fortunate enough to work with tax pros who are eager to help guests and each other, so the office typically runs smoothly. Our office also has an approachable manager who does a great job of listening to his staff and his clients--even when the clients may be upset. Having someone kind and level-headed running the office really sets a productive and welcoming atmosphere."
good,"I loved this business.  H&R Block mortgage was great for me because i got to know the in's and out's of the mortgage world.  I got to learn all the loans, and guidelines..."
good,I worked two different offices.  The pay could of been a lot better.  Making less than people do at burger king and having more knowledge is not really fair.

good,"Upon entering office you read your emails and clocked in. Call your client from the waiting room, sit down and talk with client to understand their needs and then do their tax return.  I learned tax law during the summer months.  Office managers were very supportive and helpful. Co-workers were overwhelmed at times.  Hardest part was letting the information go when you left for the evening.  There was never enough time to clear your hear for 4 months straight.  Enjoyable part was meeting new clients and getting to know them from year to year along with their children."

good,"A typical day at work, I spend imputing patients tax information into the DNA software, calculating numbers, and filing papers. I learned that hard work really pays off. The management is wonderful, and the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on the customers faces. This job is not hard at all."
good,"Can be very intense during peak season but that's the way I like it. I do not very much care for all the non-tax exploits that they constantly attempt. Customers come to have their taxes done, period."
good,very interesting and fun place to work.  I learned a lot.  It was a long time ago but would consider doing it again.  It is only a seasonal job but gives you some experience preparing taxes professionally.

good,"Had many good years there but as its a seasonal position it falls short on my current needs. Very few full time opportunities and all benefits were eliminated due to budget cuts, so no paid time off, very expensive but basic health insurance offered and only because they have to by law...it used to be offered but was cancelled prior to the employer mandate going into effect."
good,"In 17 years of preparing income taxes there is no ""typical"" day at work.  Each day can present a whole new set of challenges - be it a unusual tax situation that must be researched or a taxpayer that has disorganized paperwork.  Each client is kind-of a puzzle and it is my job to prepare for them an accurate return and get them the best refund or lowest tax bill possible."
good,People take their money seriously. It's an awarding feeling knowing that I could help get them every penny that's theirs. I enjoy the professionalism displayed by fellow Tax Professionals and Managers.

good,"Fast-paced workplace with helpful and encouraging coworkers and boss. Through my position I was able to further improve my communication skills as well as help customers feel at ease regardless of his/her predicament, however; not all customers are easy to handle, managing the moods of customers sometimes was beyond my anyone's abilities but the customer's own. I maintained a tidy and clean atmosphere in all areas of the building, made certain all office supplies were stocked and in their proper place. What I enjoyed most about the job, as I do in all my jobs, is simply helping others. I feel extremely rewarded when I am able to meet a coworker, boss, or client's needs."
good,"Greet customer, escort them into the office. Get some information from the customer.  Proceed to do their taxes.  I have learned different areas of taxes.  I have advanced every year with their schooling. My co-workers are a great bunch of people.  The hardest part of my  job was to tell a client that they had to pay taxes at the end of the year.  The greatest part of my job was that I got to meet and work with lot of interesting people through the years."
good,"It is a consistent moderately fast pace workplace.We work as a team, due to sometimes there can be a client which need more than one associate's attention.H&R Block ensures our knowledge on tax laws,rules and regulations by providing self-study learning tools which are always exciting.The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the needs of each client. The hardest part was waiting to get an IRS representative on the phone."

good,"On a typical day at work I answer phones, take appointments or walk ins, I clean, follow procedures for opening or closing whichever is necessary, balance the cash register, file, copy or fax forms or letters, and greet every client who comes in the door. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that if a client needs something I can solve whatever problem or need they may have.

good,"Generally I come into work at 7:40 and start mopping, sweeping, making coffee, and once that is done its time for costumers to come in. I usually start by filling files away, checking clients in and taking them back."
good,This job has helped me get back into the work field since I have not had to look for a job in 22 years. It gave me experience in doing interviews; working with customers face to face because my last job was with customer on the telephone. Also gave me experience with taking payments in person with cash and credit cards. I worked with a great group of people who were willing to help me learn more about tax questions.
good,Fast and Friendly Service. The Tax Associates are very helpful. We do our best to find clients money that they did not expect to receive.
good,"The receptionist job in itself is pretty fast-paced but it is very easy to catch on. I learned basic clerical skills- answering phones, setting appointments, faxing, scanning, and filing."
good,Managers also treat their workers well. Everyday I am able to learn something new plus there are tools I can access to gain knowledge of new tax regulations and company products. The hardest part about my job is remember all the tax laws and regulations. The most enjoyable part about my job is that each and every day I get to meet and talk to new people.

good,"During my time a Block, I felt like they were more focused on recruiting new clients only rather than working on maintaining their existing clients. They harass previous clients so often, it felt like working as a telemarketer at times. I enjoyed the company of my fellow coworkers; they were very sweet and supportive, but they were also held back by the ""red tape"" on what they could and could not do."
good,"Typical office day is busy and exciting in the sense that every taxpayer has his own tax circumstances. In order to address those needs, I learned how to cater to their specific needs using the information obtained from each client and my tax knowledge and skills. My co-workers have also helped me through and the manager provided us with the resources that we need to deliver  quality service. Although I work on my own cubicle, it was also a collaborative effort to satisfy H&R clientele and that's what makes it enjoyable!"
good,Good company to work for they train you and make sure you gain the knowledge needed to properly prepare returns. This is unfortunately not a career company to work unless  your in management. There are no benefits offered and only seasonal work.
good,I have learned that H&R Block is the #1 source for tax information and training. They are the right hand of the IRS. I found out some great information and met some cool people.
good,"This position was Customer Service, appointment setting."
good,"The day was never dull while working for H&R Block. My day would consist of managing appointments and schedules of the tax professionals in the office. Making sure that all clients were greeted with a smile and all the information they would need regarding the appointments with their tax professionals. Informing clients on the different products that H&R Block offered on top of its usual tax preperations such as different ways they could get their refunds, security features etc. I also would spend a good time of my day making calls to past clients to invite them to come back and have their services completed with us again while informing them of promotional items they qualified for. I also would make calls to clients that had been serviced by our location to find out if they were satisfied with their experience in our office and to find out what we could do to improve their experience for the next time. I was also in charge of keeping the office orderly and straightened as well as keeping the clients happy and content while waiting for their appointments to begin. My co-workers were wonderful in assisting me in learning things that I did not know and were incredibly encouraging in my helpfulness around the office. The hardest part of the job was the fact that the appointment times set for clients was an approximate time to begin. As goes with most appointment based business, sometimes things come up and appointments run over a little longer than planned. Often the clients would become aggitated in their wait for their own appointment times when this would occur. But it would"

good,Work with clients on their taxes. Showing the client discounts. Establishing their refunds and service charges. Quit environment and helpful to taxes information.
good,"Did Federal, State and local tax returns. Hardest part is having someone owe the IRS and having to tell them they may owe money.  People try to have kids on their return that may not be their own child"
good,"I enjoy the clients who come to my desk. I learn their needs and wants and help them to reach them. I teach them about saving for the future and let them decide. I inform them of tax law changes and how it will effect them for the upcoming year. I have learned over the years the company sometimes does not realize the client is the back bone of the company or maybe they just do not know how to show it. My co-workers are sometimes interesting, as one likes to come and go as they please. They say I am only 2 minutes away if you need me. I think this is a place to grow and learn. The tax code is so complex and the key is to learn the client and apply the code."
good,Prepare individual tax returns for clients. Not everyone can be pleased with the work that you do. The office leader does support the employees in the office. The hardest part of the job is when a tax return is rejected and the client feels that it is the fault of the company. The most enjoyable part is when the client gets a larger refund than expected or that the balance due is is smaller than the client expected.

good,"It can get hectic at H&R Block especially during peak periods.  I am very good at Multi-tasking, so answering phone calls on multi line phones, scheduling an appointment, receiving a payment, checking in a new client and assisting a Tax Preparer with their next client all at one time can be a typical day. My Manager was amazing, so knowledgeable and helpful, supportive and encouraging to all of her staff. Most all of our co-works would return each season so we all learned how to work well with each other so things always ran pretty smooth around there. The hardest part of my job really was that it was only seasonal. I returned each year because of the people I worked with and our clients. I would have definitely stayed and made it my career if it was year round and well honestly paid better."

good,"I have several years of server experience, I worked at Opry Mills Mall for over 5 yrs and I can handle a high volume and like to keep my tables prebused so that when the clients leave I hand full of glasses and a wipped down and your ready to be sat again. I am a very hard worker that doesn't mind helping fellow servers if it will help them out and it hopefully you get someone who looks out and assist you as well and it makes the restaurant run smother and keeps it running efficiently ,and  makes for a better work environment. I worked for H&R Block and was a Customer Service Representative and I know have office and Computer Experience and making sure the office was running smoothly . It was only during temporary work, for the tax season which runs from the 1st of the year until around March. So I have a great personality , work ethic and a hard kind trustworthy employee."

good,"Love working with taxes and consumers, but dislike the lack of benefits, seasonal hours, and long work days with no overtime wages only commission."

Check the Schedule, call and remind clients of their appointments., Make sure all returns went through from the day before, run report for errors. Get them fixed and resend the return. File away the completed ones. By now, it is time to open. Answer the phones, schedule appointments, answer questions, assure the wait time is not too long. Handle any issues that may come up. Corporate and District can sometimes hand down duties that can overwhelm you. The Tax-Preparers are awesome people to work with. They are genuinely caring people. Our Office Manger was one of the best. Never a harsh word. The roughest part of this comes in waves. The influx  of people on and around certain dates can be a bit much. However, watching them leave with a peace of mind and knowing how much their refund will be is so rewarding."

good,I worked in the call center.  Part of my job was calling past customers and letting them know about the new services.  After that I set appointments and made reminder calls.  The people that I worked with were nice.  This was a temporary seasonal job.
good,Best call center ever work with since I started my information technology career. Shuttling between offices in designated area kept us busy. Never had to watch the clock.
good,"Tax law is fascinatingly difficult and constantly changing, so the job is never boring. My office is a great place to work because the staff and the clientele are (almost) all good people. The company offers training at times that fix into your schedule. The supervisors are very professional and work with you to solve any problem that may arise.The atmosphere is very funny and professional."
good,"My work week is categorically divided into personal deliverables and team deliverables. The week concludes on a team review wherein I ascertain the effectiveness and efficiency of each team member deliverables. For instance, on Mondays and Tuesday, I would chalk out team deliverables and brief them about priorities and the methods by which the targets could be achieved.

good,"This was a very simple job. I answered phones, scheduled appointments, made connect calls, greeted/checked in clients, and helped keep the office tidy. The people I worked with were nice, always willing to help or answer questions. The hardest part was resolving clients' issues, as people tend to think tax preparers have the same authority and access as the IRS. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting so many new people. I loved watching people come in, afraid of what they may owe, and then walk out surprised and smiling because they got way more than expected returned.

Thanks to the great set of co-workers who made it seem all so simple for me and having shown confidence in me. Their support allowed me to learn efficiently and become the leader in the whole Niagara region for the highest number of sales."
good,"I decided to begin my training as a tax preparer due to the fact that I owed the IRS $17 one year.  After I signed up for classes, I learned that employment was possible.

good,"The entire job is very enjoyable, it is what I love to do, I couldn't ask for a better day at work. However the biggest down fall is there is little chance for advancement. The job is seasonal, with all senior employees working year round. I have been there three years and am no where near being close to getting a full time job. There are atleast thirty people that have worked there longer that could gain f-t, before I would should there be a position open up. Which is why I am job-searching right now. I need a full-time or even part time position that is year round."

good,Preparing personal income tax returns and processing loans and refunds
good,"HR Block was a good place to work to gain a basic understanding of the tax business. The software does most of the work, so a typical day is pretty autonomous. The job became difficult at times due to the lack of qualified personal. While, I was a first year tax preparer, I found my self doing a number of complex returns that I was not qualified for. While you are trained to just get these clients started and pass them off, it rarely happens. This is due to the fact that there is no where for them to go, because everyone is busy and the managers normally do not like to reschedule and risk losing the client. As long as you keep a positive attitude and be assertive in expressing uneasiness about certain returns, the job is enjoyable."
good,"Loved helping the clients and teaching them how to save on their taxes.  Also, they gave me the opportunity to teach other Tax Professionals and those wanting to become tax professionals."

With 80% of our business falling within three months, there was no time for idleness.  All staff had to be hired by December, trained in Policy and Procedure through January, and ready to go for February through April 30."
good,"An environment that is fast paced and busy during tax season, however as a result it was necessary for me to utilize my problem solving, organizational/ time management  and communication skills to meet H & R Block clients expectations."

good,"A typical day at H&R Block included lots of paper work, utilizing and customer service skills, I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers, they were like family. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my boss,because the company had a good order of operations. The hardest part of the job was, dealing with the upset, and angry clients, not that it was impossible, just sometimes took a little more patience than one is used to putting forth, when someone is yelling in your face, and snatching and throwing things at you, as hard as it may have been to have patience sometimes, the customer service was the best part of the job. I enjoy helping people understand, and be in the know about what is to be expected, and to make their choice to use the company I work for worthwhile."

good,At H&R Block there is a business casual work environment. When you go into work you find a computer to clock in and get your tools logged in. You take incoming calls from clients and help them answer the questions they have with the knowledge you gain. It's a great experience and gives you a lot of good knowledge for your own tax situation. Management is always there to help you learn and grow as an individual. The hardest part of the job is having to handle stressful clients with care.
good,"You have to love a job where first thing in the morning everyone has a smile on their face. Even if they had the roughest night, they still greet you in a warm friendly manner. You open up, get the first pot of coffe going, and begin the proper procedure for logging in. Coordinate with your tax pros with appointments and begin greeting clients. No matter how ignorant a client may get, you keep a smile on your face, answer the questions, and keep it moving. Nothing is personal when it comes to the client, and it can never be taken that way. Although at times it can be hard to hear someone cursing at you, patience is definately a virtue you either have before hand or learn while in the job. Overall, the customers are friendly and once you get to the know them...... they come with their own little story."

And got a recognition as a Block Star in the company in the past and always get a highest rating on Customer Satisfaction on the survey conducted by the company. Always a good team player. When working in the team environment I don't think of myself. Its up to everyone to accomplish the desired goals whatever they may be. My coworkers has always given me good remarks. The company has helped me learning a lot about customer service(listening, marketing, selling, building a long term relationship, setting and achieving goals) but now I want to move to even more responsibilites & challenges and want to expand my knowledge! I get many chances everyday to make meaningful connection with lots of different people at tax desk and at interpreting service!"
good,Had a great experience. Met a lot of new people and there are always opportunities to grow from working as an agent.
good,"The four months I spent working at Block were very enjoyable. My office team was a great group of people, and my office manager was incredibly flexible with my full time school schedule. They were completely able to accomodate me in that way. The pay isn't anything spectacular, and unfortunately unless a person works in a year round location, this isn't going to pay too many bills. I don't think that my DM was as in tune with the office as he liked to think. There had been talk of moving me to a year round office, and when I approached him about it, he basically just shot it down. I was told during my hiring interview in January that come February raises were given based on performance. All I ever recieved for my performance was outstanding praise from both my office manager and my DM - but no raise came my way. I would go back to Block for another season, but I would never count on it as any time of full time employment."
good,The most rewarding part of the job is a referral from a satisfied client.

I learned cash-handling skills and procedures and was able to strengthen customer service skills.
good,Not a year round job..Not enough qualified staff. But had great managers who are always willing to help.
good,"I liked the experience overall. My strength is customer service and that is what the job entailed. I answered and made phone calls, light filing, a lot of customer interaction was my typical day. Management was easy to approach and I felt comfortable communicating with the entire staff. The hardest part of the job is that it is temporary. The job is seasonal and hours diminished greatly when business slowed down. I learned H&R Block offers tax preparation courses. I thought you had to have experience to apply for the position. For a fee they will train you, hire you, and with the help your office leader and other professionals, continue to train and develop you. I was excited to learn that, because I am current employee of H&R Block I can take the tax courses at a reduced rate. Although the position is seasonal, I am excited to learn that there is an opportunity to learn a new skill and possibly have continued work in the near future. I enjoyed the opportunity that H&R Blocked offered me with its flexible hours and opportunity for continued work."
good,I love working in this position because of the people that you are able to help in one of the most important times of the year :)
good,It is very interesting to work for H&R Block as it has a very unique annual life cycle with operations at it peak during the tax season and development of new products during the non-tax season.
good,The majority of the jobs at H&R Blcok are seasonal however they are good jobs. They offer a lot of benefits even for the seasonal associates. Also they have a lot of opportunites to move up and around in the company.
good,This position is a great seasonal job for people that like a professional work atmosphere.
good,If you like doing taxes H&R Block is one of the best. they strive to teach and help their employees grow. If you are interrested in just doing taxes sign up for the basic tax classes in August and enjoy the best tax training out there.
good,"Experienced in utilizing tax documents for individuals, businesses,  corporations,  LLC's & Partnerships "
good,A good company that works in Online Tax filing services and also has a good work culture as compared to others. Growth is slow but the work is good for tax domain.
good,Good and very much a eye opener and also place I learn how to grow and become flexible when needed to be at times great experience I would work for them again
good,Company have own certificates programs for tax returns. If you want to have career in taxation. It's good place to start. Complete company offered courses and keep going year to year.
good,Receptionist position.  Long hours for part time.  Many calls coming in at one time. Must be accurate and quick.  Enjoyed working with agents.  Multi task..key holder..trust.  Must pass background check.
good,"Love the other employees, management is amazing, excellent training. Very comfortable, upbeat and positive atmosphere and very flexible hours/ shifts."
good,"I like to help clients to file their personal income tax, federal and state,  give advice regarding how paid quarterly taxes on self-employment clients,  also all benefits for saving money on retirement."
good,"In my experience the focus of customer care was not number one priority. Even though h&r block does care about their clients, the overall focus was how much money each location would make daily."
good,It was one of the best places I ever worked. But they never had all year round positions available. I worked in the Expat department and I never was given year round employment. So I had to move forward with another opportunity that did. I would have stayed for years to come but I could no longer depend on unemployment as a means to live on for two months. Great place to work but not as your main source of income.
good,"I had a great time working here, but I wasn't exactly sure what it is I was doing. Evidently with anyone's first entry-level office career there's kind of that lag point where people have no idea what they're doing. For me, I just got dragged by the lag. No clear direction."
good,"It's a good place to work to gain experience. I worked a lot of hours there.We started out with 5 CSP's,but after a few weeks I was the only one left, so I got all the hours and work load. I was also the Office Marketing Ambassador.I was in charge of the weekly marketing calendar and expected to get at least 5 leads a week, do good neighboring with other businesses, & set up side walk tables with marketing materials.Minimal pay."
good,"What you would expect from a tax prep company.  Insanely long hours during tax season, and as a contract employee, nothing once the season is over.  The owner of the Cortez Co branch is amazing though."
good,"You go to school every year learning the new tax laws, updating your education within the  tax updates."
good,I work in 3 different offices for the same franchise owners.  I love the people I work with and the environment that we are in.  I have been on one company trip for Xero training that lasted 3 days.
good,"Job is professional, challenging at times but nothing you can’t handle. I enjoy the plans/organization skills they provide/teach. Keeps you on your toes since it’s seasonal and things change slightly every year."
good,"What I like is that you learn a new skill and gain tax knowledge. The pay is minimum for the first year but if you level up and go for apply again to work for next season, you can get commission. But again that's base off of you and what clients will come to you for the tax season. What I didn't like is that for my first year I was in an office with other 1st years which left us hanging when we needed help with more complex taxes, that was truly embarrassing.  Most of the time they tax pros with more experience was just a call away and are more than willing to help. It was just a process that would make clients impatient."
good,"I have worked for the company over 10 years and I have seen the changes some good choices and bad, but I go with the flow. I enjoy my clients and that is why I am there."
good,"I enjoyed working with a great team, however, the change in managers almost every year is not healthy for the staff. I learned a lot from my co-workers but due to having a full-time job I am unable to take the classes to become a tax preparer."
good,I felt comfortable with everyone I worked with after getting to know them more. the client were patient and understanding with that am a new employee.
good,Good work culture and ethics. Proper professional treatment given to all the employees working at H&R block.They are all very helpful and friendly.Give you an opportunity to grow faster.
good,It is very good company for freshers. From managers to all other are very helpful in nature. Give you opportunity to grow faster and staff is very supportive.
good,"If you’re into sales, this is the company for you.  Education aspect is great however you are forced to sell products and the pay is bad for the amount of hours."
good,"I liked the job, i enjoyed the training, but i always felt like i didnt know what to do next. Not a clear path for advancement. Also the company encourages you to find your own clients."
good,Learning the intricacies of the US tax code is a never ending ending process. At HRBLOCK you have the tools to learn about the changes each year by taking classes in the off season. Helping individuals with making better financial choices by encouraging saving and giving tax saving strategies is all part of a tax preparers job. I found my years at HRBLOCK interesting and consider it a great learning and sometimes rewarding experience.
good,They have great training programs to get you started as a tax professional.  You can achieve different levels of proficiency up to and including an Enrolled Agent Certification.  The seasonal tax work is also good experience.
good,"Pay is 100% commission based after your first year, so if your not good and what you do and furthering your education annually it will be hard to make money. Employment is mostly seasonal, but again if you are good at what you do there are off season opportunities. Management is supportive, continuing education is almost free."
good,Great place to work. Learnt many things about taxes and how to process them. Got you acquainted with the local people who would come back year after year to get their taxes completed.
good,"H&R Block treated me well when I worked there full time as an office manager. The primary downside is being considered seasonal, no matter how many positions I worked all year keeping me employed mostly full time. The pay is bad, the hours are long, and you have to work hard to get a bonus. Not offering benefits to part time employees at all was a let down as well, especially when every employee must dedicate so much time and effort to the job."
good,"I was a 1st year tax professional and did 0ver 80 returns. During the tax season, I wasn't assigned hours for 3 weeks as seniority workers received them. The Office Manager was condescending to me in front of clients."
good,"I worked as a receptionist at H&R Block while I was in high school. Some days could be stressful towards the end of the tax season, but I overall enjoyed the experience."
good,"Hard working tax professionals can go far if they are willing to put in the hours and take classes to advance their knowledge. There are lots of classes available within the company on every tax topic, so find the areas that are most relevant to the clients you will actually be helping in your area."
good,Processed taxes for individuals and businesses. Determined by analyzing information  to see if clients are eligible for tax credits or liabilities do to the tax code.
good,"This company makes you feel confident in addressing difficult tax situations due to their many tax research resources. However, working in the down season eats up your commission."
good,"Typical day depends on whether we are in ""Tax Season"" or not.  H&R is open year round to do Tax Returns, Corporate Tax, Bookkeeping, Payroll, GST, etc.  We can put in longer hours during peak season."
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoyed it. They give you lots of opportunities to learn and advance. They provide plenty of ways to learn. I like to opportunities offered there.
good,"Its a nice seasonal job. The manager was nice, most of the tax pros were easy to get along with. The tax pros do get competitive and defensive over their clients. Besides that it was nice."
good,"Seasonal work during tax time. There was about 2 weeks of more than full time work, then hours are cut to part time. Work is busiest after 5pm and on weekends."
good,"I started at H & R Block as a Tax Preparer and then became the manager as I knew how to do everything. First off I would meet with different clients and help them to file their individual or business returns. When I became Manager I hired and fired people. I taught basic classes as well as more advanced classes. I scheduled the Tax Preparers, I greeted clients and helped them to figure out what was going on with their taxes. I took payments and made deposits. I opened and closed the office."
good,"A typical day was coming in and setting up appointment, calling to confirm appointments, scanning documents and faxing. I learned a lot about taxes especially with all the new tax laws in place now. I also liked the diversity in the office. My manager was great."
good,"I have really enjoyed working with H&R Block and would not mind continuing, however, I need more structure and benefits would be good. People are great."
good,"Job is good with hours on peak but off peak hours suck , deffinetly cannot be your only source of income . Tax Pros are very nice and helpful , very knowledgeable as well."
good,"I really enjoy working here. I wish this position was year-round. The job is fast-paced AND slow, in spurts throughout the day. Sometimes there are multiple walk-ins waiting around the receptionist desk while both phone lines are ringing. And sometimes, there may be several minutes without a customer or a phone call. In either situation, other staff members are readily available to assist... this is a ""team-work-driven"" office. I learn new tax tidbits almost every day."
good,Only do this if you cant get nothing else. The boss was lazy. This is a job for you if you are trying to get rich. It was just something to do for me honestly.
good,Low pay for the responsibility.  However was educational.  Enjoyed the staff.  Need to keep up with yearly training to continue.  Tax laws always changing as most of us know.
good,"I've always been great with people and our office is very personable. A little quiet at times however very productive. The manager is on top of things and my colleagues are great team players. "
good,"Was good experience, flexible schedule, professional management. Providing free courses, giving you an opportunity to upgrade your professional level."
good,"It's a very fast-paced environment no matter what position you work. That can be a good or bad thing, depending on the person. Honestly, it's a great place to work for me because I can usually get a lot done, and there are a lot of hours for all employees if they want it."
good,"My typical day as a Tax Manager include but are not limited to: the responsibility for creating, implementing and overseeing the tax plan for the clients, either businesses or individuals. My primary responsibility is to accurately and efficiently manage clients’ tax reporting and planning and ensure compliance of all tax laws. I work as a member of senior management within the company managing multiple retail office according to the standard operating procedures. I serve as a tax a consultant for multiple clients employed and residing inside and outside the United States of America."
good,"I relocated here in Tampa, FL in July of 2016 from Cincinnati, Ohio after a very long career with the Internal Revenue Service after the untimely death of my husband. I applied for a job at H&R Block took the training and was hired and started the job as a Tax Associate in Jan.2017-April 2018 as a seasonal employe at 9.00 per hour. This is my third year and I am now an Enrolled Agent. A typical day at work is tax preparation, taxpayer planning and addressing other needs of the taxpayer. I learned that as a federal employee for so many years that actually working for the other side is unimaginable! Management was great no complains! The hardest part of the job was not being able to use my expertises that I learned as a tax professional unless you have that type of certification! The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and working as a team!"
good,"Before it turned corporate, It was like working for a family member. I enjoyed the close knit family environment, the training, the support from management and the clients"
good,"Fast paced work setting during the first couple of months of tax season, then it kind of slows down and it is not as stressful to try and get everyone taken care of."
good,For the most part it is great for getting experience in the auditing industry or for a retiree looking to keep busy and supplementing retirement income.
good,"Good place for those that fit the company culture. "
good,Temp position for tax season only.  Helped people finish their taxes and file for reimbursement.  Fun and active place to work.  Enjoyed coworkers and location was convenient.
good,answer phones check messages and file paperwork check customers in cash them out stuff folders clean office pass on to next shift any info they need make calls to scheduled appointments
good,"long hours."
good,people are aggressive money hungry and lazy. The owner is very nice and helpful. very smart young and hard worker. you can learn a lot or you can learn nothing
good,"fun if you like solving problems and work well under pressure. a lot of incentives like over time, free lunch, bonuses. Help is available thru tiers. offers free tax filing"
good,"I started working for H&R Block in 2017 and I keep coming back. I love the office I work with. As long as they'll have me I'll keep going back. I'm hoping to take tax classes soon. However, I still want to be a receptionist."
good,"The work environment would vary from calm to stressful, it was dependent on the flow of customers coming to file their personal tax returns. There were 2 peak times where it was extremely busy."
good,With the proper training its a cool job. Had to get used to the two-three computer screens. Friendly staff slow voming to help which ran phone times up
good,"As stated in my resurme a typical day involve welcoming clients who come to file their taxes.  Their identities are verified and various transactions or T4 and other tax papers received and used to file their taxes respectively.  this information is sent to Canada Revenue Agency and a tax return if given back in the form of cash or checques if required."
good,H&R Block is a great company to work for. Sadly it is only a seasonal job and only open for the duration of tax season. There isn't any room for advancement at this job.
good,good hours and good time of year - other people there are nice to work with - location is very close to home - lots of training provided - many classes especially in fall
good,Excellent experience working as an entry level tax professional however the office management skills is in desperate need of improve. Need to sharpen office personnel's main goals to reach them in a timely manner.
good,Took this job because I just moved to the area and needed an income. The managers and staff where always pleasant. It was not a stressful jobbed I enjoyed my time there.
good,H&R Block is Only open for work from January to April annually. So those of you looking for a full time job should look elsewhere. Most employees here have atleast two jobs.
good,Company promotes continued professional eductation. Worklife balance is encouraged and promoted. Teamwork is prevalent theme and staff management relationship is positive.
good,"Working with HR Block wasn't too bad, the hours were based on what you could work and you were given clients that fit your tax professional specifications."
good,Working for HRBlock has given me opportunities to provide tax service with people from all walks of life. It also makes us aware of any tax changes and apply the knowledge to clients who rely heavily on tax preparers.
good,Positions as a tax preparer are seasonal and most positions available are as a tax preparer. H&R Block provides extensive training classes to make sure you are aware of current tax laws and regulations to help you to be able to become a succesful PTRP.
good,I found eveyone helpful and understanding after being away from the work force for so long.  Manager was easy to work for and all the tax pros were helpful and nice.  Made the job easy.
good,Its an easy job. Other tax professionals are willing to help you out if they are not busy. Management changes a lot though because the job is temporary. My district is already on our 3rd DM.
good,"As a client service professional my day consisted of making and answering the phone, greeting and checking-in clients, checking-out clients and processing payments, filing paperwork, and scheduling and confirming appointments. I learned a great deal of phone and customer service skills along with a little about filing income taxes. Our manager was a great guy, very knowledgeable, and always willing to help. This created and helped maintain a great work environment that our clients enjoyed. As an introvert, the hardest part of my job was making phone calls and developing my customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the tax pros during our down time as the office can be pretty quiet at times."
good,"Though I only worked as a first-year tax preparer (the starting position is paid pennies with the promise of much more following the first year depending on performance), I'm familiar with what can be accomplished if you find that this job is for you. "
good,"Customer Service"
good,Upper management requires things in the office that does not make sense. Each office has its own mix which varies on its operation. Loved my office and coworkers.
good,"This job is during tax season.  Can be fast paced at certain times. I enjoy working with the clients and the co workers.   The hours are according to the amount of appointments, so some weeks can be slow.  I love working there and enjoy the seasonal work."
good,"I really enjoyed my position at H&R Block. Everyone got along, And there was always someone there to assist if you had a problem. The hours were great, and the working conditions were very good."
good,"Its a pretty nice job, If you're looking to learn something new during the tax season and don't mind a fast-pace work environment then this job is for you."
good,"There’s different seasonal roles offered at H&R Block WHQ. It’s a relaxed atmosphere. You are expected to do your job duties without management continuously directing you, as it should be IMO."
good,Working at H&R Block is great if your just starting out and need experience. The environment is very relaxed and mostly everyone is willing to help one another.
good,Meet the greatest people. Help these people with understanding their taxes. Keep indoors during cold winter months and get furloughed when the weather warms up.
good,"The company lost its identity once they began hiring from outside rather than internally. Resource were cut, quotas increased, vacations equaled work!"
good,"We worked great as a team and has  great learning opportunities. If I had any complaints it would be about the salary, but once I get my clientele built up, I will be eligible for bonuses."
good,Tax Professionals were well trained and get yearly updates on new tax rules. The objective which is to give great customer service is always the priority of each Tax Professional.
good,"this job was seasonal. fast paced and fun. the other workers were fun and the bosses were even nicer. it was like a family year after year. had it been full time work, id have stayed forever"
good,"A good place to work and definitely rewarding, helping people out of tax complications, and seeing many people relieved and educated regarding their tax situations."
good,I loved working with the group of people that I worked with.  The location was great for me.  The hours and pay was OK for it being a seasonal job.  I hope to work the same group of people and location next year and years to come.
good,They change the schedule with no warning or a call to make sure you were available. Hours were not evenly done.  Can not access schedule from home which made it difficult to see if changes were made.
good,"I enjoyed working with the clients and my co workers. The only part that is a negative is that this is seasonal and does not have benefits. But during the season it can get hectic but it is rewarding,"
good,This job always lets you advance. Continuing education is very important if you want to make more money from them. They do have a great client base so you get to meet lots of new people around your city.
good,"workplace needed some updating."
good,"not a place to make a ton of money, but good for a side job"
good,"Enjoyed the company, training is great, internship is difficult as there are so many tax laws to consider.  Years of experience make this a job that some come back to for 20 plus years."
good,"A nice place to work if you're looking for something seasonal, however management and their method of operating could use a little work. There's no benefits for entry level, or non certified tax pros; however there are some nice oppportunities available to those who desire to move up."
good,The atmosphere can be fast paced and stressful but the experience that one can learn through preparing taxes is incredible. The company provides an amazing online teaching program that allows and encourages workers to further themselves in the knowledge of tax laws.
good,"It can be fun and boring sometimes but overall engaging enough to enjoy for what it is. Wish there was more year-round work and non seasonal work. I learned a lot with their tax classes and the other employees who helped me, not all of them did though. Hardest part is working with some of the other tax pros and most enjoyable part is finishing a return and the kind, nice clients."
good,"HR block should improve the payment for the employees, we lost to many clients because the preparation fee. HR Block need better management, and give a bonus to the employee"
good,It was interesting. I would have liked it if the training had more examples.  Management was fair and treated us well. I would recommend working at H&R Block.
good,"Working with the public, getting to know your co-workers from different office locations and helping the Clients with sign in information.  All around Fund place to be."
good,I love working with HR Block. The knowledge and training you receive here is great. It has good work environment. First four months of the year life is fast paced.
good,"Clocked in on computer. Sat at receptionist desk. Signed in clients. Put Client info in computer. Filed physical info. Phoned old clients to set appts and update files. Made phone calls to illicit new clients. Accepted payments in cash, check or credit cards. Assigned new clients to Tax preparers. Made sure reception area was free of debris and tidy. Clocked out. "
good,"Prendre rendez-vous avec les clients pour leurs impôts."
good,I was working as the receptionist during school  and this job allowed me to do my school work during my down time. They were able to work around my school schedule and i was able to make money and do my homework at the same time!
good,"This job was enjoyable. If this job was available all year round, I would gladly do it. Pay was not what I would call competitive, but it was higher than minimum wage and worth the amount for the work you do."
good,If you're looking for a temporary job that isn't too stressful - you've gone to the right place if you're considering H&R Block. They work with your schedule and give you opportunities to learn on the job.
good,"It was a great, flexible job for me as I was an undergraduate student at the time. I got to learn a lot about taxes and gained a lot of office and administrative work and customer service."
good,"Every year Tax Academy is conducted ,opportunity for advancement. "
good,"Some days were busy, some were slow depending upon the day of week and time of day.  I learned a few tricks and trades about income taxes and was amazed at what some individuals received.  The manager was pleasant and easy to talk to and very informative.  The culture was laid back and competition was high.  The hardest part was when we were busy and I had to inform the customers of their wait times.  Sometimes the waiting room would get loud.  The most enjoyable time was when I was able to schedule appointments for the customers with the employee of their choice and at a time they preferred."
good,If you have school or a family being a tax pro at H&R Block is perfect because they are very flexible. Once you get higher up in the company though they begin to encroach on your life a lot. They also have a very subjective pay scale but if you are effective in communicating your limits in terms of reasonable time you can dedicate to your position and you aren't shy about asking for good compensation then it's a good place to work. We have a strong team work culture and everyone looks out for everyone else which is nice. Just don't let them take over your life.
good,H&R Block is a nice seasonal job to have that can supplement your post holiday income or can be the o e job a year you need to take to get a tax return. Its usually a somewhat quiet job but obviously has its busy parts of the day. You will answer a lot of the same questions over the phone and will need to be able to communicate over the telephone well as you will be calling people to confirm appointments and then giving thank you calls. You have to be organized as you will be dealing with people's personal info and will need to ensure it is cared for properly. It is also a good way to learn about tax returns and if you are interested in becoming a tax preparer it helps that you already work for them. They are a good company but the receptionist job only lasts until April 15th every year.
good,your experience depends on what you put into it and the atmosphere in your particular office.there is generally a high turnover rate in both management and tax preparers.
good,"Great place to learn,"
good,"HR Block was a great place to work. It was a huge stepping stone in my employment future. I learned so much from this employer, and am able to use what I learned to advance in alternative associated employment."
good,In order to work at H&R Block you had to attend their tax course.  If found this to be something I enjoyed.  I typically worked evenings and most of the time by myself.  The office was pleasant and we had the proper things we needed to accomplish what needed to be done.  My employment was prior to computers being popular so we had to manually prepare and calculate tax returns.  They would be reviewed at the corporate office and found to have little errors.
good,"Days vary with time of season, could be busy could be slow.  Customers can be friendly or can be grumpy.  Management is off-site.  Scheduling can be uneven."
good,Each and everyday was different. It was a very diverse company to work for. I enjoyed free parking and winning tickets to different events in the city.
good,H&R Block is a hard place to make money due to the way the pay is structured. A tax professional doesn't really start making money until they have repeat clients and can generate more income that what they are paid hourly.
good,I would prepare tax returns and educate the customer on how the better their tax returns for the next year. I was always learning something my self. always meeting new people.
good,I truly love working with the people there.  Something can always be improved in anything you do or have in life.  But I go back for the clients that I have grown to know like family.
good,"this is a great winter job,  paid a base salary, at end of season you received a bonus. depending on how much you work deter minds your bonus  hours are flexible"
good,"A typical day at work is answering the phone, scheduling appointments, hanging posters and franchising. I enjoy greeting the customers and keeping them happy."
good,This was a fast pace job and it was nice to meet all the clients.  The people that I worked with were very helpful if I needed some help with questions that I did not know.
good,"it is  so  interesting  to  work  in  this  company  because   your  learn different  things  every  day."
good,Career advancement is one of the most important elements for employee satisfaction and retention at a company. Opportunities for career advancement are an “especially powerful” employee motivator.
good,"Much unpaid training.  Change of upper management too often.   Change of programs often.  Great tax system, but not perfect.  Love my clients.   Flexible with my self employment.  Like people I work with."
good,"I liked being a receptionist there the only thing is you get paid minimum wage. If I got paid more I would have continued working there also it's only seasonal. But they do call you back every season to see if u want to work there again, which is pretty cool."
good,I was hired into an office that had very little walk in traffic.  I didn't have the opportunity to prepare very many tax returns.  Since there was a new rating tied to your expertise and experience many people who walked in had returns more complex that my level so that limited my options as well.  I didn't have a big network to pull from to gain my own book of business so I decided this was not a good fit for me.
good,"My position at HR Block was seasonal during the 2017 tax season from December through April 17.  I have been invited to work during the 2018 tax season and feel that the company was pleased with my performance.  The atmosphere was professional.  Management was helpful and very flexible with schedule as well as training.  The overall environment was pleasant; coworkers were professional, helpful, and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was giving individuals bad news about their taxes(owing).  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and helping them get through their tax filing process efficiently and comfortably."
good,"Answer phones, set appointments, if new client, set up basic information needed for tax prepping.  filed completed folders, scanned documents for tax preparers, took payments, logged payments into clients files.  Nice people to work with."
good,"I worked with a good group of people, friendly and always helpful. very relaxed environment although fast paced at the same time. manager was outstanding. everyone got along very well there."
good,Flexible in work schedule.  More hours available the more money you can make.  Peak weeks which are normally the month of February and 12 hour shifts can be the norm including Sat & Sun
good,"I really only did office work to make everyone else's life less hectic, but it was a small office and everyone got quite along very well. Clients were often regulars who trusted us completely, and we all just enjoyed making their lives easier."
good,"Typical day depending on date and time could either be hectic or slow."
good,"Excellent lower level management. Upper management distant and frequently not attuned to needs of producers. Unrealistic and unsupportive expectations of correlative product sales, products which are often poorly conceived, inadequately tested, and embarrassing to employees. Company culture of wonderful commitment to honesty and integrity in dealings with client base, non-judgmental in handling errors of otherwise good employees, and dependable in doing what they say they're going to do."
good,Great place to work. Management is great. Good flexible seasonal job. Great learning about taxes and very rewarding when others are happy with their out come.
good,"It was fun, yet stressful. It is a learning experience though. I would still like to work there again, but wouldn't want to put too much energy into it like I did before. It may pay off to do so, but some times not really. Great start for those who are in college or school. Flexible hours, that what I really liked about the job. I wish it was permanent though. I hope to be able to get back into the job again."
good,"I enjoyed managing people; clients as well as employees.  "
good,I learned a lot and enjoyed taking the classes.  It was a face paced job during busy times.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with.  The pay was nice and good bonuses.
good,"The CSP position required online training before starting the job, so the work itself wasn't hard. The most stressful part of the job was calling to confirm appointments made the prior year. Several did not remember or were very rude."
good,Good  for retired candidate. Very flexible working  hours.  Encourage you to elevate you position.  Training and resources readily available. Opportunity to advance.
good,"H&R Block is under-estimated.  "
good,Fair employer and good co-workers to see every day. The new manager this past season was very easy going and focus to find solutions quickly and easy.
good,"Taxes are confusing and scary, and H&R Block helps. We received the best training in tax law and tax theory, and then used that knowledge to help people with real life crises. The four month marathon was a little rough, but the amount of people we can help in that period made it worth it."
good,Very nice & calm environment. Was fun to talk to customers everyday & Had good relationship with coworkers . Though if you Have a hard time being yelled Or hung up on by customers at all this may not be the job for you or any customer service of any kind . But I didn't mind over all it was fine .
good,"The months of January through April are very fast paced and you have no time, but after that you only work 1 or 2 days a week. The money is not enough to live off of year round."
good,"High demand environment given the brevity of the tax season, with limited resources to achieve goals, but outstanding local management was empowering."
good,"Only downfall is most positions are seasonal and employees are not compensated enough. Potential for career advancement is available and encouraged, but it only applies 4 months out of the year. I have learned so much through block due to my mentor. The hardest part is being under the crunch during tax time, but that is also the best part."
good,"We had a good team in our office and we all knew we could count on each other when things got crazy.  I think the best part of the job was meeting new clients and trying to save them some tax dollars.  Block required continuing education annually and encouraged helping each other out with questions.  It seems that each day, something new was added to our skill sets."
good,"Its a place that you learn how to work with federal and local taxes. The experience was great, because you can do more tha taxes in the season. you have to audit documents to be sure that all the information its true. The hardest part of the job, was know all the tax law that the client must applicate to fill the tax return and do it correctly in a fair time."
good,"Enjoy working together with my team. Very helpful coworkers and our office manager. Some times, unreasonable overscheduling. Good teamwork to help clients."
good,"New tax professionals will not make much more than minimum wage for the first few years, it takes time to develop your tax knowledge and company certifications, as well as develop and grow your own client base.  Then you can make very good money for 3.5 months of work, then 8.5 months off.  There are very limited opportunities for year round employment and all associates are separated for atleast 8 weeks during each year to maintain a status as a seasonal employee."
good,"Not a bad job to have part time. Its slow during the beginning of tax season and usually picks up towards the end. Your work hours depend on how busy the location is. "
good,"There are no complaints about this employer. Once I got used to the manager and the way she liked her office to flow, work became a lot easier, as with any job."
good,"really laid back environment. gained client service experience, opportunity for advancement. goals are clear and achievable making it easy to understand your role"
good,"Maintained client schedules and tax returns, complete accurate data entry and processed payments efficiently also greeted Clients and provided information."
good,"H & R Block is a good company, I have developed skills interacting with various clients. I enjoyed working with peers and experts with tax related codes and information."
good,Had fun working with different people and resolving tax related matters at individual level very challenging and keep busy. but seasonal job so not an option for person looking for full time permanent work.
good,I enjoy working for this company. If I could change anything I would lower the cost of how much we charge on filling returns. I enjoy the family work.
good,"If you love customers than this can be an enjoyable job. This job mostly entails answering the phone, making appointments for customers, and accepting payment for services."
good,"Can be slow at times but it can get pretty busy randomly. Some clients can be rude, but most are friendly. I learned a few things about taxes as you get to interact with the tax pros."
good,Helping client with their income tax preparation individual and cooperate.  Dealing with all personalities and race.  I love meeting new people and also reconnecting with my previously clients.  I enjoy working with all my co workers and I love learning new things every year with the continue education they have at HR Block.
good,"A fun and easy job that has basic training and great client interaction.  I worked the position for many seasons and enjoyed most of the staff and clients.  Sometimes you get a difficult client, but it is tax season and it is stressful to say the least."
good,good job friendly people good pay for college students really easy work. Sorry not punctuating but its a overall good job if you are a hunting or out doors person you will love this job because of its products are very interesting
good,Worked during tax season so it was very hectic. But was pleased with e training i received. The work culture is also very friendly.
good,"The Internal Revenue Code is constantly changing. As such, Block places a premium on learning and continuing to learn. You must learn not to judge people when they make huge mistakes with their money and wind up owing a large amount of taxes.  I enjoyed helping people with problems and always asked for the hardest returns."
good,I learned a lot while working for h&r block! The 1st office I worked at which was on chkalov had an amazing group of tax preparer's that taught me team work! I have taken what they have taught me to other jobs I've had since then! I would work for them again if it were possible but my full time job doesn't like me working at other positions
good,"	Assist different clients with their prior tax problem."
good,"Working at HR Block was good, NIce environment, well trained and had a lot of help when needed.  You are allowed to make your own schedule. Only down side is the pay could have been better."
good,I learned a great deal through the H&R block course and then applied basic to intermediate at the job preparing tax returns of individuals.I worked at City line.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at H & R block because there was a healthy and enjoyable environment along with a great staff and customer base. I learnt new skills that I will use throughout life while giving me the opportunity to further develop my character. My daily duties would include: Coming in early to vacuum, clean and answer phone calls, open the office and manage the customers. The hardest part of the job would be the promotional work we did. The promotional work taught me to be more outgoing and confident."
good,"The office was layed back. The staff was enthusiastic and welcoming. Even though I was a temp they made me feel like a part of the team instantly. With all the reponsibility the manager had and all the obsticals she faced daily she remained very proffesional and inspirational. The hardest part of the job was the lack of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, from staff to customers."
good,My time at H and R Block was a great experience and I enjoyed the help I received from my coworkers and manager. Meeting new customers and helping them were such joy. Great environment with wonderful people.
good,"This job is seasonal and fast paced, there is a lot to learn and room to grow if you put in the effort to learn in order to advance."
good,"Working for H&R Block, you can pretty much set your own schedule. The people I worked along side were wonderful... No matter what, you have something new every day. Whether it be a new client, or a new tax law you get to research. That was something I enjoyed because it wasn't always the same old thing."
good,"Although there a lot of down time, this job was a good job with good people and employees. Management was good once we all got on the same page and got the office up and running for tax season."
good,The office had very professional individual to work with. I enjoyed the work and being able to contribute to the bottom line success of the branch. I greeted clients and ensured they had all the necessary documentation for the Tax Professional to proceed with the return. Answered multiple lines; made appointments and scheduled client pick up times for finished returns. Having worked for 5 years for a Tax Attorney knowing the laws and IRS regulations was very helpful in doing my job affectively.
good,great way to better your acknowledgement of computers. the software gives you so many ways to troubleshoot. Tax preparation made easy
good,"A typical day at work in my most recent position was anything but typical.  In my most recent position as District Operations Coordinator I had to be agile and ready for anything as day to day I had to be ready to adapt to whatever the situation would require.  As the DOC I was responsible for supporting 2 districts in the Atlanta area - coordinating with the District General Manager to ensure hiring of all associates completed properly, all CE completed and registered for associates, making sure pay rates complete and schedules prepared properly.  On any given day I might be called because the A/C or heat, or plumbing wasn't working properly - or the roof was leaking.  Anything that affected to operation of the office was my area of responsibility for the 31 offices that comprised the 2 districts I supported.  I learned how to more effectively manage my day through the use of Outlook Calendar and how to effectively schedule my tasks to get the most out of my 40 hours!  I had the best co-workers - I found that the associates hired at H&R Block were wonderful people to work with - The nature of the work being customer service oriented leads me to believe that was the reason our associates were so great to work with.  The hardest part of the job was having to be hourly paid.  Many times the job required more than the 40 hours allotted and I did not like having to stop before the job was complete and put off until the next pay period work I wanted to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see the results of my work - Seeing reports showing that my associates"
good,I was only a receptionist here. I started here in high school! They were very good to me about helping me learn the job and flexible with my school hours. Unfortunately I missed out on a lot of the time they needed me because I applied so late.
good,"My time with H&R block was very beneficial. I learned a lot during my short time there. A typical day consists of:"
good,"Prepare tax returns. Supervise employees. I love meeting new people every day. I got along with all my co-workers."
good,You could learn a lot if you work at GOOD office. I work in an office in Manhattan. I heard that there are so many offices have very bad management.
good,Corporate company driven by numbers.  Great match for sales and financial career background that is looking for a part time seasonal job to make extra cash.  Multiple opportunities to develop tax professioanl careers.
good,"Laid back and low key place to work. Great co-workers and fun job. It's a seasonal job, so I hope to go back every tax season from now on."
good,We really stay busy and I like being in a busy office. The co-workers are the best and always ready to lend a hand or advice. The hardest part of working there is when you find out someone owes money instead of getting a refund back. I enjoy being able to get clients their maximum refunds!
good,I needed a job and this is what I could find at the time I was looking. Really looking for something permeant with benefits and still looking at this time.
good,Fun people and willing to help you learn. different opportunities to learn the material and continue education. Work with different toes of situations and research tax problems when needed.
good,"Very fun and energetic atmosphere, daily bonuses provided.  Management frequently provided meals for the staff.  Very flexible schedule and attendance policy."
good,Good co workers to work with.  I worked to seasons with them both different job titles. First year as front desk CSP greet customers answer the phone and schedule appointments. Second year was a First Year Tax Pro prepares taxes for the more basic clients.

good,Meeting people of all walks of life. I enjoyed working with great people who care for each other.  Provided  a service to help everyone with filing their taxes.
good,Business side is more flexible than IT who tend to work long hours.  work life balance only truly exists for some workers.  Mom and pop shop operations.
good,"I loved the people I worked with. A typical day at work was welcoming our clients, making sure we made the phone calls. I did learn a lot about customer service and was able to achieve in a lot of work. Multitasking is a huge need to be done at that job. Did have some issues with the manager not being at the office when we needed the person we had to call other offices to ask questions. Even when trying to call would never answer or will call back hours later."
good,"Working with the Villas & Catalinas Office are great. The environment in the office is awesome. It has been a great learing experience. I started as an custoer service profesional, learned and became a tax specialist. Due to my experience in office management was offered an Office Manager position."
good,great work place fun friendly environment. training needs to improve  and be more hands on. wish it could be year-round.
good,"Submitted data to the IRS for processing,  Printed refund checks, prepared clients file for pickup.  Phoned client to pickup their check.  Corrected any glitch in the return so it would be accepted for processing."
good,the work hours are flexible and allows you to fit your hours around your life's activities .the group that I work with have been there for many years and they get along for the most part and it is a pleasant place to work
good,"awsome people to work with. helped lots of people. seasonal. "
good,"Talking with people, listening to their problems and help them to solve the problems. "
good,Working as a client service professional was actually interesting. I was actually excited about working here because it was my first real job coming out of high school. My hours were really good. I made a great amount of money at that age I was at when I started working there. My co-workers were really great people. They helped me out a lot since I was the youngest one there. They treated me as if I was working with them for a long time. The hardest part about the job was memorizing certain quotes or what the procedure was when it came to the customers but I eventually got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was in a mall so during my breaks I would go to lunch with one of m co-workers or go shop for a little bit while.
good,I love the one on one tax preparation interviews with each client. Our clients get great value for money with our method of tax preparation.
good,"H&R Block offers seasonal employment, which offers the opportunity for a flexible schedule. There is awesome room for advancement within the company and additional training at a very low cost."
good,"Fun people to work with. Workload a bit much at times, but doable.  Phone line rings ridiculously.  Wish the office I worked for had music playing when calls were put on hold"
good,"A day at H&R Block starts out with our daily prep.  During this time, which usually occurs at about the first 10 minutes before opening the doors to clients, it is the job of the tax professional to prepare client files or create new client files.  Getting ready for the day helps to prevent slow services to customers and is deemed one of the most important factors of service.  In the office where I worked, I felt that I was a necessary part of the team atmosphere which, in my opinion, was the most enjoyable part of the position.  The only part that I did not like was the evaluation system used.  Customers are able to rate you, the tax pro, based on their experience.  One of the biggest factors that I am against is that the customer can give the tax pro a poor rating based entirely upon the cost of their tax prep.  The tax professionals have nothing to do with the pricing set up from office to office and should not be evaluated on such an area as it does not apply to the individual tax professionals but rather on headquarters or the office franchisee."
good,"BRENDA LOPEZ GODFREY"
good,"H&R Block gives you a flexible schedule. You make your schedule base on the need and events you are coordinating. There's no typical day. In the beginning I had a challenge engaging the store managers to cooperate with events. It was a growing experience to work with 20-25 store managers. Overall, the experience was enjoyable."
good,The office environment is very friendly and inviting. The other employees are always willing to help with business and personal issues.
good,"At the local level, I enjoyed my time at HRB. Supervisors above that level and the integrity of the company itself was in some cases lacking. I was told I would work a certain number of hours a week but those hours were cut down to next to nothing some of the time."
good,"Loved my job as a CSP and loved the people I would work with. Every year you would meet new faces of either new preparers or new CSP's or both, but always loved the old faces as well. Didn't always like the things my boss would do or how much she would let her children get away with because it would always cause stress in the work environment. Overall though I loved my job and the time I had with them!"
good,I enjoyed working for HR Block at a number of offices as a Tax Professional and office manager.  They offer extraordinary training opportunities and job stability as well as the seemingly unlimited ability to improve your pay grade and job title.
good,highly productive environment with times of minimal stress related to heavy work loads.  professional atmosphere; learning encouraged; the best feeling comes when clients come in telling how much their lives have changed with my advice.

good,"I enjoy the flexibility of my work hours.  I have had the ability to learn and understand the tax code."
good,"I've learned how to prepare different types of tax returns"
good,"A typical day at H&R Block consists of reviewing a preparing tax returns.  They provide web courses throughout the year to advance your skills within the tax profession, which I enjoy very much.  The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency and somewhat lack of management.  However, being able to prepare taxes and help co-workers with our new operating system has been the most enjoyable part."
good,"Processing tax returns is fun all in itself, but meeting new people is such a pleasure. The management and co-workers are great to work with."
good,"Although this is a great place to work, it is not full time all year."

good,I learned alot about preparing income tax for clients. It was a very good learning experience for me. I had a good team to work with everybody helped each other.

good,"Making customers satisfied"
good,"Would go in and prepare taxes work with clients and other preparers."
good,"Pretty good place for seasonal work, managers work with your hours. Can get a bit crazy since tax pros work for an end of the year commission so they'll sometimes try and steal others clients"
good,I loved everyone I worked with. You work with clients from every culture and background.
good,"Every day was different at H&R Block, as was every Client and Client scenario, which I greatly enjoyed. It was typically very rewarding and satisfying especially to take something (Tax Law), which is intimidating and sometimes confusing and overwhelming, and turn it into something that my clients didn't fear and could get a better understanding of. My co-workers were all very knowledgable, professional and kind people, and enjoyed working with them very much."
good,This was a part time job that ended as soon as the tax season ended.  I improved my good neighbor skills as well as drive up revenue to the area locations.

good,"scheduling the tax preparers"
good,I answered phones & scheduled clients. I learned tax laws & how to help calm people who were waiting for their appointments to start & clients who were walk-ins that had to wait for long periods of time. The office management was very helpful & fair with the employees. The office worked well as a team to help get clients served. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the IRS. The most enjoyable  was being thanked by a client when I was able to assist them in finding out what was going on with the tax returns.
good,"I learned a lot from working here. I learned how to do taxes, the what, when, how, and why. I learned about exemptions in your taxes, I learned what you can and cannot claim. A typical day would be hectic if there were lots of people in to files taxes. Hardest is getting people to understand their taxes and rights about filing. What they can claim, who, etc... Easiest is just getting their information and inputting it into the system."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to meet the soldiers and their families. I learned how to prepare state tax returns for most of the states in the U.S. since soldiers are required to file a state return when they file their federal return. I learned something new each day.

good,"As a tax professional assistant on a daily basis I answered the multi-lined telephone, interviewed clients to obtain tax information, entered tax information to complete tax returns, processed payments as needed, and participated in marketing activites. The management was always encouraging the employees to take more classes and advance. All of my co-workers were friendly and fun to work with.

good,H&R is the type of place where you gain a lot of experience and is very flexible with your schedule. If you're looking to make a lot of money and advance this may not be the place for you.

good,"This job was a seasonal tax preparation work, a typical work starts a 4pm and ends at 9pm or until the last customer leave the office. A typical work day will depend on the time of the tax season, I could work for about five or six hours straight without taking a break or sometime hardly doing anything. The management was hands on and always pushing for each tax professionals to exceed their previous year productivity. My co-workers were accommodating,they look up to me for supervision and we work in a friendly environment. The hardest part of this job was dealing with customer who were not satisfied with their refund, they wanted more than what they were legally entitle to.

good,"A typical day was juggling several client needs of various advisors though my focus often on one client base. I learned to be patient and help a wide range of clients with varying personalities. The hardest part of the job, which was ultimately rewarding, was learning to get along with the various personalities of all the advisors. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients."
good,Nice friendly enviroment with plenty of customer interactaion. Management could use some improvement they seemed to be gone alot. The tax pros that I worked with were very nice and understanding. I enjoyed being able to speak with the clients on a personal level. I learned alot about taxes.

good,"Enjoy the fast pace focus on the client, the retail office, and the drive to exceed expectations each fiscal year."
good,This job is considered seasonal even if you work all year around. This job generally works with anyone's schedule. Must enjoy working with a wide variety of clients.

good,This was the perfect job at the time. Great if you just want to work seasonal  The training was sufficient.  The work environment and people were great.
good,"I have often learned something new in a typical day at work in the tax office.  The hardest part of the job in my first year was the apparent ability of clients to schedule their own appointments online with any available tax professional without answering all of the screening questions that would help to ensure an appropriate match of their tax situation complexity with the training level of the tax professional, resulting in many awkward moments for me when finding myself in over my head and needing lots of help to complete returns that were above my certification level and pay grade.  The situation seemed to improve by my second year, both because I had completed additional training and because there were fewer mismatches of client complexity with my current training level."
good,Overall a good place to work and build clientele for additional tax season income. Hourly pay is not great but commission structure compensates. They should consider reducing pricing on returns.
good,"good company to work with in relaxed enviornment with moderate pay scale "
good,"training, great with hours, family oriented, many offices to work at , and you  set your hours and times to work with the potential to make as much money as you want."
good,This company is all about educating their staff. They teach and ensure their employees can stand behind their work with confidence. Very positive energetic vibe.
good,Good place to work but corporate structure is not very conducive to promote loyalty. I liked the work I was doing within the office but my direct superior District Manager was not easy to deal with and was not helpful when needed.
good,"The best part of this company was the work culture. "
good,"Learn very much, very professional, honest and would love to go back and do the front desk again for a tax season. "
good,I enjoy working here for part time seasonal duties. You spend a few months studying for the Tax Pro test and then the season starts at the beginning of the year. Starts slow and by February it is very fast paced until the end of March when the season is really slowing down.
good,"The company requires continuing education each year. Changes in the tax environment globally has reduced benefits such as Employee Stock Option Programs and longevity gifts. Commission is based on years of employment, difficulty of tax returns and number of returns completed. With longevity, additional incentives are provided for returning clients. There is some pome push to meet goals. Access to online tax preparation software has significantly altered tax customer numbers.."
good,The hardest part of the job is some of the requirements of mundane items for Block. I truly enjoy the team I work with and my clients. Management from the top down often lacks in good communication.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Stressful during tax season. Most of us only get to work through tax season. Managers work the off season. The other tax preparers are great to work with. Team oriented.
good,"It was a good job. The majority of my co workers were all very nice and easy to get along with, as long as you followed the rules then it wasn't a bad job!"
good,I worked in Texas where there was no State taxes making my job alot easier. I met some great people that I am still friends with today. I would definitely do it again if I need the extra money.
good,"The increased amount of management turnover makes each year like starting new. Reputations and delivering outstanding results every year are not taken into account by the new management team. Also upper management is increasingly trending toward remote work locations making absentee management a serious flaw in the organizations commitment to its customers."
good,"If you love quick paced jobs and like working with numbers, computers, and the public you will love this job just like I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Job was OK.  Hours all over the spectrum.  Manager gone a lot. Office supplies not supplied in a timely manner.  Enjoyed client interaction and setting appointments.
good,It was temporary just for tax season but I made very good friends and management was excellent. I was pregnant at the time and they were extremely understanding about me needing to take time off for dr appointments etc. laid back easy job with great clientele. Very respectful employers
good,"I started my professional career with H&R Block and learnt most about tax returns. The work-life balance is great. However, the job security is minimal"
good,"Working face to face with customers, offering them coffee/water. Processing payments and restocking supplies. Management was sometimes unprofessional but also sometimes helpful. Just do the best job you can."
good,H and R block offers many classes to increase your certification level. You are able to choose the days and times that you are available to work It is a good seasonal position
good,"In both environments the tax professionals and CSPs get along well, the hours are flexible perfect for college students, clients are generally nice, and the environment isn't overly stressful."
good,"The job was good and you were able to work independently and make decisions on your own.  The office I worked in, there was one employee who always called in and you had to find a replacement which was usually me as there was only five but since it was hard to find tax preps, we tried to accommodate everyone."
good,"- Typical day at work: Come to the office, call the customers to arrange or confirm the appointment for tax return, doing some marketing activities; preparing tax returns..."
good,Working at HR Block was a great opportunity for me.  I had young children at home and it gave me the opportunity to work my own schedule and move up the ladder as I saw fit.  The training was adequate for the job but the experience working with clients was great.  Block provides a base from which to start a career as a tax practitioner for men and women who need a work life balance.
good,"As the Client Services Professional [CSP], receptionist, you are responsible for scheduling of most clients. Making sure the office and office equipment is cleaned, set-up and supplied for daily function.Also responsible for making sure all Tax Documents kept on site are Locked-up and secure before leaving. I did learn how to do ""Check Image"" Deposits and ""Tax Refund Credit Cards"", issued by"
good,There are great coworkers and the work environment is great as well. Daily I would learn something new about filing taxes which I was able to pass onto clients coming through our door.
good,This job is great if you have limited or specific hours that you can work. You set your availability. If you can work around your kids schedule the company will let you do that.
good,"My employment with this company gave me a chance to prove myself in exercising my know how with regards to taxation. "
good,It is an enjoyable place to work. Your coworkers become your family. Being a team player and helpful person is good for the job. Have to be a people person in order to do this job.
good,Enjoyed meeting new people. the environment was clean and safe. I did have a small issue with the way one co-worker spoke to me other wise the employer an other employees were wonderful to work with.
good,They charge their customers a lot while pay their workers less. Secondly there is no chance of making a long term career but go for tax practices to understand the government overview.
good,I loved working at H and R Block . Co workers were great. The overall atmosphere was wonderful. Customers were great too. Hope I get work work here again next season.
good,"Doing tax returns,callin.g clients to to remind them of there appt.,enter acting with co-workers,able to get along with my manager.We are always learning new things everyday.The workplace is a happy and enjoyable place to be with my co-workers helping out when needed. The hardests part is getting clients to come in,pay their fees and making sure clients leave satified with our work."
good,I work with a great team. I strive to learn something new every day and they are more than willing to help me accomplish that goal. The company (maybe just OM) seems a bit disorganized when it comes to implementing some programs. The one thing I think needs to be stressed a little more is office etiquette.
good,Love meting the different clients on a every day basic !! Doing all types of returns and helping people in different tax situations !!! Learning the new tax laws are also interesting
good,"Provide service to clients by helping them file their tax returns and educate them about their tax situation."
good,This is the absolute best part time job.  However they have same performance requirements of part time employees as they have for full time employees.
good,The position was seasonal . Work at your owned pace.   Management was great. Work place culture open variety. Most enjoyable part the end of the season.
good,I am preparing taxes in order to gain experience in the accounting field and I believe this is a great way to do that. But nobody likes to owe the government money and this is where the job gets difficult.  The most enjoyable part of my day is all the amazing customers I get to meet!
good,"Being that H&R Block is an office environment, it was beneficial for me as a 17-year-old, to become exposed to entry-level clerical duties. A typical day at work was similar to what you can expect at a busy high-paced office, where there was ""cold calling"", dealing with clients on the phone, in the office, or managing appointments, I was constantly busy. Management and other employees were eager to assist beginners in the everyday tasks that our job required. the hardest part of the job was maintaining myself organized while also assisting a high volume of clientele.  I enjoyed the comfort within myself and former employees. After working at H&R Block I gained meaningful connections."
good,"Over all, working for Block was a good learning experience.  I appreciated the opportunity to help tax payers keep more of their hard earned money.  I looked forward to work everyday."
good,Went from front desk to being a tax preparer. Worked in 2 different states for this company. Different environments with different owners. Fast paced during peak and relaxed off peak times.
good,Since the first interview i have attended needed classes to be able to perform the work desire. the environment in the company is very friendly everyone is always willing to help.
good,They provide training and a lot of options to move forward with the career through the company or in the field that you can take with you. You are able to change careers within the company and explore different jobs to find the one that works best for you.
good,"At HR Block, there is opportunity to advance. Structured programs to enhance skills. Training and development classes very helpful. Some managers are willing to help to the max"
good,The office was a very competitive environment. There was fun working as a team member as well as the customers.  Working with the customers to feel comfortable while processing their information.
good,Relaxed atmosphere except when extremely busy.  I get complete satisfaction when one of my clients leaves the office with a sense of relief and satisfaction that they have the peace of mind things were performed correctly.
good,It could pay more and offer more benefits but the people and work atmosphere was excellent. They help if you need it and do have paid classes to further your career with them. I loved the people I worked with and the job.
good,"prepared tax returns"
good,"When an opener, prepare cash drawer and check schedule."
good,"Challenging career great to keep you on your toes.  Teaches about H&R procedures as well as the IRS and its many responsibilities ."
good,"It is a fast-paced work environment, which requires diplomacy, conflict resolution, multi-tasking, ability to work with databases, good with numbers, excellent customer service and team work."
good,Assist tax experts with scheduling appointments.  Call customers to schedule new tax appointments. Prepare and ail out tax documents. File documents and needed.
good,"face paced, busy and exciting place to work"
good,"While H&R Block is a great place to get experience, is is seasonal work, and therefore cannot provide me with a steady annual cash flow.  I have learned so much from working there though, and I would consider continuing to work there on weekends if my schedule allowed me to."
good,Working for H&R Block had taught me preparing taxes. Did not know anything about it. i have completed 12 years and love evey minute of it. Not saying it was all good dealing with clients. Always a satisfaction to see the relief on Client's face at end of preparing their tax return.
good,"It is a good workplace to learn, gain experience. Managers are helpful. The culture is like a family, you feel involved in every aspect of company's life. The only disadvantage is low wages."
good,"Opening get all desk sit up for the day. Make coffee and anything opening, payment, check schedule for the day appointment. Answering phone, help clients anyway possible. filing at end of day, keep office clean. make calls to set up appointments. End of day reports. Data entry if needed. When I first started at HR Block in Texas  I payroll and assistant to Manager. Staying busy and on top of things and making sure clients are treated like I like to be treated. Love the clients want them to be happy when leave the office. Hardest part is sometimes clients very unhappy and they really don't understand the taxes. So if can reverse how they feel before they leave then I have done my job for the day."
good,"I enjoyed it for the most part, I could’ve had better management but other than that it was a great experience. We weren’t given very much on the job training, but it was easy to catch on for the most part."
good,A fun and rewarding experience.  Learn different taxes scenario.  Enjoyed helping customers with different tax questions.  Would recommend H&R to everyone who pays Federal Taxes and or State Taxes.
good,learned the practical part of doing taxes with individuals and it was interesting. they used their own tax soft ware package. I liked working their parttime
good,A typical day at peak in the District Office in Rochester was fast paced. What I learned is how to analyze each tax situation and come up with the best solution for the tax payer.
good,"Lots of customer service encounters,computer skills and training courses available. great team work is a plus communication is required to succeed to best ability"
good,"It's great for learning taxes. But, you are expected to sell their products and it appears the company puts that over becoming a good tax preparer.  I did not know I was expected to be a salesman.  Decided not to continue working there.  A friend works for H&R Block (not in the same area I worked) and gave good recommendation as a work place.  But tax preparers in the area I worked were not friendly, did not want to help me at times, and management was rigid.  Very competitive work environment."
good,A typical work day during peak season is hectic and you will be swamped with clients and calls and last minute clients.  The office once you are in the trenches is a family as long as you have coworkers who put clients needs first. Be flexiable as rules and procedures change every year.
good,Each office has a different atmosphere geared toward the client base. Although company policies are the same the office cultures are all different.  Teamwork is key to running a successful office.
good,My experience has been excellent with HR Block and would recommend to someone looking to make extra money.  If you like numbers and are good with people this is a great job experience.
good,care about clients.cant say much more than this cant say much more or less than this  what would you like me to say except for the facts just the facts
good,I enjoyed all of the people that I worked with at H&R Block. I was able to learn and a lot and was given the opportunity to advance. The managers were always helpful and encouraged everyone. The only thing I disliked was the pay.
good,"Work is very interesting; clients for the most part are great. There can be downtime when there are no clients. Pay is not very good for the expertise and hours worked."
good,"Offer training, assistants while helping clients and the review work before releasing it. "
good,Excellent place to work customer satisfaction financial assist along with tax services. Management great. District managers was great. Overall the company is a great place to work.
good,enjoyed being able to serve customers and help solve problems. fast paced environment and busy tax season.  team work can be hard with cut throat players.
good,"I liked working at H&R Block, Your co-workers become part of your family. The company offers developmental training for tax pros every year so they can keep improving their tax knowledge. They renew your license every year and they also pay for your bond. But the pay is minimum wage and you don't get paid commissions until your second season of work is complete. It can be very competitive among employees who receive commissions, and this can create major animosity in the office. They promote from within if you would like to be an office leader, or operations administrator but they won't consider employees for any other position. The pay also goes with the position but even in the managerial position the pay is not equal."
good,"This position has a potential for career advancement. With the unlimited amount of training and classes, the employee has the potential to get promoted fast."
good,Working here was awesome. I met a lot of people from different walks of life. Everyone is very helpful whenever you are in need of assistance and the environment is calm.
good,Fast paced work area. Can be stressful and has the ability to run into situations that will require research and assistance from others. Enjoy assisting people and helping them learn about their situations.
good,"Personalized and  value service is what makes H&R Block a good company. You really focus on the client and spend time to get the maximum legally possible on the tax preparation process."
good,"Typical day is planning out your week, being on conference calls and checking emails daily.  I learned how to be a better leader and use my current skills to perform my job."
good,"My job is check customer and take phone call and cashier out customer. Have work as tax assistant so i will help customer with federal and tax, tax return."
good,I do my job cause it makes me happy to help my clients. They get ta good understanding on how the IRS works. Plus I treat my clients as family and it keeps them coming back every year.
good,"Working with H&R Block was fun. I learned a lot about tax laws and how they affect me. I also learned to use their software to prepare simple and long form tax returns for a variety of clients."
good,"The best part about working here, was that the days would go by fast as it was always so busy.  A day of work would consist on filing legal documents, take payments for tax services."
good,Seasonal related work.  Enjoyed with the clients and the tax professionals.  Good work environment and training was provided to ensure proficiency with related job skills.
good,"Working with clients and staff.  Learning tax law and keeping up with the latest in tax law. Advancement is based on individual time, dedication and willingness to learn more and achieve higher skills."
good,"As a tax professional, learning and updating tax knowledge takes more than 100 hours a year. Enjoyed working with my team and fellow managers.  I enjoyed helping clients understand their tax situations."
good,"Punch in and make sure the office is suitable for clients."
good,"Good company with min change. Fast pace during the tax season and great clients.  Flexible hours for non management employees. Overall, the company is good to work for."
good,I was the main supervisor and preparer of tax returns.  HR Block is a seasonal employer with limited part time after tax season.  I like working with tax clients and assisting them with their returns and other tax questions.
good,"I enjoyed working with H&R Block. It was seasonal for the most part, so I took the full time year round job with New Horizons Wellness Center. For someone willing to work hard, there is room for advancement."
good,Love the job! Co-workers are great! Very knowledgeable and supportive.
good,"Great set of clients who appreciate our work. "
good,"We work daily with one to ten clients. Work is seasonal. We receive hourly compensation and a small bonus after the season is over. The bonus is dependent on number of clients, hours worked and status as a preparer. We participate in 18-30 hours of training annually."
good,great place to work. Hours were on temporary. It was fun meeting the customers and making sure their wait time was comfortable. Had alot of good workers
good,I was low one the totem pole with a lot of responsibility. Had to make sure people had appointments and got messages so they could do their jobs. There was only me for my job so i received many hours which I enjoyed and helped to pay the bills.
good,I enjoyed working at HR because you always meet new people and you have a chance to use your good customer service experience and be helpful to numerous people.
good,The receptionist position was an easy job.  The only stressful times were when there were several people trying to sign in as well as people trying to pay and leave.
good,"Everyone who worked there when I did helped everyone else, regardless of what it was. Never did I hear a co-worker say ""that's not my job"". That does not mean that they didn't really want to help. They just did it. It was beneficial to help out."
good,"Worked with good people. Was able to work as many hours as I wanted during tax season. It is a seasonal job so I only worked during tax season. Able to do my own taxes for free, which was a plus. Management was decent."
good,"Schedule can change moment to moment, depending on the needs of the office(s). Must work outside of working hours to market to new clients. Otherwise very positive environment."
good,"H&R Block is a great company to get your feet wet with! Basic office operations, financial info, management experience, self management, limited advancement opportunity's."
good,"Pay gets less each year, but its a good part year gig to earn some extra cash.  Advancement opportunities are there and they make available to employees classes quite cheaply.  You can become an Enrolled agent with the company with very little out of pocket expenses.  Getting them to pay you like one is another story."
good,"Fast paced and changing.  Learned a good skill, Good management. Pay was not good and it is mostly seasonal then you are laid off. It was nice to help people."
good,People in H&R Block are very nice. They have a teamwork environment and we helped each other. It's very busy during March and April. Hope can raise the salary a little bit.
good,"The majority of the tax returns prepared are for individuals. The office manager is great, it is a conducive environment to learn, and employs helpful co-workers."
good,"I love the work at H&R block, it had made me fall in love with admin assistant work. However, the pay is below average and if you ask for more hours they cut what you already have. One week I would work 40 then this week I worked 7."
good,I enjoyed working for H&R block. The people are good to work for. This job as receptionist is part time work. The hours you want to work they are very adaptable to your sechedule.
good,it was a high thriving culture and celebrated wins for each sales team.  Lots of competition with events to win some trips and perks from hitting quotas.
good,Worked here as a customer service representative during tax season. The atmosphere here was great and time went by fast because the location I worked in was pretty busy most of the time. The people I worked with was great and I was ablate learn more about taxes during my time there.
good,it was an okay job with friendly people but it is not easy because it is always just a seasonal job that has to be applied for every year as a tax professional
good,"Sometimes early in the year it's slow, and you do nothing all day. Other days it's non stop headaches. If you know tax preparation well enough it's not a hard job. Also some offices are better to work in than others, just depends. I have heard horror stories about bad managers, but my store manager was the literal best, upper management that you don't normally see just care about numbers, and those numbers being better than last year. I think H&R blocks pricing per form is a little difficult to work with. Had to tell a homeless man it'd cost $300 to do his return, he walked out obviously. Still I think the work culture is better than most CPA firms I've been with."
good,"Have not been there long enough to form a proper review.  Historically, they have provided full and competent services to the general public for many decades.  The clients that come through the door leave satisfied and refer others to our services."
good,A good place to work if you are a student or need part time work. They only really keep receptionist during their busy season so be prepared for an hours cut during off season. Very nice people though and the flexibility can't be beat.
good,once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy. There is plenty of support from the office to find solutions to difficult tax questions. the slow part of the season is very relaxed.
good,The workplace culture at HR block was very pleasant. Everybody was always willing to help the clients and the co-workers. I had clients come to me with questions I didn't know and referred them to the appropriate tax professional in order to fulfill the clients needs.
good,Not much room for advancing but a good way to get your foot in the door for tax preparation. Able to make your own appointments and allow for as much time per tax return as needed
good,"Extremely Fast paced atmosphere, which is nice to stay busy while at work. Nice challenge to keep up with the work load. Was not a placed which is boring. Office nice and up beat."
good,My first year as a tax preparer was stressful in the beginning  but after few days I realized it was not that bad. Helping clients was challenging but fun at the same time.
good,If you're looking for a seasonal job then this is the one! It only lasts from January to April but it is somewhat easy and flexible. The only downside is minimum wage and no benefits. But great people!
good,The day is determined according to the business. one can learn a lot during the process of preparation.the workplace culture is overwhelming.the hardest part of the job is getting customer for the first time. The most enjoyable part is doing a research to complete the return.
good,"H&R Block Tax & Business Office is no longer in business.  They were sold.  All employees have moved to other businesses   I learned a lot, enjoyed the people & work environment"
good,"Enjoyed the office and personnel."
good,"It was a seasonal job with a good environment and with a very professional team that made every day easy and with a team work culture. "
good,"I have learned a lot, you are given the opportunity to learn. Manger is great. It is a very multicultural work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are given the opportunity to market and become an advocate for the company. Meet great people and very resourceful people and a lot of networking."
good,"My position is a seasonal position. I prefer a full-time position with benefits like retirement, paid health insurance and sick leave."
good,"Good place to work, flexible hours, great staff to work with, tax professionals are very knowledgeable in tax laws  and finding all deductibles available for each client"
good,This is a seasonal job.  It was so much fun to interview people.  Interviewing is the best part of the job.  To meet all kinds of different people is makes the job interesting and makes you feel good.  To help these people is right up my alley.
good,I enjoy working a seasonal position at H&R Block. There is room for advancement if someone wants to grow with this company. There is annual recertification class which helps you keep up with annual updates. There are friendly workers who have been there for years who will assist you with any questions. The repeat customers let you know you are doing your job correctly and to that they trust your work.
good,Great place to work but no benefits. Laid back and a great work culture. My manager is awesome and always there to lend a helping hand. Great location
good,"H & R Block train their employees well and there is opportunity for advancement. I idea of choosing ones own schedule makes it a plus. Block is well respected."
good,"I love my job,  it's beneficial in education, learning experience, and  advancing in rank.   It's a nice working environment that brings all employees together helping each other in need.  Of course in every job there's pros and cons. But in this particular field it benefits you in understanding the laws and taxes and things that could help you with your personal affairs. Helping clients not just with their taxes but with information that they did not  brings you satisfaction at work motivating you to come in every day."
good,"Some days are okay and then there are some days that are more stressful than others. The management changes often, whenever things are not going well for the company."
good,Very flexible schedules.  I made my own schedule.  The office manager was amazing.  Staff was great and the work environment was safe and enjoyable.  Working here was fun.
good,"Buen entrenamiento en Teoría de Impuestos, Prácticas y recursos para estar preparado para atender al público.  Debido al campo que se dedica no puede proveer trabajo a tiempo completo durante todo el año a los empleados."
good,"I like this type of work and I enjoy helping the clients, many who I see every year.  It is a commission based position.  I enjoy many of the people who share my office."
good,The job was seasonal and they hired seasonal and the pay was a good for the most part. You know that you were getting seasonal work and was done the end of April/first part of May.
good,"Doing taxes can be very stressful for most people including myself."
good,"My manager allowed for a very flexible schedule. Co-workers were very supportive, and always willing to help. We often discussed the tax code, and how it applied to specific situations. I learned something every day! However I don't feel that the pay is competitive."
good,First day of tax season is very calm and relaxing as for the last day of the season people are coming in at the last minute it can be very stressful and hectic.
good,I like working for H R Block. I work for the company every tax season since 2009 to the present. Hope to work with them for many years to come. I love helping people .
good,H &R Block has an  excellent training programs and it is helpful. Managers are engaged in working process. Working schedules are very flexible. It is good environment to learn something new every day.
good,"Relaxed astmosphere, flexible schedules and good working enviroment. The managers are very reasonable and easy to get along with. The best part of my day is opening the office, you never know what the next day will bring. I don't feel any pressure and find it quite enjoyable. I enjoy helping people. Especially people who are in need and stressed. I take this job personally. Block Advisors know's how to do taxes and do them right!"
good,"A typical work day starts at 8am or 9am for most and durning peak it is full speed until 9pm or later. You serve clients tax needs answer questions, input personal data, and recieve and all other general office duties. Management is usually there for any needed support, our office usually has great team work and work well together. The hardest part of this job would be the long hours after several days you can get really tired, but no slowing down for at least two or three weeks. My Most enjoyable part of my job is helping my clients, each client has an indivual concern or need and knowing that I put them at ease before they leave is an accomplishment."
good,H and R block was fun to work for because I like doing taxes.  The people are nice and the managers are easy to work for. I would recommend H & R block.
good,"The environment is very friendly, and co-workers including supervisors are always willing to help, to develop your knowledge."
good,"Meet and greet customers, give them any tax advice as needed and file their taxes.  Many people are friendly and wonderful.  Others make you feel like you aren't really part of the team just a number."
good,If you can not handle daily work stress and deadlines H & R Block is not the place for you to work. You will deal with a variety of clients both good and bad.
good,"All day I would prepare taxes for clients as they walked in. "
good,"The work environment was decent, flexible work schedule they work around your schedule. Most of the time easy going, see at least three taxpayers a day."
good,"gain a basic understanding of the tax world"
good,"The Internal Revenue code is approaching 100,000 pages, changing and growing every year, so you are constantly learning at "
good,very indepth with training staff how to properly and safely execute their duties. they seem to genuinely care for their employees and their well being.
good,Great place to learn about the tax system and get to help people save on tax dollars and fantastic programs for the workers to improve in their tax knowledge.
good,a typical day at work is easy and fun. enjoy the opportunity to assist others with want they need. Learn a lot about costumer service. Management is good and the hardest part of the job is when April comes and the season is over.
good,"I was responsible for communicating with the clients who were customers of H&R Block.  I set appointments and took payments.  The atmosphere was not so quiet, yet not loud.  The hardest part was telling customers that their funds were not available."
good,"flexible hours, friendly workplace, very repetitive. good for when busy but can become very slow when it isn't peak hours. overall, great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed the work it was challenging, just did not like the pay or hours. Only work 4 months out of year with no pay after those months. The franchise I work for does not have good work environment. A lot of stress no matter how good a job you do from employees and clients."
good,"I enjoyed working here but the compensation was a bit low. I liked the manager and team. Since most people are seasonal I assume that is why it can sometime feel like people just come in, do the job and leave. Not much interaction with each other."
good,"HR Block is a service job allowing the opportunity to work with the public and problem solve. You can have a flexible schedule and work seasonally, however the pay is terrible. Other than that, It is a good, clean place to work."
good,"The center we worked at is great. The people above us, not so much. Bad hour setting, last minute surprises, cut hours and early furlough for the entire team."
good,"The employees and managers are great. Everyone gets along and are capable of learning from one another. The company focuses on employees leveling up each year in order for the employees to keep same hourly wages, if not your pay will go down."
good,"This was a great part-time job for me to earn extra income. Daily job tasks as receptionist required attention to detail, but were not overly difficult. Excellent and fun employee atmosphere"
good,Dealing up close with clients on a daily basis. Continuously educating yourself on new laws and changes to the tax laws. Co workers are always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,"Seasonal work I wanted full time ; I had different managers every year I worked during tax season."
good,"Met a lot of different people and this is where I got my start in taxes and how they are done. I loved the fact that I got to see how things were done and how exactly the Government works. I helped to be sure that the office was run smoothly, so I became the Office Manager. It made me feel important and I made sure that it ran smoothly."
good,"This company only hires seasonally. It is a temporary job, with minimum wages. Very competitive atmosphere. Major marketing to build book of business."
good,H&R Block is a great place to work very flexible schedule and OK pay.i just had horrible DMG that had no communicate skills once so ever.if you get into a H&R block with good management your in a place to work
good,The staff and manager were friendly and created a pleasant work environment.  My only complaint was the salary.  They pay is not very good!  It was fun meeting all the different clients.
good,HR Block exclusively trains their recruits and ensures that they are certified to prepare taxes. There is a hierarchy of skilled employees that receive assignments based on skillset and familiar status. New recruits will receive less clients than veteran employees.
good,The Franchise was a great place to meet people and provided a friendly work environment. I learned valuable tax preparation tools to keep for the future.
good,The way that management is paid is not the same and very unfair at times.  Some are salary and expected to work the same amount as others while no overtime is paid and others are paid overtime and bonuses are not paid the same.
good,It was nice to work for them because they were pretty flexible with my hours. I'm a full time student so that was very important. Also co workers are great.
good,"I enjoyed being the manager and I also enjoyed writing tax returns in the years previous to becoming a supervisor. The hardest part of the job was that I supervised 2 different offices and one was laid back and took care of each other, where the other was cutthroat and busy at all times and always fast paced and some of the tax pros were not too nice."
good,"Wish it was more than just seasonal."
good,"I have enjoyed working at H&R Block. Customer service is important as well as keeping the front office organized and efficient.  My team leader was one of the best people I have worked with in many years."
good,This job was only seasonal for me but in the short time I was there the staff were all very friendly and courteous even though I was only a temp. The hours were very flexible and the pay was good for what I did.
good,"H&R Block is a good place to learn preparing canadian tax. It was first canadian job in which I held office."
good,I enjoyed this job. It was a seasonal job but I had to go through training and get certified to become a tax associate. I enjoyed working with the public. I filed personal taxes.  I didn't  like that my schedule was flexible. There was no set schedule
good,A typical day starts with reviewing scheduled clients for the day and anticipating walk-in clients. It is nice meeting people and helping them with their life concerns and helping them prepare for the future.
good,"At H&R Block while helping with client walk-ins and the phones. Not to mention the tax pros needing files, payments, and having questions, can make for a very busy day. Working as a receptionist, I am responsible for very many different things in the office, including helping the tax pros with their schedule as they may need to work at their other jobs more hours or just not able to come into work for other reasons."
good,"If you want to do nothing but seasonal work this company is for you! They treat their seasonal employees very well. It is hard to get healthcare, but you can get 401K after so many hours."
good,"Clock in , Get the coffee going. Call to confirm appointments, Chat with fellow employees or help with finding folders for incoming clients. The Franchise owner is very flexible when it comes to our children being sick, she aint to hard on us but she is serious about her work and our jobs so that's a plus."
good,"The flexibility of the work schedule is great. When I had my husband to fall back on financially it worked with raising a family. "
good,Learned a lot from current tax pros in a fun atmosphere.  Work life balance is great and management always willing to listen.  Makes me want to come back next tax season
good,The enjoyable part is seeing people please when they leave because we helped them get refunds some did not expect. We always try to put the client first.  Many have been using HR Block for years. Its hard seeing people not getting anything back.
good,"I have been blessed to work with a great group of people who are dedicated to achieving customer service excellence. Its a superb place to grow and learn how to do different types of tax returns."
good,Work this job along with running my own store. They worked with my on my hours between both jobs. I worked a lot of hours at both jobs but H and R Block never gave me a problem with the hours.
good,"I currently work the day shift during the week. Typical day consists of coming in, making coffee, and attending to any assignments your manager may give me. It's an incredibly easy job, my main responsibilities are to schedule appointments when clients call the office, and also to confirm appointments that are already in the calendar. Closing duties consist of emptying the coffee, emptying the garbage, and making sure the storefront maintains a clean appearance. My manager is very good, although H&R Block itself doesn't really have it together. My manager encounter numerous problems where she would schedule her workers for one thing, and corporate would overwrite her schedule and it really complicated things for both my manager and my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with the public, you meet some very nice people. Really isn't a hard job."
good,"Co-workers are nice, Tax Pros seem to be nice also (the ones I've met). Can get busy and hectic, especially during tax season."

good,"Enjoyed working with a team."
good,perfect part time job. You set your own schedule. Great job for college students. only downside is that you are required to take a 2 month break every year and its unpaid.
good,I like numbers and helping people. I enjoy explaining to customers their tax year and the reason that they are getting a refund or no refund. The challenging part is telling someone that they owe the IRS. The awesome benefit is that tax season is only seasonal.
good,Always room to move up within the company. Learned quite a bit about a typical office job being a receptionist. Learned more about the tax world. Great set of diverse co-workers.
good,"Come in clock in and get started o tax returns, answer phone if need to. I'm always learning something new from my co-workers and my manager. I really like her she's really good.  The hardest part of my job is giving people bad news and working on Sundays."

good,"H&R Block is great. I just need more constant work, and H&R Block works in seasons.. with large gaps between seasons."
good,Would reccommend for people who are looking for some extra cash throughout the year. This is a seasonal position. Loved working as a CSP but after seeing everything in the office I can now take the tax course to become a tax professional.
good,"Great team.  The seniors tax specialists are willing to share their knowledge with the new tax specialists. "
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work with the right management team. Mine was great!  They empowered me to do my job and  learn daily. Learning and development was a must and meeting our personal as well as professional goals too.  We strived every day to do the right thing for our customers. My immediate team of 11 was an extended family.  We had a relaxed atmosphere and casual work attire."
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work to gain tax knowledge both federal and local laws"
good,"My job is seldom the same from day to day.  I work for a wonderful boss that treats me like an adult and we work well together.   I enjoy dealing with the vendors, creating processes and forms that turn out to be very useful."
good,Learned a lot from HRBlock. Started off as receptionist and went to full-time Tax preparer. If you like people and doing taxes good place to work.
good,"Focus on client retention."
good,"A typical work day is either crazy busy, or so slow it seems like it takes years to get through it. I have learned a lot about tax law and tax preparation while I have been employed here. My co-workers are amazing, and management is great too! "
good,"Good job, it's a seasonal position. The job has very low hours and pay is not that high. But fairly easy job."
good,I have no words that I want to share about this company but would rather the star rating speak for itself. Long hours everyday of the week.
good,I enjoy working with the people and customers. The job is flexible and hours are part-time. I answer calls from 5pm-9pm while file papers in between calls. Also check to see if taxes have been received by the State and Federal.
good,This position was exciting working with the communities at the different locations. I was the go-to person for this company. I ensure the preparers that clients have all the information needed to prepare taxes.
good,"Always interested to interact with others. I did worked for 4 seasons with H&R Blockand always have fun to come back. Sometime stressfull but still, i like helping people as much i can"
good,"Learned an enormous amount---how office workers apply their knowledge of the duties assigned, getting along with others, multi-tasking at one time, organizational skills acquired."

good,"enjoy working with the public, assisting in federal and state tax forms while adhering to state and federal guidelines."
good,Here at H&R Block you really get to show how great you are at you job.  There was always recognition to those associates who really went above and beyond on their job.  Here I really got to put my education to work and make a difference in the district.  I still have many great relationships with the team members.
good,"Greeting customers, who would like their taxes prepared immediately."
good,"Preparing taxes for people, doing calls on previous customers, sometimes doing marketing for the company, very nice coworkers with a lot experience doing taxes.  It was a great experience learning about taxes in the United States."
good,"This was a seasonal job, only worked part time after my full time job, enjoyed the work and plan to return next tax season."
good,"Enjoy what I do, I am able to have Summers off with my children, flexible hours. Co-workers in my office are also enjoyable. Endless learning possibilities."
good,"Management is understandable and organized."
good,My day at H&R Block was always a challenging day for me because I dealt with different kind of nationalities also I learned a lot there.
good,Constantly learning new things. You must be up to date with new tax laws to provide the best service to your clients. The only drawback was it was not year round.
good,"Co-workers are awesome.  Very helpful."
good,"Being a receptionist at H&R Block was a great experience. The pay was fine for the work, the management was good, and I learned a lot. I would've liked to stay longer, but the tax season ended."
good,"During the tax season it is fun, but in the off season not much work to maintain a lifestyle. It is ideal for college student because it is very flexible hours."
good,"Answering phones. Distribute Tax checks to customers."
good,"H&R Block is a quality organization that engages my personal strengths of utilizing financial expertise/analyis to assist others in understanding their financial position, grow their understanding about taxes, and if/as needed, suggesting methods to improve their fiscal stability.    H&R Block provides continual educational opportunities and incentive to increase our tax knowledge.   The team environment is a major benefit.  Tax professionals willingly  transfer knowledge among colleagues so we all become stronger in supporting our clients with high accuracy of tax returns and tax planning.  District management is challenging and supportive.  They provide clear goals and suggestions to enable us to meet expecations.  Most enjoyable is the building a client base that does not dread tax season since we're available year round.  It's rewarding as they count on seeing us the next years ahead."
good,I have enjoyed working with this company for the last 4 years. We are only open 4 months out of the year and during this time we are very busy. This is a small town and it felt good that I and my co workers are trusted with their most private information. The hardest part of this job was seeing people who despreatly needing money only to find out they arent getting it or they owe. This year was especially hard because of the new Obamacare laws. The worst part about this year was also the management. We had two new tax pros this year and our manager was not there for them. So it made for tension in the office.
good,"The office environments that I have worked in at H&R Block are calm, helpful, and productive. It is a great place to work and you receive the help and training you need."
good,H&R Block is very flexible with your personal life schedule.  Managegement is Great!  Lack of Benefits and only Seasonal.
good,I work at 8 W. Pine in Lodi and it is the best place to work. We are a family that helps each other. The best part of my job is working with people from all walks of life.
good,H&R Block was a short term position but enjoyable.  I worked very well with all other employees and enjoyed my term of employment there.
good,"Come in an hour early on my own time to prepare for the day."
good,It was a great job I enjoyed working with my clients. I learned how to be a good productive manager and help my coworkers with their questions.
good,"Meeting and assisting clients to their best outcome, reducing their stress levels, and providing the structure and a input to make their planning better."
good,"The workplace was productive and fast paced.  Co-workers were all pleasant and fun to work with.  I learned how to balance work and life.  Most days were long, but clients were patient and understanding."
good,"Hectic at end of tax season,but most everyone was patient and willing to work together for the good of the customer. All in all, an enjoyable learning experience. They were very flexible in allowing me to work as much time as I wanted."
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to answer the phone by the second ring when the phone was ringing non-stop, while trying to set up multiple appts. My co workers usually always had a smile no matter what their day was like. This is absolutely my favoritist job so far."
good,I love working at H&R Block. I work with some of the best people I have ever met They were very accommodating to mine and my families schedule. We were a team who became family.
good,"Normally a typical day would include logging into my computer, pulling up my tools and taking inbound calls until my shift is over. The hardest part of the job may be defusing the client's, because majority of our calls are escalated. The most enjoyable part would be the research part. Finding a solution for the client and helping them in some way if any."
good,"I really enjoy my job at H&R Block. Every day I get to meet new people and learn about their lives and their careers.  And everyday brings new challenges. Every tax situation is unique and the scenarios range from the most basic to very complex tax returns. The job culture is awesome as long as you have a good store manager.  For the most part, all of my colleagues are highly educated and great to work with. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers.  H&R Block provides its associates amazing training. There is no limit to how much you can learn about tax. If you are motivated, you will advance quickly and gain the knowledge to prepare not just personal returns, but business returns as well. There are probably 2 things I don't like about H&R Block. The first is that I feel under compensated for the services I provide,  especially when taking into account  the hours I spend at home studying tax law.  The second thing is dealing with the corporate mentality."
good,"If you like numbers and want to learn to do taxes. Then come to "
good,"It is a great office environment. But as a second job it is kind of stressful managing a regular job and being a tax pro. some days it would be full of people and you wouldn't see the end, others relaxed. Management was good, but difficult at times. It ended up being to much for too little so i stuck with my primary job."
good,"I learned how to work the scheduling system, how to handle cash and how to do tax returns as well as answering the phones. I had wonderful coworkers who easily welcomed me into the office and the management was very understanding and helpful when it came to teaching me all my job tasks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with clients who would come in angry about something our office had no power over and I had no way to help them resolve the issue. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we had slower days and I was able to take my time organizing the office and filing paperwork."
good,"My boss was great, real nice and flexible. He always made sure we had what we needed in order to work. My co-workers were great to work with as well, very kind and outgoing. He would gives a break and helped us out when we couldn't figure out what to do."
good,"Preparing tax returns, setting appointments, answering  phones"
good,A typical day at work involves dealing with clients to complete their tax returns and answer their questions.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with client complaints because it is not always pleasant but fortunately it does not happen that often.  The most enjoyable part is continuously learning new concepts.  Tax laws are always changing and there are many new aspects to learn.  We have a great training department on staff and everyone is pleasant to deal with.
good,A typical day at work for me started with turning on the computers and counting the cash in the register. I learned to multitask and focus on what tasks needed to be completed first. My co-workers weren't the best to work with but I managed to get through the day with a smile on my face no matter what happened. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude/angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment that I got from completing the tasks that weren't asked of me.
good,"Very little boredom."
good,H & R Block was an awesome part-time job.  The tax preparers and financial advisors were great.  Management was knowledgeable and welcoming.  The clients were courteous and honest.  I enjoyed preparing taxes.  I would have still been working there every tax season if I had not returned to school.
good,As the District Employment Assistant I was in charge of all the development and hiring of new and returning tax professionals.  I had to make sure that everyone met the hiring requirements as far as continuing education and training.  I was responsible for moving all online applications forward to the next step as well as setting interview appointments.  I also conducted job interviews for tax professionals along with a panel of office managers. I conducted interviews to hire receptionists for the tax offices.  I also had to verify employment eligibility documents per Homeland Security requirements for all personnel hired. Once tax professionals were hired I had to enter job titles and salary information into the automated hiring process system at the direction of the District Manager.  The hardest part of the job was to make sure everyone met their requirements by the deadline of October 31st.  The easiest part of the job was building relationships with all of the associates who worked for the company.
good,For a seasonal job its all good.  Managements lets you come up with you're own work schedule.  But before hand you of course have to go through the training and pass the course in order to become a tax preparer both federal and state (if it applies).
good,Very stressful during tax time but all the employees were willing to help each other out.
good,Going to work was always a joy. I learned several things over my period of employment. The management team consist of very caring and fun individuals. The hardest part of my job was upset clients. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the clients that came into the office.
good,"loved working for H&R Block. Gained a lot of experience, staff was friendly and very welcoming and open to new ideas."
good,"each offtce run a little differently -worked at a few of H&Rs offices,"
good,"This is a seasonable job, December to April 15. H & R Block offers a large scale of on-job training on fiscal code and also for client relations. "
good,"Great place for seasonal work, easy and relaxed work place.  Taught and managed well."
good,"My day typically involves client service/satisfaction, based on their tax situation.  It is my responsibility to make sure they get the maximum refund/lowest tax liability.  I work on a computerized system and have to be competent of 3 different applications.  There are all levels of experienced professionals in my office, but as the most senior person here, most of them look to me for guidance and procedures.  Unfortunately there is usually a lot of staff turnover and you are never sure who you will be working with/for in the next season.  The hardest part of the job is knowing your tax knowledge and having to explain to young clients that they have a balance owing to the CRA.  The best part of the job is getting to meet so many different people on a daily basis and when you can find them more of a tax refund than they thought they would get."
good,"Typical is not a word we use to describe a day at work. Each day brings new situations and opportunities. The business of tax preparation is focused and also enjoyable. "
good,"Great place to learn and help others understand taxes"
good,I enjoyed working here and my manager was amazing. My co-workers were friendly.
good,"Every day is different, some days are quiet while others are very busy. Every day you do taxes you will learn something new because no two returns are the same. I have a great manager and absolutely the best co-workers. The hardest part of the job is having to tell a client they owe especially when they thought they were going to get a big return. The best is when you get to tell someone they are getting a big return."
good,"Some of my duties are day to day operations including setting appointments, preparing taxes and end of day procedures.  Other responsibilities are monitoring employee performances, scheduling, resolve any client conflicts and ensuring goals are met by employees.  I also have the challenge to grow business by local marketing and promotions."
good,"•	Assisted clients with maximizing annual tax returns through efficient communication and in-depth analysis. "
good,"Everyday was pretty much straight forward but during the busy season it could be chaotic at times.  Trainers were really good and fun to be around which made the environment pleasant."
good,"Because this business is mostly seasonal they are amenable to accommodating your individual hours of availability and work the office schedule around that.  Some flexibility on your part is required but it mostly works out well."
good,"I prepared personal taxes for clients.  Worked within a cubicle.  Greet clients, escort to work area.  interview clients for possible needs within tax forms.  Generate completed tax forms have client review and submit to IRS."
good,Typical days are fast paced and productive.  I learned a lot about how to deal with the public in heated situations.  The hardest part of the job is coping with unreasonable client issues.  The most enjoyable is actually resolving their issues.
good,"A typical day for me is planning my day with time managing skills."
good,"Overall I had a good time working here. I enjoyed the work environment as well as the people I worked with. My manager made it a fun place to be while holding us all accountable by treating us like adult coworkers instead of subordinates. "
good,"Enjoyed 5 years of solving tax situations for 100s of clients, each one being unique.  Two years of management brought satisfactory results in sales and volume."
good,"Learned to prepare taxes "
good,"Prepare individuals tax return"
good,"This job has great opportunities for advancement. "
good,"H&R Block was a great experience for me for over 10 years. I had a chance to interact with many different clients and co-workers. I learned how to use a computer software called appointment manager, which was very beneficial to me because it was used on a daily bases. The hardest part of the job was telling clients their refund check was not ready. The best part of the job was putting a smile on the client face by letting them know their refund was available for pick-up."
good,"I enjoy meeting people, interacting and learning differe nt culture, interest of others."
good,"Seasonal position only, great management team an I am able to still have time with my familu"
good,Great place to work if you just want seasonal work.  I loved my boss and coworkers in the Hyde Park location!  
good,"Preparing taxes for people, getting to know them and helping them plan for future years as far as tax preparation and tax saving. The team of workers helped and left me with a sense of confidence during the tax preparation process for our clients."
good,"#1. If your work hours are 8AM - 5P.M. you don't walk in at 8A.M.,  say hi to everybody, ETC.,ETC.ETC. & sit down at your desk at 8:15..."
good,"i had fun with the company, intersting travels and always busy. it was a job in my field so i was satified"

good,all the tax preparers were wonderful to work with and always mad sure customers left out satisfied
good,Steady work atmosphere. Supervisors always appreciative of what you do. 
good,"I had worked for HR Block for twenty years. I marketed for new clients, taught tax courses and prepared tax returns for over 40000 clients."
good,"A typical work day for me would be opening the store with a tax professional or manager. Counting all money. Making sure store is neat and clean. answering phone, taking messages. providing excellent customer service. Co-workers and manager were all very nice. District manager seem to change a lot, not always for the better. No real hard part to the job. Customer service was the most enjoyable part."
good,I am not sure if the company is still in business and more. I have changed industries.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the different types of customers that came in and working along side of very knowledgeable tax professionals. Everyone worked well as a team.
good,Answers dozens of calls from returning customers & potential customers
good,"The people are great to work with. Very professional, helpful and friendly."
good,Nice people even though it is a high pressure environment. The work is seasonal so it is better as a second job to earn extra income.
good,This was an exceedingly busy job as it was tax season. I met people of all cultures and loved being on the desk helping them out. I learned to manage their stress with regards to long waiting periods by adopting a method of calling them back instead of waiting in the office. This job got me used to a busy office environment. My co-workers were hard working people and some of them I'll never forget because of how wonderful they were. The Office manager was somewhat difficult to deal with but you learned how to operate with her.
good,"reviewing the day a head what the schedule looks like which employees are scheduled, then I will tweet the schedules to reflect the days schedule, will make calls to clients for reviews on their visit in the office, I have always had a very close work relationship with my office staff, we worked as a team which made the office run alot smoother, I learned alot about the different types of people and how to deal with the issues of life, really when someone complains they really want someone to listen to them and care,"
good,"Work place is an office setting, but the company is getting into more that taxes. This tax year, they are going after people who need health insurance."
good,2nd year supervisor taught me alot about Taxes. Help me with certain aspects of helping clients to get what they needed.
good,Answer phone and scheduling appointments
good,We at H & R Block try to make sure all customers are totally satified with their filing tax for the new year!
good,"It has its ups and downs interms of people flow, but there many opportunities of advancement and you learn a lot about taxes."
good,Everybody works together in the office. I like helping people feel comfortable and relaxed when it's their turn to get their taxes done. I like that I can work at an office close to home and cut down on drive time and gas. I enjoy all aspects of my job. The room for opportunity to movie around is wide.
good,"HR Block pretends its an office environment, but it treats its employees like they work in a factory."
good, 85 hours of income tax training and 2 years of marketing
good,Rapid pace of work during peak season and slow pace during off season.
good,A typical day at work is productive and always focuses on growing and retaining clients and on building stronger relationships.
good,"Preparing tax returns is an easy way to keep track of all the changes in tax laws year by year. It also allows me to interact with the public, which is one of my favorite activities."
good,A typical day at work can be extremely busy depending on the office. The hardest part of this job for me is when people want to under mind the legal system.
good,Was helping people and being able to provide exquisite cutomer serivce.
good,Love it there. Can pick your hours good if you have a family. You are eligible for a bonus based on your productivity
good,It is a fun place to work and gives one the opportunity to learn whatever one would want to about tax administration. Coworkers are
good,"As a Office Manager at H&R Block, it has been challenging and has made me a stronger leader. With it only being a seasonal position there is always room for growth, it is very fast paced and very structured. The hardest part of my job is having to assure that goals and targets are met daily. But then again it is also the funnest part of the job, there is constant movement and change. To build the business and acquire the daily goals, theres lots of outside marketing and good neighboring. Working as a team and sharing struggles and defeats is a great tool, that has helped me reach my goals as a leader and taught me how to become the manager and coach that I have be come."
good,The bad Part of the job was that it was only temporary so you only worked a few months of the year. I did also enjoyed working here because I learned many things and many programs in the computer
good,"The pay is awful. However I love the flexibility and the team I work with. It’s sad to know that fast food workers and retail are paid more than myself when I have 20 years as tax professional services during the off-season. During tax season we are paid fairly. But during the off season we deal with lots of tax notices, complex returns, and more for very minimal pay."
good,I love working at HR Block you meet interesting people. This will be my third year coming back for the season. The flexible hrs are great. The office I work in Is in a good location.
good,"H&R Block is a great company, my coworkers were very professional and competents. I got a good experience doing tax returns in Enghlish and Spanish. "

good,"My responsibilities were to answer phone calls, greet clients, set up and confirm appointments as well as take payments. It was a good place to work to improve your customer service skills by learning how to deal with clients who are upset or angry.  I enjoyed the job because of the people I worked with and the skills I learned."
good,"The atmosphere at the office I worked for was for the most part congenial.  As in any organization there are issues to overcome for almost anyone.  Luckily, the overall efficiency and willingness to make things run smoothly by most of employees far outweighed the inability of a few to hinder productivity.  The owners were visible and their main managers were highly proficient at their jobs."
good,H&R Block is not a boring job. There is always something to do and to learn. I got to work with a great team of people with different levels of experience and they were always eager to help.
good,"I love coming back every year, to meet new clients and embrace others. A great day at work is welcoming everyone, everyday, by encouraging the new prepares all season, equipping the team each day to reach and meets goals, also, empowering the clients of H&R Block by acknowledging services and products, that we offer to enhance their experiences by educating all clients. "
good,This company does offer positions where a person can grow.  Management needs to address people that want to talk over people and not give them a chance.
good,We were more like family during the tax season and beyond - we were concerned about each other and helped each other out with questions and solutions.
good,"Great Manager"
good,I love working here they worked around my full-time job. It's very fast-paced during the beginning of tax season then weans off till towards the end then fire back up...
good,We had good times at the location where I worked. Team oriented. I would work at H&R Block again. I enjoyed my time in this position. Made some life long friends.
good,"I wish it was a year around position. I love interacting with clients, preparing income taxes, learning, taxing classes.  I had great bosses & flexible schedule"
good,"I liked working at H&R block. The people at my location. They were very helpful and willing to teach. "
good,"Very poor pay rate. More hours during season than expected. No real bonus or benefits. Salary really not fair if you work 70 hours a week. Relaxed atmosphere, nice people."
good,If you are looking for a seasonal part time job Jan-Apr. really good job. You make your own hours. Really laid back. Will be a dry period where you will not have any clients. You can practice tax returns on the software in the mean time.
good,"The work atmosphere was great.  Very busy.  Seasonal work.  Long hours during tax season.  Fast pace, but can be enjoyable if you like working with the public."
good,"Since there are so many branches of H&R Block I can’t speak for everywhere, but the branches I’ve worked at have been over all a good experience. Unfortunately business has been getting slower over the last couple of years due to the rise in people doing their taxes on their own on the internet. There are some busy days but most days it was very slow and not much work to do."
good,"As long as you apply well in advance of the tax season and are hired before mid-January, you can decide your own availability to work.  The last season I worked I had applied a little late so I worked whenever they asked me to.  I had a new manager not accustomed to filling out schedules so my schedule changed every day.  She managed two offices and the other manager in the area also managed two offices.  The other  manager became very ill, so my manager ended up managing four offices.  When she hired me, she asked if I would mind floating between two offices and I said that was fine.  Then, when the other manager became ill, I was asked if I would float between all four offices.  Sometimes my schedule would change more than once a day.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different types of personalities sometimes.  There are a few tax pros that want things done their way against protocol and there are a few that are demanding about getting the new clients.  Other than that, the culture is fine.  There are some great people working at H & R Block."
good,H & R Block is a wonderful place to work.  I just wish it was all year long.  This job gives those with no office experience an opportunity to enter the administrative field.
good,"I have worked for H&R Block for 3 seasons, and have advanced every season. There are incentives for both tax pros, and management.  This last season there was also an incentive for CSPs."
good,Enjoyed meeting new clients and educating them on tax issues. First time filers are my favorite because they usually didn’t  know anything about tax laws but they did when they left.
good,I worked for a franchise so its a little different than corporate.  They provide you with most of the training that is needed to advance in the business.
good,"Excellent advancement opportunities. They are a seasonal employer but depending on your experience and education, bonuses are great!"
good,"Enjoyed meeting new clients, learning about their tax situation and providing guidance to assist them with a positive experience and outcome.  Having returning clients was awesome to see them, their new members in the family and their past year experiences.  Great place to work, the pay was on the light side for the tax knowledge and the penalties that could have happened if due diligence was not taken."
good,"Very flexible with hours"
good,In our office we have about 65 years of experience with all of our tax pros.  We all get along great.  I have been in the same office for 15 years.  At times I worked year round at different offices as well.
good,"H & R Block has seasonal, rewarding work for those who enjoy serving the public while supporting a team who consistently provides an accurately completed and valuable service. Inherent in the tac season are peak and non peak time frames where overtime is required to meet demand and non peak where less support is needed. Corporate's ideas to increase sales via egregious over-calling-to a loyal client base-was; in my view, wrong headed. But a small nuisance compared to the many positives which included a strong knowledgeable and supportive team of tax preparation professionals, easy, common sense technology and software systems and that loyal client base made up of agreeable customers who liked us; enjoyed coming to us for an otherwise annoying federal mandate. Though I logged 55 hours a week during peak, I never encountered stress from within the team."
good,"A typical day at the workplace is very fast paste and makes the day go fast.Learned some skills on how to do tax returns and C.R.S. managing the front desk was my daily job. The workplace was of mix cultures The hardest part of the job was when refunds didn't come as scheduled. But, on the other hand when refunds came in as scheduled people were very happy."
good,"I worked as the front desk as a receptionist.  Made appointments for 10 tax preparers,including determination of what preparer based on experience would help a client.  Ran reports as needed for manager.  Acted as cashier for payments of tax return fees."
good,"The learning curve was independently driven and steep. Workflows were self-taught with some random aid. Overall, the experience was enjoyable, clients were interesting and each had a story, and the job provided a sense of accomplishment so therefore was a gratifying experience."
good,I highly recommend this job when its available if your lookin for a seasonal place to work. The coworkers are great and help the day go along. It's sad its only seasonal.  They asked me to come back for next year but I'd really like to find my forever job.
good,"You can work when you are available make your own schedule."
good,"I work as a tax professional and do tax forms.  A very steady work place but only temporary work.  February to May."

good,"This is a great company to work for to get your foot into the tax business.  Lots of schooling and training.  They focus too much on things that you can't control and don't pay well.  It is based on client count.  "
good,"I learned a lot at H&R Block. It gave me experience to learn at the front desk role, and I am looking forward to continue this career. I am advancing to become a tax pro next tax season, and I am very excited."
good,Even though is was only for a few months my time at H&R Block was short. I was in a wonderful team environment. We all worked together to get the job done. I hope to be back next year.
good,"Self-Motivated with the ability to multi-task. "
good,It was great I would be able to come in the shift before me would have everything they are responsible for done. I would work on my homework when there was free time and they let me go on lunch breaks whenever I needed to as well.
good,Working in the office in Oak Harbor was great my co-workers were great people and if you need help they were there. It is a family friendly job. I really like working as a receptionist.
good,"Had to maintain the office in shape, replacing coffee and adding paper to paper trays. Along with attending to clients questions, Scheduling appointments"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.  The hardest part of the job was to see a customer sad when they owed money to the Internal Revenue.
good,The learning experience is great. They pay first year tax pros by the hour and it’s not much above minimum wage. After that we go to commission. It’s a great learning experience but the pay is low compared to revenue we bring the company even at the top of the commission scale.
good,"prepare Income Tax returns for clients. Great Management, team and colleges. The hardest thing is no room for mistakes and dealing with CRA, The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting clients and working as a team"
good,There was not enough tax associates within the office which created overload for remaining associates. They should hire more associates and focus on customer satisfaction.
good,"Free classes were supplied to all employees, some money incentives, flexible hours, flexible locations,fun coworkers, build up of clientele retention,made friends."
good,It was a friendly place to work.  Everyone was very kind and helpful with the learning curve. Compensation was not very high but as a temporary job it was OK.
good,"You you mainly answer phones and help tax preparers continue their education in the form of online classes. You would assist the in the form of navigating through the website for certain needs or by creating, editing or deleting courses. The management was helpful with anything you asked about. The workplace was laid back and friendly. The hardest part about the job was learning the different way to assist the caller over the phone and understand what needs they wanted assistance with. I enjoyed pretty much everything about the job it had great hours, great employees and I liked the challenge it provided."
good,"I enjoyed working there. It was a part time job, as a receptionist, but a great environment. I would recommend that company to any college student looking."
good,"Every day is different. No two clients are the same. Enjoy working there."
good,Everyone was very warm and welcoming especially the managers. There was a lot of comradery amongst the different offices and friendly competitions between them were frequent. But beyond my immediate supervisors there was a lot of micromanagement and office politics. Overall a Good experience for me but not everyone felt the same.
good,"Do interview the customers for preparing tax returns, give them  tax tips, prepare the returns and provide excellent customer service."
good,"great co-workers, nice customers, can be tense and stressful at times along with demanding. some expectations seem unreasonable for the job description  like manning the front counter for customer service yet shoveling snow from the front sidewalk. trying to answer phones and cleaning the bathroom, emptying trash and giving customer service ?"
good,Generally busy workdays.  Good opportunities for learning. Competent management. Workplace culture is extremely/excessively sales oriented. The most difficult part of the job is understanding complex tax details.
good,"I really enjoy working in my office as we are a good team. But the peak hours are intense and the non-peak can be stressful in trying to get clients to come in."
good,"From the office managers, tax preparers all the way to the Customer Service Representatives, all workers were professional. We all seemed to get along well. Sometimes the clients felt that the services were a tad on the expensive side. However, most clients have been clients of ours for many years."
good,"It was my first job, its where I learned how to provide customer service. It has built me to be who I am today. A hard worker, who finds things to do instead of not doing any thing at all."
good,Seasonal work. a typical day includes preparing tax returns for individuals and small businesses. Training on the software is a paid training. Tax topics and updates are provided through the year using virtual classes. You need these classes to move up to a higher level. However you are not compensated for taking the classes.
good,Start the day opening the shop preparing files for returns to be completed that day. Greeted customers upon arrival. Called to confirm appointments. Checked out customers once were returns were completed.
good,"If your a first time preparer or pro Block is the place, I have not heard of a unset employee, Block is fresh and new place if you enjoy upbeat and new Block is the place."
good,H & R Block is a great place to work. They genuinely care for the clients and providing the best service to them. The atmosphere is great. The people are hard working and caring. The clients are great.
good,"The staff was great to work with. Fast paced environment at times, but everyone helped everyone else so it made it fun. You definitely learn to work as a team to make sure the customers are satisfied."
good,"H&R Block is a great company for re-entering the workforce. The in-house training is very helpful and you can advance in your career at your own pace. The hours are flexible, but if you are good they will push you to work more hours. I find the work fulfilling. The work is seasonal but at certain times extremely fast paced."
good,"I enjoyed my time at H&R Block. The work atmosphere was excellent most of the time. However constant turn over in upper level management did create lapses in production at times, but was an overall great place to work until the recession. I'm truly grateful for all  the opportunities I had and received while working for H&R Block."
good,"Honestly it's a great place to work if you LIKE to prepare taxes. H&R Block pays very little compared to the actual work you do. The management is nice, and they do what they can to help the office. I enjoyed preparing taxes, and enjoyed coming to work every day."
good,State of the art equipment and tax programs with a nice working environment. Training was required seasonally and was very intense. The people were great and for the most part so was the management.
good,"It was very interesting, very challenging and I really felt wonderful there.  Every day trying taxes to different people, different situations, different taxes laws.  "
good,"The mornings and evenings were slower then the middle of the day usually. The Tax Pros were friendly and easy going. I felt like part of a team from day one."
good,It is fast paced and need to keep up to date with all the rules and regulations of the IRS. Do returns for all kinds of clients. Put them at ease  and do the best job for your clients so that they will return to you every year.

good,For me I kind of loved this job it was a seasonal position and due to the type of business.  At H&R Block it's a tax company they prepare taxes there I was working the front desk.  it is I learned alot from there until I got sick
good,"The particular office I worked in was nice, it was busy but after checking clients in and handling my worked it was more relaxed and open. Their was some tension between some of the employees but as the front desk staff you won’t get roped in as th job is seasonal"
good,Nothing to report. See my comments on another venue.  I do not wish to comment at this time.  Comments are limited to internal affairs.  My comments will be added later.
good,I had a great time working for this company. It made me feel productive throughout the day. The workload was manageable and the tax professionals were always friendly and helpful.
good,"I love the culture at H&R Block.  They have a variety of professional development opportunities.  I especially love the Women's Network events.  However, my pay is less than satisfactory."
good,A great place to work it was seasonal though so an average working term is approximately 6 months. Every year you have to pay to reapply for the position as well.

good,Company provides all the tools necessary to become an expert in preparing individual and corporate tax returns.  There is continuing education classes offered online and the work environment is fast paced during peak tax time!
good,"A ton of work, not a lot of money. I had no paid time off, and it was a stressful office environment. I learned office environments are definitely not for me. I liked some of my co-workers, though, and my boss was amazing."
good,"For a retired person, this is a good way to work 4 to 5 months out of the year and have the remaining months off.  Company is flexible with the amount of hours required to work."
good,It is a fast pace atmosphere from the beginning of the day to the end. There is a lot to be learned about taxes and the in and out of preparation. Most of the time a friendly atmosphere with clients and Tax Pros.
good,"I love doing tax preparation, but it’s seasonal and takes years to actually master the tax code. I will continue to educate myself and use my knowledge of tax law to help advise individuals and small business to succeed financially."
good,A typical day starts with contacting clients that you have an appointment with within the week.  You have a variety of changes each year as far as the tax changes that continually change each and every year dues to tax laws.  Management keeps us up to date on changes and procedures that change on a daily bases.  Each day is exciting because you have a variety of clients with different situations.
good,"-Encouraged to obtain additional training, path to advancement very clear."
good,"High stress levels during tax season, hours were fantastic. Did not like being paid once a month, but cash advances were great! Boss can be grumpy, just have to have thick skin."
good,"While I can't speak for every team, my team was fantastic to work with. The job is stressful, the hours are long, but we were all in it together and it was a privilege to work with them. By all means, if you can handle a fast paced environment and better yet, if you excel at it, then this is the job for you. Leading these tax preparers and receptionists was a great experience from beginning to end."
good,Great company and good staff. Iwould recommend others to work there. Great hours I have no complaints. Its flexible shifte so you have to guess what times you would be working. always check schedules.
good,We have all the items we need in our online portal. We have self training and instructor training. Very casual workplace but sometimes too casual for my taste. Like the interaction with clients. Like that I can set my own schedule. Note: min hours are required for hiring.
good,"greet clients that come in the door, make appointment calls for several offices, file paperwork daily, take payments upon completion of the tax return."
good,Training to prepare for service desk support was good experience before starting the position. They accompanied your needs to assit with service calls and had multiple resources to troubleshoot the issue at hand.
good,"For the most part, H & R Block was an enjoyable experience. The people I worked with were friendly. The owner of the local franchise was rarely around, but could be a little rude."
good,"MUST BE PC SAVVY! Being a CSP is usually pretty easy depending on location. (busy location = more work, slow location =  less work). They do have discount program with other companies, and everything is digital."
good,"Full time, seasonal work.  Lots of training.  Some support.  Room for educational advancement.  Can be cut-throat.  17 week season is either very busy or very slow.  Paid weekly figured against seasonal draw on commission."
good,I enjoy working for H&R block. H7R Block is a friendly place to work and have a lot of room to grown in the company. I plan to one day become a tax pro for the company.
good,"My day is very whirlwind type of work and multi tasking is a must.  I work as the Office Manager of Two offices. Outside of tax season I teach the tax course and I work summer service."
good,The position with H&R Block is seasonal. A preparer works from January to April each year. You are paid by the number of tax returns you prepare and the cost of the return.
good,"I enjoyed the work environment as a client service coordinator. It was relaxing and easy-going. I had the opportunity to help tax professionals in filing taxes. They were a little strict on typos or office skills and the job had instructions for how to answer the telephone, make outbound calls, or handle company calls. I thought training was easy and fair and is was great that you were allowed to take your training home with you. It was white-collar and I was only part-time, but I enjoyed the slow pace and ability to study or reflect on the job. My manager was hilarious and the tax pros were very professional. I enjoyed working there."
good,"H & R Block sets the standard in the tax preparation business. Having worked in an H & R Block office this past tax season has been rewarding, but has also been stressful. Taxes are a very touchy subject with people, as well it should be. The Tax Professionals at H & R Block are skilled in doing taxes, but they are also very understanding and comforting. It is also a refreshing work environment. The ""powers-that-be"" are very much in tune with the employees. Conflict is handled quickly and diplomatically. Plus, not only are there Client Surveys, but the company puts out an Employee Survey that is used to make improvements across the entire company. H & R Block also strongly believes in recognizing those who go above and beyond. There is an entire website that is dedicated to such recognition. I have thoroughly enjoyed working for H & R Block this tax season. The only draw back is that the position is seasonal instead of permanent."
good,"Overall I had a good experience at H&R Block. I was able to learn and grow within the company. It was a great work environment, my co-workers and manager were very easy to work with."
good,"Great place to work, especially if you like working with numbers. Must be a people person and great listener with patience. Can get stressful at time when customer is not happy with the outcome of their tax return."
good,My new manager is amazing. Not a good payment for 13 year service. Friend and family discount is a pro bono. No vacation time. Very good friendship with other office coworker.
good,"I loved working for H&R Block - I was a natural on the phones & working the front. I was promoted to a bigger store during the training. It is very fast-paced at times, but it's not hard work. The tax professionals were very friendly. Some of the clients were rude, but that comes with every job. I had to leave the main office because, despite letting them know I would be starting school soon, they made very little accommodation & actually suggested I quit school. The manager of the main office often gave me extra-curricular activities that were more appropriate for my talents (PowerPoint presentations, mass outbound calls) which was great when work was slow. I eventually moved to a couple other offices which were managed by someone who was willing to work with my schedule. The pay is alright. I wouldn't really go back unless I was strapped for cash -especially since the job is seasonal."
good,This company's main focus is based on a team work ethic that encourages growth and productivity for the business and their employees.  Their ability to teach and help new employees learn is amazing.
good,Enjoyable place to work with associates who are willing to share their wealth of information.  There is and excellent training program which allows people to progress as far as they want within the company.
good,This is a seasonal part time position for tax season.  I have worked here four seasons.  I enjoy the job and the people I work with in this small office.
good,My franchise office allowed fantastic flexibility as a part time seasonal employee.  I had no problem managing schedules between this an my full time job.  Office was mostly a relaxed atmosphere.  We were always allowed enough time to ensure we were able to be as accurate and complete as possible when preparing client tax returns.
good,"Prepare tax returns and advise clients on how to reduce tax liability for coming year."
good,"I was between two offices and would have 4 hour days and some 7 hour days, there was no in between. Also depending on the office, it could be slammed. Some of the tax pros WILL NOT call their clients to help you out. Some tax pros will almost throw a fit if they lose a client. They get a commission and you won't know until you give their client to someone else while they're with a walk in. The walk ins can be a challenge, because some offices are understaffed and always only have 2 tax pros in the office. Also, the clients tend to ask a lot about taxes and the CSP's usually don't know how to answer the question until they've heard it before. It can be a lot on the CSP's with filing, handling walk ins, handling all incoming phone calls, as well as emailing and calling clients to confirm or reschedule appointments."
good,Answering phones and making appointments. Making sure to greet clients as they walk in and make sure they are comfortable. Assist in general office duties.
good,Employees are nice and helpfully. It is only a seasonal position.  The job is pretty straight forward and easy. They provide plenty of training before starting.
good,"Of all the things that I take away from my jobs with H&R Block was how the supervisors, managers, and leads were always available and active. My position was very high stress, face paced, banking resolution customers. So having the ability to ask a question while dealing with a difficult customer was a asset that I appreciated and also respected. Having a management team that is willing to stand in the fire with there team, is a leader than I can get behind. It's leading by example and it made our team better everyday. I was on the Senior Care Team and we did not relinquish accounts without a resolution, so having that driving force helped us succeed."
good,"Nice seasonal, part time job.  I enjoyed helping and interacting with both the customers and coworkers. My manager was supportive and allowed me to work at my own pace."
good,"Blending the complexity of the tax code with the general public is a delicate balance. Then cram all the stressful financial conversations into a whirlwind four months of long days; it's not for everyone. It gets easier but never comfortably predictable. If you don't put the time in to know the work and the service you're selling, working for Block will be a nightmare. But if you know your tax law, can lend a perceptive ear, and project confidence in your work, then you can make a good amount of money in a short time."
good,"After taking a class, was able to get a seasonal position working like 4 hours a day a few days a week. Was perfect for a first job after becoming a mommy."
good,For someone who went to school for accounting there was always a part of me that wanted to learn more about filing simple and even some complex returns but there weren't many employees willing to teach me.
good,You could write your own hours depending on your availability.  There was a generous support system if you had any problems that you needed to work out.  Overall the workplace has a very good vibe about it.
good,H&R was a very good place to work. The people were friendly and always helpful.  My son was in a car accident and I had to leave the company to help him.
good,"Excellent Seasonal job.  Fast paced, Continuous learning in progress!  Many reference materials and experienced owner to work with for complicated situations."
good,Professional deamenor in the branch is highly observed due to the nature of services the company renders. Confidentiality of personal info is secured in every transaction to earn customers trust.
good,"It is very flexible schedule, pretty much you set your own hours. However, lots of work during the tax season, but after there is no hours. Although I had a great experience."
good,"Love working with clients. A challenging job,stressful, rewarding.  A lot of yearly classes to keep up on tax law changes and to maintain eligibility requirements for the job.  Advancement is at your own pace."
good,The hours were flexable. The fellow employees were helpful. I would work here again if I didn't have a full time job already. It is stressful but interesting work.
good,H&R Block is a fast paced place to work. I learned about management and time skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with clients and helping them understand their tax situation.
good,"The work is fast paced and can be stressful.  I can only speak for the particular franchise that I work for,  I like my boss and the team of preparers in my office."
good,A typical day at H&R Block would consist of arriving at work in the morning and booting up the computers and making sure all work stations are up and ready to serve our clients. Then I would check emails and voicemails and return calls or emails as needed. Sometimes further research is needed. I learn something new everyday at H&R Block. The management is laid back and hands off for the most part. The culture is laid back and relaxed. The hardest part of the job is getting the taxpayers to understand how tax law applies to their unique situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people improve their tax circumstances.
good,This is a nice place to start your career. Flexible and cultural working environment. My managers are super helpful and nice. You learn a lot about tax field and meet up a lot people.
good,A day of work constitutes getting files ready for the day and checking appointments.  I learned some tax information.  Management was always there for help.  The hardest part of the job was keeping appointments to get started on time.  The most enjoyable part is working with people.
good,I have nothing bad to say about H&R Block.  They provide a lot of training and education available to the employees.  There is tremendous room for growth.
good,"I enjoyed meeting and greeting clients."
good,H R Block was a very good company to work for and I enjoyed it very much until the focus shifted to B2B.  Block has many outstanding leaders who work very well together.
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Enjoyed the classes. Challenging. Low pay to begin with. Opportunity to advance. Continuing education. Only seasonal.
good,"Monotonous work but very healthy environment at workplace, Effective management & very supportive to employees, good place to learn effective communication skills,"
good,"As this is a tax office, the position is competitive in the fact that we are competing against other business providing the same services, but we are also competing with online software.  Coworkers are positive and helpful."
good,I enjoyed meeting new clients and helping them with their tax needs.  The only bad thing about it was the cost for clients to prepare their taxes was a bit high for most people.
good,"comfortable work place                         "
good,"I am very happy with this work and work place, I recommend to others as well. I get to learn many new courses every year for a negligible price and also get exposure to various tax topics."
good,"This was a temporary job.  I was a secretary.  Answered phone, input client information into computer scheduled clients, and filed papers.  Very busy job most of the time until tax season slowed down."
good,It's good chance to learn about personal tax. Great work environment and excellent colleagues. You might get very busy during the tax season but you could meet different people and help with their tax issue.
good,"I enjoy being a part of H&R Block.  I like the versatility of office hours.  Meeting new people, helping them better understand taxes.  It's not that scary."
good,This is a great place to work but is only a seasonal position.  The management here is awesome if you enjoy working in a good atmosphere and only need a seasonal part time position I would highly recommend working here.
good,It was both relaxed and fast paced environment with a few angry clients here and there overall good job great people and didn't hate coming in to work everyday
good,H&R Block is a great place to work for those who are fascinated by taxes and how they impact millions of individuals every year. Almost every tax return is different and allows to use your knowledge to help each client in their own way.
good,Nice place to work if you looking for part time yearly employment. They hiring process is long for first time employees but when you are in the system its better
good,For a seasonal position it was a wonderful job.  I enjoyed the people and the customers.  They offer opportunities for advancement and improvement of your skills.
good,I worked for H&R Block for about 5 years. I liked working there you can choose your own hours and advance at your own pace. You meet new people everyday and get to help with their tax issues
good,Loved working with clients.  Good educational opportunities.  Never knew what your next clients tax return would consist of;  a lot of variety.  Most of the employees were helpful
good,"Best place to get practical experience of Filing of Income Tax returns of an individual.  I learnt how to communicate with the clients and got the training of soft skills. Overall management of 600 employees is good and appreciable. "
good,Everybody is very friendly but it does get pretty busy. As front desk you will be standing for a minimum of four hours with no breaks. As a tax preparer you will constantly have a paper of some kind on your desk.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I was at the front desk. I had to take payments for taxes to be prepared. I answered the phones, made copies of documents. I answered questions to the best of my knowledge."
good,I love working for H&R Block. But its seasonal. I work great with others and I love keeping the office organized and clean. I love to be busy and help people in any way I can. I learn fast and can keep up with most things. I sometimes act as office manager to resolve conflict. I am very good at that. I can keep a cool head when things get tense. I love working and helping others.
good,"The training and leadership is great, I learned a lot, I recommend working with H&R Block  Flexible schedule, easy to work around other jobs or family life. Autonomy in handling client issues. Great training and education opportunities."
good,"I was fun to work in because, you test your intelligence and can adquire skills like typing and all that stuff, customer always got sastified by our treat."
good,"I enjoy working with HR Block since it is seasonal, lots of new situations on any given day, learn how to juggle time, and the sense of accomplishment"
good,"From the moment I showed up to work everyone had a bright smiling face, you can tell that a happy up-lifting environment is important. My job included filing, making phone calls, communicating with clients, and to be that bright face in a potentially bad day. I personally enjoyed the workers, everyone always had corny jokes while still being professional and was always willing to help if questions about my job arose. The hardest part of my job had to be the angry customers, when working with taxes, it is almost guaranteed that someone is going to not get the money they thought they were going to get back. This causes some hostile situations, and my job is to deflate those situations before they got worse."
good,"Typical day at work includes set up appointments, sell products, marketing, recruit new clients, generate revenue. Contact old clients to scheldue new appointments.  Great work environment, the most difficult job is competing with other companies doing the same job. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people with their tax returns."
good,"assisting with answering phones, booking and rescheduling appointments. cleaning front desk area. learning basic tax needs, and providing people with our services. Advertising outside of the company, within the area, to gain customers."
good,The majority of employees with H&R Block are either semi-retired or already working another job. Therefore they do an excellent job of working around crazy schedules.
good,"H&R Block was a great place to work at as a part time job. My co-workers were very friendly and the manager at my office was amazing. Unfortunately, due to under-hiring, I ended up working about 50-60 hours a week. That would have been fine if all the overtime I earned didn't go into taxes (ironically). In order to thrive in this job you pretty much have to expect to be the punching bag for clients and learn how to take it with a smile. The majority of clients I dealt with were polite and friendly, but you will run into some very cranky ones that will treat you like public enemy #1. Just smile and be empathetic and you'll get through the day."
good,"On a typical day for me as the manager of my two locations, I would go over daily reports, chat with the staff, go out and market for both offices, and fill in when staffing was short due to illness or vacation. I learned a great deal of information during my time here, especially how to oversee two locations effectively. Which in turn was the hardest part of the job, especially being able to keep in constant communication with everyone."
good,It was a very good experience to work there. I learned many new things and clarify my doubts about few things. My schedule was very flexible. The staff was very co-operative and knowledgeable. Everyone behaved in very professional way. There is lot of growth potential in the company. I recommended this company to many of my friends and family. They are doing very good by giving back to the community by offering free tax course and classes to educate people about tax issues.
good,I like to work for H&R Block but it 's only a seasonal job and the pay is low even with the commission. It would be great if it was a full time permanent position.
good,"good training online classes and coworkers are friendly. You need to pass required certificate exams to level up. Since most positions are seasonal, it is not suitable for people who are looking for full-time jobs."
good,Management at HR Block are very helpful. Opportunities to learn and grow within the company are strongly encouraged. Training is very essential and you are have access to training material 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
good,"Boring, tedious office work. No room for advancement unless willing to get certified to do taxes. Often have to double check tax pros work and make sure that they have signed appropriate papers necessary to process and file returns"
good,"Seasonal work preparing taxes.  if you want to advance you take classes online through Block in the off season and work on more difficult returns the following year."
good,"it was great to be able to give people advice on their tax returns.  The  hardest part of the job was sometimes telling people what the"
good,"The opportunity to work at H&R Block, has been rewarding. I have gained knowledge in so many different areas of customer service. The people I work with are a delight to be around, we all work together as a team, this makes the work load easier on everyone."
good,While I was working here i learned a lot about answering phones and making appointments.

good,I enjoy working at H&R Block.  The people who work there are friendly and helpful.  During the peak time the day is overwhelmed with clients wanting to get their tax returns done but it is good to know that the tax professionals who I work with never lose their patience and are always willing to help other tax professionals that encounter special difficulties.
good,"This was my first real office type job right after university. Its not like the office but it wasn't bad either. My co-workers accepted me into their space without question and because of that It was easier for me to jump right into role everyday, knowing if i needed help i'll have help and not judgement."
good,This was my first year and with all the changes the office had it was hard to be taught anything. I had to go by what I learned in school and ask questions when I could. At the end of the year I still managed to get to awards out od the district.
good,"Comme poste réceptionniste j ai appris les bonnes qualités de services a la clientèles et j ai eu des bonnes relations avec les clients."

The manager of the office know's her business well and is dedicated to her clients which I appreicate.  Despite being a short-term job, she is flexible regarding scheduling and time off and appreciates all the people who work for her."

My co-workers were very sweet and down to earth, and always willing to help."
good,"In a typical day at H&R Block, I have the opportunity to help people understand their tax situation. I ensure that both of my offices are appropriately staffed for the day. Every shift begins with a daily huddle where I make sure that my staff  understands our daily goal and where we stand for the current season. After the daily huddle, I spend a few minutes with individual tax professionals and client service professionals to touch base. These meetings provide me an opportunity to coach individuals on their product attach rates, net promoter scores, and find out if they have any questions or if there are any barriers I can remove for them. Due to the part-time seasonal nature of the company my tax professionals have varying needs to balance their work and personal lives. This presents some unique staffing issues, many of our tax professionals have limited availability or schedules that change rapidly. My goal is to ensure that my employees have a positive and drama free work environment because the general atmosphere of the office effects the client experience. The best part of my day is a toss up between developing my tax professionals and helping my clients to understand their tax situation. The hardest part of my job balancing my own work life balance. I love to help my tax professionals and clients so much that sometimes it is hard for me to disengage from the office and head home at a reasonable time. I also struggle with saying no when I am asked to take on additional projects or coming in on my days off. H&R Block has a high turnover rate at the district manager level."
good,My co workers were all women who were great and good with advice. I never had a hard day but I learned their database really well. I enjoyed getting to know customers and putting their needs before mine.
good,"Great co-workers, good hours, great clients that come back year after year and a good way to meet new people."
good,"Working at H&R Block, I've learned a lot about taxes through my peers and from clients situations. As a Manager, each day would be different.  Along with managing the office, my work can involve in assisting the District Office Coordinator and Regional District Manager with other offices."
good,"I am currently employed as a CSP. The job is pretty basic- answer telephones, schedule appointments, make coffee, process payments and some light filing. One downside is the pay rate. It's pretty low, at about $8.25 However, I was told if I were to come back next year, they raise the wage for previous workers. They also offer tax prep classes to be a tax professional starting at $20.00"
good,"Meeting new people"
good,H&R Block is a great place for part time employment. They have been around forever and won't be going anywhere anytime soon. I am able to build a book of business and get to do the same people's returns year to year.
good,"Typical day at H&R Block was to greet the customers as they walk in. Get information on them there name and Social Security number. Attended the needs of all clients before directing them to a Tax Professionals. Management was great to work with, Working with the Tax Professionals in a working environment went very well."
good,"Company believes in advancement and has great learning potential for every employee.  Greatest part of the day was when I could save the customer money and get a great refund for them.  Co-workers were helpful and encouraging.  The hardest part of the job is learning all you need to learn to help customers, so you can rely on older associates to help you."
good,"I love working with this company. They were always very easy to change schedules around if something personal came up.  Everyone in the office is like a little family.  After I got married, they threw me a little party in the office with cake and presents.  Their only downfall is only being open seasonally.  If I had a full time all year position I would stay with the company."
good,Helping customer preparing the tax return. Trying to minimize their tax payable. Management is always willing to help. Communicate with the customer effectively.
good,A lot of stress for a short time. Only work January thro April. Meet lots of great people who depend on you. Great place to work.

good,"The best part of working for H&R Block is the opportunity to help individuals and businesses with a wide variety of tax situations.  The compensation is hourly and the potential to earn an end of the season bonus. The harder you work the more bonus you make and could increase you hourly pay the following year."
good,"I worked with H&R Block for 3 years. It was a very good experience. They provide you with all the tools to be a successful tax preparer. While waiting for customers, we were always studying, learning new software, new laws, new ways to get more customers. The management was good, always attentive of our needs. The co-workers were great, very friendly and happy to help. "
good,"I enjoyed office work very much. It was definitely my environment. I loved my job. I loved the hours, reliability, and the efficiency of it all."

good,"Greeting customers, answering phones, making and changing appointments, keeping supplies stocked, helping out where needed, making calls to clients thanking them for using H&R Block, and rearranging appointments for the tax preparers when needed. The hardest part of the job was when a client was upset about their return and you happen to be the first person they speak with. You usually got the brunt of their anger. But if you would empathize with them they usually would calm down. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,"When and if I ever decide to retire, I will then enjoy the tax season life of H & R Block three months of each year. In the three different years I worked for Block, I learned new things every day, met and interacted with people from all walks of life and worked with the hardest working people, ready for smiles throughout their day."
good,"I enjoy working for H & R Block and will work for them again next tax season if I haven't found a better job."
good,"Prepared tax papers for tax submissions and returns"
good,"During peak season, the pace of clients was back to back. The support from the other members was excellent. I mostly handled simple returns with a few W-2s and dependents. The most enjoyable part of the job was laughing with clients. The hardest part was breaking the news about owing taxes rather getting a refund."
good,The clients are so versatile and you never know what type of situation will walk through the door but you do your best to assist them with their situation.
good,H & R Block is very flexible with their employees schedules. You get treated with respect and all employees are taught to be helpful to clients and other employees. Everyone works together to make the business run smooth. The part I did not like about the job is that it is seasonal. Very few employees have the option to work year round.
good,"Because it was seasonal, its a great company to work for to get extra cash. Tax season was fast paced. Got along well with all my co-workers and supervisors."
good,Small office with eight helpful tax preparers. I worked two tax seasons and learned a great deal. Some pressure as a result of preparing and completing returns with customers present. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I found deductions that they were not aware.

good,"The overall culture was excellent (my office was ideal). Co-workers in the office were helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and enjoyable to be around. Management was persistent and always attentive. The hardest part was also the most enjoyable- peak season rush. Much satisfaction was derived from helping Spanish language customers and a great deal of professional development (and tax knowledge) was achieved. Balanced very well with class and non- traditional student life.  "
good,"As I was a part-time worker. It was a good place to work, nice environment, co-workers were supportive, helpful and respectful. Enjoyable part of the job is to solve queries for the customer and meet new people every time and everyday."
good,"Very productive with a wonderful co worker, having mature conversation about anything.  The previlage of knowing that you are good at anything doing what you do and being able to problem solve any problem that comes my way.  I love talking to my co workers to see what they like or don't like, being able to help them do their job better.  Always finding away to improve the work flow and improve the attitudes of everyone that i closely work with to ensure a good day.  Sometimes it is tedious, but we press on and make it a great day anyway.  Staying busy makes time go by fast every day i really love that.  Being able to adjust to any situation that comes my way.  Complelting what i given to me in a timely manner, being reconized by my manager as being a great worker and the best that they have had yet is a good thing, that is a trait that has alway been with me.  Being the best i can be at all time no matter what."
good,Typical day at work was working nights preparing numerous tax returns. I learned how to be patient with the various types of clients that scheduled appointments and walked in for their tax preparation.
good,"For the most part, the office is light hearted but professional even when there are no customers around.  Since tax season has two peaks with a slow period, the activity in the office mirrors the period.  From up beat and full of energy, to slow and boring. "
good,"I spend the majority of my day assisting clients with tax returns or any question they might have. We are trained daily on any new rules or regulations in regards to the IRS. The manager is very laid back and understanding if a family situation comes up, and is always willing to work wit if you need more or different hours. The hardest part of the job is never knowing what difficult return a client might bring in."
good,"Overall, H&R Block is a pretty nice place to work, or at least at my office. The pay could be better, but honestly its a relatively easy job as a CSP. Everyone is very nice and easy to get along with at the office I work at. The management is organized, and won't hesitate to help you anyway they can."

Management very helpful answering questions I didn't understand. Co-workers friendly . Hardest part would of be waiting on the correct ino for the customers. the whole experience was enjoyable.
good,"I enjoyed going to work every time I was scheduled because I was able to see the faces of the happy customers we served on a daily basis, at least during the season.  My co-workers and I all became one big, happy family and we have forged relationships that have lasted for years.  My supervisor and I worked together until he passed away in 2012, he was able to transfer me to each office he managed and I was willing and able to be transferred."
good,I would come into work and get ready for the day by turning all computers on. moving items in correct spots. get client folders out for the appointment that day. I have learned to not just lean on your self and always join  a helping hand when it comes. the hardest part of the job would of been answering questions as best as I could. I most enjoyed about working here I the employees and being appreciated for what I have done correctly
good,"Scheduling appointments for upcoming tax season. Managing 100-10 calls per day, sending clients to their local tax office to get income tax for current year completed."

good,"I have run the H&R BLOCK St. Albert Location for a few years now and have developed a pleasant work environment that has staff and clients insisting on my return yearly, I enjoy helping people with things they themselves find stressful and seeing the look of satisfaction when the job is completed. That applies to every job/ position I have held. Customer satisfaction is my first priority and frequently go the extra mile to ensure they will consider me the next time they have a need. A happy customer is repeat and new business. It has always been personally satisfying to be the best representative of a company philosophy that matches my own personal beliefs."
good,"Great team work, flexible hours. Learned so much about great customer service and the importance of customer satisfaction. Great support from Management Level. Diverse customers."
good,A typical day at work is setting down making customer calls to ensure you have a constant flow of foot traffic. What you learn at this company is how to prepare tax returns and how the IRS works. Management is great. Your co workers are always willing to help. Hardest part is saying good bye when the season is over.
good,"If one is looking for a seasonal, part-time job HRB is the place to go.  Co-workers are great"
good,"-Learned professional tax knowledge"
good,"Obviously since you prepare tax returns, the workload is greatest from January to April.  At times it is difficult to take a break or lunch during the day. Sometimes during the peak times the workday can be from 9 am to 9 pm, although no one is required to work such long hours.  Then there are other times when it is slow and you may start wishing for a customer.  The pay starts out low, I acknowledge, but the pay increase is entirely up to the employee.  They are a major contributor to their own ""promotion"".   The one thing that is a recurring issue is the dissemination of information from corporate to the local office. Some employees receive information faster than others.   "

good,"Review and prioritize e-mail."

But  I knew that if I work together as a team with my staff everything will be easier at reaching our goals.  I love working with people and helping them to have a good day in the office doing taxes returns.  Every day was a change for everyone, but with a positive attitude and working hard every day we were able to go beyond our goals."
good,"My typical day would consist of a client coming in to prepare their tax return the return is extremely difficult and I have to ask for the assistance of my co-worker which they gladly comply. The client is expecting to owe money to the IRS but instead after much research and study I am able to show the client is due a refund instead.The client is happy ,I am happy and so is my manager. This is what I enjoyed the most the hardest part of the job is being unable to help the client at all due to no fault of my own."
good,"Really great place to work, great amenities for employees, located around great entertainment. I felt I received great training (not for slow learners though) but it was great, Things were a bit unorganized when we got onto floor though. Management was not favorable by a lot of people due to many reasons, unfair schedule but otherwise great place to work."
good,"Great place to work. Values are high, and people are warm and friendly."
good,"Intense seasonal business"
good,"I always enjoyed working with numbers, math was one of my favorite subjects all through school.  Most clients have little knowledge of how to prepare their tax returns and it is rewarding to make it look easy.  The clients appreciate our expertise!"

My co-workers are very nice and supportive. They are supporting me in any new situation and give me valuable advice and instruction. Day by day, I am more and more confident in my job and I can consult my clients in many ways to have most benefit in tax return filling. I love to do tax filling for the whole family, (husband, wife, kids) and it is very interesting to find out the most optimal situation for their family as a whole to claim proper deductible expenses or tax benefit amounts. I can sit down with them to see the outcomes for each option we make and find the best one. I found my passion on doing that and my clients will be very happy and interesting as well. "

good,Working clients tax returns to find them the best return to get their money
good,"Communicating with clients, completing the accurate return and providing the best tax tips are my daily typical work. I have always learned and upgraded my softskills as well as hard skills. Excellent Management and co-worker to work with. The hardest part of the job is that it is a seasonal job.

Ordering office supplies and using office equipment."
good,"While working at H&R Block was considered a learning experience. It was the first time that I had worked as a secretary. The training was extensive, as I had to learn and explain all of the tax programs and different options for payments of the client's refunds. I had to be trained on a new register and how to set up appointments for the clients and tax professionals. The position was only for the duration of the tax season but I could always apply for the same position or take the tax courses to be a tax professional the following year. The clients were good and the tax professional friendly and understanding. The tax professionals always worked to get the client their maxium refund, and explain in detail if there were any questions about the refund."

good,I enjoy working at H&R Block because I like to help people with doing their taxes and understanding them. There is always something to learn everyday as taxes policies can change and no 2 tax preperations are the same. Management are supportive and assist in answering any question that may come up.

Wasn't a personal issue for me, But i did watch it happen.... otherwise very professional."
good,"A typical day at H&R Block would be answering the telephone, scheduling tax appointments, assisting client walk-ins, and other miscellaneous administrative duties.

good,"The one thing that I learned and will apply in all aspects of life, is to seek to understand."
good,"I like to start my work day by arriving at least 15 minutes early. It gives me a chance to get my computer started, review the calendar, and check with the office leader to determine work day goals. Being a first-year tax preparer, I am asked to perform extra tasks since I have not built a large clientele. In addition to preparing tax returns, I answer phones, make calls to set and confirm appointments, file, and do anything else that is required. I like to stay busy, so these tasks are appreciated. The hardest part of my job is solving problems for unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is explaining the tax reporting process and getting a large refund for my clients."
good,The company really stands behind their employees with extensive training each year before tax season starts. The people I worked with were always ready to help each other and give tax assistance.
good,"- A rotina é bastante corrida, mas é prazerosa."
good,This job sparked an interest in accounting and tax preparation
good,"A typical day working at H&R Block would have been greeting clients, assisting clients with questions they might have, and setting them up with a tax professional to file their taxes. I also took all the payments that clients had to make. I was responsible for multiple phone lines and keeping the office neat and clean. My co-workers were nice and always offered to help when I was busy with workloads and they were not doing anything."
good,"The CSP position is the first contact with the client. I am responsible for checking in the client for their appointments and answering or directing any questions they may have.

good,At tax time the inevitable rush comes. At H&R Block we were encouraged to support and help one another and that led to genuine friendliness in the office. They were willing to work with me on scheduling so that my daughter spent limited time in daycare. Management were always willing to help and not afraid to roll up their sleeves and join in the fun. Data entry was an everyday routine along with filing the printed tax forms. The hardest part of my job was when i was unable to help my clients and had to refer them to someone else. I most enjoyed the diversity in people i was able to work with during the tax season.
good,learned how to do beginers taxes talking to and on the phone with people

good,The role as a Marketing Coordinator for (2) districts with a combined of 29 was challenging. I felt like to effectively meet the needs of each office geographically it was impossible. The (2) districts should have been split between two marketiing coordinators. HR Block is a big family. I loved the company culture. All of my colleagues were a email or a phone call away.The company was very straight forward with protecting their Brand and I admired that. I learned to be self-sufficient in my role as well as time-management. I loved assisting each office manager with executing their marketing plans to drive business through there doors and seeing promising results!
good,would recommend it to anyone that likes numbers i did lots of marketing and setting up appointments for clients the coworkers were very helpful when asked i learned that there are all types of people that can get very upset bout their money and expect that they get it when they want it or it is your fault that they did not recieve it on time

good,Hardest part of the job was that it was seasonal. I enjoyed working at H&R Block
good,"A typical day at work was fun relaxing and very interesting.I must admit i learned a lot about preparing taxes ,regulations and guidelines on taxes.

good,"Working for H&R Block is always exciting, changing from one season to the next. You have Tax Season which is crazy busy to your off season where you are planning out the next years business. As a District Manager you are probably more busy in your off season then Tax Season. But overall a great place to work!"
good,"Fun to work, a lot of information to learn, however there are a lot of tools for the tax associates to learn. I am very excited to be able to help people."
good,"Worked with some very nice people and a supportive management, which encouraged employees to advance their tax knowledge.  "

good,"Per hour pay is quite low at 8.75 to 12 per hour for the first several tax seasons (with a bonus at the end based on production). If a person can be patient, grow their certifications and their client base / following, this can turn into a $10k to $30k gig for the first 105 days on the calendar with the rest of the year off."
good,Constantly need to study tom improve certifiaction and advance in the tax field.  The company provides a lot of support. a good place to work. continued learning
good,My experience with this company is excellent. The only drawback is that this job is not year round as such you cannot depend on this job alone for your living.
good,"Great place to work. You are thrown in, but it’s not a problem if you’re motivated to learn. Pay could be better for the level of responsibility you have."
good,Study and keep up to date on law changes.  Customer appreciation is very important.  The company encourages moving up in levels of tax expertise and becoming Enrolled Agents
good,"H&R Block is a seasonal job.Our typical day consists of helping our clients by preparing their taxes and educating them on the new tax laws.  We also are responsible for making coffee and cleaning our office. We have a diverse workforce. We have all different people with different education levels. We help our fellow co workers when they need more expertise. If you have the education, there is no hard jobs. The training is 98% on your own. The most enjoyable parts of this job is the comradery of the workers and serving our clients. It brings warmth to my heart seeing people come in that we have waited on year after year."
good,"Great part time position in any capacity,  receptionist or tax pro.If you are good at math, can understand basic principals in tax law and are interested in learning this is the position for you. Pay is not great and no benefits but it can be a stepping stone."
good,Working seasonally at H&R Block was great. Doing my job I was screening people to make sure they passed their identity checks for their tax returns. Set my own hours. No max on hours I could work per week.
good,"The courses about taxes are really accurate and updated, The most important thing is helping the client fo get a maximum refund,  for that reason your customer service is the best asset to get a relation between client and company, however, they are missing guidance to internal duties which are the problem to be comfortable when you start and try to grow in the company."
good,H&R Block is a good company to work for. You learn a lot. The pay scale is ok. I got plenty of hours but was hoping for more money. Great work environment
good,"The hardest part of the job is that it is only seasonal.  I would like to do this all year round.  File, cold calls, payment processing, proofreading for signatures.  Cold calls.  Meet and greet clients both face to face and over the phone.  Assist co-workers as needed.  Balance register, deposits when needed.  Assisting new workers, getting the acclimated to the job, before they are ""thrown to the wolves"" by themselves.  "
good,Work hours are very flexible day or evening shifts. Tax season is Jan-mid April and must be willing to cram a lot of work in that small time frame. The more you work the more you can make.
good,"Excellent place to work, proper training is provided, improves customer service, pay is less compare to work but can learn many things to grow in future"
good,Never received the complete training that I was supposed to receive was thrown into a office less than three weeks of training to manage a staff of ten employees
good,"Very busy tax preparation office with great co-workers who are professional, well versed, knowledgeable and helpful. Small office with a great atmosphere promoting teamwork."
good,"I enjoywd working at Block. My manager was great and so were my colleagues. The pay was minimal and the comission was only attainable if you always have a client at your desk. I worked the first month when there were no clients coming in, so i never made comission.  I dont think most of my colleagues made comission either. I would have loved my job if the pay had been a little better."
good,I’m happy with my job only wish it was more than three months. I schedule appointments for the office and keep the paperwork and take payments. Answer telephone and route calls.
good,"it was pretty good. i had basically no issues working here, but the pay could be better. most of the training is paid which is a nice bonus, but when it is slow that cuts into your commission and that can hurt."
good,The company is always changing and implementing new practices so go in with and open mind and be willing  learn and excellent customer is a must if you want to maintain your book of business.
good,Busy days in March and April-be ready for surprise phone calls and visits from managers!  Everyone helps everyone out!  More training needed.  More year round jobs would be great!
good,"Heavy phone volumes, busy maintaining scheduling of clients, keeping waiting area clean, keep children occupied if they arrived with family.  Hardest part is sometimes there is no break/lunch time available towards the end of tax season because the office is so busy."
good,Pay needs to be higher for everything the recieptionist does. Hours need to be a little more descreet with there employees. Needs to higher tax pros that dont complain.
good,"Greeting client, assign them to the correct Tax professional. Answering phone. Management they are very professional. the hardest part was dealing with unsatisfying customers. The most enjoyable was helping was my co-workers."
good,This was a seasonal opportunity in which I really enjoyed and learned a lot from. I plan one day to go back to this profession just to learn more and take up to date on it.
good,I enjoyed my time at H&R Block. The training for tax preparation is basic but ample opportunity is available to further your knowledge. The environment is geared toward reaching set goals and corporate expectations that push inexperienced tax preparers to push returns out the door. Overall I was pleased with my position and the admin.
good,"If your passionate about helping others in an area of expertise that they would rather not deal with, and having months off at a time, this is the job for you. If you have a family to take care of, be sure that you can separate work and home life."
good,Great company to work for if interested in retail tax preparation. The training is required but there are incentives to complete them. Management is very professional.
good,"Great when you can focus on your clients current preparation and future planning."
good,It was a joy to see my clients return and find out what had happen since we last talked. With each client been different I would find the best possible outcome for their tax situation.
good,"H&R Block gives their employees excessive training, skills to retain clients. Always someone to help you learn if you need extra help."
good,"Great environment , learned a lot about taxes. Training is excellent makes sure you have all up to date knowledge on any new tax laws.  Opportunity to advance is always available"
good,I work part time at a retail store and my hours get cut in January after Christmas. I worked for H&R Block as a part time receptionist while my hours were cut from January to the end of tax season in April. Super cool enviroment and awesome management. Only thing that isnt good is that the CSP position is only temporary.
good,"Coworkers are friendly and respectful. They are always helping others out and asking how you been. I am always having  good conversations with everyone. Some days can be really busy, other days can be not that busy."
good,"A very nice environment to work but it is frustrating that the job is seasonal. The hours are very flexible, due to most of the employees having a full time job while H&R Block is part time for them. Comparable pay for skill set and location."
good,Friendly place to work where the employers treat you like family. Southern clients that also treat you as family and it's in a wonderful community. Decent job!
good,I personal work 3 different offices but I don't mind it. But It all depend on where you are and how you get around as well as how far you are welling to got. Most of mangers that I meet are nice people. Otherwise the work is fairly easy depending on how much you can handle and how much you can and willing to do.
good,"Training is online and can be done at your own pace. You can also test up to increase your skill level. If there is a drawback, it is that this is only seasonal work."
good,"I enjoy working for this company, they are very flexible and help you with work/life balance. The Atmosphere is quick paced but at times can be slow, but there are always things that need to be done."
good,"I've worked several seasonal positions for this company and I've enjoyed every last one of them. If I had the opportunity to work for them permanently, I'd gratefully appreciate it."
good,Know all the rules and tricks to fill income tax for individuals or business. Be up-to-date with the regulations and rules according to the Canada revenue agency
good,"Co workers are very friendly , only positive attitudes are here they make you feel welcomed ! They worked with my schedule and helped me learn more about their business."
good,i really love working here. the tax professionals are dedicated to their clients and good to me as well.  the only down fall is its seasonal and i want to work here year round. I will return next year as a tax professional myself!
good,for a temporary seasonal position it was fun and rewarding. Learned the value and imortannce of great customer service and satisafaction. The people I worked with was a great team.
good,"My boss key in Southampton New York, was the laid-back easy-going fantastic man.    It was a relaxed work environment. Everybody I worked with was very nice. Sometimes it was super busy and sometimes it was super slow."
good,"Provided technical personal computer (PC) and network support to the district in the accordance with H&R Block guidelines and district plan. Served as a liaison between district associates and vendors, World Headquarters and Regional Technology Manager to identify and resolve problems."
good,The staff is very pleasant and respectful to others. Everyone work together to get the job done. It is a great place to work if you are a person who likes working in a fast paced environment and great customer service atmosphere.
good,"Taxes, you can support  the office as a Customer Service Professional being one half of the customer experience, or be a Tax Professional doing peoples taxes and being cutting edge of the changes and the best in the industry.  H&R Block is so practiced and polished as a company, there are HUGE nationwide and have it broken down to region, then district, then area in the district...  every aspect is covered and if you want to work one day a week they accommodate, if you want full time it can be accommodated depending on needs.  Management is great (local level) they are supportive, understanding and at times strict, but never waiving from company policy.  I would recommend the work to anyone who enjoys an office atmosphere and wants to benefit from the seasonal work situation"
good,Loved working for this company when it had the old owner and management-very caring open to opinions of others. Co workers were like family & always helped each other out.
good,"Part time, seasonal. I have found the company to be awesome and provide a ton of opportunity. We care deeply for clients and our new CEO will navigate us to the future well."
good,"Daily Organization of Tax Prep.  Training Employees, Daily Bank, Deposits, and Reconciliation, Public Relations, Greeting clients, Financial Planning, Submitting Completed Tax Preparations to IRS via email or mail, Maintaining and Updating Unfinished Tax Returns."
good,Although HRB is a seasonal job I feel that its year round. There's always some type of training you can be doing to become more knowledgeable concerning taxes. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how committed you are to a seasonal job.
good,"Knowledge of basic tax laws"
good,Fast paced office with more than enough to do. Good job culture and aware of the possible learning curve that entry-level preparers may have when first starting
good,I deal with customers regularly on a daily basis outside of duties required for the Office Leader. I talk to numerous customers throughout the day. It is necessary to handle challenging situations. I make a lot of phone calls to call back previous customers. I have weekly meetings and once a month manager meetings.
good,"Manage office administrative as Client Services Associate duties in tax office, filing, printing & schedules of appointments & miscellaneous duties."
good,"worked January till April 15 each year,  advanced to tax preparer"
good,Work load was very heavy and expected of you. As an Office Manager you were expected to open the office and close the office each day. You had to lead a team of tax professionals in building their client base and marketing their skills and abilities in the area of which they worked.
good,H&R Block Provides a great part-time job opportunity. Great opportunity to increase your tax knowledge. You can work flexible hours. A lot depends on what particular tax office you are working at.
good,"Wish they paid more but overalll it was an easy job and it was enjoyable as well. Very laid back, scheduling, data entry, phones, filing and audit mostly. It can get very busy and then it can be very slow."
good,"A typical work day consisted of learning and being up-to-date with all the new tax laws and requirements for filing a tax return.  Working with H&R Block I learned how to do high demand, complicated tax returns for different clients.  Each client had a different needs base regarding their tax return, which required more attention to detail than a simple tax return such as a 1040EZ or a 1040A."
good,Hours are flexible they provide great training classes. well established company. You are able to help your clients as well as yourself work the maze of tax laws.
good,If you need just a seasnal job I would reccommend working for H&R Block. Good place if you like working in a professional setting. Must like working with a diverse clientele.
good,"temporary for tax season loved my coworkers and clients that I worked with. There wasn't enough of a work load to keep me as a receptionist busy and I wish that I would have taken the tax course, so that I could have had something to occupy myself during down time."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is having access to all the learning one could ask for.  Not only do we have access to CE hours we also have the Tax Institute for reference and when there is a tax question that I need help with I can reach out to them and they will answer it.
good,"H & R Block good company to work   However, first year pay if very low Seavond season it it is even worst The commissions spay and how it works is very hard to understand As first year tax year to learn what you need to learn it depends on what office you are placed it and who is willing to help you learn  Plus  H & R Block have 5-6 retail items you must sell The company keeps track on how well you sell them. Also, each client is sent a survey in order to grade your performance You must ask each client to fill it out. The company keeps track of the survives and will base your review on it"
good,"I really enjoy working for this company , I just wish it was all year round. You get to grow within this company , become a leader or just part of the staff. Either way it has been a great experience for me."
good,Great place to work at with very friendly colleagues. The company is very flexible should you require a day off for a valid reason. Nice new office located in the downtown core with convenience access to city transit.
good,"The best thing about this job, in my opinion, is the amount of time and effort H and R Block puts into training their tax associates.  There is a plethora of study materials at your fingertips all designed to help you better understand tax code, so you can take that information and help your clients.  During the off season you can use these same resources to study up, take tests, and rise up through the ranks at your own pace."
good,"Working with a team of other tax professionals of all levels provides effective in-house resources. The company provides great resources and makes them easily accessible 24/7. On-going education workshops, courses and seminars provided to assist employees with keeping up to date with tax law changes."
good,"First Year Tax Professional."
good,This company offers a great way to learn taxes. I think their hiring and advancement system could be easier to use and navigate. They do offer all the training you could need
good,"Working for this company can be enjoyable if you like working with the public. It is satisfying helping clients with this important information. "
good,Good seasonal employment.  Social networking and expanding office skills and various program applications are very helpful in the business area.  Tax pros were very willing and helpful when dealing with customers and previous clients.  Range of responsibilities kept me busy and provided continual education in the tax business.  Bulletins and report schedules kept the staff up to date on the latest facts in the tax industry.
good,Buen lugar para obtener experiencias y conocimientos en diferentes temas profesionales.
good,"Decent place to work if you like people. Constantly busy whether it be answering phones, pulling info from previous years, or assisting in any way possible."
good,"1.Assist clients with scheduling appointments"
good,"I would  go in early and drink some coffee. "
good,Management is changing but without seeking operational input. Good place for senior citizens to work if they are retired and have supplemental income and don't need benefits. Provides a valuable service to clients.
good,"It's a nice place to work. I have worked in the same office for 15 years. You have flexible hours, can work in more than 1 office. They have classes to keep your skills up to date and sharp."
good,"Income tax preparation that encourages customer service via the lens of taxation.  The tax training is top notch based on a more practical methodology, rather than theoretical.  Formal training on the day to day practical aspects such as front desk, and office procedures could be more extensive for the actual tax professionals.  Most associates are only seasonal so advancement within the company is based on upon more advanced tax courses in order to prepare more advanced returns.  The more tax seasons completed the more advanced tax training is received."
good,"Fun and fast paced"
good,I learned so much working there I left with extra skills and knowledge that can bring extra revenue for my house every way tax time. Training is done every year to keep all employees informed on new laws good company
good,This is an enjoyable place to work. The only drawback is that the work is seasonal and not year-round. There is a high level of collegiality so it is easy to learn and improve rapidly.
good,"H&R Block is a professional workplace without being stressful. The work is simple at times, it is never boring. The people are friendly, fun, and truly care."
good,This is an awesome company to work for. I love being part of the HR Block family just wished we didn't have to take a 8 week furlough. Great team work.
good,"Good atmosphere, good easy job, just sucks its seasonal. Would come in, open the office, set it up for the day. Make phone calls to clients regarding services offered and scheduling appointments."
good,"This company, overall is very knowledgeable in the tax industry. It probably has one of the best Tax Schools in the Nation. The workplace culture, is pretty casual; which has its pros and cons. What I liked about this company was the thorough certification classes available. What I dislike about this company; is when their Peak hits; they throw any return at any tax pro; just to get the sale through. I've seen it happen too many times.. Additionally, their corporate office books clients with first available tax pro; this highly upsets returning clients who have repeatedly complained; they weren't given varied schedule options with the prior tax pros. Some clients have even cancelled the corporate bookings; and called the local offices to reschedule for themselves.(Example: 2nd year tax pro given rental property, depreciation and K1 returns, with everyone else stopping to help them through those unqualified returns.) To me, this is treating clients like a ""drive through service."" Clients know who they trust and want; especially if they've been returning repeatedly. Stop, throwing clients at anyone to make the sale; and, give clients the respect to make an informed appointment decision."
good,"You bring a client into your office ask some questions, give some advice, and enter their information in the tax software that you would learn about in the course they run and you have to take before you can be hired as a Tax Pro."
good,It was a very good place to learn how to talk to clients and fix their problems. I learned a lot about how to deal with issues on a daily basis and I had a great staff to learn from
good,"Working here, especially at the front desk, meant that you got to see first hand everyone who walked through the door. Majority of the time, the clients were polite and respectful but you do see some coming in yelling and complaining about pricing."
good,"The team was very friendly, caring, understanding."
good,"This is a great learning experience and especially if you like working with numbers.  Steady paced, it was seasonal, unless you decide to stay in for a career opportunity. Must be a team player to make sure the day runs smoothly."
good,"I took the job for some extra income. They gave me training and support to succeed. I learned a lot and was part of a team. Really enjoyed the work, and the people."
good,"Working at H&R Block, it is fast-paced.  You are constantly helping clients file their taxes, or helping with a letter they have received from either the IRS or the State.  I find that the hardest part of the job, having to deliver bad news to clients.  The best part is helping the clients."
good,I enjoyed helping to keep the tax professionals time management on track & learning about the services during the time I worked there.  The tax professionals had wonderful ongoing relationships with their clients serving them year after year & were available & open to answering all client concerns & questions as well as working together.
good,"I enjoy helping people complete their taxes.  As the office manager, I liked the challenge of getting staff to collaborate.  Only drawback is the pay.  The incentive I feel should be straight commission."
good,Great place to work to start your career and get some experience.  Not somewhere you can plan to have a long lasting career however you will be exposed to a number of training opportunities to prepare you for you for that next move.
good,"I enjoy the job, but they were not truthful about the amount of hours I would get. I was told that it would last for the entire tax season, but they have already starting to cut hours down to nothing."
good,"We are hard workers we are very busy through out tax season, computer tech needs to be fixed constantly slows down. A lot of client interaction a lot of growth opportunities"
good,This is a good temporary or seasonal job to supplement your income. Management would like to see everyone take the tax preparers course but that is not for everyone. Very nice people but don't expect raises or advancement. It's pocket money.
good,Worked at H&R Block for one tax season. Learned a ton about taxes I didn't previously know. Training before the season began was truly informative and enjoyable. Would strongly recommend taking their Income Tax Course to anyone.
good,"Seasonal good for Retires or stay at home mother's"
good,As a new tax preparer you have the opportunity to prepare 2-3 tax reports a day. The more experienced tax preparers were always helpful and available to answer questions. They were also open to teaching you and sharing their knowledge. There was a variety of culture within the workplace and everyone got along well. I learned a lot and was sad to stop working for the company due to relocating to another state.
good,"HR block  have flexible time and you can choose your own hours, its a happy environment to work and everybody treats you like their family. The  manager and coworkers are really good."
good,"H&R block provides a tax course before hiring agents, this allows for easy entry by people who have customer service experience. Many opportunities arise if you're able to work hard but it is mostly a seasonal position for the rest."
good,"Answered the telephone, filed our copy of income taxes, cashier, scheduled appointments and called/text/email reminder of clients' scheduled appointment time, maintained office cleanliness and office machines, housekeeping, assisted tax professionals with client services."
good,After attending the tax course you really get a great understanding of how to prepare taxes. So much information and not a lot of time to learn very quick paced but they are preparing you for what tax season will be like.
good,"I enjoyed the tax work we did. Always a new experience, and always a enjoyable work environment. People were great to work with and hard working. Tax clients were very nice people. Always lots to learn and just when you had the work down, they would give you something else to learn. I had a great experience. There were always tax pros who were willing to answer your questions and teach you something new. Also always had plenty of work to do."
good,Great training ground for Tax Professional career via Tax Pro in-house training course.  Excellent for all adult ages.  A wealth of knowledge to draw from in office with returning Tax Professionals.
good,Very professional job. Very organized. Staff had good repoire with clients. Everyone was allowed to break when it was convenient for them.  Very relaxed atmosphere but time sensitive.
good,This was a great place to work. It was my first job. The only thing I can say is that you do find yourself in some pretty intense situations because it all involves money and there can be relatively explosive disagreements that usually take place between the customers and who receives what. Also when they come to pick up their return and they dont have an ID they get pretty angry because you can't just hand checks over to anyone.
good,"Like to work with numbers and people."
good,Enjoyed working during tax season. H & R Block has a great training program.  The yearly continuing education proved to be more then helpful.  Staying up to day with tax laws.
good,The hours were great! Co-workers were enjoyable to work with.  I input customers as they called or entered the facility to do their income taxes.  I enjoyed working with the community and meeting new people on a daily basis.
good,"My typical day at the H & R Block office started at opening the office in the morning .  Make the coffee ,  Set up the sign and balloons. Check the appointment  manager to see when the first client was set to arrive  then proceed to check the emails and print out the reports. My manager was a wonderful guy .He was knowledgeable and always helped me if I had any questions, The work culture was very upbeat and friendly, my Tax professionals did not compete with each other over clients like I heard some offices did, they helped one another like a family. "
good,"Working at this company was great. From the beginning it feels not a lot but few minutes in, you are busy like every hours. The wok environment  was great."
good,Fun place to work. Competitive but caring.  The culture is addictive. Mostly seasonal so benefits are lacking Developed many friendships while I was there.
good,The work was interesting. You could work the hours you wanted.  The owner was a people person and great with clients and staff.  The more experienced staff was supportive of the newer staff.
good,H&R Block is a good place to learn taxes. They have classes to advanced your knowledge about taxes. They give CE classes that are required by federal and state government for paid tax preparers.
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet customers as they come in."
good,I really do not wish to participate in this review. Thank you for asking. If you like hard work and a great environment with little to no pay then this is the job for you!
good,As a seasonal part time Tax preparer for H and R Block I enjoyed interacting with various personalities for both internal and external customers.  The position encouraged staying on task with changes in the tax codes and rules.  The hardest part of the job was when a client had more advanced tax issues and I had to refer them to a more compatible preparer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when another preparer would seek my assistance on a tax issue or concern.
good,"Welcomes visitors by greeting them, in person or on the telephone; answering or referring inquiries. Directs visitors by maintaining employee and department directories; giving instructions. Maintains security by following procedures; monitoring logbook; issuing visitor badges."
good,My first manager was great to work for.  very patient and allow you to work around class schedule and when kids get out of school.  My last manager and his wife were not as helpful with info needed to know.  They tell you will let you work around when kids out of school but then  they didnt.
good,"Some days we had very long hours, but it was enjoyable due to the fact that we had great staff in our office. Not all offices are the same, but in ours, we had great customers and an awesome staff!"
good,"The tax season is a limited time period. Very fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you build the your clients. They look at you as an extension of their family, for the most part. Finding ways to save them on their taxes due, is a wonderful feeling. Each client is like a new puzzle. Whether you are filing their taxes for them or helping them with tax issues."
good,"I enjoyed all the people that I got to work for and with here. This was a temporary position for the tax season.  This job is fast paced and stressful, I just wish it paid better."
good,"There were certain things I really liked about working at H & R Block.  I enjoyed the relaxed office environment and the autonomy I had over my own work. I felt that after being there for a few years, and building my client base, I deserved some sort of advancement.  My advancement in the company consisted more in title, than actual increased pay.  My manager was fair and very flexible with schedules."
good,"A great place to work but stressful dealing with clients personal information, enjoyed meeting new clients and talking to people on the telephone and in person"
good,"A typical day was make sure the office was presentable and clean at all time. I learned many things such as learning more how to do more complex taxes, how to use a helium tank. Be able to sell the services they offer to clients. Management was great. They recognized the work we do. Offered their help in anyway. The hardest part was being able to do get taxes done before the next clients appointment."
good,Its a good company to work. The management  people are very nice. Its a very interesting job. Sometimes stressful but you learn a lot. If you like customer service this is a job for you.
good,"I would recommend H&R Block,for anyone looking for a part-time seasonal job. They offer on the job training and is so flexible when it comes to scheduling of their employee."
good,"I was hired in as a manager of a branch in Fort Wayne. I was trained as a first year tax professional, but they were short handed on managers and I tested well so they gave me the position. It was a great experience. The senior tax pros were so helpful and made me feel comfortable. They truly trained me to be a manager with the help  of their experience and dedication to their company. By year end I was able to do tax returns that were far above a first year tax accountant's requirements. I learned so much and had an amazing staff. I did not return the following year because I had taken a full time job and could not commit enough hours to HR Block."
good,Must be able to multi task at a high level during peek. Must have great communication skills since you encounter face to face everyday with very different situations.
good,"It was a very fast-paced, learning environment in which uses your basic math skills and computer skills daily. There are people there to help you learn and improve your abilities when time permits."
good,Do you job and it is great. Free lunch during peak. You set your own hours. Boss is easy to talk to and work with. Co-workers are ready to get a long with.
good,Building a client base and the returning clients because they trust you. Flexible hours is a good thing. What I have learned is that you really have to listen to your clients to better serve them.
good,Very fast pace place to work. Completing taxes for clients was a new venture for me. I love numbers and helping people save money. So I went outside my career of Medical for a bit to give it a try. There is alot more that goes into it than meets the eye.
good,Very structured when it comes to tax preparation and compliance of laws. Good place to work if you need very flexible hours. How far you want to go depends totally on how much training you want to do.
good,"HR Block is a temporary position during Tax Season only.   Face to Face, personal and informative interview. I learned that every year or so tax laws changes. Management has its politics. There's no workplace culture.  The most enjoyable part of the job is diversity."
good,It's a great place work. When I first started working at block I was looking to learn more about my tax situation and figured I could earn a little money while i learned. Blocks continuing educations is amazing and you're only limited by how much you decide to move up.
good,a well diverse group that loving sharing their experience and knowledge of the company. welling to help out in any situation. very supportive group of individuals.
good,Great seasonal job that my skill set was well suited for.  My experience at the IRS was very helpful in this position.  I am very familiar with tax law and codes. My customer service skills were acquired while working the toll-free lines for taxpayers.
good,Working here you have lots of clients coming in and out of there.. All the tax pros there are friendly and efficient.  Treat everyone with respect. Great place to be
good,H&R Block has been a stable company for many years.  They are working on ensuring they stay up with the times both technically and by process implementation.
good,Worked with clients to help them with their income taxes so they could file them and understand the results. Answered questions for the clients. Helped out as receptionist.
good,"Spend most of your time doing tax returns. Types of returns depends on skill levels. Paid on commission (if you make enough commission wise) and hourly."
good,A good place to learn how to communicate with individual clients and solve their problems specifically. Also a start to transform myself from an university student to a professional employee.
good,H & R block is a great place to work to get the experience doing taxes as well as learning how to run an office environment. They are very hands on and give you the training you need to succeed.
good,The company was always a place with a good business culture and professionalism to work in. They have a long and structured training curriculum that allows the employees to enter the job position with limited transition.
good,"This job was a part-time seasonal and I prepared and organized correspondence for clients who came to file taxes, answered phones, scheduled appointments, made sure Tax Professionals were assisted as needed with copies and files, etc. The Manager was friendly and cooperative, and the staff was friendly. The hardest part was balancing this job with my full-time job and my school schedule all at the same time, but I managed. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and meeting people."
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work if you enjoy helping people. It is also a great place to work if you enjoy making temporary friends. I have met some wonderful people in my time working with H&R Block. The only down-side is that you cannot work there all year as a steady job or steady source of income. They have really flexible schedules and there's a place for anyone beings there are so many different positions. It is not a physically challenging place of work, but it can get stressful just like any job can. The rate of pay is decent. Tax professionals and office managers work very hard, and I don't believe H&R Block rewards their employees as well as they should. Overall I would give them a 3.5 or 4 out of 5."
good,"This position was seasonal from January through April, and I only worked one tax season. I enjoyed the people I worked with and never felt that the job was overly stressful or demanding. I began the job with steady 8 hour days but that was reduced after tax business slowed down for our location. I developed a good working relationship with the manager of my location and would have enjoyed working with her again if I hadn't moved out of state. The hardest part of the job was not always being able to take a break depending on the business of the office and how many tax professionals were in attendance. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and seeing them receive the help they needed with their tax preparation."
good,Clients are friendly and patient. Phone calls are periodically out the day . Tax pro's trys to satisfy all clients as well as CSP's . Marketing and Promotions are interesting.
good,"great chance to learn and put in practice all concepts you have learned "
good,"Although I only worked there about two months, this tax season, I plan on working there more next year.  I am going to attend a training course this summer so that I can hold a different position next winter."
good,"I was looking for a part-time seasonal position to ""get my feet wet"" in the field.  H&R Block and the staff at my office were encouraging, enthusiastic, and supportive.  I intend to work here again next Tax Season.  If income tax reform does go through, the hours next year may be rather shorter."
good,"This was an enjoyable place to work. The only drawback is the fact that it is seasonal employment only, so it lacks in terms of long term potential. However, they offer continuing education to help you obtain higher pay each season."
good,"Love doing taxes. The overall idea of the business is good but their compensation package keeps changing so you don't get paid very much for working you butt off during tax season. The company keeps raising their prices to the customer too so people keep doing their own online. HR Block is paying for advertising and other things they don't need, charging customers too much and losing them, and then paying employees less and less. Fun group of people to work with and I love the work though!"
good,Good training and follow up with other experienced tax professionals. Performed different office functions on a daily basis. Continued daily training and briefings on current happenings. Enjoyed helping customers and putting them at ease about their tax situation.
good,"hardest part of job is dealing with clients that complain about the price when you agree that it is too high "
good,"Fast paced and continuous change..  Good team work and management.  "
good,I enjoyed all but one of my coworkers. I loved going to work everyday. the customers were great. I never felt I wasn't being used to my full potential.
good,Working as a tax preparer can be an intense experience.  The franchise office where I work places emphasis on accuracy and customer service.  We receive all the training and updates needed to prepare returns.  The hardest part of the job is telling a client that they have a balance due.  I love working with people.
good,"I really enjoyed my job.  I continually learned new information daily and was able to get help with any issues I was having.  Loved my manager, she took great care of us all.  The hardest part was working with rude clients.  The most enjoyable was actually preparing the taxes."
good,Working with different people everyday if very challenging but interesting at the same time. People are relying on you in explaining clearly and in details what is their refund or tax owing depending on  their tax situation.
good,You come in with many expectation you learn a lot the should make a few adjustments in the prices for the customer overall you meet a lot of people and we tried to help the customer
good,At the office I work for they are great team of  workers. The manager of the Menomonie WI cares for the tax pros and their success.
good,"Opportunity to prepare many tax returns with variety of individuals' situations. Season has two peak periods--end of Jan-Feb and first two weeks of April. Work load slow rest of time."
good,I liked working with clients and being able to help them fill their personal income tax returns! Management was great and they let us work independently and only required us to report to management if necessary.
good,"Yearly classes are mandatory, due to the ever-changing IRS rules and requirements for Tax Preparers.  Without attending the update classes each Fall, you cannot continue working for H&R Block...which is a good thing...it's just the pay that isn't great! Management at the top level is super...but sometimes the individual office Managers fall short.  It was a life-saver for me, but was only the solution for approximately 90 days each year."
good,"Lot's of online tools available, but the available work hours BEFORE tax season is very minimal to really grasp the job.  Then it's instantly crunch time, then CUT THE HOURS BACK again after first peak.  No job security."
good,"Enjoyed assisting clients with vital area -- yearly income tax preparation.  Company provided excellent training to ensure accurate completion of various types of 1040 tax returns.  Enjoyed working with supportive, experienced (17+ years) tax professionals; management provided excellent guidance and receptive to employees needs; job enhanced conflict resolution skills and allowed employee an opportunity to utilize knowledge received during extensive training programs."
good,It was a nice place to work and a good company but I didn't care for sitting at a desk and on a phone for eight or more hours a day. I got bored. I prefer a faster pace and face to face customer interaction.
good,Management was very helpful and environment was very family orientated. I loved the staff and the planned events. Best place I had worked for I loved this company.
good,"I loved working at H&R Block in the beginning but each year there is more bs*** they put you through. The management is not the best. The continuing education is literally the best thing because you can take any training the whole year for just $20. They keep on lowering the salary. The CEO/ marketing department and whoever else decides the marketing projects , also suck in making appropriate and sensible decisions to market the company ."
good,Good environment to work in. Scheduling is handled fairly. They are flexible with their hours to accommodate those with busy schedules.
good,"I work as a CSP at a franchise location, so my experience isn't necessarily the typical experience of CSPs working for company-owned H&R Block offices or other H&R Block franchise offices. I enjoy my work and I learn more about taxes every day. My management is great, and my workplace is relaxed but professional. The best part is helping clients determine appointment times, explaining new or changing tax policies, and assisting clients in general. It can be difficult sometimes when there are clients from multiple platforms (in-person and on the phone at the same time) and I feel discouraged occasionally when a client's question is beyond my expertise, but the Tax Pros that I work with are knowledgeable, helpful, and willing to give advice, even if that means the client ultimately doesn't file with our office."
good,"Great Staff and friendly people to work with."
good,I found it very rewarding to work for this company.Work schedurle was very flexable.Staff were very helpful and pleasant. Manager always mad time for her employees. Would higly recommend  workeng for this company.
good,"I have some tax preparation knowledge. I was responsible for answering the phone, taking messages, making appointments for clients, connected walk in clients with a tax preparer, cash handling, filing, distributing refunds to clients, printing/scanning tax information and computer knowledge."
good,"Its okay because its temporary for client service professionals but I did learn a whole lot when talking with client about the services HR Block provides, the tax professionals, and any other concerns the client had"
good,"I like working at Block. I worked here several years. We have our regulars and they make it worthwhile coming in to work. Good job to pick up a few extra bucks, but it's not going to make you rich."
good,"Very good experience, learned a lot about taxes, all co-workers and management was very friendly.  The pay wasn't worth the hours put into it, since I worked on commission, there was a lot of down time."
good,Everyone who worked there was very nice. Everyone would help you out if you needed it. This is a good part time seasonal job to have. This is a good job to have to start off in customer service.
good,The atmosphere of the office was very professional and up beat. The staff was very caring and understanding. Everyone loved helping others and truely enjoyed working there.
good,"Job was seasonal, had a great time working for H&R Block and also they have great team work. The environment is always changing & the best of this job is able to help customer."
good,C'est une très bonne compagnie mais étant donné l'arrivé des préparation d'impôt plus facile à compléter sur internet cela à donner une baisse de revenu
good,Lots of work but exciting and I learned a lot. Had different jobs to do everyday which kept me from being bored. Loved teaching taxes
good,Can get very busy but also we have slow days. Deal with a lot of angry and rude people. Must be patient and detail oriented. You file a lot of paperwork and make appointments as well as handle walk in clients. People you work with are normally very nice. Not much chance of getting a raise and sometimes it can be hard to get hours if too many people work in the office..
good,I have been working for H&R Block for the last 4 years.  Its a great company that offers a lot of training for its associates.  Compensation is sufficient for the job.  I just don't like the emphasis on cross selling extras to clients
good,Working for H&R Block was like a paid internship for tax prep.  I enjoyed learning and working there and would recommend it to anyone that has to pay taxes.
good,"very good place to work, very family oriented, and hard working people. Managers are very understanding and compassionate. Work environment is slow but during tax season can be very fast pace"
good,"- I would visit a cluster of offices and make sure they were up to date on marketing activities as well as help with anything the district marketing coordinator needed"
good,Preparing peoples tax is always a challenging experience because no 2 people have the same time of tax preparation.  This so many different scenarios that come to the office that we do a lot of research and preparation to keep up with the new tax laws.
good,Making product recommendation to customers workin hard to reach my task and goal.Have time to work have doing what I like and helping poeple.
good,Small office with about twelve employees.  Everyone worked together and with a positive atmosphere.  We would take turns bringing in lunch or snacks; help each other if someone ran into an IRS question.  Looked after each others clients and had fun.  The hardest part of the job was explaining to clients why they had to pay money into the IRS and give suggestions on how to eliminate that problem.  I considered myself as having a great team.
good,"1.On the busy day I will be preparing income tax for clients and on the slow day I will mark cold calls to clients and set up appointments."
good,"good company to work for , friendly enviornment helpful co-workers, flexible work schedule great for a second job, diverse groups of people to work along side and great customers."
good,I make sure the customers   orders was fresh and hot.   I always  let them kno how long the wait time would if its more than 2 minutes. I enjoy working at fast-food  because the time always went by fast.
good,"you get to make your own schedule and choose the money you want to make."
good,"-Scheduled clients appointments, greeted incoming clients, managed documents"
good,great place to work if you like teamwork. schedule is flexible. employees help each other with job training. there are perks of being employee such as local discounts. the work process is very organized.
good,My typical day involved running the financials and marketing plan for the day and week to come. Review staffing requirements and schedule employees and manage payroll . I also handled all customer issues and address all filing rejections. The balance off my day was spent doing tax returns and distributing work to other tax pros. I learned a great deal about working with the public and marketing to the community around the office. Management provide goals and tracked results but allowed you to control your own destiny. My staff and co-workers were some of the best people in the  tax business. The hardest part of the job was not being too personally involved with your clients and their tax situation. The best part of the job was finding all the deductions and benefits my clients was entitled to.
good,It was short but took from the knowledge I learned and use it for careers to come. I liked working with the customer base that came in .
good,"As a first year tax associate, my time at H&R Block was enlightening. I was given training before employment which covered basic federal tax code and touched on Massachusetts tax code. The training was defiantly worth while. It gave me the appropriate knowledge to prepare simple to moderate personal tax returns and a better understanding of financial planning."
good,"Working as a Client Services Professional, was a great job that offered flexibility to work around other jobs since the position is seasonal. The job itself is fairly easy, and once you get the hang of the job its actually pretty fun. My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job, was that you would sometimes have hateful clients with poor attitudes."
good,"I was originally hired to be part-time seasonal, however, I have been working full time and more (approx. 75 hours per week during peak). I asked to work this many hours and my boss has actually had to make me leave early because he's worried I'm going to burn myself out. "
good,My typical day on the job was to make sure the deposit was made that day. Make sure the workers had everything that need. The hardest part of my job was trying get my co-workers to list to what I was telling them for day task at hand. And try to deal with rude customers on the daily basis.
good,"The people are great and the work is fantastic. Learning new things becomes an adventure, and meeting new people can be life changing for developing strong relationships."
good,"Start early and work late.I learned to manage my time,had excellent"
good,My first tax year provided me with a good learning experience and I am looking forward to returning for the upcoming season.
good,The company is very interesting to work for. The  management is always attentive to the employees and customers. Every day is a different challenge.
good,"They are  very professional and team players, This is really a great company. They offer a lot of different services for your taxes."
good,"Working for this company gave me a chance to see the inner workings of the tax industry.. Customer service to the general public in a very comfortable setting,   Also gave me the chance to enhance my office skills."
good,"The work environment is very supportive, flexible and I enjoy the work atmosphere. There is room for growth and it is encouraged."
good,"H & R Block during tax season is a very fast pace, high pressure, demanding job with very tight dead lines. The job also requires the ability to be exceptional with multi tasking skills and endurance for excessive hours, often putting in overtime hours to get the job completed on time. It also requires a high need for confidentiality as well as being sympathetic as you are dealing with financial situation for people, I thrived and loved this job and the owner each year gave me more responsibility to the point he would be away from the office for 2 or 3 days a week leaving me in charge of the company. He was also always able to keep everyone on the lighter side when things got extremely busy in the office."
good,"Job was fun to work at for the most part, and the management was supportive, but I love the working with numbers and people part."
good,I enjoyed my years at H & R Block and would not have left if health insurance coverage was offered.  I was always treated as a professional and learned excellent customer service skills as part of my management training.  Every day was different from the one before and offered challenges.
good,"I handled all paperwork, maintained the work area, greeted customers, and helped the tax professionals with every day needs."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and hopefully I will be up for rehire the next tax season to come. Co-workers could improve on enthusiasm in gaining knowledge in providing answers regarding tax questions based on experience. This helps provide the front desk receptionist provide excellent customer service by providing fast results as customer inquiries are made.
good,"management was very helpful. great company to work for. The co-worker are very helpful and co-cooperative. I enjoy working with this , the hours were very flexible."
good,The company offers a lot of changes for the customers to improve business for it.  During training it is gruesome to input a lot of the knowledge  But overall it is a great place to work
good,"easy going colleages, 4 months training before work, you got your own office. job is pretty easy but fast-paced. overall good."
good,"Can be a fun place to work with the right supervisor/manager."
good,"Help people make good choices in regards to their tax situations. Give advice for the future. Have fun, market and meet new people."
good,"receive packages "
good,"I was responsible for the running of a very busy tax office for 3 years before moving over to the premium office where I was able to work more closely with tax clients. "
good,"I enjoyed working at H & R Block in Houston, TX."
good,"A typical day at work was challenging, coaching and praising my team on our productivity and their professional growth and development.  Invested much time in education and advancement for each employee. Focused team building and collaboration to address client issues and concerns.  I learned that I should always strive to improve in every area of my professional education and experiences.  I have also learned that I can achieve anything I want to with the right attitude and focus.  My management team always had an open door policy and were willing to listen and give constant advice and guidance when I came to them with questions.  They were very thorough in my training and professional development. I always received feedback on my performance. My co workers were team players.  I worked with a really great group of people.  I consider them family.   The hardest part of my job was taking the seasonal break every year. 8 weeks of not working and doing a job that I enjoy  was rough.  The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching customer service skills classes to all the employees before tax season."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with interacting with clients. Normally, it is a fast paced environment where you are constantly moving and interacting with people. However, the environment and atmosphere can be positive and joyful. The hardest part is dealing with misunderstandings between clients and tax professionals. The most enjoyable part is the relationships you develop between the clients, tax professionals, and yourself."
good,I enjoyed my position at H & R Block.  I just wish I could find similar job that was not temporary.  I made some great friends in my co-workers.
good,"Since my work at H&R Block was just an internship, it was fun and I was very dedicated. The Hiring Manager wanted me to stay and work full time but i had to go back to Georgia and couldn't stay in Florida. Between answering the phone and making appointments, the day would go by fast. Clients walking in and out, happy with our service, I always kept a smile and no one left a bad comment about my work."
good,"A day at work consist of greeting our clients, making an appointment for a tax professional. I learned how to schedule appointments."
good,u learn a lot about taxes and u meet a lot of people  its a fast pace environment and fun nice people and friends ect ect different places

good,"Prepared international taxes for U.S. citizens, coworkers are great people to work with and will help you out with anything you need help with."
good,H&R Block being seasonal temporary position would be a good fit for someone looking to have free time outside of tax prep season.
good,"I have worked with H&R Block for the last 5 years, and while sometimes a stressful job, I have learned a great deal about patience, customer service, and team work. The best part of the job was getting to interact with so many different people. The hardest part of the job was working 7 days a week, 9am-9pm hours. My schedule was usually all over the place."
good,"A day at work waiting for clients to come by and filed there Income Taxes with this company, stand and Advertises. My co-workers where great and helpfull all the time. The hardes part it pleasing the clients making sure there are satifying with there taxes"
good,I enjoy working here. My coworkers are very friendly and helpful. If I have a question someone is always willing to help. My manager works with each of us to assure we receive proper training so we can provide quality service to our clients.
good,"Basic reception job, learned how to do basic office jobs. Friendly staff, however it is only seasonal and not much room to advance. Also, their online hiring process is disastrous."
good,Learned about tax credits provide knowledge to customers. Find out if there will be a tax return or if tax money should be paid to the state or federal.
good,"The management supported staff. They were a family."
good,High intensity with tight goals and aims. Staff members are great. Short season intense work. Training is fantastic. Flexible hours. each office self managed
good,"Doing taxes was a constant learning process.  You always had references to articles, books, and co-workers to do clients taxes correctly.  H&R Block required that you know tax laws and that you kept up to date for any new changes to the laws.  The training is outstanding in preparing you to do taxes.  Customer service for clients was also emphasized. "
good,"Discuss marketing strategies for office, assist other professionals with new tax software, and prepare clients tax returns."
good,"Typical day at work: Helped internal clients with questions or problems, client resolution, leading my team towards office level goals that were inline with District goals, drove myself towards personal level goals and helped internal clients towards their own goals, prepared complex tax returns, attended weekly meetings with District Manager then cascaded to my team, performed weekly huddles to keep team informed, praise for jobs well done, and energized towards meeting our goals.  I learned how to produce better performance from myself, a more professional and friendly way to make external clients feel at home and less anxious when they had to wait in line.  The hardest part of the my job was time management; it was hard to learn that I could not be everywhere and do every thing at once.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the growth and confidence build with my team, each individually.  I had a strong upper management, but felt that they did not keep their promises and there were time when a particular manager would work my team behind my back."
good,"Seasonal employment, continued education, excellent instructors, loved working  with everyone"
good,"balanced reports for 8 locations"
good,"I worked here for one tax season, as a second job at night.  My co-workers for the most part was doing the same as me."
good,"Good job and great co-workers, learned a lot great people"

good,I liked working at H&R Block.  It was a very busy environment and it kept you on your toes.  The other employees were very easy to get along with.
good,Worked with a different staff each year. Learned more about company each year and new IRS laws. Training required yearly to assist you with up to date information.
good,"8 to 12 hour day depending on clients"
good,The HR BLOCK is good place to work. I worked very hard and got my goal.
good,I enjoyed the office life dealing with the office manager and clients. My boundaries were pushed to make me a more knowledgeable and skillful asset to the company. It was difficult to correctly handle the contrasting views of the corporate managers versus the office manager at times but overall a great experience.
good,"I had a great learning experience. ive learned to do business taxes, book keeping for stores, and teach typically any business in America how to make money."
good,"This employer is international and looks after their people, but they sometimes forget the little people. They furnish nice offices and supplies are plentiful to get the job done. Typically a day in the office is to clock in, check the appointment file, if you do not have any appointments then I would start calling my previous clients that had not been in yet and see if they were ready to make an appointment."

good,"I enjoy helping people by preparing their taxes but when the tax becomes a burden, it's hard to see people upset. Preparing taxes is educational because of the requirement to take classes to stay on top of tax updates, but it's enjoyable because it allows us to help people understand an otherwise confusing topic. Our manager is always helpful and co-workers are friendly so our work environment breeds success."
good,"I always started my day opening the office with good people. We would potluck breakfast during opening. Once the doors opened, it was go, go, go. We stayed busy the whole day. Most clients were a joy to work with. There was always that feeling of knowing you made even just one person's day when the required services were complete. There were even a few that came back year after year and would bring lunch because I gave them quality service."

good,"From the time the door opens until the time it closes, this location was by far one of the busiest branches. Between handling 7 lines, scheduling appointments, managing walk in clients as well as the reception area, there was always something to do. In fact, sometimes it would get so busy you couldn't get a break - and that wasn't even peak season."
good,"busy fast pace "

good,"Great place to work because hours are flexible.  Co-workers are friendly and helpful.  "
good,"Learned day to day running of a business, mixing with co workers and working side by side. Learning from co workers their way of handling business issues. "

good,This was my second tax season with H&R Block. I enjoyed working with the other tax professionals and learning more about preparing taxes on a daily basis. My office manager worked with me whenever I had problems with my schedule or a tax return. 
good,I enjoy working with all different types of individuals with different tax needs. I enjoy documentation challenges and I am able to handles matters in great detail. My communication and analytical skills are very strong.
good,"My experience as a seasonal employee of H&R Block is the company as a whole cares about clients, employees and its communities.  Management keeps employees informed of matters on a district, regional and national level and immediately addresses urgent concerns.  Our Tax Pros receive the best training available throughout the year and implement that training during the relatively brief tax season. It's not the kind of thing that just anybody can do, and the company seeks out the most dedicated people to be company associates. This company realizes that to stay in business it has to always do the right thing and do it quickly."

good,I worked sometimes up to 12 hours a day. I was kept very busy.
good,I prepared tax returns for clients. My co-workers were great people and enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was letting clients know that they owed money when they thought they were getting a refund. Otherwise it was keeping up with all the law changes.
good,"I enjoyed going to work each day and coming home with more tax knowledge than I came in with. Everyday I not only improved my computer & customer service skills, but I found fun and easy ways to interact with my co-workers and learn from each and everyone of them. It wasn't hard to feel comfortable around the office and I found it easy to ask questions. The hardest part of the job was that there is a lot riding on your own tax knowledge and you need to be fully aware of what every step of the process is. I liked that management had set our own personal goals as well as office goals and each week we were updated on our performances and what we did/didn't need to improve on."

THe hardest part is explaining to someone they owe the IRS. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the faces when people get a huge refund.
good,"A typical day at H & R Block is one full of commitments and obligations. Attention to detail is needed. I've acquired a vast amount of tax law knowledge and experience in Income Tax Preparation process, including compliance and audit process with IRS. I have developed great interpersonal skills. The hardest thing about the job is keeping up with the busy work schedule and demanding clientele. However, that is what makes this job challenging and enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work for me was finding all the credits and deductions for my clients with a thorough check. I learned that you just don't work for a company, but also for the customers that pay you for your job skills and your knowledge of your job. Management was there if you needed it, but we were self-managed and worked in a teamwork environment. The hardest part of the job was you had to go home. The most enjoyable part was to; WOW the client, do a great job, client satisfication, retention, and you got a referral."
good,"During tax season, I primarily prepare individual and corporate income tax returns. I'm also responsible for scheduling employees every other week. I'm responsible for maintaining a large network of computer systems; this computer system involves a server, rapid refund computer, desktop computers and multiple printers. I am the office customer service representative; I address all issues with professionalism and respect. During the summer, I usually handle client audit situations. Starting in August, I begin teaching individual income tax classes and preparing for the next tax season. During the off season, I upgrade all systems and keep all computer software and hardware up-to-date with national standards. The hardest part of my job is keeping up-to-date with the ever changing tax laws and keeping our clients informed of such changes. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people obtain the best possible refund/balance due based from their tax information for that year."
good,"A typical day at work involved making sure enough staff was available to cover the client load, handling problems with clients, answering tax questions, verifying payroll, and explaining the benefit of H & R products to clients. I learned I enjoy helping clients obtain the best product for their need. As manager, I tried to listen to my co-workers and adapt to their needs. The hardest part of the job was the disappointment a tax pro would experience when a client walked out and refused to pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was witnessing the positive tax experiences the clients were able to receive from the tax pros."
good,"My typical day at H& R block was to great customers with a smile and prepare their Income tax returns. I learned how to prepare personal and small business returns. I management was very helpful and easy to work for. My co-workers were ready and willing to help out with any problems I encountered.

good,It was long days but I did enjoy working with the public. Every return was a different story.

A typical day was working in the scheduling software, answering emails, phones, fax, paying invoices, arranging managing meetings, and making sure all the retail locations look the same. It was fast pace, exciting and my co workers were the best."
good,You can work towards education for free. Great team environment and hands on experience.
good,"During my ongoing tenure I've learned a great deal. Specifically dictating the flow of an office, as well as honing my communication skills. Working in an industry which either generates or displaces client's income can become extremely volatile. By prioritizing work assignments I am able to seamlessly service customers regardless if problems should arise, which is by far the most enjoyable experience."
good,"Enjoy doing taxes, meeting new people and being able to help my clients."
good,"Its a great 2nd job. Since the majority of the employees leave after the tax season and come back at the end of the year, it easily becomes almost like a small family feeling. It can get pretty intense during the peak season with personalities especially those of the long timers, but peak only lasts a few weeks."
good,"I have worked in several departments in different time periods - Emerald Card, Bank accounts, Seasonal Hire, Mystery calling... I enjoyed all departments for the most part. Although I have had some really great Supervisors, the most challenging part was having one or two Supervisors who were not very helpful and made the job difficult instead of pleasant. Office politics and young, inexperienced leaders in a position of authority caused some issues as well."
good,"A typical day consists of recording bank transactions, ledgers, and accounts. I learned as an Office Manager how to record bank transactions and resolve account checking discrepancies. It is very helpful and comforting to be working amongst seasoned professionals in their careers. As a seasonal hire the hardest part of the job was learning the tax industry within a short time period. The most enjoyable part of the job is witnessing satisfaction and client retention. It is an indication of superb service."
good,This place was really great about working a round my schedule. People were great in my office. Unfortunately it was a seasonal job so there was really no chance for advancement or benifits.

good,"busy environment"
good,This is my second season as a CSP and I love it. I followed my manager from a different office. She is fantastic and everything manager should be! The pay could be better and a bonus for the position would be more incentive to make every opportunity to schedule an appointment count
good,My coworkers and everyone i worked with was so awesome!! I loved going to work each and every day.every time i got called in to work i was excited.it was a family not just coworkers..
good,Managment was amazing. The people were super helpful. I loved my job. It was fun. I learned a lot. If I could I would go back to this job again. So much training and a lot of hard work. Totally worth it all.
good,"Block is the gold standard and remains so as we deliver tax services at the highest level of accuracy each year.  I am enjoy both the tax professionals and clients.  The variety of expertise is both interesting and challenging.  However, those qualities are what sets us appart from any other tax service."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job , is getting to meet different people on a daily basis!! Helping people budget their lives, helping with their taxes and financial situations"
good,"I had a excellent time learning the job, but it took me awhile to catch on. Each manager who came to the office helped each employee learn the job. The Corporate office was very helpful, wanted us to learn the job. The Human Resource Department was always available to help out as well."
good,"Recently, I had an epiphany and decided to embrace doing my taxes. I finally realized the power of doing our own taxes. I could input different scenarios and see how this would impact our taxes. Taxes is one of the biggest expenses you’ll have every year and there are tremendous advantages to understanding the tax codes. Here are just a few things I’ve learned."
good,"Good to start your career after college and get some professional experience. It's good to get your foot in the door with this company. If you're into accounting, you should get started here."

good,I loved working for this company. I was a tax prepare and also the manager. It did not take much for me to move up with the company. We have meetings often and they also motivating you to do more.
good,"When the boss' were there it was a quality work place.  Too much horsing around when they were not present.  Too many unqualified tax representatives - many errors - one in particular, just said the people were ""stupid"" and did not acknowledge her mistakes."
good,Working previously with H& R block gave me a enjoyable opportunity to be included in all tax preparer experience as a receptionist and supervisor. Working with the preparers were great.
good,"I have worked for H&R Block for 25 years and have always enjoyed my position with the Company."
good,"A typical day at work for me began with making coffee. The coffee was there for staff but most specifically for the clients. After that I would log on to the desktop and call clients. The nature of the call was to remind clients of there appointment that day. Then I would greet clients at the door. Most of the time I was scheduling walk in appointments and answering tax related phone calls. At the end, of the day I would tidy up the office, e.g clean the coffee machine, sweep the floor, clean the break room and bathroom."
good,HR prepares you fully before you begin to work. You have alot of support from peers and coaches. Its a very flexible company and they work with your needs.

good,For approx 10 years. I have worked for this company. Went through change of hands to New owners. They have been a blast to work for. They are the best to work for.
good,I worked as a tax specialist for H&R block.  It provided a quality work environment with a flexible schedule.  I primarily worked during tax season.  Good Experience.
good,As a Customer Service Rep at H&R Block you will greet clients as they come through the door.  Some will have an appointment and some are walk-ins.  You are required to make sure no one has a extensive wait time and advise walk-ins of their wait time or encourage them to do a drop off or set an appointment for a later date. You will also create client files and ensure the tax professional has all the information they require to file the clients taxes.  I have worked with some wonderful people and met many more in my time at H&R Block.

good,"H R Block is place to utilize the training and skills obtained from 60 required course. It is a professional, friendly environment. I enjoyed working there during tax season."

good,Trainers are knowledgeable and eager to help. Pace is fast. Software is not difficult to learn. Company hires tax preparers for one season at a time so it is necessary to re-submit application annually.
good,"Great second job. I really enjoyed my time there. Learned a lot."
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a part time job or some experience. You can make your own schedule and work evening hours if you wish. Compensation is minimal until you advance your certifications and bring more clients.

good,Block Works is a very simple system that this company uses. I found the training quick and easy and i loved the branch that i worked at! I can't wait for tax season!
good,I learned more from my supervisor and my workmates. I enjoy this job and I hope I can come back next tax season. I like help a lot of customer to finish their tax return.
good,H&R Block provides training to employees for a low yearly fee; the current price (as of 2019) is $35.00 to update tax knowledge and review. If you are a tax preparer you are required to have so many CEU's every year.
good,Worked with clients to make sure they received the largest tax return they were eligible for or the least they had to pay. Enjoyed working with the clients. Enjoyed the workplace culture
good,"I really benefited from a short commute. "
good,"Pay is good, but very long hours. There are many easy days up until when the tax deadline is close by where everybody is rushing to get their taxes done. Great management."
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot about taxes. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them with their taxes. I would recommend them to others to work for.
good,"I loved working there, its fast pace. Have to be quick your feet an adapt to change, but great starting job. Had a veey good manger that helped me understand everything."
good,"I enjoyed  working with tax preparers and learning in between and I also love the clients. Even tho some may have been frustrated due to taxes, they still remain calm and knowing they were in good hands."
good,I only worked there for a short time during tax season. Unless you are a tax preparer you don't have many chances for advancement. Constant changing of employees was hard at times
good,"Other than regular office drama, that you would get anywhere, it's a great place to work with flexible schedules that you decide. I've made a lot of good friends there, only downside is most offices are only open 4-5 months of the year."
good,"Hour are flexible work at your own pace many online"
good,Great people and clients to work for.  Helping with clients with their taxes for both Federal and State.  I learned a lot about what the government expects from the US citizens.

good,Booked appointments for clients to prepare their tax returns. Called and confirmed clients of appointment date and time. Prepared tax refunds by debit card or cheque.
good,I enjoyed working there but I don't think it would be an enjoyable full time position. The office was pretty relaxed but helped each other out when things got busy.
good,"This job is pretty relaxed. It can get very busy at certain times. On a typical day you would answer multiple phone calls and schedule appointments, make coffee and make sure the entire office is neat and organized. The hardest part of the job is probably trying to explain certain things to disgruntled customers."
good,"Took part in the training and became a tax consultant at Block for 2012 after my retirement from Linde. As was the case with my previous positions, it was great to meet and discuss needs with customers. As we purchased a home in Florida, I was not able to continue as this is a spring seasonal job, and I was not in the country."
good,"H&R Block was my first experience at somewhat of an ""office"" job. I was a Client service Professional so I basically just called the same list of people every day and answered phones to answer questions of clients and book appointments. Overall the work was generally enjoyable but at times was somewhat repetitive."
good,"I enjoy working and helping people. There are days that are very stressful you're at a fast pace you have to do so many tax returns, you works more than eight hours in one day."
good,"Highly stressed in dealing with multiple client tax issues and only a few colleagues willing to help you.  The colleagues willing to help you are awesome, the ones not willing to help not so much."
good,your company review and job title will be shown publicly on indeed. do not include confidential company information or personally indentifiable information.
good,We had a great time when a new manager came and helped us with all the info we didn't know. But the first manager wasn't capable for his position. Good training and some coworkers were nice but not everyone.
good,"Company gave good opportunity to grow.  Definitely some folks that are competitive and silo you out, however, overall very collaborative.  Gave me a good opportunity to grow my career."
good,The environment on the retail side is very committed to selling more so than helping the customers. The focus is how many additional services can be pushed onto the customer. The retail locations would do much better year after year if the customer felt they were meeting with actual tax professionals and not sales people.
good,"Never have had an issue with scheduling or workload. Wonderful manager, wonderful co-workers. Always a great atmosphere.  There is always something new to learn."
good,"I love working at H and R Block preparing peoples taxes and talking about their financial future and helping them get on the right track."
good,"enjoyed job and learned new skills and greeting customers, learned about taxes,got taxes done for free,also filed and took payments,enoyed getting to know co workers"
good,H & R Block is fast paced during peak times.  During non-peak times; cleaned the office & worked on Connect Calls.  They monitor the budget closely; you may have your schedule altered in order to meet budget goals.
good,H&R Block- This is the best place I have ever worked. I do have very nice colleagues who does not have any hesitation to help others. The workplace provide complete freedom and support for research.
good,"I worked for seasonal H and R block for several years, and I really enjoyed it. The only reason why I don't still work for H and R block is because the hours started to conflict with my regular work schedule."
good,"basically all i did was make appointments for clients and assist them with other needs they may have."
good,H&R Block is a very professional tax office. Highly trusted tax preparers. Room for advancement. All tax professionals are very qualified and experienced in tax preparation. Management is very helpful and eager to listen and help employees.

good,"I like serving the people I like seeing different situations for different people. The hardest is charging the sometimes high fees for an average tax return, the most enjoyable is meeting people"
good,Good job to have seasonally.  If you willing to work long hours during the peak season you can make very good money 3.5 months a year.  Company comes up with different ideas every year but tends to have problems on the implementation.
good,"I enjoy the challenge each client is different"
good,"Being a telephone Operator for a good amount of time, I know first hand the importance of professionalism.  Courtesy and professionalism goes a long way when dealing with customers. I was the first representative the customer would engage with so my best is what they received everyday."

good,"The typical workday consist of making sure that customers feel welcome and let them know that their business is appreciated."

good,Good place to improve one's tax knowledge and quality white-collar-type work environment.  Good place to know how to use taxation software and launch your own tax preparation business for the near future.
good,"no job is perfect no matter who when where and why"
good,Over the few years i have worked with H&R Block i have learned a lot as a CSP about tax preparations and enjoy the interaction with the public we offer during tax season. And the pay and benefits are great with filling costs and training fees its almost free when you are an employee.
good,My typical day started with greeting clients with a smile and doing my job the right way. Helping people find their money or getting their money back was the highlight of my day. I loved getting to know my clients on a personal level.
good,"CSP is the first encounter you have with H&R Block, whether by phone contact, and /or computer, of course walk ins."
good,"Gives year round training that keeps it's employees updated on all tax laws. Minimal cost for training and also provides the necessary tools, practice opportunities and group exercises.  This allows for actual live situations to perhaps be resolved before the occur."
good,Looking for extra cash? Then I would recommend. The hours are flexible and there is room to grow within the company. Company offers classes to advance learning and certifications.
good,Every office has different times when the branch is at it busiest. Preparers should be given the opportunity to travel to other branches at that time to advance their skills or learn from senior preparers.
good,"Excellent classes to further tax knowledge,"
good,"met great co workers and learned a lot about tax information, did lots of fun events in order to bring in new clientele, learned to manage multiple line phone skills."
good,"This job was a change of pace from my other job at the time at Smith's Food and Drug but was a good change of pace that I thoroughly enjoyed working at, I would work in this atmosphere again if given the opportunity. Being able to interact with clients and provide assistance gave me a good feeling throughout the days I was working there."
good,I just worked for H & R Block during one tax season but it was flexible and was easy to pick up some office hours here while working another job. I would definitely do it again as a side job or recommend it to others.
good,This is a great company to work for! I love the mentorship and continuing education. I look forward to returning each and every year. H&R Block exceeds my expectations to client care.
good,I used to efile taxes to clients on a daily basis. I talked with them and got to know them a little bit to. Management was great and enjoyed working there.

good,"Working for H&R Block was one of my favorite jobs. I really enjoyed all the people there, and the management really seemed to care about you and your family. They are always offering improvement within the company and overall I would recommend this job to anyone who is willing to put in the work."
good,"meeting and greeting a variety of personalities, data entry, documentation, filing, emailing, faxing, scanning, copying, printing, making coffee, cleaning when needed, Phone operations, scheduling/canceling/changing appointments, etc."
good,You perform tax duties answer phones set appointments for future tax appointments office duties making copies and running fax machine offerings coffees to the clients
good,I learned alot  from Block . I not  only learned about  income  taxes  but dealing with  people  . I wish  it was  not seasonal  only. Block is a great company to  work  for
good,H&R Block is a VERY GOOD place to work. There is no heavy lifting required. You get to meet repeat clients each year along with new clients. The co workers are always pleasant and helpful.
good,The managers was amazing ... Peek season was a fast pace time.. Flexible hours..  Pay rate was OK...  Easy to get to offices.  Once you get in the hang of things.  You will love it.
good,I had too set appointments and look up people accounts and I enjoyed be able too help people and knowing I could possible move up in the company also they provided training too make sure you can conduct yourself on the floor by your self
good,"H&R Block was a fun place to work I got to meet new people, and to help them with their tax needs, my co-workers we're just like family, the hardest part about this job was unhappy clients. The best part of the job was having a listening ears to our clients."
good,the classes are great and very informing. I recommend taking the tax certifications courses at HR block. you do learn quite a bit. I just wish the work schedules gave more hours because you are promised a full time position and then you see that you only work 10 hours a week. Courses are great
good,"As a receptionist, I answered phones made appointments for people to come and get their taxes done.  Filled paper in the printers, and ran reports on the days goals."
good,"H&R Block has great opportunities for advancement and increasing your pay. You must have the ability to work on your own, education yourself, and be willing to find and take classes offered for advancement."
good,I like working there because flexible hours training available. People in my office are very friendly and will help you with questions if you have a really hard return that you are working on.
good,"Overall, I had a good time working there and my coworkers were nice and I got along with them very well. They were willing to help if I needed help and we all work as a team. It does get a little stressful in the beginning and towards the end of tax season and it also depends what office your placed at some can be more busier than others. The manager was nice and if there was any issues you can easily talk to him/her and resolve it. It was nice to choose the days and hours that you can only work so it was flexible for someone that is a student like me."
good,"I liked working there. The company had a very professional, but relaxed attitude towards their employees. Everyone I worked with were professionally minded and cordial to each other. I would have continued with them, but they re-located out of state"
good,I worked at H&R Block for 5 years.  I enjoyed assisting the Clients in their tax preparation.  They provide continual training to enhance and increase your tax knowledge.
good,File paperwork answer the phone make labels take money clean the bathroom lobby work the front desk take out the trash  move paperwork restock the printer
good,"The company is very strong I promoting training for their associates. The associates pay increases is based on their training they take each year. The company rewards their associates on the achievement of the goals they achieve. "
good,You have flexible hours and during peak times can get overtime if wanted.  You tend to build good business relationships with people because of the information that is shared.
good,"Most first year tax pros get paid minimum wage, and that's after they pay to go through training and have to pass a class and get a license if you live in Oregon.  There are CSP's (receptionists) who end up getting paid more than tax pros at times, which doesn't make sense.  Other than that, it's a good place to work.  They allow your schedule to be flexible, which is very convenient."
good,I enjoyed the diverse team and the fact that its never a dull day at work during peak season.  Being able to assist a consumer with filling a W-4 to increase his or her refund check the following year is rewarding to me.
good,enjoyed it people were nice hours were good an could be flexible if needed the training class was a little long but I learned everything they wanted and how they wanted it done
good,Worked with clients doing their taxes and answering any tax questions.  Also answered the phones and made appointments. And called clients reminding of schedules apointments
good,I learnned a lot about working in a tax officeaff very supportive wanting to help.  hardest part of the job was making sure the tax pros were on time with appointments
good,"District Manager was great and very involved with each stores branch. Provided great encouragement and coaching. The way goals are released is to provide motivation - not stress. "
good,Good experience. nice working with very diversified office environments. Lots of many different backgrounds to collaborate with problem solving for the support that we did.
good,I enjoy work for this company every year it is a seasonal jobs for me I have learning a lot of thing from day one it is a great opportunity if you want to know about tax and what are the difference rule that apply to everyone
good,Nothing to add. I do not wish to say anything extra about this company. It was a pleasure to work in it and i would work there again if given the opportunity
good,"Problem is its seasonal. Fast paced during tax season. Lots of classes to take before you can prepare taxes. the laws change every year, so keeping updated with new laws is important."
good,"It good place to work with all friendly and professional staffs."
good,I enjoyed working there but it is only seasonal. Its fast paced and everyone i work with is great. You learn all about what people think or feel and i work with people who if you need help will help.
good,I love working there during the tax season. I have clients that come back every year and you get to see their children grow and the changes that effect their life and taxes.
good,I enjoyed working with the ladies in the office and meeting so many people. It was very uplifting to be able to help people and interact with everyone.
good,"Job culture was amazing, employees were very sweet to new employees. The pay wasn't so great so that's the only con I have! Besides the lack of quality pay everything was relaxed and easy to handle! Great for mothers looking for part time work and students looking for an opportunity to dip their foot into the world of taxes."
good,"Love my job, and the people I work with,but there's no benefits. I've worked there 31 years with no retirement. What you make is based on you, and how hard you work for it."
good,"totally enjoy my work with H&R Block, even though I am seasonal only, I have enjoyed coming back year after year for over 26 years and have a lot of clients who have stayed with me during this time frame."
good,"If your looking for a job that can work around you this is the job for you. Typical day is answering phones, receiving faxes, making sure your customers have a wonderful experience in your office."
good,Assist clients with achieving the most out of their taxes and financial objectives by serving as their tax and financial partner. Prepare tax for clients base on the documents they provide to you.
good,It is an easy temporary job. The training is the toughest part and that's just until you get use to the software H&R Block uses. Great place to work and quick response as well.
good,"The people are nice, I did my best job. Got to work and checked what needed to be done. Cleaned the office for closing. Was kind of slow and not much to do at the beginning of tax season. Later on it got really busy and I had lots to do. Was kind of stressful at bits because several different things needed to happen at the same time and occasionally one of the tax pros were grumpy."
good,I worked for h&r block for 4 months because it was a seasonal job only but I really liked it and didn't mind making it my full time job and also more than seasonal.
good,Good place to work for those who have college degrees. You are much exposed to people during tax season if you work as a tax associate. They offered career advancement.
good,You learn about the varies forms a tax return has and how to fill them in.You help people do their tax returns from year to year. The employees train yearly and continuously to provide the most up to date knowledge fro tax law changes.
good,One can learn and advanced through the company. If you put in hard work you will progress. Pay is mediocre especially if it’s your first couple years. Need to build your own client base
good,Typical day at work was easy. Just hot during summer. Truck drivers were good. Job was easy counting loads and making sure they were there on time . with correct loads.
good,I enjoyed my tenure with H&R Block.  There started to become an uncertainty of job security as more customers are moving to online filing instead of going into a tax office to file.  Layoffs started to occur
good,"Great working environment. Toward the end of ""tax time"" it could get a little hectic but it was still a great place to work and the particular group I worked with was fantastic!"
good,I was a good job for the tax season. One Female CPA pushed her religious agendas on clients a lot but I ignored her presence. Manager is a push over which is bad for business but great for lazy employees.
good,"Good people and management to work with.  Continual education"
good,I worked for this company as a Client Service Professional...basically a fancy way of saying receptionist because all of the tax prep positions were already taken. It was great for the time it lasted because I worked with a great staff. And the manager was okay with my organizational skills to keep the records in track. All of my suggestions taken heeded with consideration and that in itself is great. Not only did I help schedule tax return prep for clients I also helped the walk-ins. I managed the issuance of refund checks and helped clients get estimates. The hardest part of the job was to not actually do any tax returns there. In the middle of taking classes for the next season I had to change from morning to evening classes  for a job I had just taken. The transition was doable and great. Unfortunately I couldn't continue on in the path that was afforded me due to other obligations. I do recommend the courses for those who are interested in tax prep.
good,I enjoyed learning how to prepare taxes and it is knowledge that can be useful to anyone.  I was a little uncomfortable recruiting people to get their taxes done there which we were encouraged to do.
good,"During peak tax season - extremely busy. "
good,Working for H&R Block I was able to level up to more complex returns. I helped run the office I was located in this year. When I have had a concern I have been able to go to the manager.
good,"No hard job. Have to deal with a lot of different personality. Also ways have something to do. Always trying to help customers with there taxes and whatever else the may have problems with. Last year taxes, etc..."
good,"Tough job, trying to remember everything you learn in such a short time, some of the staff was nice some where not, did not like my time with them, we were busy and not bored, would do It again but not in Harborcreek, food places around were good, close to home, I worked in Erie once that experience was good,"
good,I think this was a good place to work for the experience. They do hire people with no receptionist experience so you do learn a lot in that short amount of time and will be going back. It was slow at first but towards the end of the season it did get busy and I was not expecting it to get that busy. The management needs to work on a few things but other then that it was a great job. The hardest part of my job was learning how to multi task when I never had to at a job before. I really enjoyed the staff who I worked with and how patient they were with me when I first started.
good,"It is seasonal employment preparing taxes and I greatly enjoy preparing taxes, but it is quite low pay for the amount of work and continuing education and it can be very stressful"
good,"At my office, every Tax Pro is helping new person like me.  They helped me out when I can't do something and force me to push my limit.  They are also want to learn and practice more."
good,"Extensive knowledge of state selling guidelines for refinances, including but not limited to cash out, lower interest rates, new purchases. Needed to know how to sell."
good,"love the company and all it has to offer. It is a seasonal job but they will educate you for as little as 20$ per year, the higher you get in the tax pro rank the more pay you will receive."
good,"Sometimes stressful juggling appointment for the tax professionals, calling client for appointment reminders, taking payments whether credit card, check or cash, maintaining privacy and security of client's personal tax information."
good,great place to work! coworkers are amazing and always willing to help. the ability to use my expertise to help clients and grow within the company. being a tax preparer is very rewarding.
good,Everyone works close together here. When you work as receptionist here you can tax class in the fall for free and advance to a tax pro. Lots of room for growth as long as you put in the work.
good,"Great income in the short time span of 16 to 20 weeks. Just seasonal. This job requires alot of attention to detail, plus hours of working on staffing constraints. Pay for tax proffessionals is good, but very little compensation for support staff. It has unrealistic budgets that do not take inconsideration changing enviroment. You must be ready for micro management. The company still tries to run like it did 25 years ago which is a stumbling block. Fees are very high to consumer because of lack of thought on corporate offices. Still trying to make same profit margins it always had, with declining customer base. You have a saturated market with only growth in the 18 to 25 year old range. This range files mostly forms that are free on line that gives very little revenue growth. Company needs to revamp sales and profit goals, while adjusting its marketing. Needs to be modernized in its management thinking."
good,"I loved my job at H&R Block.  It was a really enjoyable job.  I loved working with the clients, tax preparers and my boss. The hardest part of my job was balancing at the end of the day. ( Which was not hard at all)"
good,Rate this company
good,"Fun, stressful and interesting. The job is well worth the struggle. Good people to work with and for. some issues with staff but no major issues. Very slow at times other times very fast paced."
good,"Relaxed but can be stressful during peak. No one is micro managing. Telemarketing calls are annoying. First year tax pro pay sucks. ""everyone gets ""fired"" at the end of season"" and must re apply in December"
good,"During Peak you are very busy, besides that, alot of down time. Pay isn't bad and opportunity to level up and make more after your first year. It is a seasonal job."
good,"The tax pros are great to work with and the manager, although very busy, treats everyone fair. The work is not hard, but it is the kind of work you cannot slack off on."
good,"H&R Block is a tax preparation company in the United States, claiming more than 24.5 million tax returns prepared worldwide, with offices in Canada, Australia and Brazil. The Kansas City-based company also offers banking, personal finance and business consulting services."
good,Has great hours but is a temporary seasonal position. I worked during the summer as an instructor and tax professional. I enjoy working there but it is seasonal work.
good,The office I work in is very friendly and everyone works well together.  Every year the same people return to work and we have many regular clients. The company has classes on tax preparation and tax law that are available throughout the year so you can advance.
good,"Typical dayat work: good  relations with customer and preparing taxes."
good,Great place to work hard work long hours poor management no bonuses growth opportunities loved it but I would not go back to the environment. enjoy some of the co workers
good,It is a great place to start as tax professional. The manager is awesome and the colleagues are very helpful. They offer online courses and you can learn a lot.
good,very fast pace with enjoyable co-workers and full of tax knowledge. Great customer exposure and problem solving skills. I looked forward to tax season.
good,"Overall a fun place to work.  Since pay was partially from commissions on returns completed, most people were good about taking turns.  You'd get some though that wouldn't care and would grab any they could even though they weren't next in line."
good,Lots of classes available. Co-workers are great to work with. No real room for advancement and no benefits. Looking for full-time work as this is a seasonal position.
good,"This is just a secretary position. Greeting clients, keeping kids occupied while the parents have taxes done. Filing paperwork. Very simple and good job to have."
good,I worked for H&R Block as a seasonal employee for a few years. It was a good part time job for extra money every year. They provided extended training every season.
good,"I love working with numbers so totally enjoyed the experience of working at H&R Block.  Seasonal work, but the extra pay for those months was nice.  I've thought about going back and doing it for a few more seasons."
good,I scheduled apts for clients and handled walk-ins. It was a decent job and the people were nice. It was only for the tax season though. So it had to end.
good,"My first stints (07-09) of working for H and R Block were awesome. Last year was impossible I was in the slowest office. The people I worked with were some of the best in the district at handling complicated tax returns. "
good,Enjoyed working for this company and the on going education. Just could no longer afford to continue  employment  with the money the government required you to pay to be employed for 4 months.
good,It is a great place to work you can set your own hours and its a family environment.  I love helping others and to try to make sure they get the best return possible.  I love the learning every year.  the hardest part of the job is the end of season.
good,"Gave me the experience i needed to work in a office environment. They are very flexable on work schedule, Things get busy, phone lines ringing  there are 3 lines, people walking thru door, needing appointment, checking in for appointment. You need to know how to prioritize and be organized... Love working there, will return.. Sad its a seasonal job!!"
good,"Great company year after year corporate office meet and great tax office promotions several locations friendly staff, reasonable interactions with staff low volume  discrepanicies office upgrades marketing and office equipment"
good,"My manager was wonderful and the company itself really puts time into making sure you know your stuff. It's a very valuable experience, and you can absolutely advance as much as you want."
good,"During my time there i had good times. I was able to interact with many customers, which is my strong suit, and grew my interpersonal skills within my time there in the office."
good,This is a very fast paced environment. You have to be on top of things all the time. You get to meet lots of wonderful and interesting people.It's a challanging and rewarding job.
good,"You will become like a family working there, yes there is some drama in the office but that can be at multiple places. In the interview they do give you information on becoming an Tax Pro if you enter in as a CSP. There is a opportunity to move up in the office. Personally it is a great way to gain experience and if you want to know how to do taxes or run an office it is a great place to start."
good,"I got this job thru a friend to cover while I look for a fulltime job. It is easy, answer phones, schedule appointments, talk to customers, call clients. It is very easy and gets you thru January-April."
good,"A regular day at work. I punch in and pull up the scheduled appointments for the day and then I make coffee, answer the phones, take messages, take payments and interact with my team to ensure a productive day."
good,"In this position I processed residential home mortgages. I also trained new associates in this position. "
good,"Always busy with clients coming in to do their taxes which is a good thing.  When it's slow, it drags a little.  Lots of marketing to do also but its to promote the business."
good,I worked for HR block for 3 tax seasons as a receptionist and it was always a good place to work. you got to meet new people and also see old clients that you haven't seen t\since the previous year.
good,"A typical day  means opening the office and getting it ready to receive clients for the day.  Once open, I answer phones and set and confirm appointments while matching clients to the best tax pro for their needs as well as accommodating schedules for both the tax pro and the client."
good,"Part-time, flexible work environment with a diverse workplace culture.  Enjoyed assisting a variety of customers and small businesses with tax preparation services and consulting."
good,"H&R Block was a fast paced sales environment with strong company support. Management was invested in the success of their employees. "

good,"The subject of taxes was very interesting and employee's are provided with excellent training on the job.  Received education about the earned income credit, pensions, personal exemptions and other subject matters."
good,I enjoy my co-worker they are very helpful when you need a solution. They make sure you understand. My manager is great listener is she will make sure you have all the resources you need pertaining to your solution.
good,"Knowledge about taxes is very important, I can help people with this complicated and must do stage in everybody's life. HR Block offers me the opportunity to learn and grow, with time to enjoy the family out of the tax season."
good,I got to help people get the most out of their taxes. People were always nice and excited when I got them back more than they were expecting. Other employees were always helpful when I needed help or a question needed to be answered.
good,"Lately the office was slow, so It would give me the oportunity to get trained and do marketing."
good,I like working here they are very flexible when it comes to the hours and right now I need that because I have a child in school that I have to pick up.
good,"The H&R Block I worked for was a franchise office not corporate. The working environment is more controlled by the franchise owner rather than the corporation, which made the working conditions much more of a local and hometown atmosphere. The people I worked with were all wonderful from the owner on down.  The hardest part of the job was the rush times to get returns done before the deadlines to file."
good,"I get along well with my coworkers, I do work them every season when I get a chance. The work culture is nice, everyone has a different back grown which is cool and I am the youngest in the office."

good,I have worked for the company for several years and always look forward to workig the next year! I love working with the public. my manager was a great leader and she was understanding if emergency with children. it was a team effort.  It was like a family reuniting every year when we started the tax season.
good,"I have enjoyed working under the District Manager.  He is open to any circumstance and tries to help you along the way in any subject."
good,"usually very busy, lots of call , verlfying information. Always learned a new tax law by listening. Loved the boss at location' Bob'. He retired last year. he was 86 and full of knowledge and spunky. Cleaned office at end of day. balanced out daily."

I lean something new everyday and every taxes season because the taxes rules are always changing and have to be up date  on all new tax laws management is okay not always on top what they need to be but us coworkers take care of what we need to keep the management up the hardest part of my job is when the IRS rejects returns and we have to have the clients come back in and find out why it was rejected and fix everything and resend it the most enjoyable part of my job i something that i cant help people and get them the most money i can get them back and if they owe make sure that its the lest that i can get them to owe
good,I already filled this out on another page just as I did for Allendale Mutual Insurance Company and I do not know how to delete this.
good,"A typical day at work is calling my clients to see if they are ready to come in with all of their information in order to get their return into the  IRS in order for them to get their refund ASAP.

I also liked that I was responsible for the tone I set in the office which was always warm and inviting. As I grew in this office I was able to learn many important requirements with tax information and I take credit in the help I offered to keep important documentations organized and filed in the appropriate place. I was privileged to have this opportunity at a young age."
good,"Some days at H&R Block we were busy, other days not so busy.  I took a lot of on line courses offered by H&R Block to improve my knowledge of their operations. "
good,"I enjoyed the training and the friendly atmosphere of my co-workers.  Some days were very stressful, with the waiting chairs full of clients, and others were pretty quiet.  If I had not become a mother during the following tax season, I would probably still be working there."
good,I really enjoyed working for H&R Block and I do plan on going back. Make sure you get a good Office Manager. I had a great one and she was very helpful. My co-workers were really fun to work with too. I hope the one co-worker will not be back at my office because if she is I am leaving and not coming back. She would do things purposely to drive me crazy! That is the only issue I have with H&R.
good,The work day is the input of tax forms. There are many tax classes to help associat perform their duties. The hardest part is remembering the laws for states and federal. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and looking in other people lives and giving suggestion on how they can get a better refund.
good,working with different customers was the highlight of my day! I entered personal financial information to file customers taxes. The co-workers was very helpful.
good,"It would vary if I was the opener or closer. If I opened, I would start my day by making coffee for the clients. I would then put out our business signs on the grass around the drive way to draw in cliental. I would make sure everything was cleaned properly the night before then log in to my system and clock in then open the cash drawer for the day. I would then proceed to call the clients who have the appointments for that day to confirm the appointments if they were not confirmed yet. I would then call for the next three days ahead in case a client might of forgot they had an appointment and would like to reschedule to another day if convenient for them and we had the opening available. A lot of returning clients set their appointments a year ahead. After that I would do some filing and making sure the tax professionals put the paperwork in the correct order for our corporate location to review. Through out the day as well I would process payments for clients if they owed for their taxes to be filed. Closing procedure I would bring in our signs, vacuum the office and wipe down all the desks, have the coffee ready to go the next morning, take the trash out, then close out the cash drawer and have the deposit ready to go the next day if there was one for that day. I loved working for H&R Block and learned so much such as opening the point of sale system and closing, setting up the deposit for my manager the next day, I got faster on my typing. I also was pleased how the training was done so we were ready to go when the office would open for the season. It was a lot like a family"
good,"typical day consists of setting appointments, checking customers in, referring them to a tax professional that could best handle their taxes."

good,"H&R Block is a great place to work. You're always meeting new people, they encourage you to increase your knowledge and pay rate, compensation is great. The only downside is that its seasonal and they don't do much in the way of helping you find another job.

good,"I loved working at H&R Block.  I learned a lot about taxes and I loved meeting with clients and to able to help them.  Most of the people I worked with were great and have become life long friends.  I hated leaving the place but I needed a full time position that H&R Block could not offer me.  The salary was not the greatest.  Once you past the two year mark you start earning a commission.  I was an Enrolled Agent, so I was the highest level you can be.  You make approx. 26% of any revenue you bring in.  The problem is that if clients don't ask for you, you can lose them, causing you to lose money.  Commission rates change year to year and new ""rules"" come out every year making it difficult to earn a living.  Too many products you need to sell that are not necessary beneficial for the client but money for H&R."
good,"a typical day at work could be really relaxing because everyone its there for you, each of my co-workers help me learn and be more effective."
good,H & R Block gave me the opportunity to interact with different people.  The first thing I would do every morning is make sure that each tax professional has everything that they need at their work station for the day.  I would usually call clients to verify their appoints each day and organize appointments for new clients.  I filed paperwork and answered business calls throughout the entire day.  I got along with most of my co-workers and I did not have any problems with management.  There was nothing about H & R Block that I felt was difficult.
good,"Every clients is different, so are the cases. It's a good opportunity to apply your tax knowledge. Having reliable co-workers and good management helps to avoid little mistakes. The hardest part of the job is when you have new complex cases you have not dealt before. The most enjoyable part is having satisfied clients, who book an appointment with you right away for next tax year."
good,I  have the usual complaints working at this establishment.
good,"I loved my particular office and that is the only reason I go back every season is because I love my co-workers, If I didn't like the office I work in I wouldn't work for H&R Block."

We are trained on how to deal with these situations, ensuring that the client initially vents frustration, and ultimately leaves satisfied."
good,"I worked here in 2013 for the tax season. Pay was just above minimum wage, which seemed fair. Everyone treated me politely. I never had any problems getting enough breaks during cold weather, and work was even cancelled on really bad days. They seemed genuinely aware that the position is taxing, and tried to be fair and accommodating. Sign spinning itself is not a great gig, but my experience with H&R Block was entirely positive beyond that."
good,I started as a tax associate in a very busy A office. I wrote over two hundred tax return per year.

Co-workers were always friendly and helpful as well. Hardest part of the job...there really wasnt. I think it might have been training...being on the floor was easier than what they made it seem.
good,make appointments
good,I loved my job at H & R Block. I was respected as an individual.
good,I worked anywhere from 4 to 8 hours per day. Greeted customers. Help customers with their individual tax returns. I learned that each person is different. I found my managers to be quite helpful when I needed I didn't know the question to something. My co-workers were very fun to work with. I enjoyed the family togetherness. The hardest part of my job was trying to sell customers on products that they didn't want to even hear about. I really enjoyed it when I got to tell a customer that they were getting a bigger refund than what they were expecting.
good,My boss had asked me to start making phone calls for people to come in and do their taxes. I called this one lady who about cussed me out for calling her house and that she didn't want to do her taxes and hung up on me.
good,Worked with customers and also helped out customers that didn't speak and english.
good,H&R Block is a great company to work for. They have several departments you can work in and I was chosen to work for almost all of them. I'm a quick learner and I like to move myself up to higher positions.
good,I enjoyed my job here inter-acting with the customers and co-workers; I like a job that keeps me busy and this job provided that structure; I also learned a lot from all the Tax Pros.
good,I like the fact I can return each tax season and get to know the clients and tax professionals.
good,How to deal with the different types of people. Management is very understanding of the ordeals of everyday life. Hardest part of the job is only for a couple of months of the year.
good,"Greeting the clients. Help them to reach the maximun Refund possible within tax context. It was a great satisfaction to help the latino comunity, let them know how important undertand their situation and the best way to do it."
good,"during tax season the hours are Monday to Sunday sometimes 14 hour days, but it is always busy with many things to do. I learned how to manage individuals to bring out the best of their abilities and to work as a team."
good,I have always felt that H&R Block really understands the importance of balancing work and personal time. Although there are strict deadlines and goals to meet there is always someone there willing to help you meet your goals. Great company.
good,"This is a seasonal company, that is very demanding for the few months of the year they are open. It has great advancement. I really enjoy working here. I wish it was a full time/year round job."
good,"Start of a typical day would be to come in check voicemails, turn on computer, double check files for appointments, start coffee and do a visual check of items that are low. Through the day would be assisting clients with checking them in and out of their appointments and assisting my boss/co-workers if they needed anything to get their jobs done."
good,Always something new and exciting! Loved my co-workers and the work enviroment.
good,I learned a lot from working with this company.
good,"A typical day is answering phone lines. Depending on what department and the time of the year you are working. Once I got trained on setting appointment for filing taxes, I was trained to work in the banking customer service phone department. I answered questions about IRA and CD accounts. The balances, how to either close and transfer funds from accounts. Forms sent out to clients in regards for tax preparation in the filing season. Once the tax filing season started, answered questions about when clients would receive both federal and state refunds. Account balances, interest payments on IRA and CD accounts for clients. The hardest part of the job was the training for the different systems I was trained on. The most enjoyable part of each work day was break and lunch. Management was okay, didn't really get to know upper management, but floor management was fine. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and became friends with some co-workers."
good,The best part of working here is the training and the training is the best in the industry. They are very flexible hours and the clients are really wonderful. The other Tax Pro's are also very fun to work with.
good,Not a bad company to work for.Bad thing is the pay and its seasonal
good,"I was responsible for customer service such as appointment setting, collection of tax prep fees, answering multi-line telephone, answering questions regarding tax services and rates. I also ran reports for the office and verified tax returns were properly sent and accepted by the IRS."
good,Great seasonal job
good,"My day would begin at Block with a cup of coffee and incoming phone calls. I enjoy working with people and I have a ""bubbly"" personality(at least tha'ts what my co-workers think of me) but it's very challenging to please ALL clients. I wouldn't want to work for any other tax company,at Block I've met so many amazing people and my co-workers are like my family.The hardest part of being an employee for Block is when the tax season ends.Most of us don't get to see one another until the following tax season."
good,Learned the in and outs of the tax laws. Gained many clients through HR Block. The seasonal work was a little stress ful but good
good,"If you like working with numbers and systems while providing personal service, H&R Block is the place to work."
good,Glad to see the customers happy when they leave.
good,"Typical day would be preparation of personal and business tax returns, most enjoyable part of the job were the people I got to meet."
good,Everyone was very welcoming. The entire office acted as a team. No one was more important than anyone else. It was a very warm and friendly atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed going to work, I had a very outgoing office. My office manager was the best and my coworkers were always willing to help us first year tax pros. the hardest part is knowing that its over already!!!!"
good,"Working with clients, making appointments and trying to ensure loyal clientele. Friendly people to work with and great management."
good,"Typical day consisted of greeting customers, making appointments, filing tax returns, closing out at end of day which included preparing deposits for bank and completing report."
good,"It was a nice environment to work and i would like to work there again for the next tax season. If, I haven't obtained a full time job by January of next year."
good,"The people I worked with were great. Easy to talk, and if I had a question they were there to answer it. A normal day was just answering phone calls scheduling tax appointments, and operating a cash register."
good,"Not always so busy, the people and the environment is very friendly, they help you learn new and exciting things about taxes."
good,"I love love love working at HRB, I wish it was all year round! The people are great, the managers are on your level, and the atmosphere is fun."
good,"The employees and the management are wonderful people. Flexible scheduling management very cooperative,"
good,I really enjoy working with H&R Block. All managers have been great. Training is available. You can arrange your own schedule.
good,"Working for Block is an amazing opportunity to obtain knowledge and skills that will benefit you for a life time. To this day, I still am able to advise friends and family on how to maximize their tax refunds, despite not having worked for the company in a couple of years."
good,"You have a friendly work environment, their training is good, you will learn gradually , you should respect the clients as much as possible, most of the clients like this company!"
good,"They do great at training, continuing education, on the job training and review. They have a great atmosphere, great flexibility and good customer service. The only things I didn't like were how they determined customer prices (they prey on the poor and unbanked), and the pay (any downtime wipes out too much commission)."
good,"H&R Block is a great company to learn valuable knowledge and skills. Beyond a doubt there will be a job for you every tax season. However, the hourly compensation for entry level tax professionals is locked at $10  an hour. Zero to little benefits are offered if you are anything below a District Manager. Honestly, I would love being a tax professional year round if I could be properly compensated on an hourly basis."
good,"I was overall happy with the time i worked at H&R Block. The only things i would change are the expectations that are given to first year tax pros. I was required to do far more than what was initially asked of me during the tax season. Also, being that i was asked to do more wish that i had been given enough time prepare for the extra tasks i was given (in other words, more training material specifically related to the tasks i was given)."
good,Very good place to work. Performing the TSA pre check was terrific. Wish H&R still performed this service. Working with the tax pros was great. I hope I have the chance to do so again.
good,I liked working at the Seaside office because it was a very collaborative environment. There was always good communication and teamwork was emphasized. There is opportunity for career advancement in the tax world and H&R Block has classes for that every year.
good,"my day at work is fun, I do clients taxes, my manager helps me achieve my goals, they listen what I need in training to have a great year."
good,Really enjoyed working with tax professionals.  The customers were very nice and I Jst was overall very grateful for the work experience with H&RBlock.
good,"I did mostly bookkeeping, filing and general office duties at this company.  But if you ever wanted to learn about taxes, they have a great course they offer during the off season."
good,The people that work there treat you like family. Everyone works together to meet our goals. We give each other kudos for each one's accomplishments. We help each other get the previous clients a reminder call of the appointment and to verify that they have the documents they need to bring in.
good,Love this place time flexible great co workers and client though they are only open around Tex season time you do not get benefits.  Again great place to work office
good,"My boss was amazing and was very understanding of the fact I have children. My co-workers were great to work with. The atmosphere was relaxed, clients were nice. Loved working there and wish I could have had a year around job with them."
good,Seasonal employment.  If you do well you can be rehired each year.  Can work your own schedule but you must work when you say you will be available.  Beginning pay is usually minimum wage and each year your rate can change based on classes taken to move up a pay level.
good,"A typical work day encompasses assisting manager, providing excellent customer service to clients who come into the office, supporting management & tax consultants, inventory & supply management, collecting fees, making calls, knowledgeable about products."
good,Just be yourself and control the situation. Know your tax laws and how to ask probing questions in order to paint the whole picture. Be willing to go into detail about what is needed to process all tax returns.
good,"I loved working at H &R Block. My husband was military so after working at H&R Block for 2 years we moved. I loved working with the public and helping the tax preparers when need be. It was at times stressful, however, I enjoyed every minute of my job and even worked at different locations when asked to do so."
good,I had a first year rough experience involving nepotism but it was handled with great care. I have maybe the best DM ever! He’s very upbeat and dynamic makes you want to work ethically
good,"Things have changed over the years. Used to give hours could work and that was fine. Now want hours for their benefit more than your schedule."
good,"I worked in the mansfield and franklin offices. In franklin u could ask questions and the staff would help if you got stuck, but you were left alone to do your own thing. Mansfield office staff was great! Any question i had they were always willing to help. And not actually just ans but if i needed them to show me something they would take the time to sit and show me how to compleet the task at hand. My mentor was located in the mansfield office and no matter which lication i was at i always had access to her.. The company offered many continued tax training options which you could complete between clients or on personal time.. I also worked off season, had a great mentor there too. The manager was wonderful but aparently the office mang. change every year..everyone is required to take a 2week sabbatical to recharge or take a brake. durring my sabbaticle there was mandatory meatings i was not informed of because i was not on the list of current employees that the new mang received. Therefore i was not allowed to return to h&r block that season..wish i had paid to do xtra training durring my time off but i received an offer with a higher payrate unrelated to taxes so i didn't return"
good,H&R Block is a great place to work to supplement your income or if you are a student. They offer very flexible schedules. The job is seasonable being that they do must of there business during tax season.
good,Different experiences every day offering new learning opportunities.  Some long days with necessary weekend work.  Great working environment with awesome co-workers.
good,Great company to work for part time. I loved working for them. They taught me so much and gave me the professional experience I needed to further my career. Only down fall is that now days there are fewer people who go into a tax office to have their taxes prepared by someone.
good,Great place to work at. Provides lots of classes so you are always learning more things. If you don’t have the answers the staff is always helpful with everyone. We work great together and have each others back and cover for one another if someone can’t come in.
good,I am looking for a position similar that is year round.  The professionals I work with are wonderful and I enjoy helping clients while doing taxes (or other accounting work)
good,"meeting new people"
good,Met alott if different people this was temp job for tax season. Was to far me to go to this job. So I really didn’t last long I was looking for something closer to home and just decided to go back to school nd finish college.
good,"It's a Good place to work, if you like being busy. Most of the employees get along with each other. They don't offer benefits because it is a seasonal position."
good,"I loved my manager in the Baldwin location."
good,"I am happy that coworkers are willing to help a new person and the company requires us to take mandatory tax classes to stay current with tax laws. A typical work day is you coming in and checking your appointments, checking emails, preparing tax returns, supporting coworkers always making sure that clients needs are met."
good,"Fairly busy during tax season, does get a little boring at times. My manager was one of the best I've had, very relaxed and nonchalant about everything. It does get slow quickly and you're there doing nothing for a few hours."
good,A typical day during the tax season is filled with 89 returns. You learn to manage your time to stay on schedule with booked clients. I get a satisfaction from helping people get accurate returns and helping plan financially for the upcoming year.
good,"I liked the customer service aspect of the job and there were some very nice Tax Experts who were willing to answer questions. It was a good job for someone who wants office experience."
good,"I enjoyed working here because at the time it was seasonal. Due to the off months, I was able to be employed here and also continue being a stay-at-home mom. If anyone needed help with taxes, I could go in to work if needed."
good,This is the best place to start my job as a tax professional. working hours are flexible. You can learn a lot from working. Colleagues are very nice. They are always to help you whenever you need.
good,"I have worked with the company for 10 years as a Office Manager and Tax Professional, and I enjoy the  flexible hours that you can work. I enjoy learning about different ways to help our client become more knowledgeable about their taxes."
good,"I enjoy working for H&R Block.  It is a great seasonal job.  I had an excellent supervisor and worked with a great group of tax professionals.  We see many repeat clients in the tax seasons that I worked for the company,"
good,Working at H&R  Block was more like working with family. Everyone was a joy to work with as well as our clients.  We all trusted and relied on each other do our jobs effectively.
good,"If you are about accomplishing the mission and feeling good about it, H&R Block is a great place to work. Clients come in to get their taxes done, for some it might be a bright part of their day to get a return. Some already know if they are not getting a return and they will owe. Either way engaging a client through conversation and giving them great customer service has been a plus for me. I have learned through this, that you cant make everyone happy, but as long as you know you have done everything possible, that is all that matters."
good,"The management supports its employees and strives to do right by their customers.  Adequate training is given to all employees, and it is up to the employee to decide how much they are willing to learn.  Everyone is given the same opportunity for advancement.  If you want to learn all about taxes and people I highly recommend this company.  The culture tends to be positive."
good,Challenging part-time job  Requires a lot of studying to keep up with upcoming changes to the tax laws.  Always have a good rapport with every client.
good,"i have learnt how to be a good communicator . It is productive learning as  networking is critical in this position, business development managers must often travel to conferences, business meetings, and industry events."
good,"Tax Preparation and solving problems with hardware and client letters from IRS."
good,Definitely gives a thorough training to new employees and make them feel welcome and beneficial. Straightforward guidelines and expectations are clear.
good,"I've worked at H&R Block as a receptionist for the past 27 years and plan to go back next tax season. My office is filled with tax pros who are very willing to help new tax pros. We all work as a team and support each other. My manager is amazing and will work with receptionists and tax pros with regard to the hours that they can work. She has been working with me on cutting back on my hours at my request. "
good,"H&R Block is an interesting and an excellent place to work by helping clients with their tax experience. While working at H&R Block, the opportunity to learn tax information is very impressive."
good,"Being with H&R block they really give you a sense of respect and honesty. In all positions you will be respected weather you're a receptionist, tax pro, manager, this was the first job that I've received such a great acknowledgment from peers and upper management."
good,H&R Block allows for flexible work hours that fit around my schedule. The work is always different because you work with individual people with unique circumstances.  It is a great place to work if you want to help interesting people understand and work through the ever changing tax code.
good,You set your own hours.  You are in control of your advancement.  You can take advantage of the opportunities to learn more and advance your certification and benefit level.
good,"There is job security in employment with H&R Block if you prove to be a good employee, but the pay for the non-professionals needs to be increased.  They offer convenient work hours."
good,"Preparing taxes for H&R Block was a wonderful experience.  We always found unique was to motivate staff and help customers feel comfortable.  No matter what office I prepared taxes in, it was always a positive working environment."
good,I loved working with people in my office. Everyone worked as a Team! Whatever I asked they were there to help office! I think H & R Block was pretty good company to work for. My one complaint would be change in Upper Management not consistent. Don't always have support from them.
good,"I worked as tax professional in this company, which is my first job in the United States. I have to say it is a really great chance for me to develop my working skills, especially for my communicating skills."
good,The work is very fast paced and its always very busy. Handling multiple phone calls and the incoming customers simultaneously is quiet a challenging job. The management is good and co-workers are friendly.
good,"I love and take prinde in working for such known company. I work for franchise and love my boss, I was contracted throughout the season and then move to hourly during off season.But I absolutely love my work,take pride on what I do. I just like to learn more and be aquire more qualifications and be diverse."
good,a good place to learn and work...flexible hours....knowledgeable seniors....always helping and problem solving ....a learning and working with fun.....
good,The culture at H&R block is very competitive. You get to work with people with different backgrounds. You are encouraged to learn and level up. Managment is always willing to help and support you. The worst part is that is seasonal. The best part is the if you like taxes and deal with people you should be good to go.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block is processing tax forms for federal and state tax forms.  I love working there because i love working with numbers. It is a great place to work. You meet every one and get to know your customers , You give them some advise on taxes and for the future."

good,"I have been working here for 4yrs. working atmosphere is good. Management is great. They try their best to help with your concerns."
good,I enjoyed working here and didn't feel too terribly pressured because I always did my best. I liked that I didn't have to 'take my work home with me'.
good,"Learning the tax polices and process was great ,there is nothing like having the opportunity to learn and practice at the same time.I really recommend the job."
good,I love working for H&R Block. It is like a big family and the schedule is very flexible. At the beginning of the tax season you can put in what you want to work for each day for the entire season.
good,"They are very friendly in the office not to strict and the requirements to get in are low, they prefer you have some background experience. It’s a sit down job which would be perfect for people who need a good sit down job"
good,"H&R Block is mainly tax season January through April there is room for advancement as long as you work hard and want it. I really enjoyed working there, I just couldn't remember all the tax laws and I need full time employment."
good,"I work evenings, but could work days,  As a first year tax professional, I work on taxes that are to my skill level and their certification,  In other words, I have to pass their test to move up.  When you move up you also get a raise.  And it it fair.  The office I work with has several Tax Professionals who have been with the company for years and they are all very willing to help if you get stumped on a problem.  I have been encouraged to work on leveling up but this is not paid training and must be done on my time."
good,"This job is very fast-paced. People skills are necessary since tax season is usually stressing for everyone, so go into it with a positive attitude. This will get you through the peak times of tax season. Great starting job as a front desk receptionist. However, this company gives little spots to employees who are hired year-round. Therefore, this job is very much supplementary. The company culture became much about recognizing each other through an internal program called BlockStars, which is nice. However, when in office its sort of a gamble the type of Tax Pros you work with. Many are older retirees and can be unwelcoming, ""Type A"" accountants. Don't be afraid to vocalize your needs, opinions, and questions to others and your manager, this is the only way you'll get through. Also, since the employee turnover rate is high, management is always changing, whether that be good or bad. Company plays a number game with clients for sure. Clients get irritated because they've received a thousand calls and emails already, while our manager still pushes us to make calls."
good,Fun environment.  Good people to work with.  Friendly atmosphere.  Fast paced.  The management was really good.  The customers were always nice and friendly.
good,"Did my 3-month internship in which I learned a lot about Taxes and developed a huge amount of patience. "
good,"After completing the classroom training,  the hands on learning began. Working in the office greeting clients, light duties such as bookkeeping, data entry, answering incoming calls and making outbound calls to list a few."
good,H&R Block was a very relaxed and easy place to work. The tax professionals were very helpful to the clients and employees. It was a temporary part-time position that I found enjoyable.
good,"There were quite few, the most typical was when my manager went for a meeting and I had to manage the office. This day was one of the busiest day as per work load and on the top of that I had to answer all important calls and manage office .I learned lot of things from that day, like managing office, management duties, time management and communicating with top management people. Workplace culture is great as everyone works as a team and management looks after the people. Hardest part of the job is to deal with difficult clients. Most enjoyable part of the job is meet the expectations of the clients and see them going with the happy faces."
good,"Many of the staff are willing to help you understand information that is new to you.  What you are not familiar with, the staff or internet resources can be helpful."
good,This is a great place for seasonal work but it just does not offer the benefits like health insurance that really met my needs.  Worth it if you want a job to have fun and get excellent experience in the accounting world.
good,"Fun environment, and also a good place to learn. Employees were friendly and enjoyable to work with. Most days were busy and kept you on your toes. Hours varied during busy tax season."
good,A typical day wasassiting clients with their tax preparations. I learned how to help individuals of all nationalities with their taxes.Tax prreparers within he office were helpful when problems arose in completing he return because we concerned ourselves as a team. Being a Tax Professional takes patience and commitment when learning the Rules and Regulations of the tax codes from IRS.  If an individual is not willing to put in the necessary time to learn theses then they are wasting their time.
good,H&R Block is a very motivated company. The training for the CSPs was very good. Hours were flexible and the work was interesting. Balancing customers and H&R workers was always challenging. Management was eager to help and assist in any area needed.
good,A great place to work. Gives me the flexibility to attend my family. Manager and coworkers are down to earth and understand my needs.  There is opportunity yo grow I the company.
good,"I loved working there even though it was only seasonal I feel like there were small things that could have been better if things were different but overall I did enjoy working there. "
good,"good place to work if your looking for a second job, they work well with you to get hours in while working around your full time job................................................"
good,"Entry level position to compute and prepare income taxes for H&R Block tax service. My overall opinion based on my first year expierence was a bit overwhelming. However, they say it's to be expected to first year tax professionals due various reasons. Inital first year tax professionals duties include; payment of income tax course , theory of how taxes are computed, preparation of all tax forms required for each individual's needs, ethics, due diligence, obtaining PTin number from the IRS, comprehension of all current tax codes and laws"
good,great management and amazing resources and support.  Enjoyed working with all types of clients and given great opportunities to learn new skills.  Also great co-workers.
good,Able to have a good work/life balance. Work culture of respect. Able to advance as much as you can (i.e. you can advance by taking the certification tests. There is no limitation of how many test you can take in a year. Excellent continue education program.
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work for it takes you out of your comfort zone and makes one a true professional.With information most will remember for a life time, taxes help one help others, and that something one can always be proud of. With incentives for continuing education, it's a win-win for everyone."

good,"Great support team, but the training was a little too much too fast and The hardest part of the job was not having enough work hours. but It is nice to work at H&R Block"
good,"Preparing taxes is challenging. Curve balls are the order of the day. Clients can be challenging, difficult, and may not always tell you everything you need to know."
good,I like the people I work with. They strive to be fair to everyone that works for them and they are ethical for the most part. My direct manager is fair.
good,"A typical day was taking calls, making appointments, orientate clients (walk-ins and in the waiting room). When the office was slow I audit and file documents. At the end of the day I make that everything was in order for the next turn or secretary."
good,"The typical work day at H&R Block when the office is not busy looks calm. During peek week, which is the busiest days at the office, there are many clients calling and walking in for appointments or asking information about our services. On a daily basis Client Service Professionals will get calls and will make calls. A LOT of calls. I learned that dealing with costumers can be a little difficult at times but it can be well managed with the right attitude. Our main goal at H&R Block was to satisfy everyone who would walk through our front doors and that goal was almost always met everyday. The hardest part was of course pleasing everyone. Overall, this job was very productive and the H&R Block community was very welcoming which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Awesome workplace with the feel of fulfillment. Knowing new people and keeping your old clients in which they confide in you to help them with any questions and problems that may have occurred.

good,H&R Block will work around someone's employment schedule.  Typical day is working with people to prepare their taxes and to file the tax return with the IRS.
good,"I have worked here for many years in different capacities.  I Love serving the clients and the knowledge that I get through training, teaching and classes."
good,busy and quiet I usually work alone and get stuff done very quickly. The other tax preparers and management are very busy but friendly as well. there wasn't a hard part about this job it was extremely easy and relaxing I guess.
good,"Working here as been a walk in the park. I make and receive phone calls, book appointments, file, entertain the waiting room, and do some minor cleaning. The worst part of the job is dealing with angry clients, and as a CSP one can't do a lot for them."
good,"work for H & R Block for many years I enjoy working with numbers"
good,"I learned that being an Office Manager you have lots of responsibilities, you have to manager 12 people and satisfy each and everyone of their needs and stay on top of your game to be successful in the workplace. Stay on top of answering emails, dealing with clients that sometimes give you a hard time and stay consistent. Great place to start if you're looking to build experience, the pay is good and hours are flexible."
good,"The place was really good. I truly enjoyed the friendly environment, it helped the work day go by faster. The manager was great, she helped me if I had any questions. I would defiantly work there again."

good,Good company to work with. Good entry point for new immigrants to those who want to get into their Accounting and Finance fields.very good training to update knowledge.
good,"I thought training was going to be more complete, but it was a joke. Hopefully they take our suggestions and improve for the next training session. The majority of the training is on the job, and coincidently, on the hot seat. Which, actually makes sense, since a lot of people learn better while under pressure (Okay that was a horrible experience but I know how to do it now). Co-workers and bosses get it, and are always ready to help. Just kind of weird how the phone calls are randomly monitored and scored for the newbies after only two weeks. Hardest part of the job? Probably having to deal with yelling callers while making sure you meet the call criteria so you pass call inspections. There is NO healthcare for this job though, since its seasonal."
good,"On a typical day I would perform five to eight tax returns, make several copies of documents, fax documents for clients, and make appointment for clients to complete their tax returns. My manager was very nice and patient with me. Fellow co-workers were also nice and friendly and we all tried to help each other as much as possible. The hardest part about working with H&R Block was constantly learning something new every day about taxes. The most enjoyable was interacting with my clients and learning about H&R Block."
good,"Every day was different because of the variety of personalities and circumstances of our customers. This helped me learn and to better my skills as an income tax preparer and as a person, as I would learn of their situations as I interviewed them to be able to better prepare their tax returns. I have always been a team player and make new friends with my co-workers."
good,"Envioroment depends on where you are placed. Each office is different, but it is just like any other receptionist job. You call people, make appointments, and file client folders. Its a good temporary job for experience, but you can also go further with it if you want."
good,I enjoyed working for this company I know I can always go back if I ever need to. The pay was good and they gave raises every year.
good,"To obtain a position in which I can utilize my skills and experience to contribute to the success of a"
good,As RFS Support you are always learning something new everyday. Either tips or tricks on how to use the software more efficiently or increasing your knowledge about taxes. Hardest part of the job is not knowing how to solve the issue but with teamwork this hurdle can overlooked.
good,"Typical day consists of preparing the office for open, making coffee,  counting the cash drawer,  checking in clients, confirming appointments for the next 3 days, completing sales transactions,  matching first time clients with appropriate tax level professional. Closing duties were light cleaning. Love this job, coworkers are great, management is amazing, and flexible with my schedule. I wish it were seasonal. Everyone in the office always helps each other if a tax pro has a question and no one fights for clients like at other offices, they remain professional."
good,I enjoyed the staff at the troy location and it was placed in a good location regarding getting to and from work. And I especially enjoyed the coworkers that I had working around me
good,"Is a good place to work, they just have seasonal positions, so..."
good,It's a great company to work for and the people are awesome! The only reason i'm having to leave is because I was hired on and promised full time hours and i'm barely getting part time because they don't have hours to give me.
good,Professional and quality customer oriented service and prompt customer service protocol.  Accounts receivable initial activation and balance transactions.  Telephone operator and computer appointment scheduler and  management.
good,Wonderful company to work for with great management. I enjoy working a seasonal position with wonderful co-workers. The company offers extensive training with the opportunity for advancement.
good,"While we have a time frame a typical day is not heard of.  We work in a group and alone at times, however we always have each others backs.  We are always willing to help out another Tax Professional. Everyday is a learning day, you never know what will be asked.  Every client is completely different.  The hardest part of the job is never knowing what a typical day is like, it can start out slow and turn into something completely different."
good,"In the almost 10 years I have been with the company people have always asked me what it is that we do outside of tax season."
good,"I think this is a duplicate, as I have already reviewed this company."
good,I loved working for H &R Block because they give their employees extensive tax training course. They also allow their employees to move up in employment by taking tests. H & R Block really is a great employer to work for out of any other tax service I have worked.
good,Great company to work for. Excellent support and flexibility. I enjoy coming back every years because of my loyal clients and office team.
good,"Manager of this branch is very good at allowing the office to run smoothly, while offering suggestions and help when needed.  Great co-workers! Fun environment while building a tax client business! Co-workers very helpful when second opinion or help is needed. A lot of experience at this branch."
good,Districts and Markets vary but overall the company looks at results. I've learned and gained great working experience working along side District Managers and Corporate Leadership
good,"Overall, H&R Block is a fun place to work. Most employees are socially interactive and enjoy spending time there. However, due to the nature of the business, all positions are seasonal which means the company has little responsibility to provide superior Medical Insurance. What little is offered is not suitable for the income potential."
good,"I worked for H&R Block for 8 years. I started off as a tax professional in Dallas, TX and worked my way up to Office Manager III. They are a great company who appreciates their employees. I had 3 children within the 8 year span I worked their, scheduling is great; they work around the schedules of those who have first jobs which is a great to find in a company. I worked as a tax specialist for 5 of the 8 years, working in the summers as an audit specialist and last 3 years was promoted to Office Manager that in which I was doing taxes, audit work, coaching employees and managing my office. Marketing events were very enjoyable.."
good,H&R Block provides a high level of expertise to all of their clients. High level of quality training and many opportunities for advancement. Great people to work with and for. Excellent job to work around family life and not loose the opportunity of a full time career.
good,Learned a lot of detail information that enabled me to perform well. Day consisted of interacting with customers. Searched for leads. Hardest part was working in a timely matter along with ensuring quality.
good,"I enjoyed working with H & R Block because of the flexibility of the hours and days that I work. I also enjoyed the ability to move around throughout the company and to learn new skills. The most frustrating part of the job was trying to explain to clients that the cost for tax preparation varies upon the client need and situation (some people just didn't want to hear that). I did, however, enjoy meeting new people everyday. What I disliked about working with H & R Block is that at the end of the tax season, if you are not a Tax Professional, you are required to ""take a break"" (you are laid off) for a minimum of 8 weeks. I loved my co-workers and find it unfortunate that I have to leave to look for other opportunities."
good,"Typical day would be when our system is down and clients are waiting."
good,"You determine your pay - it is not only based on service years but also on the continuing education you take.  The more you increase your value to the company, the more you make."
good,"I work for Franchise owners, and not Corporate, so my experience is based on that.  The Franchise owners are terrific people to work for, and they train you quite well."
good,"Working with H&R Block have been an amazing experience learning and interacting with my coworker and clients."
good,"Not only does this job train you to deal with stress, it helps build lasting customer relationships to ensure business stays up every year."
good,Fast pace and sometimes stressful. The co-workers are friendly and willing to help when needed. The management is very supportive. You meet new people.Most of your clients will come back year after year and develop a relationship.
good,The Tax Enterprise requires many hour of studying to become certified.   Customer service requires training also.
good,"My typical day would be working with clients, preparing taxes, tax planning, solving problems, brain storming with other tax preparers."
good,A typical day at work consist of greeting clients and preparing simple to complex tax returns. I may have to assist in helping the client with an audit assistance which means spending hours on the phone with the Internal Revenue Services and fixing the error that was incurred. The hardest part of my job is getting the client to understand what is going on with the situation that they currently may have. It takes a lot patience to get clients to understand the tax laws. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the client through a tough situation and seeing the smile on their face after fixing an error that may have existed and also learning new information while helping the client.
good,"seasonal job, which is great, so you only work about 4 months out of the year,"
good,"flexible hours, great management, great customers , great place to learn about tax laws."
good,Exceptional seasonal opportunities that enables one to learn and utilize tax knowledge.
good,Always able to learn something new. Management is very supportive. Great team envirnoment.
good,Was a very nice place to work manager was very helpful in teaching me the more complicated tax returns.
good,I have to say that working for H&R Block is a really a great place to work. I like and appreciate how they are willing to work with you on the hours of work as well as helping you continue with your learning and certifications on advancing to the next level every year.
good,"A typical day at work for me began at 4:45 a.m. and consisted mainly of receiving inbound calls regarding client's needs. Those needs varied from tax appointments needing to be set/cancelled/rescheduled/directions; and/or issue resolution regarding H&R Block's other many products and services."
good,"A great, faced paced work environment. Would recommend working at H&R Block."
good,"I really like working with H&R Block and the many things that they offer you, however, it is only a seasonal job so that is really the only down fall. Working for H&R Block is great, it gets really busy and you will encounter situations that some times you do not know what to do or expect but keeping your mind clear definitely works."
good,"Tax preparation - always encouraged by office leader to challenge ourselves.  Learned more about tax preparation, various levels and requirements.  Great co-workers, the most enjoyable part are the people you meet and the relationships you establish."
good,Hands on tax preparation. Great job if you love #'s. Every day is different and every client is different.
good,"H&R Block is a great company to work for as long as you go in with your eyes open.  It is seasonal work, and for that season, you will be extremely busy.  There are two ""peak"" periods in each season, and those you will work even harder.  It is challenging but rewarding work when you are able to help someone understand their taxes.  However, you will run into people every so often who are trying to scam you, the IRS, or both.  However, the training that is provided is top notch, and they really drill into you how important confidentiality and research can be.  Great place to work.  My only gripe is that, as seasonal work, you can't rely on it as a full-time job unless you get involved with upper management.  If I can't find a full time job before training season starts, I plan to work for them again."
good,"Great wages for the position, great managers, and great family oriented atmosphere."
good,"The job is a perfec fit for anyone seeking a secondary job that's flexible and can work around your schedule. There is advancement and compensation is largely based on your own work ethic allowing for big pay offs. "
good,I loved my job here and miss not only my co-workers but H&R Block's clients.
good,Atypical day at work begins and ends with a satisfied customer.  Learned so much about the tax code and its interpretation. Have a great office leader who works with a particular employees needs.  Co-workers became a family of support.  Hardest part of job is the rare client who just couldn't be satisfied no matter what you did.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the one on one with the customers.
good,"You work hard for the money, but overall it's a nice company to work for. It is hard to balance work and personal life because once you're in tax season, your personal life is essentially placed on pause. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the work was to do the best possible tax return for the clients and when clients were living the office happy, promising to come back the next tax season."
good,"My typical day at work was answering the phone, filing, calling customer to confirm appt., and in general taking care of any customers when they come in. I learned to prioritize and manage my time in a busy office. Management was easy to work with and receptive of my ideas. My co-workers were for the most part fun to work with and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was juggling everyone's schedule and still keeping the customers happy. The best part of my job was learning from the tax pro's and helping people get through a tough part of their lives."
good,The ability to remove some of the mystique  of income tax preparation and helping the client understand the hows and whys of their current tax situation and future tax planning
good,"Although preparing an accurate tax return is important, helping a client solve a problem is a priority."
good,Meet lots of people. Learn how many different situation are in pack due to tax laws.
good,Busy once tax season started. I learned there is a lot to doing income taxes! Management was awesome to work with. Learned a lot from co workers that had been there a long time! Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,Upper management was always available to provide constant feedback and suggestions for improvement.
good,"enjoyable part is working as a team and co workers are very friendly, meeting new people and helping them , and learning new things. helping client when they walkout from our office."
good,Great place to work and meet new people. Greet customers and set up appointments for clients with some of the best Tax professionals
good,"During tax season I work anywhere from 30 to 60 hours a week. For the most part I love my job and my coworkers. Nothing is quite as enjoyable as being able to help someone with their return and getting them a lot of money back. The downside is that I have to deal with quite a few people trying to lie and cheat the system. Since being there I have learned more about taxes than I even thought possible, and I've never enjoyed myself more."
good,A Typical Day at work was coming in the office and every Tax Pro welcoming you.I learned to have a lot of patience with people. Management would always keep an eye out just in case someone needed help.My Co workers always offered help even if you didn't need it which was nice and they would always show positive attitude. There wasn't ever a hard part about the job everything was smooth.The Most Enjoyable part of the Job was calling clients back and asking them how the service was and hearing how much fun they had with people in the office.
good,"A typical day entails timely client service to prepare income tax returns, resolves client issues, high call volumes, and follows up."
good,Very structured
good,"Employees are always learning new things, great possibility to advance to greater and better opportunity."
good,"As a tax preparer, I work with clients who have appointments with me - and others who simply come in and get assigned to me. When not working with a client, there are still plenty of other duties to attend to. The office environment is very good with current management and co-workers. There is great cooperation. Over the years, I have learned how easy it is to communicate with so many different personalities. I really enjoy helping clients and other tax preparers."
good,"The company provided courses of learning to advance in the tax field and had flexible hours for the courses and working hours plus a compensation package. The office environment was cooperative, friendly and co-workers were helpful to one another."

good,"As an employee for H&R Block I have had more good times than almost any other position. You get to help and educate the people in your community, while honing your own skills. I wouldn't recommend this job for financial security, but there are many more reasons why this company has become one of my favorites to endorse."
good,Typical day at work for me was filling out 8-10 tax returns. My co-workers were very friendly and easy to talk to. They didn't mind stopping what they were doing to help or answer any questions I had. Hardest part of the job was remembering all the rules and laws and not second guessing myself. I love working with the people though. The stories they had and you could just become part of their lives.
good,My experience with HR Block was a very interesting experience. This job help me see tax season through a tax company's eye. I wouldn't trade our four month family experience for anything.

I find that to be remarkable these days. The pay isn’t great but is fine for what we do. I like the ethic Block portrays.
good,"H & R Block is a great place to work, most of the employees are courteous and work as a group of team players...Although all employees are not the same, H &R block is driven on completing accurate tax returns and demonstrating quality excellence to each and every client service by H 7 R block"
good,"This job was super easy and gave some good in-site on my career field and good knowledge on doing taxes. I'm going to school for Business Administration so it was the perfect job for m, except it was only for the tax season."
good,"I worked as Customer Service Professional which is mainly a receptionist position with some other responsibilities. My tax pros and manager were always very appreciative of my work and very helpful. Truly amazing people to work with. The offices I worked at everyone pitched in and helped each other. While the pay was not great, it was doable for the few months of tax season."

But then I noticed that I was not getting any returns to complete which was getting annoying, because I wanted to work and nobody(the receptionist and Managed) would give it to me. This was a common issue with First Years, I heard but still. I want work too guys. Overall, great company to work for."
good,"Very flexible hours with lots of competitions with bonuses attached to reward competitiveness.  Office goals are reasonable according to previous staff performance.  Tax school is mandatory to upgrade and continue learning but opportunities are available to work for the entire year, not just during tax season."
good,Although a stressful environment during peak weeks the bonds built with the Tax Professionals (TPs) make the environment fun and bearable. Learned alot about Customer Service and even learned about taxes on slow days from the TPs. My location was like a big family culture so it was great to come in and get a hello from everyone. The hardest part would be the last minute schedule changes. You also have an opportunity at the end of the season to do the tax course for free.
good,At my location I do marketing and drop off flyers to local places in the area. I also do CSP work to ensure all customers are attended and questions are answered.
good,"Most customers make an appointment for completion of their taxes and are matched to the tax professional that has the skill set required. Through the interview and form completion process, it is important to make the customer feel comfortable disclosing all their personal financial information to you. Completion of each form with accuracy is an absolute that is expected by the customer and should be an expectation of yourself.   Teamwork by the office manager and other tax professionals is a must. The hardest part of the job is time management; because simple returns can become complex returns due to each individuals circumstances.  The most enjoyable part is the customer expressing their satisfaction at the completion of the process."
good,"This job is great for someone who only wants to work part of the year. I worked there for many years, really enjoyed the people, and would love to work there again."
good,"Pull reports, review emails, phone huddles, huddles in the office, and Marketing.  If the office is busy I'll stay in the office; unless it is not busy, I'll go out and market."
good,I enjoyed my time here and met numerous people. The work pace was fast at times and slower at other times. My co workers where always willing to help when help was needed. If had the chance would return if I was seeking employment.
good,i love it great with numbers and a big people person.  just wish they paid more and had it year around for me. that would be great. not only for me but my family.
good,Great place to learn and work. Every client promotes a different experience sometimes resulting in further research. This helps the tax pro gain knowledge as well as educate the client.

good,I have been with Block for 11 years and can not see myself ever leaving this company. I started out as a customer service professional and after 2 seasons I decided to become a tax professional. That was the greatest choice I could have made for my career. I can choose my hours and I am in control of how much money I can make. What other profession gives you that?

good,I enjoyed working at H & R Block as a seasonal employee. Coworkers are great and I love meeting new people. The job can be stressful towards the end of the tax season but there are plenty of people for support.

good,"This is a seasonal position. The hardest part is the change of hours and days due to the corporate need .  Good part is the ability to adjust schedule due to family and personal needs.  Training is up to date and includes current information.  Managers are open to suggestions and take issues up to a higher level.  Employees who have worked for Block in previous years are always ready and willing to help/mentor new employees."

The managers where all hit-or-miss; the last two I had were terrible but it was the district manager that was an absolute nightmare. He got rid of an entire position because it wasn't under his control."
good,In H&R Block you will learn something new every day. Weather is through self research or through experience. At times it could get boring but for the most part your always meeting new people.
good,"I always look forward to going to work. The people I work with are laid back and pleasant to be around, and generally (so far) the clients are pretty cool, too. A typical day at work consists of answering the phone, scheduling/rescheduling/cancelling appointments, calling to confirm appointments, checking people in and cashing them out, all the basic things a receptionist does. People will call with tax questions that you won't know the answer to, but usually there's a tax pro available to take the call if you need them to. Everyone is very helpful when you have questions or need something. What I enjoy most about the job is the social aspect of it. You get to chit chat with people while they're waiting, talk on the phone, and when the tax pros aren't with a client, a lot of times they'll come up to my desk and hang out and talk with me. Management is awesome, too- laid back and kind people. The job in my opinion is really easy. I will definitely consider coming back to work again next tax season."
good,"Nice place to work to learn about taxes, but the first year you are not paid well because you are not eligible for commission.  This sucks but you can take classes and next year earn more."
good,On a typical day at work i file about 4 tax returns.  I learned there are a lot of dishonest people.  I feel the management is very low key and easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is documenting rentals.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making someone smile when they get the results of the refund.
good,"I worked for a franchise so it's going to vary where you work as far as pay, benefits and so on. It can get stressful, but overall it's not a bad place to work. The best thing about working here is when you have returning customers year after year, it becomes like a little family. I loved that part of it."

good,"Seasonal Employment "
good,"This was a great place to work, your always learning new things and meeting the clients that come in can be such a fun experience.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people and getting them the most money back in their tax return."
good,It is a very comfortable job if you do not mind sitting at a desk all day! In this industry you have to be able to organize and count. The office that I work for consisted of six very loyal and supportive women. It was like a close family
good,The work day busy for the most part. Days start off slow and gradually gets very busy. I learned how to schedule taxes and be organized for an important tax company. The management helped with organization and allowed me to learn from them. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customer satisfaction.
good,It's a fun place to work. Easy enough to do. In the branch I personally worked at there wasn't room to really advance. Management was very nice and understanding of personal issues and always listened.

good,"I answered the phone, scheduled appointments for clients, made reminder calls and any other duties as required by the office manager and H and R block."
good,"It was a pleasure working for H&R Block Tax Office here in Chicago. From our district manager to our office leader, everyone I worked with was extremely helpful and courteous in helping new hires."
good,Helping customers on a daily basis that best helps their needs and making sure the clients leave with their questions all answered. I learned a lot about filing a tax return and I learned a lot of answers to questions for tax preparation. Management is very nice and since the job is only seasonal they give you as many hours as needed or wanted as long as it's not over 40 a week. Co-workers are very friendly and we help each other when it comes to solving a problem on a tax return or a payment situation. The hardest part of the job is not knowing every single law with the IRS.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing clients happy leaving out the front door about the services they just had experience with H&R Block.
good,"Every day was different, challenging and filled with great people to work with. I came in knowing nothing about multi unit  operational management and was able to come away with a greater understanding."
good,Love working here. Hate that it is seasonal. Such a good company to work for. Wish wages were a little higher to compensate for how much driving is needed. And the CSP hours need to be more than 3-4 hour shifts.No one can afford this.
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, and co-workers. Wide range of client situations and emotions to work with. Glad I was able to have the experience and training provided by this job path."
good,"The position is seasonal, but I've been back more than once! The employees and managers are wonderful and understanding people! It can get busy, but that's a given in this line of work. Everyone is very encouraging of others and completely willing to help each other out!"
good,"Fun co-workers, although some just cared about themselves."
good,Coming in each morning and preparing the front desk for the various clients entering the establishment for tax preparation and inquiries brings a great joy to me knowing that when the clients leave they will be relieved and elated that it was handled by the most proficient tax preparers and handled with total care.
good,"I enjoy working for H&R Block for a number of reasons. I love working with my clients, giving them the best experience possible at my tax desk. I enjoy helping make sure that we are doing the very best we can at making what can be a stressful experience and making it less so. "
good,I love my job at H&R Block. My co-workers and managers are all wonderful people and are like a second family to me. I had to learn a lot about office paperwork and what goes into filing taxes and making spreadsheets and filling out forms for people. I think that the hardest part of my job is keeping everything in line when you are being pulled different directions on a busy day. The best part of my job is most likely interacting with many different people on a daily basis.
good,"Great place to work, had a great team of marketing professionals. Great leadership and team relations.  Seasonal employment that I wish would have lasted year round"
good,"H&R Block is a good company for someone who loves to interact with people. The clients come for tax preparation and with the continuous tax education offered, the tax associate is able to keep abreast of the constantly changing tax laws and issues. "
good,"Awesome job to have. If you love to be around people and help others this is the job for you. Great compensation, benefits, and a flexible work schedule."

good,"a typical day at H&R Block can vary, my duties are phones, emails, invoices, scanning, filing and more. I love my job its faced paced, individually worked, no micro managing, friendly and its easy. the hardest part is the amount of mail we get..especially during tax season but it gives me a break from the monotonous day to day things. Working here I learned that change comes without any notice and it doesn't always have to be looked at like a bad thing. I've learned that I can do more than I can handle that's for sure and I'm okay with that."
good,"Being a Client Service Representative is very similar to a Receptionist position. There were busy days and calm days but overall I was kept busy with keeping the office in tact, organizing the files and contacting clients."
good,"I liked working here. My typical day of work was answering phones and setting up appointments for clients who wanted to get their taxes done. I also took payments as well. In this job, I learned a lot about customer service and I was able to take the things I learned here and apply it to any customer service job. "
good,Always learning new things. Short Season. Very laid back. No micro managing. Free training provided to advance career.
good,It was a nice look into the accounting world. I just wish there was more to do. They really didn't have me do too much and found myself sitting there doing nothing for most of the day. They were nice people and tried their best.
good,receptionist. assisting customers. answering phones. making appointments. co workers are very helpful with all questions.
good,"Awesome company to work for, great work enmvironment, everyone is very helpful with training. Only con is this is a seasonal job."
good,A Typical Day at work would be Greeting clients and making appointments and Reminder calls. I learned a lot about keeping customers content.  Management and Coworkers were very friendly.  Hardest part about the job was making sure that the clients stayed content with out them storming off.  the most enjoyable part was getting to know the clients/
good,"First office job, got to learn alot about office clerical position as well as management,"
good,Great times working with other professionals and learning about the tax regulations that challenge so many people. I learned how to navigate the tax framework while explaining the regulations to our clients. The most challenging part was helping someone understand why they owed the amount of taxes they owed.
good,"My job is high demand, and very stressful, however I work better under pressure. I like the job and it provides a new experience everyday. I work with great clients and co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent decisions and actions of the owner."
good,The H&R Block I work for is very flexible with my hours I request what days I can and can not work. Great for a parent. Co-workers are great!
good,I love doing taxes or working with #'s. I like that every return is different and there are many things to figure out. I like to be  challenged. We all work together and help each other out in the office. The hardest part is building clientel.
good,"very fast paced, Driving cuustomers to and from their medical appointments"
good,I have a full time job as a caseworker for the Department of Social Services and H&R Block was a perfect fit for my schedule. It's basically like working for yourself but with the guidance and support of a corporation. They even have summer positions if you wanted to work past the tax season.
good,"As a seasonal employee, this is the perfect job for me. They are quite flexible with scheduling. HR Block is up to date on all IRS information and pass it on to each and every employee. Great communications even for part-time seasonal employees."
good,Training easily available and comprehensive. Clients a pleasure to work with. Management always available.
good,"This is a very good company to work for, they have very good benefits. At the begining the pay is not good at all, but once you progress in your skills and learnings the sky is the limit! Great work ethics. Perfect for retired people and other individuals that love to help people, and want to do something different for a few months of the year."
good,"A typical day at work would be when I arrive at work, I would have clients schedule by the hour sometimes by the half hour. I would prepare Federal and State tax returns until close of business sometimes after hours. The hardest part of the job is trying to accomplish all that needs to be down in one work day. Sometimes you have to return clients calls the next day because how late it was the night before. I enjoy meeting new people and seeing returning clients."
good,I have the best bosses that anyone could ever ask for. I just wish that this was a year round job.
good,"It will depend on which office you will work at. I was lucky to work with nice people, who wanted to work as a team, had no judgments, had good relationship with customers, etc."
good,"H&R Block provided me with excellent educational opportunities so I could raise my expertise as a Tax Preparer and I was encouraged to learn as much as possible. I was provided with unlimited business cards at no charge to me and encouraged to give them out freely. Since tax preparation is a seasonal job, I was able to find full-time/permanent work elsewhere and adjust my H&R Block schedule during tax season to coincide with my other full-time job. H&R Block also reimburses the fee I have to pay each year for my tax preparer license."
good,This company is a great career starter for accounting majors. Starting off as a tax accountant is a perfect way to build your resume for future accounting jobs.
good,So far very friendly and flexible.   Able to work around your needs and still get hours.  Management is nice and as long as your here for the job your good.
good,"good place for part time work.  You get paid on commission,  Can choose how many hours you want to work.  If you do not get along with a particular manager, you can work at a different location."
good,Fast pace and fun at times. I liked meeting all the people and interacting with them. I learned a ton with all the rules and regulations and how to properly do taxes. I took a whole course and had to pass a test to be able to do it. The office was great and all the people I worked with were great. My manager was amazing and so good to us. The people were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was the stress and trying not to make a mistake.
good,"I go back year after year because of my clients.  I have a lot of regular clients.  I make their experience fun. We all work as a team, I have been with H&R Block for 18 years we have a good time working together."
good,"Very flexible, schedule is based on your availability. Only seasonal, but with possibility to work year round as well (part time only). "
good,"H&R Block was a great place to work. I loved waking up and going to this job every morning. I would have done this 7 days a week for 365 days a year if I could. Everyone in the workplace was very helpful and friendly. If you needed help with something, there was an abundance of people you could ask. A typical day at work consisted of handling 70+ inbound chats/calls daily to resolve any technical issues our clients would experience. From this job, I learned that the harder you work, the more you should be rewarded. The more passion and excitement you pour into a company, the more you should become cherished. This is because most people wake up and hate going to their job. They do as little as they can until they finally punch out and go home. If you bring that attitude into the work environment, you don't deserve to advance. Management was very helpful at the on-site location of H&R Block Technical Support Center. This was a job where you could fully engage and get to know your managers on more than a business level. They were always willing to join a remote session to assist in rectifying any situation. The hardest part of the job was dissecting foreign languages over the phone. Since we did not have a team of bilingual agents to decode the transcript, we would have to do our best to break down what the customer was saying. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to successfully resolve an individual clients issue. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from helping someone else fix their problem in a field that you have mastered."
good,"It has been a great experience meeting new people while helping them through a time that is stressfull to most. Tax Season!"
good,H&R Block even though it is corporate strongly believes in a work/life balance. Upper management is great and is also very supportive.They offer great compensations as well.
good,"I would go in store and open it up clean the office fill copy and fax machine check or set up voice mailbox answer phones, set appointments, file paperwork I was constantly working and staying busy my co workers were greatest I got along with everyone. Great Managers the most enojoyable part of the job was to go in in the mornings and set the office up and make sure everyone is stress free that day I would be constantly helping out the tax proffesionals so there work was less stressful. the hardest part of job was when i was setting up appointments and 3 other phone lines start ringing there was a lot of multi tasking but me being me I got the Job done sucessfully"
good,"As the management of H&R Block said, ""If it is not fun we are not doing it right"". This sums up my experience at H&R Block. My co-workers are definately the most enjoyable part of my job. It is just an amazing positive environment to be  around."
good,"I believe that there is no greater service than the one that H & R Block provides."
good,I love working for H&R Block. I love helping my clients with preparation of taxes and assisting them their issues. I have the best co workers in the industry.

good,I enjoyed working at H&R block . The people are wonderful to work with . I love to interact with others and learn new things . I look forward to the next tax season and learning more . 
good,Prepare tax returns on a seasonal basis for various individual clients.
good,"Typical day at work is to set up the computer with the programs used so if any calls are taken, you can schedule appointments and see what is going on for the day. When a client walks in to get their tazes done you take down their information, enter it into the computer and notify tax professional they are there. I learned all the great new products the company is offering (compared to last year) to get clients in the door. The management is very helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing clients satified with the service provided to them."
good,I enjoyed helping people and learning. They offered me a great education to learn tax laws and excel in being able to prepare w-2 all the way to begin able to also prepare for business and their personal accounts as well
good,"Fast pace, a lot to learn.  Keeps dull routine away.  Always fun and competitive.   Learning opportunities within the career.  Growth is there.   Worth it"
good,"answering phone calls and setting up appointments  "
good,"Loved working with Clients."

good,Company is very organzied and offers great training to their staff.  Staff is great to work with and work well together.  It is fast paced but helping the client makes it worthwhile.
good,Great company to work for. Office staff is very helpful and always available for any questions or documents i may need to do my job correctly. Every one is very nice and personable.
good,"H & R Block, is a refreshing business to work for due to the new customers that are coming and going everyday. Seeing personally that you can brighten someones day with helping them with a question, or preparing taxes makes you feel as though you are achieving life lessons; To be givers and not takers. There is also a down side to the customer service world: not being able to help everyone. But with character training, taking more courses, and encouragement to seek out more knowledge, anything is obtainable."
good,"You can always get help from your colleagues and supervisors. Work on a team."
good,"A typical day at work was receiving phone calls, calling people back, making computer appointments, in-person appointments, and maintaining the cleanliness of the lobby. I learned the at-the-time computer program when it was still in use. Management was good, the job itself was fairly self-explanatory. When I had a problem it wasn't an issue to ask for help. They were always happy to help. My coworkers, being 25+ years older then myself, still made the environment enjoyable. The hardest part was learning how to work with conflict and help resolve the issues. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I was benefitting people in any way that I could."
good,"	Responsible for scheduling appointments, and checking people in."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,I had a good time with my co-workers. I learned a lots of new subject every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the client.
good,"The telephones never stopped to come to me for problems.   "
good,when I worked at H&R Block I had a great experience I learned so much from it. My co workers were so helpful they needed help and I was stuck I know that I could account on them to help me. the hardest part about my job was that it was text service job so you had to learn all your basics to in order for you to get certified for it. it was a lot of learning was a lot of classes a lot of hours for me to have that type of job so I really value the job that I had.
good,"A typical day at work is busy during tax season. There is phone calls all day with questions from clients, new clients and clients from other tax companies looking for you to review their taxes. I have learned a lot of different skills from this company. I LOVE this job and the company I work for. They treat their associates well and give them oppertunity to grow within the company."
good,"I have enjoyed working with H&R Block. This is my first year and I do plan to re-apply in the fall. The work was what I expected it to be and my coworkers were always there to help and guide me. If it was something that I didnt know or didnt understand, they were happy to help. They kept me on my toes and that is my type of JOB!"
good,this job is very interesting you have the opportunity for know a lot people there and I to felt a great satisfaction when the clients said thank you for your excellent job that's very good because I felt power for do better my job each day.
good,Well intentions from the corporate office but poorly managed and maintained from a district perspective and not hiring professionals that are strong in tax knowledge or professional appearance..
good,It is a very moody environment to work in.  The owners are not on the same page and often do not give each other any respect.  Its a lot of a competition.
good,"Been with HR Block for 15 years, best to get your taxes preparation. Provide excellent custom support service by increasing clientele and ensuring confidentiality of files."
good,The managers are brought in from outside the company and they never come in because they are salary while you are hourly. Customers don’t know anything about taxes but claim you are bamboozling them. They charge too much for their services and you get complained at for it. No advancement. Barely any education unless you have a degree in the field.
good,You learn a lot of new things and the hardest part is making sure you don't make an error on someone's return. Numbers can be tricky.
good,I answered phones all day and cashed out customers.My coworkers were great. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy customers. I know we all can't have a perfect experience but I tried to make it happen.the management was new so it was not very organized.
good,greet customer daily .that your customer are first priority. management was fine .they were ok . job was simple . enjoyable interacting with a diverse group of people.
good,"The training provided prior to beginning the employment was intense but good.  The job itself was not satisfactorily at all.  Too many people were trained because they were getting pay for each trainee, however, there were not enough jobs for all the trainees.l  The pay was very low and sometimes I was sent to offices that way too far, and therefore, the expense out weighted the compensation."
good,this was a good job you can learn a lot from the people who work here but its only during tax season but its a great skill to have it will always be with you
good,"As I worked with this company, our office functioned well as in a family setting.  We all worked well together.  We set an example for the clients in dealing with one another as well as with thems I looked forward to beginning my day at work as each brought about something new and interesting. I learned to adapt to situations at a moments notice and acted accordingly.  As co-workers, we showed respect for each other and accepted our differences as to what each brought to the office table.  The hardest part of the job for me, I would say is just making sure that during peak time, everything was just so. That's why it is important to have co-workers who have one other's back.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being an important part of the body as it were, putting my personal skills to use in order to be valuable to H & R Block"
good,"Good place to work poor training. The hardest part of the job was being cussed out on a daily basis, sometimes with every call. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"Did not like our manager, she has a terrible attitude and you never knew what her mood was going to be.  She was never available for phone calls never answered emails or texts. Very critical of everyone"
good,"A great place to work , fun atmosphere and great people! manager s appreciate the people and so does the district managers, we always feel wanted. I usually cant wait for tax season, it s always fun the first day of work because usually the same people come back year after year and so its like a mini reunion. we have potlucks, birthday party's and it is great, there is a little stress during peak times but help each other through it."
good,"H&R Block is a good place to work.  I get to meet new people and help them out with appointments and getting ready for their tax professional.  Everyone is great to work with, we all help each other."
good,Nice place to work and meet new people. You learn a lot .a typical day at work what you learned. You can go to different H&R Block. Nice place to work.
good,When I worked for this company the perks were great and it was a fast paced enviorment. there was never a dull moment when you came in to do your job. I would work for this company year around if I could do so
good,"Prepared taxes seasonal only. Worked with customers nearly 12 hours a day. Stayed busy, professional work place though."
good,"M-S"
good,I had another job and communication made it unbearable.  I get off early from job to get to hr block to find class was canceled or schedule was changed because someone couldnt work her hours and you wasn't notified after driving to another state to work.
good,"This is not a bad company there is a lot of things that could have been changed and better managed, there were a lot of changes made for the good of the company."
good,"Fun job, setup new offices, troubleshoot servers, secured and backed up data. I had a district responsibility up to 10 locations. Setup all new seasonal locations(i.e.. Sears) monitored data and security of clients SS numbers and data."
good,H&R Block has a great training program - taught me about income taxes and services to the client.   Very busy during tax time and have to deal with people that are angry they have to pay taxes and don't want to wait for an appointment - was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was a client's happiness when you saved him/her money and they got a good tax refund.  Co-workers very knowledgeable and hard working.
good,This wasn't too bad to work for although they don't provide you with any sort of training. It depends on your store and the tax pros you work with.
good,"Good seasonal job, salary is too low, no benefits. Office is too small, and hours were not distributed properly"
good,"Seasonal work,and it was a good working experience."
good,"My day was typical scheduling appointments and getting tax checks ready for customers, closing out the daily bank receipts, meeting customers. I learned how to get checks ready for printing. My co workers were there whenever I need help with any assignment that I did not know. The hardest part of my job was trying to explain to customers why their check was not ready, and the most enjoyable part of my job was just be able to help customers get a need done."
good,Working for HR Block was great the first few years but after my ninth year I realized it was not about the employees it all about the clients that walk in and if you have a manager that does not have compassion then it becomes more challenging to gain retention.
good,"Again, a tax office. It's a very stressful, time consuming career. I left after 18 years to make more money. There was nothing I didn't like at Block."
good,H&R Block is one of those places that can help you learn basic skills and proper work ethics for your future endeavors. It is a fast paced environment and an overall nice place to work.
good,"I really enjoyed working at H&R Block.  Just wish I could support my family by working there year round.  The folks that work here are your typical people that enjoy helping others, and they put a lot of effort into maintaining their skill level in tax preparation and skills."
good,Hire someone that's not even trained to manage people. The company defiantly is a awesome company to work for just need better management. I would recommend certain areas for h&r block
good,"a fast paced job. On.ly worked from Jan to April each year . I learned and was educated in the tax world. We took 30 hrs yearly of tax classes."
good,Love helping families with there taxes and finding them the most money possible. Learned not everyone can have a plan for savings for the future. The hardest part is when clients have to pay the IRS. The most enjoyable is the smiles I get from my clients.
good,"A typical day at work would include answering phones, making appointments, calling scheduled clients to remind them of their upcoming appointments, filing, generating reports, mailing letters, retrieving IRS acceptance numbers, taking payments, making copies, greeting clients, assigning tax prepares to clients per their experience, filling out and mailing thank you cards, sending faxes, and managing other receptionists."
good,Great place to work and start out in marketing. I enjoyed managing 3 districts ad 65 locations to conclude a successful tax season.
good,"I enjoy working at the front meeting people, answering the phone, filing, computer use, copying documents, etc. I did not enjoy vacuuming the rugs, taking care of the garbage and hauling it out to my car and hauling it away. company to cheap to get a dumpster. the clients are free to use our bathroom which I did not agree with. the program for the receptionist was not adequate enough to be able to take care of my mistakes without bothering the office manager. the co workers were polite and helpful to me. I had notes put on my wall of the desk to help me remember things to do according to the receipts, making appointments, etc.  I reorganized the area where we store items so that we had enough room for the clients to get around with falling over the items. I unpacked the new chairs that was bought. I carried heavy boxes up stairs into the office and emptied them and broke the boxes apart to be able to throw them away."
good,"Very good place to work where you meet wonderful individual from different cultures. This company offers a chance for advancement if one so desire. Although there is not health insurance, the pay is good."
good,"Temporary position, wasn't there long enough to really let things sink in. I did like the Office manager though. She was very nice and always had something positive to say."
good,"It was a clean and organized company, however, your job was not guaranteed from one year to the next."
good,• Prepared and organized employee’s schedules to meet clients expectations
good,Working for this company is a great opportunity to learn how to prepare taxes and all the laws as they relate to taxes.  Having knowledge of both business/ individual financial operations is an asset in that it helps you with both working ability and privately
good,"After peak (2/1-2/20), things start slowing down and aren't as fast paced like at the beginning of tax season. They offer incentives for doing good on the job, and they offer paid mileage when you quirk at other locations."
good,"H & R block are very thorough in their training if you work as a customer representative you can get your tax preparer training paid for , This course is a 60 hour class and can be very hard at some times."
good,This job is very stressful and can be very emotional if you get too attached to the clients. Whilst they are waiting you are the one who is communicating with them. Sometimes they come in and they are filing for the first time after their husband has died.
good,"This company works on a temporary basis. It is a great place to gain experience in customer service then move on ot being a tax preparer."
good,"A typical day at work--prepare individual income taxes"
good,This job I was the first & last face you saw.  I worked the front desk & got to meet a lot of clients who have become family.  Needed something more than seasonal employment.
good,No a bad company will have good days better than every you can talk to people get to know people. You have opportunity to open or close if you are Csp you filling papers calling old clients and some new ones some people are mean and rude as ever but like I said some days are better then other it can have it chili days but it awesome overall
good,this is a good part time job for anyone interested in financial field. tax season is very busy at this company. I would recommend it  for anyone who wants to make decent income in short time
good,Appointments were made with enough time allotted to properly screen travelers.  Office setting was relaxed but professional which allowed for good engagement with travelers.  No micromanaging.  Employees given the flexibility to make decisions.
good,"Greeting customers and taking care of their tax needs.  Helping the receptionist answer tax questions and phone needs.  "
good,"Great place to meet people from various background.  Many people are nervous when preparing their taxes, this position allowed me to help clients relax before and after their appointment."
good,"Fast paced, exciting, never a dull moment, meet and greet new clients, working with tax professionals, managers willing to work with you on schedules."
good,I love this job and it its a perfect seasonal job.  However I need something full time. I get to meet very interesting people and help them understand more about their taxes
good,"Greeting clients, answering phones, preparing taxes, scheduling appointments, working on getting new clients in to do taxes, and some general office duties"
good,I love working there! Everyone was so helpful and it had such a family atmosphere. Most all the clients were returns from years before and was wonderful seeing them again!
good,Great place to understand personal taxes. The courses are the best I have ever seen in the industry. If you’re trying to understand de REG part of the CPA exam I highly recomend to do a season with HR Block.
good,H & R Block is a professional and fast paced culture company to work for.  I enjoy working with all of my clients. Learning something new every year and required to complete continuing education annually.
good,"This is a good part time job if you want to work seasonally.  They offer continuing education and plenty of hours in most offices.  Unfortunately most office managers are overloaded or not cut out to lead.  Also, they do try to push for people to treat this as a full-time job when many employees only work for the tax season and have other jobs that pay their bills."
good,It's a seasonal job and if there is a good mix of colleagues it is a great environment.  The office I work at has had a very good composition in recent years.
good,"All the coworkers are friendly and help as much as possible. Some customers can be difficult but that's because they screwed up doing their taxes on their own and then want us to fix it, but only if we can. We are not miracle workers, lol!"
good,"I started as a receptionist before ultimately moving up by taking the income tax course and becoming a tax preparer. Had a lot fun, learned about marketing."
good,typical day is preparing tax return. Learned more tax law. Work well with co-workers
good,enjoyed working with different cultures and ethnic groups
good,"My job at H&R Block was wonderful!  I enjoyed being the 'first face' our clients met in the office.  I loved greeting people, scheduling their appointments, making them comfortable so they would feel good about their experience with H&R.  The office was hectic, fast paced, different every day.  Our Client Service Leader was supportive and a true leader, who emphasized associates' strengths and made them feel good about their performance.  I LOVED my team of tax pros.  Couldn't have asked for a better group.  The hardest part of my job was when it was over on April 15th.  I loved the interaction with clients...that was my favorite part.  Oh, and they paid me!  Bonus!"
good,"Walk in, check the briefing board. Then get signed into all programs and get started preparing tax returns."
good,Working at H & R Block has been a very enlightening experience. I was able to extend my knowledge at this job.
good,"I learned how to be customer service orientated, manage was good , however there did tend to be some backbiting ."
good,I loved working there. the people were awesome. it was like on big happy family. They wanted me to go to school so I could be a tax person as well. they would take the time to show me how it was done and answer any questions I had
good,Making appointments and greeting the clients.
good,"If it was full time and better pay, it would be the perfect job. I love the people here!"
good,A typical day at work is a professional environment that strives on customer service. The learning experience is ongoing with the tax law. Management and co-workers are always willing to inform and help in any means necessary. One of the hardest parts of the job is when a tax po has done a return and the client decides not to get their taxes done or they cannot pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping and educating the clients why their taxes are being done.
good,It was a great opportunity I learned a lot about
good,"My duty is to prepare clients' individual income tax return to make sure they get back the maximum refund or pay the less tax. Since the clients' situations are not the same, the tax credits they can claim are quite different. It is a big challenge to conduct client interview as we need to cover all aspects which may have effect on the calculation of tax. After the interview I will do data entry, with accuracy and speedy. Then I will explain the result to client, letting them know how the result is that much and why there is a difference with prior year's return. Future, I will give clients tax tips for next year's return. Next I will collect the service fee and explain the fee we charge. At last I will file the return and store documents in designed area. It is a great job to start a professional career."
good,This was a great opportunity for a seasonal or short term income. Very fast paced and no time to even monitor the clock. The training was thorough and they were fairly decibel with scheduling. No benefits though as it was temporary work. I would work he fee again as an option to supplement income alongside potentially a job with benefits.
good,It was a great place to work. They was nice friendly and we had days they would by us food. They would give us training as needed. Also Representative of H & R block would come see how you are doing.
good,"Intensive Training as a customer of the product."
good,"I enjoy working for H&R Block. This will be my 12th year. The management changes and what we are paid are terrible. I have had to get a full time job and work only part time at H&R Block because of management changes, I was a manager with them for 6 years."
good,It was incredibly empowering to be able to do something many people have no idea how to do. I very much enjoyed developing a client base over my 11 years there.
good,"My experience with H & R block was informative, educational and environment was fine except for one (01) tax representative was very abusive verbally.  HR had to get involved."
good,"At H&R Block employees are mostly seasonal tax professionals who have direct contact with the clients to prepare their tax returns. "
good,"Scheduled appointments "
good,Working at H&R Block is very fun and requires attention and hard work. The new owners and management in Augusta though were not great. They do not keep their word and  declined to inform people that they were fired until the day they showed up for work even though we were told no one would get fired with the management change.
good,The most enjoyable part the job is see the clients leave with a small. The hardest part of the job is the hard days work. workplace culture is we where like family. The Management was great. What I learned was you can't make all Clients happy. A typical day at work was very easy.
good,I learned a lot about working with finances.  This is a seasonal job that I really enjoy because it is a great place to work. The information about taxes and investments have helped me with my personal finances.  The challenge of the trainings every year are fun.  I enjoy learning new things and keeping up with the current tax laws.
good,Greet clients as they come in. Prep and file income taxes for the clients. Take incoming calls and schedule tax appointments for the clients. Make outgoing calls to past years clients to schedule appointments.
good,"I loved interacting with the public and assisting the tax pro's, I loved being responsible for many  things with little to no supervision and the option to work as many hours as I wanted to. I loved being able to multitask and stay busy with answering the phone, making calls, checking in clients, preparing folders, files , taking payments, making appointments, making small talk while the clients waited for their appointments and opening and closing the office."
good,"Greeting clients, filing. I learned about taxes and how it really works.management was good. the hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy every client with prices. It was a fun tax season, wish it was yearly, provide other services like bookkeeping. I would go back for extra income."
good,"when tax season starts it can be a busy environment, and multitasking is a must. I learned a lot through the companies training, not only about my job but other aspects of the IRS."
good,"This an excellent seasonal job which provides adequate income if you don’t require a full time job. I love working with the clientele.  Assisting my clients each year with their taxes is my favorite part of the job.  The fact that management will work you 12 hours day if you let them, is s sign they should hire more personnel."
good,Anticipated my position there to be busier then it was.  Overall was a good experience.  I would have gone back the following year for tax season but got a full-time job and was unable to.
good,"Working for H & R Block was a learning experience and well worth the $9/hour to be a Receptionist."
good,"Even though it is only season, I will always go back to H&R Block."

good,"To enroll clients in our  Tax Identity Shield plan educating them on the services and plans, assisting clients in setting up their myblock.com accounts online, as well as answering questions on their  tax returns all while  offering up excellent customer service."
good,"Front desk type jobs such as greeting public, taking money, keep office clean. Keep office machines working. Knowledge of products. Phone experience.."
good,I have learned so much with this company. I meet very nice people while working with HR Block. I will be returning to this company in the next ta season.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working their. It is a fun and happy place to work. Employees are helpful and will answer questions and help where need. Managers are kind.
good,"I applied for a receptionist/scheduler job at H&R block but while interviewing was asked if I had ever considered tax preparation...I hadn't but the interviewer thought I would be an excellent candidate for a tax preparer, I was given a test and passed with a 100%. So I became a tax preparer. I t was one of the greatest jobs I had ever had, but because it was only seasonal it was not a long term option for me as I was a single mom of 3 children. I may however consider that career again now that my children are grown."
good,Great business model; cannot include confidential information.  Seasonal positions are great; the desire is to move into a full-time position.  Very hard working dedicated teams.
good,"It was okay to work there.  Not alot of advancement in the position I was in.  The management could be a bit better.  They did have flexibilty with hours you wanted to work, so that was a big plus."
good,"it can be a great place to work, but its seasonal and the wages suck."
good,"I have met many wonderful people here who are so helpful. There are opportunities for advancement if you choose. As a receptionist, my job is not very stressful, and at times I have to look for ways to keep busy, especially during the slow season."
good,"a typical day at work would be fun, I learned a lot about taxes, my bosses was outgoing and engeric. there was nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed going to work everyday and meeting new people!"
good,"The floor I worked for was very unorganized , the rules and regulations that they continued to withhold did not apply to everyone on the floor"
good,"Working at H&R Block was a great experience. I learned alot of new thinks like printing Western Union checks for clients that were in-tiled   to a refund, doing PWR, AFR, booking appointments,answer calls,end of day cash out, contacting clients to pay balances outstanding, and last but not least i love meeting new people and just talking to pass time.  Overall the company was a great work place, co-workers were friendly and so was management."
good,"Responsible for preparing, consulting and assisting tax returns for clients. Answering questions of tax procedures, rules and regulations."
good,"This was a very good part time seasonal job.  Office always ran smoothly.  I would like to of been kept a bit busier.  I would consider going back for seasonal part time again,"
good,I had to drive an hour or more to get to work.  The hours were long and some of the tax professionals that we took calls from weren't professional with us.
good,"Greet customers, answer phones, cashier and keep work area tidy.  Co-workers were friendly.  The best part of the job was greeting customers."
good,"I like my coworkers in the office we treat each other like family even after tax season we still keep in contact with each other, I also enjoy meeting new clients and catching up with the prior clients."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time with Block and the team at Block"
good,As stated above I worked with the clients and also the office staff. I checked clients in and out. I would also call to confirm the appointments for the next day. I also gave clients there checks when they arrived in the office.
good,"I like that the company had a high level on corporate integrity. They state their standards and I saw that there was a great effort to adhere to that standard. The associates I came into contact with were for the most part serious about serving their clients to the best of their ability. I also noticed that there was a great deal of collaboration. (I.e. if a Tax Pro didn't know how to do something, there were a lot of people willing to help them find the answer.)"
good,"Assisting customers, answering phones assist Tax preparers. "
good,"Management and employees were always on same team."
good,"Worked from 8am to 5pm m, w,th,f and 1-9pm t."
good,I enjoyed working with HR Block but we only work full time for four months.I especially like the way they encourage us to keep up with the latest tax laws. My co-workers change from season to season and I get to expand my network of informed tax pros; the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the people we met.
good,"This job was okay to work at if you wanted to work part time. The work isn't permanet, but its a job."
good,"a typical day at the office is report to work by 10am. answer phone calls, make tax appointments. take payments, data entry then float to different offices to see if the tax preparers have everything and then at the end of the day go to offices and close out the cash drawer. my co qorkers were very understanding and helpful although some tax preparers had bad attitudes. management was laid back long as u did ur work. the hardest thing was having to stay so late and the most enjoyable thing was being able to travel to various offices"
good,learned that i love customer service. Job wasnt hard. Enjoyed working with customers.
good,Great place to work if you need a flexible schedule. CSP put in their availability. Great pay for amount of work. Great atmosphere. Worked in a couple of locations and loved them both.
good,"H & R Block is a good place to start.  You only work seasonal but you get to learn a lot.  It was very educational for me.  I enjoyed working there a lot.  I still consider going back from time to time, but really need to learn more than what is being offered."
good,Couldn't achieve a full time position within the company.  Seasonal work was not enough pay vs. time.  Leadership roles good with flaws of no advancement within.
good,Great people who do a great job.  Definatly recommend getting your taxes done here.  The Tarentum location is by far the best location.  Check it out!
good,Just need to offer more money no matter what job your doing. We make people so happy we need more. At less $12.50 an hour. You have to have it in you to deal with all types of people. Some happy some mad

good,I enjoyed helping people get the correct deductions for their type of life style. I enjoyed the fast pace work atmosphere. Down fall is that the job to start is only seasonal.
good,H&R Block strives to put client satisfaction first.  Always making sure that we as Tax Professionals are always up to date on the latest tax laws and how they will affect our client base.  Also many clients come back year after year because of the quality of our work.
good,"Great place to work and grow. I think of my Benton IL H&R Block family, as just that, family, I left only because of relocated to California,  and miss them greatly."
good,"I have nothing but praise for H&R Block/Block Advisors.  The management is concerned for the well-being of its employees.  Hours are very flexible, and pay, while not lavish, is comparable to similar jobs in the area.  Co-workers are always willing to help out.  My only complaint is that this is only a seasonal job!"
good,Everybody is there to lend you a hand especially if your a beginner they will guide you to make sure your clients taxes are prepared correctly. This company is a great place to work at only if you wanna work seasonal.
good,Meeting with clients and helping them with their problems is an exciting career opportunity for anyone who wants to hone their problem solving skills.
good,"The job is not for everyone. There is a lot of unpaid training to be done on our own. And that is the down fall of working for them. The hours can be long from January to April, then you are done. This could be a great job for someone wanting to only work a few months."
good,I have never loved a job as much as this one. Completely different than H&R Block corporate offices. I enjoyed every single day of tax season even the long ones!
good,"H&R block is the best place to work. The Management staff made sure you were taking care of at all time.  Clients were sometimes upset because they had to pay in, however, that's just the way things go sometimes."
good,Will work around your houirs.  Willing to train and super leaders.I loved working here and would reccommend to anyone.  Also willing to teach you to prepare taxes.
good,"My experience working at H&R Block was a great one. It runs a little slow at first, but then speeds up so fast you hardly have time to think. The manager was extremely nice and I really enjoyed working there 4 years."
good,"I Had the best trainer, they worked with me and let me do things on my own. they let me chose my own hours. they have gret traing, you are always learning something new."

good,The class I took had an amazing instructor!!  The people in the office I worked out of were great!  If I ever had something I didn't understand they were right there to help.
good,If you are under the impression that a tax professional only does tax returns then you have it all wrong. We are expected to build our own business by marketing our own skills to businesses and potential clients. We are expected to also make sure that the office is clean which  means emptying trash and making sure that all desks are clutter free and ready for the next client. Leveling up with this company is what you need to do if you intend on making money at doing taxes.

I would suggest for anyone who need a seasonal job just to make vacation money. This company is impossible to move up. Doing a great job is not enough. You have to be the bosses favorite or you will go no where. Also other departments in the company do not communicate well.  "

My co-workers were all really nice, as they had been in the business for several years and were willing to help me learn the ropes.

good,H&R Block is a great place to work for a seasonal job.  Company offices are run very differently than Franchise offices.  As a CSL at HRB I learned to motivate tax pros to meet goals and expectations of the higher management while also trying to make sure the local office was run according to regulations.   The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients and helping them with tax issues.
good,"I met so many different exciting people while working with  H&R Block. The staff is amazing and very sweet. We take care of each client with personal needs in mind. A typical day of work requires me to schedule/cancel appointments. Call previous clients to inform them of the new promotions of the company.

I learned how to engage conversations with waiting clients and how to promote the company's products and services so they would know what H&R Block is offering this year before meeting with a Tax Professional. I answered phone calls, made appointment reminder calls, and took messages for Tax Professionals and at times for the manager as well. I would also help out the Marketing Director in passing out flyers to residences and businesses around the Stanton area and also worked at a second office when they needed someone to cover their front desk. This was a very enjoyable job that I undertook this past season. The only difficult times were at the peak tax season times where it would get a little more difficult in fitting in appointments last minute but I would communicate with the Tax Professionals personally to find solutions for clients needing to come in. I would not hesitate to return to work at H&R Block for the next season if I am given the chance to even as a part time because it proved me in being a great company."

During the slower time of the season I would clock in and make sure we had plenty of coffee or other ""needs"" in the break room. Our receptionist would usually beat me to the punch on that. I learned that everyone has a bad day and to not take clients personally. My husband was my manager/supervisor...enough said. No, really we worked well together. The only co-worker I had a problem with ended up getting fired. The hardest part of this job was telling people they owed money and then sitting their and listening to them cuss me for 30 plus minutes after my supervisor checked the return and told them it was correct. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with my sweet husband on a daily basis."

Co-workers had the same work ethic I have.  The most difficult part would be when a client was not happy with the results.  Positive results on a tax return are never a given.  I learned more about tax law each season.  Tax laws change so frequently that studying to keep up with the changes was critical.  The most enjoyable part of the job was telling a client they had a good refund.
good,A typical day at H&R Block would be making sure all the computers and server are up and ready to work.  If they aren't for whatever reason then that just means I'll be on the phone with tech support until tech and I resolve the issue so we can continue with business. Daily challenges consist of helping clients save the most on taxes and also following up with their refund status if already filed.

My co-workers were very supportive of me and it was very much a team environment.  The hardest part of the job was when clients would want to me to not report information to the IRS or some how prepare their return incorrectly so that they would get a bigger refund.  It was my integrity on the line and I would have to stand firm and say no.  I enjoyed when I was able to get people a bigger refund because of a deduction that I was aware of and that they weren't.

I enjoy helping people and try to make them feel at ease about getting their taxes done and recommend ways they can maximize their refund."
good,I was the receptionist of the H&R Block. I learned how to use a credit card machine. The management was awesome!

The hardest part of my job was when I was unable to resolve a client issue they were calling in about but, when I did all that I could for the client it made not only them but me feel better about the situation. The most enjoyable part of this job would be motivating my co workers and always pushing others around me toward greatness. The best that a person can be."
good,A typical work day for me is sitting at my desk waiting for clients to come into the office and need help doing their tax return. I've learned alot from the comany aswell from my coworkers. They've taught me how to do from simple returns to big returns which I still need a little practice on but I know with more study and hard work I can get to where I wanna be. My hardest part of my job is doing business returns but that's beacuase I'm still not educated in that area but my co workers are always able to willingly help me when I get stuck which I really appreciate because it helps me learn more.

good,"Great seasonal job.  Love the people and the opportunities I have."
good,"I worked at the Headquarters in Kansas City, great job but it was only seasonal. Would like to go back but no job security. Part - time job not enough money to pay my bill."
good,My work is fulfilling and satisfying.  I enjoy meeting new people and helping them to do their taxes.  My office staff is awesome and our management team is above the rest.
good,Unpredictable work environment in the sense that there were busy days especially in the two peak periods and then there were slow days with little client activity. Work was done at my own pace with little manager involvement which I liked. This was my second year coming back to the same office with all the same people which I loved.
good,"This was my first year as a tax preparer I was  lucky to have had older more experience to willing to help, train and provide guidance as needed. Other than the pay being a negative it cost me more to work then what i made.... but the experience, knowledge was extremely valuable to me. I due wonder why some tp stay for so long though  I see myself working for the company at least 3 years before making it on my own and trippling my income... at least  I learn I could possibly make $50,000 in one tax season."

Have coffee available for our clients."
good,"I liked working there but felt uncomfortable sometimes because of co-workers, I had to make calls to clients who did not want to come in over and over, they would get mad a lot. There was a lot of competition  for clients between the tax preparers. Overall though, I did like working there at the Cypress Center."
good,"I enjoy the work it's relaxing, however it's not enough to survive on. It is a good work experience for people who want to learn about taxes and understand them more."
good,"Start with opening the office and greeting the clients, let the pros know their client is there and then as they finish receiving their payment. Know that stress will be apart of the schedule since there are times when you have a client wanting to pay our, one waiting on the phone or those coming into the office for their appointment.  The day goes by pretty fast since you are busy most of the day.  When you have the opportunity you make calls to confirm the appointments that have been set. I learned that this is a job that helps me to keep my focus on the job at hand. The culture of the job is very different from working at the church.  The people are great to work with and yet can be at times challenging.   The hardest part of the job is the confusion that can come when all are coming at you. I enjoyed working with the pros and greeting the clients daily. Always a new face to see."

My co-workers are very nice and helpful, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry clients and system shut downs at times.

As a practicing Muslim, I was able to find the time and space to do my prayers while working. It's difficult to find both co-workers and a company to accommodate for those needs but H&R Block gets very High-Marks for their cultural/religious understanding/sensitivity."

My co workers are all people I enjoy being around and the atmosphere is one where I feel I’m treated with value and trust to do my job without being micromanaged. My supervisor also treats like I’m capable and is the first I’ve had who doesn’t treat me as a lesser employee but one who is part of a team and doesn’t feel the need to assert power or talk down to me. It’s been really enjoyable and I look forward to going to work. Such a breath of fresh air and I’m sad it’s only seasonal. Thank you for not only giving your clients the most personal and diligent tax preparation service but also treating your employees the way you do.

good,I loved working here. I was surrounded by very nice and understanding co workers. The office manager is an awesome person and I will be applying for the seasonal CSC position for next years tax season. The only thing I would is having the job full time and all year round.
good,The individuals I work for are easy to get along with. They are helpful to new employees.  They have several different locations and sometimes have their employees travel to different offices
good,It was very informational when it came to giving the rules and laws that IRS requires for individuals to have.  I knew corporate taxing and wanted to learn to do individual taxing.
good,Upon clocking in you check your appointment calender.If you have a customer you bring them in and begin to ask necessary questions to prepare their tax returns.While you are preparing their return you ask them numerous questions about their life in that last year and enter into the computer all their necessary information.Upon completion of their tax preparation you give them tax advice to help them be better prepared for future.When you are not with a client you are answer phone and taking appointment or calling previous year client to make their tax appointment for the year.You also may be working on schooling to gain new tax update knowledge.

good,I had a very good experienced working for H&R Block. it was fun learning how to work with other employee. i learned a lot about tax and how to lead the company to making more money and bring in new customers.
good,"I have worked for H R Block for many years and enjoy the work, however, I do not like the fact that the work is seasonal.  You can work in the off season with a much lower wage than when working during the tax season.  This compensation is very low and will not sustain most."
good,They did not fire me even if I didnt have the skills to be at the desk. And allowed me to do some filing. I really do not have much to say ab it but it was good overall.
good,"I worked 2018 Tax,Season! Loved it"

good,"Client interaction, very challenging at times. Tax Software very up to date and easy to use. Promotion opportunities yearly. Tax updates when occurring with IRS."
good,Great company for a self starter. Also a very good company to work for if you are looking to get into tax work. The flexible schedules allow you to maintain another full time job while working seasonal during tax time.
good,"In order to begin your career as a tax professional, you are required to take classes to about tax law.  These classes are ""free"" in the sense that there is no tuition, but you do have to pay $157 for materials in order to take the class.  Once you have successfully passed this class, you are offered a job as a tax professional making only $9 per hour.  You are not given any commission during your first year, and raises are almost unheard of. Having to take a class to get the job makes this skilled labor, and only making $9 an hour for skilled labor almost feel like an insult.  Employees at H&R Block all know that they are criminally underpaid for the amount of continuing education they have to complete in order to keep their jobs.  If H&R Block would appropriately compensate its employees, it would be the perfect place to work.  Unfortunately, it would be difficult to afford the pleasure of working for this company."

good,It was a seasonal job and I would like to return next tax season. Typical day during the tax season it 6 to 12 hours daily.  Management was wonderful.
good,My experience with them was great. I just didn't like having unobtainable goals from the outset in my first year being a tax prep. But other than that it was fun I worked my hours at my leisure and advertising was the best part because you weren't stuck in the office and you still got paid to go out and sell your skill sets to a variety of people.

And the most enjoyable was the family atmosphere that was generated from the employees to the bosses."
good,"H&R Block is an excellent seasonal company to work with if you have in interest in the financial field. A typical day would include opening and closing a shift (CIS system and deposits), provide great customer service on a continuous basis and overall provide administrative duties to the general manager and tax associates. Management was friendly and easy to get a long with. The most enjoyable part of the job was that is was constantly busy under pressure environment, trying to multi-task and provide excellent customer service to everyone while completely admin duties."
good,"At the beginning it was rough with certain management issues but afterwards was smooth sailing. The tasks are simple. Just answer the phones, book appointments, process transactions, prepare files for tax professionals, and open or close office as scheduled. The management team and staff are all excellent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers wanting a return done for free. The best part is the support of the rest of the office."
good,"On a typical day at work I would file state and federal tax returns for people and small businesses. Almost on a daily basis I would learn something new. There is always something to learn about taxes and the best way to learn is to just have someone help you when is situation occurs. Co-workers and management were always willing to help always friendly.

I am always a team player, everyone dealt with each other in a respectful manner. The hardest part of the job was explaining to clients that there tax return was rejected from the IRS and there was nothing we can do about it. The most enjoyable part is building a repore with the clients and getting to see them every year."
good,"I love Peace of Mind. Great service, people know there tax laws and great personality's."
good,"Set up office for clients to meet with tax preparers,I how to use my customer service skills to help as many clients feel comfortable about getting their taxes prepared,Management was very help at training to be the best,My coworkers were cooperative when needed, the hardest part of the day was if the clients all came in at once and there was not enough coverage,the most enjoyable part of the job was when I would hand them a refund verses having to pay taxes."
good,I only worked at this job during tax season and it was part time doing taxes
good,"When beginning a shift, a call sheet is given to you with 60 names, numbers and codes on it. The responsibility was to call each person and assist them based on the code next to their name. If the person couldn't be reached a letter would be sent or a fax to their place of employment. Inbound and outbound calls were made making it a very noisy workplace. Phones rang from the minute you come in and didn't stop even after we closed. The co-workers were friendly and always ready to give a helping hand. This job could easily be overwhelming."
good,"Arrived thirty minutes early to make sure your desk is ready for the day. If it was a slow day at the office and you did not have a lot of appointments then we would take turns on the clients we took back. To ensure that everyone had someone that day. At any office you have to go in with an open mind to learn, so that what I did and I gained knowledge about taxes everyday. The staff was very helpful and very enjoyable to be around. The most enjoyable part of this job was the different cliental.  "
good,"Set appointments, trouble shoot returns for clients when there was an issue with their return."

good,A great place to work with incredible support. I have learned a great deal on our tax system work on both the commercial and residential side. The management has been very supportive and knowledgeable and my co-workers have been most helpful. The most complicated part of the job is understanding our incredible complex tax code which I do not think nobody ever will. I really enjoy working and meeting people while preparing their taxes.
good,"A typical day a work is cleaning the office, filing, banking, reports, checking in clients, answering the phones, making appointments. I learn to deal with the public and I love it. The management could be lots better ut we do what we have to to keep our jobs. My co-workers are awesome, we all work together to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is picking up others slack. I feel like I do my managers job because she is never at work. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with my co-workers and helping out our clients."
good,"Preparing client's tax returns & qualifying client's for loans is our major objective. Our in depth knowledge of new tax laws really helps us to be more informative to our clients. Office Managers are always available for assistance if you're uncertain about particular subjects. Experienced co-workers with many years more of knowledge are also willing to lend a helping hand when needed. My most difficult situations arise when I'm trying to prepare a client's return that also has a Schedule C/Business expenses. I get a little confused sometimes in trying to include all of their expenses and where they are to be entered. Overall the tax office is pretty laid-back and a place you can come after your regular job and sort of take a deep breath and relax, while at the same time providing expert service to your clients."
good,"I loved my Job, I worked for 5 Tax Pro's, did their filing, appointments, we all worked together just fine. I worked 9 t0 5, 5 days a week, I can get along with anyone that walked in the door, young & old, I just hated when tax season was over, I wished i would of worked sooner in an office, bank, school, somewhere, I just liked working in an office."
good,This was a wonderful job. I loved the people that I worked with. My only reason for leaving is we moved to the Huntington area.
good,i would recommend anyone to work there it is such a fun place to work the only downfall is that it is a seasonal job
good,The over all experience was very fun. I learned that many will postpone doing their taxes until the last moment. The Management team worked incredibly well together. Co-works worked together like a well greased wheel. The hardest part of the working with H&R Block was calming the client when they owed money to the government and avoiding the multiple paper cuts when filing away the completed returns. The most enjoyable part of this experience is seeing all of my acquaintences and friends coming into have their taxes prepared.
good,"Great Management, Organized"

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  They were always very supportive of me and each other.  Any time I asked for help someone was available to help.  We were very much a family and everyone seemed to enjoy their job.  Unfortunately, the job was temporary and did not pay very well."
good,"H&R Block is a highly recommended Tax Preparation company as well as Financial"

good,"I loved working at H&R block. I was bondable and worked between many offices. It was like a family I truly enjoyed my fellow employees, supervisors and lead bosses. I was appreciated and recognised."
good,It's good place to receive knowledge if you are into accounting or if you need experience as a receptionist. For your first year it would be regular salary and as you advance you get commision. It's only seasonal within tax season at the beginning of January.
good,"You learning a lot and meet a lot people "

good,"Receptionists at Block are normally paid a little above minimum wages standards. Receptionist are give the chance to take the Income Tax Course after their first tax season, for a discounted price."
good,All Associates are very well trained and educated. There is also great flexability for work. The software that is created by H&R Block is extraordinary and extremely simple to use.
good,Overall the position requires the ability to prioritize projects. We are given projects and mile stones to complete. Along with the projects at hand we re-shift priority if any of the offices we service reach out about an issue that need immediate attention. It is a lot of learning the yearly routine of projects and re-adjusting to accommodate the seasonal needs of the offices.
good,"A typical day was composed of answering customers' questions and directing them based off of specific needs. As a taxpayer, I was responsible for providing accurate information on tax return for clients. The hardest part of being a taxpayer was learning the state laws.

good,"over saw the daily operation of the tax service, most of the people I worked with were awesome, had fun at this job, enjoyed both learning and teaching tax laws."
good,Overall happy with the job. It was a temp seasonal job. Fast paced and fun competent staff. I would have preferred a part time position instead of seasonal.
good,"While working at HR Block during the tax season as tech support, I must say that the workload is there if youre looking for a fast paced environment. Decent pay with excellent overtime options. Not a fan of mandatory OT"
good,"was seasonal, but good job for the time being. if you worked more hours you got the hang of things quicker, of course. but otherwise was a pretty simple job"

good,I absolutely loved working for the Zabaneh's. It is so very unfortunate that the Service Center will no longer exist after H&R Block corporate takes over. I will miss everything about this place and I am devastated to have to find something new.
good,"H & R Block is a great place to work for a seasonal job. You are properly educated and others in the office are very helpful. It is a job that starts out boring (January), gets rushed beyond belief (early February) stays okay for awhile and then in April you are bombarded with work. However, it is all manageable and you know what to expect. I've worked there for 30 years in many offices and have always found the atmosphere good. Best of all, you are educated every year -- learning new tax theory, new software programs, advancing your level."
good,I had fun time learning and working there. The team was very supportive and my experience there helped me with my people skills. I could always approach senior tax pros and their door was always open.
good,"Day filled with servicing clients with tax prep, or calling the client to get an appointment.  Enjoyable part is service to client. The hardest part of job is explaining to client why they owe."
good,I answered the phones to schedule appointment and answer questions. I kept the waiting clients occupied and comfortable while they waited to have their tax return completed
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with , this was my second season with this office and hope to return for a third, the work enviroment was always fun , and busy ."
good,"Love the challenge of different tax clients, other tax pros are very nice and concerned in our office. We work together and support each other. The software program we use is software friendly and easy to manipulate.  There is additional monitors for the clients to watch what we are doing and aids in their understanding of how taxes all go together.  The company offers many courses to keep their tax pros up to date and tax pros are required to complete 18 hours a year of tax law, ethics, and updates to retain their certifications."
good,"I tried to make my office a place my employees liked to come to everyday.  They worked 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.  It was a very busy office due to the extra soldiers training at the base that were heading to Desert Storm. Working along side myself were 4 tax preparers and 2 secretaries who helped keep my office running very smoothly. At the end of the tax season they all received a bonus and during the year I would purchase and deliver birthday gifts for my employees and family Christmas gifts. I did not need to supply insurance or other benefits because we were all military wives whose husbands were stationed at Fort Irwin. I treated my employees the way I wanted to be treated by an employer, with respect."
good,"It is a seasonal position that only runs for 4 months.  The flexibility of work hours is great if you have a full or part-time job.  There are two different peak seasons.  One at the end of January and the beginning of February.  The other is at the end of March through April 15th."
good,"The H&R Block office was always in perfect order, so finding whatever I needed to complete my task was never an issue. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job the most, since we try to maintain good hospitality."
good,"Great pale to work if you like to prepare tax returns for individuals and companies and like to learn and have on-going training."
good,I really enjoyed my first tax season at H&R Block. I took classes 6 hours a week for two months before starting work. My classes consisted of learning basic tax preparation. My manager/ franchise owner was very informative and patient. The workplace culture was usually very fun and casual. The hardest part was working with clients who had extreme misconceptions about their taxes and communicating the truth about their situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team of preparers and clients who had a great sense of humor. My only regret is that it isn't a full-time year-around position.
good,Great group of people to work for and with.  High pace work activity at times due to peaks in the season.  Over all. Loved working for H&R BLOCK. The only down sides to the job was that it was seasonal and had no benefits.  Wish i could
good,I love my Job I work with great lady's  learn new things every day great atmosphere manager is awesome I would recommend this place great Gob to work at !!
good,"This was one of the most enjoyable places to work.   I learned how important it is for the first impression of a company to be good.  I am an organize person, so managing the front desk was important and easy for me.  The hardest part of the job, was also the most challenging part.  That was to be able to keep a pleasant environment for clients while waiting to be helped.  Because of my personality, it was fun.  I was able to communicate with the clients in a way that they did not have to think about the time they had to wait."
good,"I had a great opportunity to enhance my knowledge in Tax preparation for the Individual Tax Return as well as the Corporate Tax Return. "
good,Nice to work because the team was very helpful. It offered so many free trainings that it ws worth working at a meagre salary of less then 10 Dollars per hour. It was easy for me to work due to proximity to my house and flexible timings.
good,"Good Place to work, cooperatives coworkers, continuously learning, you set your time to work but maybe you don't get a lot of hours during the week, but also depends of your manager and assigned office"
good,most positions are seasonal would love for taxes to be a year round job. great company to work for everyone is friendly. loved everything about working for H&R block
good,"Great job for someone who knows their way around an office. Answer phones, manage appointments and create tax pros schedules, paper file returns, greet clients, operate company data system, data entry, coworker communication, basic cleaning."
good,I am very proud to say that I work for H&R Block.  It is a wonderful company to work for and I have made some amazing friends.  I do wish it was a year round job and that there was some benefits.  The management for H&R Block is very good.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours during peak season when everyone is getting taxes done.  I love working with the public and all the interactions that I have with all my clients.
good,"Great group of Tax Pros and Clients to work with. Tax season is always very stressful for the Clients, so I always tried my best to make sure that they were scheduled with a Tax Pro that would be able to help them with their Tax Return.  "
good,"I enjoyed this job because it was very self paced, and the managers where there to help me anytime i needed it. i felt so comfortable. being a client connect caller was one of the easiest jobs ive ever had."
good,"It was only a Contract.  This form is not working.  My previous job was a Contract.  For clarification, my previous job was simply a short term contract."
good,"My typical day would start at 8am. I would make office coffee. Next I would check the calendar to see which tax professionals had open appointments for the day. If I thought we needed additional tax professionals, I would call someone in to help out for the day or just for a few hours, depending on the business needs.  Next I would do inventory and make sure that we had all of the office supplies that we would need for the remainder of the month. I would put in an order if needed. I would answer phone calls, clean the office, call clients to remind them of their upcoming appointments a couple days in advance. I would also replace emerald cards for clients who had lost theirs. I would do inventory of emerald cards. I would make new client appointments."
good,I really enjoy working with the people and clients at this company however this job is only seasonal. The hardest part of this job is not being able to take a break unless you don't have a client and tax season is a very busy time so breaks are hard to take.
good,It is a fast paced job. since it's seasonal you only work 4 months. I had a really great time working at H & R Block. I met really nice people and dealt with many different types of people from different ethnicity.
good,"listen to people problems, dealing with clients tax issue with irs. i learned everyone different.management was wonderful mr,james knew how to run the store."

good,"Good job for extra cash. Gets busy on peak days ,so it gets stressful. But, it feels good to help and advice a person on their taxes. Being able to help them receive the most amount on their return on the right way."
good,A typical day at work begins with mental preparation and reviewing your clients for that day.  The hardest part about this job is that you don't know the complexity of the return so sometimes you're alloted less time with a client and that makes your day stressful.  Every return is different but I love the challenge and love helping people.
good,"Good company for those who care about people (clients). H&R Block, and most of the firm's tax professionals are experts who care about our clients.  We have years of dedicated service to consumers."
good,"This job was so much fun as I got to greet clients who were coming in for tax returns, most of whom were expecting refunds and were happy customers.  Enjoyed performing secretarial duties."
good,"I enjoyed working at H&R Block. I was given great training and support from my manager. I was given my schedule in advance and was able to change what days I worked as long as my co-worker could switch with me.The days in the beginning of the tax season is very busy and hectic. Later in the season even without as many walk in clients, I still had plenty to do.The hardest part of the job was in the first few weeks of the season due to a large amount of walk in clients and the wait time they have to sit through.The people I worked with were all very nice and kind. They were always available to answer questions or help."
good,"Enjoy working and serving  with the general public, assisting in tax questions and preparation. I appreciate the learning that is required and provided through H&R Block.  It is a good job and pleasant environment."
good,Call center work environment with great management. I loved this job but they didn't pay very well and not very flexible on hours during peak. I had to leave this job in order to graduate college and get a better pay.
good,"Working with H&R Block is great, Its rusty to start but once your learning its a great place to work! I have worked there 3 years in counting its a great job for getting into the field of IT."
good,"I loved everyone i worked with, never had any issues. Only problem is i know the tax preps (no matter how long they have been with the company) do not get benefits and i strongly believe they should."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed the duties of District Manager.  I had 19 locations and 462 employees.  The work day was always interesting due to the wide scope of responsibilities.  I only left to pursue the purchase of franchise operations of this company.  I acquired 10 franchise offices which I sold when I. Moved to Alaska in 2008.
good,"The working environment is over all pretty good."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for H & R Block. The only downside is the fact that organization only offers part-time seasonal employment, and not full-time year-round employment. It was an awesome experience and opportunity!"
good,"Helping individuals with financial complexies is fun, and the environment invites growth and stability. Schedules can be challenge, however, communication is key."
good,"Time management used to ensure fast tax returns to clients and ensuring all work related items were stated in returns includes depreciation of assets from individual to business and complex returns."
good,I had always wanted to do taxes so I take the course and worked for one season. I would have worked this season but my other job was a conflict.  It was a interesting job and I would work there again.
good,I love my job and clients! I intend on continuing my employment at this office on a part-time basis. The owner of this office has been amazing to work with and for.
good,A great place to work. Ability to learn a lot on the job.  Customer service is #1. A great company that works well when all employees work as a team. A seasonal position for most employees.
good,"A interesting place with many personalities. The information that each one had was part of a whole. Dealing with the different clients and their tax life. We all worked together to do what needed done. The hardest part was making the calls to people on a list multiple times for the same thing. If I received a call every two days for the same thing, I would not like it. But it did not matter what I thought it was company policy. People would get mad a me when I was just doing what I was told to do. But I did enjoy working with the tax preparers, they were nice. They were very informative. We all got a long."
good,"Learning how to do higher level of preparing complicated taxes and consulting and showing how to reduced people taxes and to shows "
good,I liked working there because they work with your schedule.  Management was a little different this year due to cuts in the company. There was lots of unhappy employes.
good,"Basic Clerical Office work, not very challenging if you have common sense. unreasonable pricing for tax returns ( this is coming from an employee) some of management know nothing about taxes and CRA. great work life balance as the schedules are to your own choosing. Minimum wage . no real advancement as you'd have to pay from your own pocket for training."
good,H&R Block has been a great place to work as it offers a flexible work schedule and an opportunity to grow and advance through the Tax Professional levels at your own pace.
good,It's a great company to work for. However the pay is not to good and the commission isn't either. They do not give raises but will lover you pay rate.
good,"Can be busy with walk-in client and incoming calls, this is a great area to learn about the working of tax prep. also gives you the information you need for your own tax."
good,This job is great if you like to help people and can take critism and accusations by the individuals you help without making it personal. The staff works hard together to promote a family atmosphere. Management should be a little more present. Overall a great place to work.
good,Good training and exposure.They introduce different perks to motivate employees and appreciation is given when target is achieved.
good,"Plenty of opportunities for continued education, and for advancement within the company. Local office full of wonderful individuals."
good,I do love coming back every year just because i get along with my coworkers. Every years the government change plan have to adjust with it. meet all kind of people. I do love all my managers from Sudbury to Toronto.
good,A typical day was a million things happening at once.  People to serve and new accounts to open. It was fast paced and offered new challenges every day
good,"Typical day at work would consist of opening/closing the office."
good,Through hr block I of course learned to prepare a tax return by hand. It was a fast pace environment so no boring days. The hardest part was the schedule a and c forms for those owning homes and self employed.  The mos enjoyable part was the fat bonus at the end of the season for selling the additional products
good,Tax season can be stressful for everyone.  The client is anxiously awaiting their bottom line and tax professionals work hard to get the best possible outcomes.

good,"Answered multi line phones, check in clients, make appointments, take payments, kept coffee, kept clients happy while they had to wait for there tax pro.  Made copies and faxes. The clients having to wait for long periods of time and then not getting there money...I loved being the secretary and meeting new people."
good,Overall good place to work at. It can get competitive with coworkers for clients but nothing out of the line. Everybody is helpful and willing to give a hand if needed.
good,I have came very far with HR Block. The required training we receive every year helps me give the best advice to my clients. The nost enjoyable part of my job is being able to socialize with my clients and learn new tax laws every year.

good,"A Typical work day at H&R Block consist of answering phones , greeting clients , scheduling appointments , Taking payments , making sure the office is intact for work day ."
good,Open the office.  Went in and turned all the computers and did the daily updates.  Printed checks and made sure that there was enough money in the cash register.  Called the clients and let them know that their check was ready for pick up.  Call the other office and made sure they were all up to date.  Sometimes the software was on the fritz.  This was to me a very good environment.
good,"Preparing taxes is very interesting as each return is different. Unfortunately, the management at HRB is not as fun. The clients are the most interesting aspect as you can help them greatly in their financial life."
good,"This is a enjoyable job, I have fun meeting new people.  It is not all about who you know, its how well you work with others and what you make of it."
good,Open up the doors..check the schedue...start tax preparing and send by computer to IRS...finish reports and deposit money in the night dispostory..

good,"This is a great place to work, fun and invigorating."
good,Good place to learn more about income taxes.  I learned the ins and outs of managing a H&R Block office. The hardest part of the job was trying to explain pricing to clients.  The best part was helping people with the ins and outs of filing their taxes.
good,I liked working here because it was a very peaceful office to work in and also had and enjoyed this job due to interaction with customers.
good,"We always had new client coming in , they were the challenge because they were always asking questions , but then you had some that were okay with everything, i learned how to handle people more here then in my working at other places, management were always ready and willing to help when needed, my co-workers were great to work with, hardest part of the job was when you clients that insisted that they should have gotten more back on their return then what it showed them. i enjoyed the lunches, we were always trying to lunch there at the store and sometimes we would just enjoy and relax and talk about any thing just to get to know each other."

good,H&R block offers many new skills for you to learn! They are a faced paced business with the satisfaction of the customer in mind! It was a wonderful place to work. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demand during tax season. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you build with your clients as they return each year.

good,everyone get along and there is no drama with any coworker or management. the customers are very friendly and don't mine waiting to be served.
good,A 9-5 job but seasonal. Loved the other employees and the management. It was a lot like a little family. The hardest part was having to handle customers that were upset due to a small refund.
good,"I have tried for many years to get into the classes for H&R Block Tax Preparation. I am so glad I was able to do so this year. While there are slow times in the office even during tax season, there is never a lack of information to learn. The hardest part of the job has been feeling like I don't have all the information I could possibly have, this is only due to my lack of experience because the people I have had the pleasure of working with have been simply amazing. I love coming to the office each day."

I helped in anyway I could with customer service, either by phone, in person, or as I prepared their taxes.  The customer came in by preset appointments, or by walking into the office.  I worked in one of the busiest offices in our region.  I prepared over 200 tax returns for the 2012 tax year.  I would have to review tax documents, advise, ask personal and sensitive questions, and input the data accurately to prepare the customers tax return.  After review, informing, printing and assembling their return, I had to electronically file, or assemble the return to be physically mailed to the IRS. I would also help with overflow of clients, problem solving customer concerns, questions, or inform clients of tax laws, rules, and pertinent information regarding the IRS. I had to know tax laws and how they applied to the particular scenario of the client.  I was limited to personal taxes.  I went though 72 hours of IRS tax training and examination to be certified for personal taxes."
good,enjoy working there close to my house. good people work there.
good,"Managers are great, work day is chaotic and can be extremely long."
good,this was an okay job its nothing I didn't like about it. I liked my hours and I worked with a lot of different people I got to meet new people which was good and I got to use my good communication skills

good,Overall a great company to work for. Great work atmosphere. Team orientated

Management was great and the coworkers are wonderful it really is just the seasonal thing that gets me about the place."
good,"Excellent coworkers and business owners, good work environment. Wonderful opportunity to help people, learn new material and advance with a career."
good,Overall this was a good company to work for. The down side is that you are a seasonal employee and are required to take 2 months off each year. Also their first line of support is in Texas and is horrible. This often leaves us cleaning up their mess at the WHQ in Kansas City.
good,"Prepare tax returns for clients, meet and greet clients, handle client complaints and help tax professionals with tax questions and computer problems."

My supervisor and co-workers was very helpful in handle problems that I was not able to do.The hardest part was keeping up with all the new changes in the tax year but I enjoyed learning new things to inform my clients about.
good,I work 2 to 3 nights a week and some Sundays. Make some new contacts and develop a clientele to work with year to year preparing tax returns.
good,"I absolutely loved working for H & R Block during the tax season this year! I was a Client Service Professional throughout the season so I had the awesome experience of meeting and greeting new clients every day, matching them with the tax professional best suited for their needs and then I also took care of the daily in-house chores such as keeping the office neat, opening and closing the registers and computer systems, and taking phone calls and making appointments. I truly like working with people so this job was right for me, my weakness though was that not everyone was too pleased to have their taxes done. I didn't realize that people would be so upset when they left our office but I found comfort that I could sometimes cheer them up. The best part of H & R Block was my co-workers. I met some people that I'll never forget and they made each day something different and enjoyable!"
good,"Working with H&R Block over the last 5 years,have brought me not only a new level of tax knowledge, but a new extended family.

This is for tax preparers. Csr job is fast paced. Lots of telephone customer service and basic tax knowledge. I received excellent training for front desk.
good,"Love the Supervisor.  Old building it was ok but needs to be updated. Needs their own bathroom.  Clients are great. I do think that if you have experience you should have a higher starting wage, especially if you have to travel. Winter is horrible there to get to the building if its icy. Overall I loved working there but that building is too small and not updated for that business."
good,"I loved my job and the people that work there.  The pay is not so good, but oh well.  I felt like I was working with family.  My manager was great.  Will work there again next tax season as long as I have the same manager and the same tax staff return"

good,H&R provides yearly classroom work to upgrade skills and knowledge as it pertains to tax. They also offer other seminars to help further a persons knowledge in the tax world.

good,Did not feel appreciated for the time i work here very minimal raises work long days and evenings love all my clientele and the work of preparing taxes
good,"Good job environment, I learned a lot here. I love my coworkers, but the salary was very low and the schedules very late shifts. I gain experience and thank for that"

I enjoyed helping the walk in clients as well as my team of Tax Pro's.  Management honored my request for my specific hours.  I would definitely work here again.
good,"I enjoyed working here when H&R Block was owned privately and not by corporate. Corporate-owned H&R Block has more obstacle courses to go through. Prior to it becoming corporate-owned again, I enjoyed working here with everyone. I loved the fast-pace, learning new things, and the co-workers."
good,"H&R Block is the best store-front tax company.  They train a lot of new people every year but they demand continuing education and they have thousands of experienced preparers that do this seasonally all of their lives, even into retirement. This company is the expert at individual taxes. They take on issues that business specialists can't afford to specialize in. If the new kid makes a mistake the old fogey will fix it later in the summer."
good,The company is results oriented with aggressive but achievable targets. Good training that can be raised to the next level. Strong support for district and regional management.
good,"All in all good place to work .work with your schedules  ,room for growth . Good coworkers  . Ethical place all by. The book company office of course."

good,"One manager very versed and wonderful, one manager let's staff get away with unethical behavior. "

good,I found that working with the people at H & R Block was very informative I learned a lot while there. The best part of working there was meeting all of the people that became clients. I really enjoyed working with the owners of the Company.
good,"I very much enjoyed my time working for H&R Block. I worked in multiple offices in the city I lived in and made some great friends there. Every once in a while you would find a disgruntled customer, but for the most part they were very sweet."
good,Loved working at H&R Block. Was able to meet new people everyday. Working there was a good experience and I was able to learn a lot about filing taxes even though I was just a receptionist.
good,It's a.seasonal company with.the opportunity to learn different ways.to prepare federal taxes.for customers. Very good.training material is.provided..
good,"Good company to work for but I needed to move on to more money per hour and a full-time permanent job, not seasonal. I would work for them again if needed for more pay."
good,"Great environment, lovely employees, clean place , I would most definitely work there again due to tax season it was seasonal but met nice people there as a receptionist and learned so much."
good,Be honest and straightforward with clients yet be compassionate with mercy.  always do your best for the benefit of the client.  co workers are great resources of information and fun to be around.

good,Good flexible seasonal job. Good team to work with and training was provided. Ability to have flexible hours both during the week and on weekends. Good job to help other people and make money while doing that.

good,Best part of the job was to complete an individual tax return and have a client thank you for working so hard on their behalf and that they will be asking for you personally next year.
good,I worked with a great team of people. They were like family. I liked that I got to meet people and often saw the same people every year during tax season and was able to catch up on all that happened in the past year.

good,"H & R Block is a professional tax service that focuses on the specific needs of their clients. Each H & R Block employee brings a positive attitude, understanding mindset, and professional appearance to the office. The workplace is an open, friendly environment."
good,Everyone at HR Block are supportive and easy to work with. It's never an issue with them if you ask a question or get trained in something new. Great place to earn some extra cash!
good,Tax season was very intense because of the competitive nature of the tax industry as well as the limited time-frame as structured by the IRS.  Your annual profits were made during 5 months of the year and the rest of the year was spent preparing for the next tax season.
good,"H and R Block great place to work, prepared taxes for people. Great office to work at everyone was very help. Managers were extremely nice and schedule was very flexible."
good,"My coworkers at H & R Block are amazing about helping out when needed, as far as answering questions and showing me how to do things I am not sure of. They are very encouraging. A typical day at Block; make the coffee, run the reports for the day. Put money in the drawer and turn my computer on and pull up Appointment manager and DNA. Then I wait for my appointments to start coming in to get their taxes done. Management is almost non-existant, as the manager has two offices to take care of. I've learned how to do taxes and recognize different things that affect a client's refund, like what they claim on their W-4's.The workplace culture is very busy most days, but calm most of the time. The hardest part of the job is unhappy clients, but if I keep a calm demeanor, usually the client stays calm. The most enjoyable part of the job is, happy clients and their praise and my coworkers and their helpfulness."
good,"Productive place to work with a diverse languages and cultures, promotes team work. However sometimes tax professionals put their commission before people they lack a system to control that."

good,Very pleasant place to work non stressful. A nice diverse environment. Trading was very in-depth.Thats pretty much all I can think of would always go back very qwelcoming staff.

good,I have worked here for 8 tax seasons now and love it. I work with a great group of people and we all believe in team work. It is fast pace most of the time. A person that works with this company must be able to multi task and at the same time be able to treat each client as tho they are they only one in the room.
good,"The start of the season wasn't quite what I expected, but I was able to work my way through it by asking questions and learned a lot that way.  The rest of the season, I feel went well. I met with several clients who seemed happy with my work and returns were done accurately."
good,"The typical day at work is to start by prioritization the schedule of the day, by having to deal with clients forms first, and also handling the clients who come in and ask questions, so the hardest part is when there's a lot of people who come in and also have to deal with the clients face to face to do their taxes. The most enjoyable part is the satisfaction I get when I answered and helped the client correctly."
good,"Always treated well when going inside H&R Block, all the tax workers are very informative and know what they're doing. 10 out of 10 get my taxes done there every single year."
good,"It was a fast-paced learning environment with great people to work with. A typical day is mostly answering all the phone calls, making appointments, and getting walk-ins set up. the hardest part of the job was to deal with the customers you make never make happy. The most enjoyable part is defiantly the people to work with/for."
good,This is the job that gave me confidance to do more advanced jobs. I realized that I was good with numbers and could do a great job with out a college degree. My manager had great confidance in me and my job abilities.

good,"Typical day - Always something needing attention. Ever Changing. Learning something new,  then it may  change the next day.  Have to be organized and flexible. Fast paced, high energy, always changing, striving to be better and more efficient. Goal Oriented company.  Strong team support from my team members. Upper management tries to keep encouraging and communicating weekly."
good,Learn Quite a lot there although the hours were bad at times and Manager can get quite rude. Fun Experience for me overall. I loved going there each day and hoped to have more shifts and longer hours.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block involved answering the phone, setting appointments, servicing clients and making sure they were given the best customer service, doing side projects such as taking care of holds and CODs. In addition, handling all payments, opening and closing the register and the office,"

good,"Enjoyable seasonal job with year round employment. I work year round helping clients resolve issues. Not just tax problems, I deal with clients beyond just taxes.  It is a very rewarding job.  I receive hugs and thank you from so many clients. I have so many clients that end up crying of happiness. The client would walk in feeling that all hope is lost.  Then I would sit with them, listen to their problem and then make a plan of action, send them home with homework and a plan to resolve their thoughts of hopelessness problems.  I fee like I am Superman at times. I am able to help so many people."
good,I had the pleasure of working with all sorts of different ladies /gentlemen who never had a problem answering any questions i had or briefing stopping to assist clients if I was not available or unable to converse due to legality.
good,"With Block it is all about you and your client."
good,"I worked with a good office, but of course there's always one person that doesn't cooperate. But other than that one bad apple, I loved it. They are flexible with work scheduling. It can get a little crazy at times, but it's a tax company & people want their refunds."
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work. The atmosphere can get rushed and tense at time due to the fast pace of getting all the returns done, but it is also collaborative. We all help each other and learn from each other."
good,A typical day at work it's usually busy when its tax season and it gets slower. I have learned lots about taxes its fun to work with people and help them not feel stress when filing taxes. The hardest part of this job it that theirs clients that come in upset when they find out something was done wrong and need our help fixing the issue. I enjoy helping clients and Love seeing them leave the office satisfied and helped!

good,Tax professionals are extremely knowledgeable and genuinely happy to give clients information that would help them receive refunds from the government.
good,Taxes can be complicated and HRBlock lets you invest all the time needed to learn how to complete tax returns. The pay is based on your skill level and you can advance as quickly as you would like.
good,"The cultural of the staff was educational, no time for personal gossip. If you are not working with clients, you are either marketing to promote the business awareness and engage in conversation with potential customers that will be outside the store, that are perhaps a bit hesitate of entering the office. And the other task you would be doing daily is working on ways to improve your income tax skills online. There are so many programs to engage with to increase your knowledge and skills."
good,"Management was not acceptable as manager was not around much to answer questions."
good,"Seasonal employment.  Friendly staff, great learning experience.  Competitive customer base.  Flexible scheduling.  Enjoy helping people file their tax returns with minimal stress!"

good,"I enjoy working with coworkers, helping train new tax preparers. Getting to meet new clients and serving previous clients. Learning different schedule each year for rehire, and recently having a new office manager each year and getting to know them. H & R Block is a good job and it have security as far as having a job year round if your qualify or just seasonal. The hardest part is not getting enough hours outside of tax season."

good,"Loved it here, made appointments answered phones, was temporary job because it was just for tax season. Overall was a great experience.  Would recommend for someone just needing extra money."

good,I like working for H & R Block because they are a family friendly company which allows for flexible schedules.  It's great for parents who are looking for part time work.
good,"A typical day at H&R Block was meeting and greeting previous clients as well as new ones and preparing their tax returns. I learned how to manage appointments for all tax pros within the office and scheduling upbeat office meetings to pass on info from district offices, etc. Workplace culture was light and upbeat. Most enjoyable part of the job was educating clients to new tax laws and benefits to them."
good,"*Typical day - Prepare office for clients, great clients, make appointments, secure all information in compliance with the HIPPA Laws.  Always made sure office was clean for the clients.  "
good,Handled individual tax returns for many people. Manager was very helpful. Was only part time and seasonal. It worked with my other job which slowed in those months.
good,I worked as a tax preparer and in my first year I was able to make a commission (which rarely happens to first year preparers); I liked the seasonal work this job provided during the cold winter months.
good,"A typical day would start clocking in and immediately starting coffee for the lobby area. I would go over notes from the Manager while combing through appointments that should be arriving and possibly picking up the phone at the same time for those who wanted to make, change or cancel their appointment.  I then went into my Company E-mail and printed out the numbers for her and a copy to hang in break room. Once I accomplished any special requests the Manager had I would then continue to regular duties. Calling to confirm appointments and answering the phone, checking in clients for their appointments and such."
good,"Excellent training. Working on a seasonal job basis it is good specially when you have another job, it is a good way to get extra money working only afternoons and weekends."
good,"I found it enlightening place to work. I worked two different place daily. it was to be a part time job and seasonal. but ending up working over 40 hours a week, but it never made me fill tried. The hardest part of my job was some of the system that would go down or not enough supplies. I love working for HRBlock for the last two seasons. I did learn that working with verity of different people. is a hard at times. but i made it work. My mind and soul was to make it easy and comfortable to the Tax pro's and the clients."
good,Loved working here.  This is a Great place to work.  All of the tax preparers help one another out. I would work her full time if the position was not seasonal
good,i worked at h & r block for 4 years. through high school and when i was in cosmetology school. i was a receptionist there. i had a great experience working for them.
good,"The management and staff at H&R Block saw value in me. They put me right to work, and challenged me both years I worked for them. This year I took 80+ hours of classroom and online courses to become a Tax Pro. The job really tested my abilities and pushed me and caused me to grow and learn enormously."
good,Great place to work and learn. Dealing with customers and learning about both your clients and tax code/laws can be really rewarding. It's definitely something I would enjoy doing as a career but it's not for everyone. H&R Block is a client oriented business and clients depend on the employees to be up to date on the relevant tax laws. So an equal amount of the responsibility is to learn and relearn taxes.
good,Love preparing taxes for customer.  Loved the customer service part of the job.  Customers are always anxious when they come to have their taxes prepared.  I am always good at putting their mind at ease with my excellent customer service.
good,"Friendly but usually concerned or serious clientele, not a hard job with pay equal to the job requirements, very temporary. A good job for supplemental income and room for advancement from receptionist to tax professional with reasonable cost in classes and plenty of hands on help and experience. No benefits except to get your own taxes done knowing that it's done right."
good,"It was a very fast pace place to work,but i enjoyed it,especially meeting new people.very nice co-workers,there was always something to do,so your day went by fast."
good,"I've been working for H&R Block for two years now and I love it. I can not wait to go back next year. I learn something new every year by listening and hearing all of the tax pros interviews with their clients. Even just being a receptionist you learn so much from just listening. The most difficult thing about the job was upset clients about owing the IRS money but the good thing about working their was the learning experience and the atmosphere, I got along with everyone of my co-workers."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers and doing their taxes."
good,At company this is a great job for the first 4 months and then you are laid off. With my franchise I am working year round! Franchise is the way to go if you want an actual career. My boss is a local businessman whom cares about his employees.
good,Great Company to work for. At the time I worked for the company they used outside employment agencies but now do all of their own hirings.  This is good since you now have the company benefits to count on.  The only downside to working for a company like Block is that it is really heavy on seasonal work.
good,"Our H&R Block franchise has been a wonderful opportunity for me - I started four years ago and through great effort and determination on my part I've become a senior tax preparer making about $30k in four months. However, that four months I work an average of 70 hours per week with few opportunities for breaks. "
good,H&R was the first job I had in the big city and they quickly included me in their high knit group. The office was a very inviting place and we worked very well together.

good,"Best training to assist the new tax associates to success! Always hiring and training new personnel. Hours during the tax peek are grueling, but rewarding and interesting!"
good,"Working for H&R Block was an educational experience. I was not familiar with ""taxes"" other than my personal experience. The work place was pleasant although at times very hectic and busy. The Tax Professionals were knowledgeable and very helpful. Many had clients they had represented for years and had developed relationships with over the years. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the clients, assisting them in person and on the phone and knowing I was helping them during a sometimes stressful process."
good,"I love this job, plan to take the course to become a tax preparer. meet so many people. Everyone is so pleasant. The hardest part of this will be when the end."
good,"Work for this company for 9 year, keep your return accurate by federal and state laws and regulations, excellent customer service skill and you keep your job every season,  really easy work for this company."
good,I loved working here. All my co workers were friendly and easy to work with. I got more responsibilities as the owner would see I was capable of the duties.
good,"When I worked for H&R Block I assisted a franchisee to run his new business.  He told me to pass an exam to prepare other people's tax returns.  After I passed the exam I prepared income tax returns for individuals.  Other responsibilities included scheduling tax appointments and operating the cash register.  My circumstance involved working with a manager who had a year round bookkeeping office as well as a seasonal income tax preparation service.  "
good,"Management is great, training required to do the best job possible is of the highest importance. Knowing that you are qualified to the job asked of you without reservations is wonderful."
good,"This is my 10th tax season with HR Block and I keep coming back (even when friends ask why I still work there). HR Block gave me a paycheck when no one else would. You don't make much money in the first few years, but it's a good back up plan. Whatever direction my career is in or wherever I live, at least I know I can always get a paycheck from HR Block."
good,H & R Block allows room for advancement for all employees. Its a great place to help clients achieve their financial goals.
good,"A typical day a work starts off by me greeting clients in a personalized, friendly, and inviting manner. And then I display strong customer service skills needed to ensure an outstanding end-to-end client experience. I also, showed strong organizational and time-management skills. What I have learned working for this company is, people don't play with their money. But also learned how to process taxes, correct any errors that might occur on a tax return and process refund checks. The management there was great. They made sure I had the knowledge that I need working for the company. The hardest part of my job was dealing with protestor coming into the building and harassing the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the day to day operation of how the company works."
good,Love what i do. Its my passion. The pay isn't all that but i don't mind. Meet various characters which makes the job interesting. Clients are great and thankful.
good,"A typical day working at H & R Block was to prepare the most professional tax return for all clients. Answer all questions over the phone accordingly. Assisting my piers with tax situations. Various other office duties."
good,My role in the company was to assist client during the process of their tax returns. Federal laws change daily and it was a part of my job to keep up to date with them. I worked close with other employees because it was a small office and we helped one another as needed to provide great service to our clients. The most enjoyable part was seeing the client happy at the end of the interview process.
good,"This job was again, one of my most favourite jobs. Flexible hours, everyone was super nice. Manager was great. Training available anytime you needed. Pay was a little less but overall a fun place to work."
good,Great company to work for as well as oppurtunity to move in the company good people great benifits rewards company is like family .Fit your schedule and make your own hours
good,"though only once a year, and you have to pay for the classes, its a great opportunity to learn. managements first year, was not a great fit though they tried there hardest. i myself fit better as a receptionist then i thought so i learned how to make a difficult thing easier for the customers."
good,"A typical day would involved with answering calls and questions, set appointments for clients to come into the office, along with preparing taxes to be sent into the IRS. The knowledge that is needed to complete taxes since it is law so keeping up with tax law and mathematical skills. Management made the team feel like equals. The team that worked with me was very pleasant and always helpful. One difficult part of my job was not being able to get all clients returns from the IRS. What was the overall enjoyable part was telling clients that they would be getting much more back than they had expected."
good,"Peak tax season is hectic and stressful, but the early season is slow. Co-workers are awesome because everyone is there because they want to be and enjoy the work that they are doing. I learned to prepare my own taxes which was the reason I took the course in the beginning."
good,Great to come in and greet customers and assist them to meet with the Tax Professional. Co-workers were great to work with. I learned from management are different rules of filing taxes.
good,Customer satisfaction utmost importance. Professional tax preparation and advice to clients.  Positive work environment and great staff.
good,H&R Block is a great company to work for because it allows you to grow in many levels of business. You meet people and are able to build a business for yourself and are able to see the reward.
good,"Took phone calls and set up appointment for clients to see a tax expert."
good,"A typical day at work is every client need to do tax return."
good,It is a very fast paced job that is never the same any given day.  It challenges me as an individual and I look forward to meeting that challenge daily.  I have an excellent group of employees that work with me.
good,"Fast paced, fun enviorment to work in. Lots to learn, at times it was slow but I was taught different things. I enjoyed my experiance there."
good,"it is a wonderful place to work, the personnel is great but its only seasonal. overall  for a part time on the tax season its good."
good,"I enjoyed working and meeting new people.  I have learned how every body lives go and without knowing them you hear them and give them advise.  You get to know lots of different circlestances of how people work, their business and how they have a lot going on in their lives and tell them how they can get a bigger refund or pay less."
good,"I love working for this company, they treat me well. The only problem is that its a seasonal job with a very short season, there is little room to move up the ladder and earn more money."
good,"I learned alot here. I learned alot about the law and the way you are supposed to do the returns. My coworkers (senior) were very helpful. The manager, I believe could have done a better job. If I were manager I would not be racist towards any of my employees. The hardest part of the job is not being able to do anything for a client that needs my help. I enjoy meeting the new clients, and helping them with their needs. I most of all enjoy interpreting."
good,Enjoy working for  H&R Block.  I plan to take classes to become a Tax Professional. It is a professional place to work. The Manager was always friendly and informative.
good,My experience in dealing with face to face client interaction and their tax issues requires patience and understanding so that you are able to explain the tax law and code to the client as it pertains to their specific situation. I interact with my co-workers extremely well and I am a team player.
good,"I ended up managing the kiosk that I am working at this year."
good,"I love working at H&R Block! It has been such a fantastic experience and I am so glad I have the opportunity to be apart of something a great as this company. The management is wonderful, the Taxpros are all great and I am happy to represent a well known, reputable company."
good,A typical day is always exciting. Learning different aspects of tax law. Great management team. Great co-workers. Hardest part of the job is satisfying an already disgruntled customer. Most enjoyable is being able to make sure my clients are very well taken care of.
good,The daily look may look different based on the amount of customers we have that day. Every part of the job went rather smoothly. Of course I made all appointments greeted all customers and placed them with the correct Tax Pro because they are at different levels. I also did marketing for our location which meant that I went to other businesses and met their employees  As well as the business owners and told them about our business and any specials that we were doing inside our business. I also made connect calls which is where you call clients from previous years and try to get them to schedule an appointment for this year.
good,I enjoy working here. Working with other tax professionals has its rewards. I enjoy helping people and their tax situation.
good,"A typical day of work consists of checking in clients, answering multiple phone calls, scheduling appointments, accepting payments for tax returns, and contacting previous year clients in an attempt to win them back this tax season. As it became less busy, I would use that time to file tax documents in alphabetical order, confirm appointments, or enter submission numbers on tax returns. Management kept me busy with new tasks to complete, coworkers were usually always busy with clients filing tax returns in their cubicles. There was not necessarily any ""hard part"" of this job, but like any retail company, customer satisfaction is essential, and this I think will always be an enjoyable challenge. The best part of working with block is keeping busy most of the time, and being able to accommodate clients, since I am the first impression as a recepcionist."
good,"I love working for H & R Block, dealing with the clients is the best part, some of my clients I have done their taxes for over 20 years, love getting caught up every year."
good,1 year of HRB Tech is far greater than the knowledge we saw coming from Devry or ITT.  Was an overall great experience to see how much more one can know from hands on experience over 2 - 3 years technical degree.
good,"This is a great company to work for, but there is no job security. This company likes to overload people with work and then terminate them when they can't keep up."
good,"Greet clients as they come in. Collect data. Direct them to the appropriate Tax Professional. Set appointments, Run reports for previous clients, call for appointments. General clerical."
good,"Supplying and Maintaining office supplies to start the day, Greeting clients, Scheduling appointments. Making outbound calls to generating new clients. along with processing payment transactions"
good,It is a company that excels in providing training and support to the employees in the successful performance of their duties and responsibilities. There is wide exposure to different types of clients and allows one to improve customer service in the solution of their problems or simply provide information that they need. There is constant evaluation of performance that motivates employees to continuously work on improving their skills and knowledge.
good,"I enjoy working for H & R Block.,although it can be very stressful at times but every client is a challenge which makes it worth while"
good,"I would make courtesy calls, marketing calls, set appointments, greet the guest. I learned certain tax laws and my manager was easy going and so were my co-workers."
good,Very technical position that has a techie culture.  Long hours solving issues. Seasonal position - work 10 months out of the year and required to take off 8 weeks each season.
good,I learned the complex situations of completing a correct tax return. Management in my office is great and a great motivator to all of us in the office. Co-workers are fun to work with and never had any problems with them. The hardest part of the job is getting out on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching our customers the best tax practices they could do throughout to year to avoid paying the IS or to avoid paying so much money to the IRS.
good,Tax preparation.  Direct client interaction.  Great atmosphere to work in.  Very diverse in tax situations with clients
good,"Management was very laid back. Never a Micro manager. We handle each task with care , efficiency and effectiveness. The drive for me was to far and I was ready for career advancement."
good,"H&R Block is a challenging and fun place to work. No day is like another and the agility to be proactive and reactive to the constantly changing and compressed industry keeps you on your toes and excited to wake up each day."
good,"Long and short hours"
good,Working for H&R Block helped me learn how to manage my time wisely and multitask. How to work and adjust to different needs of co-workers.
good,The staff are fun and easy going. The work environment although stressful it is a great experience for a fast paced setting.
good,"This is seasonal employment. In Mass. we do get a small, 20 week unemployment benefit, after tax season. Basically 3 1/2 months on, 8 1/2 months off."
good,Working for H&R Block is a great place to work for the only i didnt like is that it was a short seasonal time and it would of been better to work all season long but either way it was a very good time working for the company.
good,"Greeting customers in person or on the phone . Scheduling and confirming appointments .Handled  and filed confidential documents. maintained office organization and resources with team members. Handled cash , checks and credit card transactions. Great company to work for."
good,A typical day at H & R Block is usually fast paced. During January and February we had a lot of clients and there wasn't time to take a break. However things slowed down during March and we had clients dropping off tax information and come back at a later time to sign. My co-workers were very enjoyable. The work environment was laid back. If there was a question I had or something I didn't have experience with my co-workers were always happy to help me. The hardest part of my job was explaining to clients the IRS rules about certain tax credits and dependency requirements. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and gaining new experiences and knowledge. Most people hate to deal with taxes so their always willing to let somebody with the correct knowledge help them.
good,"I work the night shift 6 nights a week and am quite happy doing so.  I usually come into the office and immediately verify the cash register to ensure everything is correct and balanced.  I then check for any ""conflicts"" in the schedule for the next week while answering multiple phone lines and greeting clients as well as taking the payment at the end of their visit.  I file papers in alphabetical order and help the tax professionals in any way I can.  I have learned so much about the tax preparation process and tax laws.  This was my first corporate job and although it took some getting used to learning the process of having such a large company to understand I learned quickly and quite enjoy it.  My co-workers are all amazing, hard-working people and make it easy for me to enjoy my time there.  It is extremely hard saying goodbye to not only my co-workers but also the clients.  I have gotten to know many of the clients over the years and I take pride on providing them with the best customer service and experience that H&R Block has to offer."
good,Working as a Tax Professional was very interesting.  I found it most rewarding by having each client having minimum liability and the best refund due.
good,"My day would consist of making and receiving phone calls to/from clients whose taxes needed to be prepared. I would also check clients in as they arrived for their appointment, make coffee, take out trash, and close out the cash register at the end of the day. There is not one thing that is hard about working for H & R Block. Great staff!!"
good,"My co-workers have taught me a lot more about taxes and how to assist clients who may have difficult tax questions, while at the tax desk. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a client who has a balance due rather than a refund on their tax return."
good,I am able to learn and advance as much as I push myself to. The company is great on doing what is best for the client. As a new tax associate you can work with a mentor to quickly learn how to do a client interview and then try it on your own with the mentor helping along the way.
good,"Keep office flowing smoothly, checking in clients, scheduling, filing, answering phones, and greeting clients making them feel welcomed. I realized that I can learn a new computer program in a very short period of time. And that when you stay calm with people and treat them like you wanted to be treated everything is so much better. The hardest part of the job is when clients call concerning their taxes which the government has taken because they owed child support, or fines  and there is absolutely nothing we can do for them, they get angry at you, even though it's not our fault. I have been saying ""I''m sorry I don't know what to say to make it better"". That's hard to deal with emotionally. The most enjoyable part of the job is when people who need money really bad, like when they are very poor, and they get back a lot, I am really happy too. It almost feels like I'm getting the money back myself. Good feeling."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty laid back besides peek but even then its not that bad, most customers and co-workers are friendly"
good,"Great seasonal company to work with, the company offers online training refreshers as well as on the job training for beginners. The software is user friendly and just about any one can complete their own taxes"
good,"Provide administrative support to tax preparers, Greet, entertain, and thank customers in waiting area. Process customers’ payment. "
good,"Preparation of income tax returns was the main daily activity in the company's software. Daily cash deposits. Real nice office staff, very helpful and knowledgeable."
good,"Call center was fun and exciting. No cold calling, client incoming calls. Seasonal work, but well worth it. Must be on time and know the provided script to tell clients."
good,Good atmosphear.  Associates are pllesent to work with. Flexable hours
good,"Good for a part-time, seasonal job, this is a great place to work (even if you don't prepare taxes). It's great for people starting a career. When they discuss team building, they mean it! Management in my district is excellent. The people are wonderful and everyone helps everyone else. They are excellent about ensuring good work/life balance and scheduling flexibility is great. They are proactive about continuing education and ensuring all employees--not just tax prepares-- have lots of opportunities to take online courses to expand their skills--for no charge. I've picked up many new and valuable skills here. It's a great place to develop ""people skills"". The benefits for full-time employees are fantastic."
good,"Typical day at work was full of fun and great customers. Great co-workers and managers. Very understanding, giving, loving, warm hearted people. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had holiday parties."
good,"the management is great and always on her toes"
good,"Set up paperwork for the day"
good,Me and my office were like family.  I loved helping people with their taxes.  I would prepare taxes and educate clients on tax information.
good,Doing taxes for my clients is getting to know them and helping them get the best refund they deserve. I have the best co-workers who is always willing to help me any tax related questions I have. the hardest part of my job is doing is telling a client that they owe money to the IRS.
good,"To be a tax office it was very relaxed and laid back atmosphere. Everyone knew what responsibilities they held and you could go to anyone and ask questions. I was the first and last face people saw when they walked in the door. It could really make or break the experience especially if the tax meeting didn't go well. I always made sure to give excellent customer service and tried to get them to leave with a smile or some degree of satisfaction. I answered phones, filed returns, took payment, set tax preparers schedules for the week, sent the electronic files and calculated/delivered the nightly deposit. That year our individual store won every competition between the stores in the district. I spent a lot of time with my manager mulling over and bringing to life ideas to promote and draw attention to the store. I would say this was a fun short term job. My schedule was flexible which was great with my college schedule."
good,I would open the store and turn computers on then wait for my first client. I would process the clients tax return while answering the phone if needed. Then I would go print checks and file paperwork. I worked with retirees that gave me a lot of wisdom. The hardest part was when someone came in with not a typical tax return but we were trained for that and would get it done. The most enjoyable part of my day was opening the store getting ready for the day.
good,challenging and fun. We get to meet people everyday and help them with their tax questions.
good,This job has a good and positive environment place to work. The co-workers are really responsible and helpful people.
good,Very fast paced but a great place to work if you like a fast friendly work environment!
good,I love working here..Great place to learn and meet people.There is always room for advancement. Courses to take every year.
good,I love interacting with the clients from all over the world who come into H & R Block.  A typical day at H & R Block is doing tax returns and working on audit letters for clients in the summertime and during the tax season working on their returns.  I have learned a great deal from the management staff at H & R Block which helped me to pursue my education from the University of Phoenix.  I have a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Business and Management as a result for working with H & R Block. The employees at H & R block are wonderful to work with.  They all have different service levels of expertise within an office setting.  If you have questions you know you can ask them to another associate or they will help you to research the question you are having a difficult time trying to find out.  The hardest part of the day is when you have to tell a client who didn't make very much money that year and you have to tell them they owe the IRS when they have young children who depend of them.
good,"Nice owner/manager.  The job was good, however, it was just seasonal."
good,"My typical day at work was opening the office and making sure that there is paper in all printers and fax machines.  I would count the money to start the register for the day.  I then would go over the calendar and see what the day was going to be like.  I started with a pot a fresh coffee to serve the clients and staff.  Made sure all signs were operational and pathway to the door was clear.  During the course of the day I answered over 100 calls on a busy day, took messages, checked in clients, served coffee, ran errands.  The hardest part of my job is peak season from January to late February.  I enjoy interacting with clients over the phone and in person.  At the end of the day I counted all monies and charge card receipts, printed a journal and waited for my coworkers to lock up for the night together."
good,"I loved it there I met all kinds of new people and loved it. I started there in feb and ended in april , hoping to go back if they need me , I love working receptionist."
good,"Great Place to work, Mangers are always willing to help you if you  don't understand something."
good,"I have enjoyed working as a Tax Professional for the last 3 tax seasons. It has given the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds, and help with their finances matters. My biggest satisfaction is to put my clients mind at ease, turn their frown into smiles because they know I am giving them my best advice. Clients have high expectation from H&R Block, and I am proud to work in a company that give their employees all necessary tools to success and believe in our own products to help our clients. I enjoy helping people choose the right steps to a better financial life."
good,Very good training programs and advancement opportunities.  Very flexible schedule.
good,Working with the brokers in making sure that the customers have the right iras and making sure that when they are deceased their funds go to the correct family members
good,"Opening office procedures, greeting clients, check in and appointment scheduling, answering phones, stock office supplies, bookkeeping, and closing office procedures. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. They are also easy to get along with. I enjoy everything about the job!"
good,"I loved working for H&R Block. The staff was great and out going. If it wasn't for the moving we had to do because of hurricane Rita, I would still be there."
good,"I love doing taxes and making people feel better and less stressed."
good,Call prior clients and market to new ones. Prepare tax returns and review competitors.
good,"A typical day at work involved me working with all co-workers helping them with their apt. schedules, then answering the phone and talking to customers and wetting up apt."
good,That was my favorite job working in customer service representive  I just wish it was full time
good,great team work great co-workers great boss loved everything about that job so sad it was only seasonal
good,Greet customers get them back to get their taxes completed.
good,"I enjoyed my time @ H & R Block as a payroll supervisor.  I was responsible for maintenance and processing of time & attendance data for over 40,000 employees nationwide.  Coordinated processing of time & attendance data for payroll processing schedules."
good,"This is a great place to work. Keep really busy running around, greeting customers, filing, there is always something to do. I love to keep busy. Co-workers are so nice."
good,"As a receptionist for H&R Block, I was responsible for answering phones, accepting payments, making appointments and greeting customers.  The fast paced environment was a rush for me.  I loved it.  The hardest part is trying to please upset customers that have waited a long time.  Making sure to engage was very important."
good,I learned how to deal with various types of people and how to tactfully respond to problems as they occurred in a timely manner.
good,"A typical day would be answering the phones, e-mailing,faxing and utilizing the copier.Ordering supplies, Creating databases and maintaining files. The hardest part of the job would be unable to reach maintence to fix the repairs needed in the office. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfied customers that leave the office at the end of the day."
good,"Able to help customers with filing taxes, and ensuring the best refund possible. Management was a bit lazy when it came to customer service. Co workers were very helpful with me being a first time preparer. There were no hard parts of the job. Most enjoyable was learning a different trade."
good,"I really  enjoyed this position, I just could not catch on how to troubleshoot the issues"
good,"I would prepare tax returns for mainly individuals or couples.  I met many different types of people and learned alot about taxes along the way.  The hardest part is if I had not learned something and I felt I had let the client down, although I had a many co workers who were willing to jump in and help through those time."
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at H&R Block."
good,"The workload is heavy, due to seasonal work. The atmosphere is usually tense, due to screaming children. Management staff are there for you at all times, and co workers are more than happy to help you too, building your ladder of success. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a team, but responsible for your own work. It's a rewarding position to work for H&R Block."
good,It is good company but most the time managers are not educated and  its very obvious when they take decision.
good,"Most days its about greeting customers, making courtesy reminder phone calls for appointments, making sure we match clients with the right tax pro. Sometimes there are some packages that need to be delivered and received. Other times, ordering office supplies, sending and receiving faxes and the like. What I learned working there is time management, especially around April because it can get pretty hectic. The hardest part of the job is upset clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding out that you can create a calm and efficient office with your work."
good,Gave me an excellent starting point for entering the work force after being a full time home maker.
good,Excellent company.  Management constantly encourages us to learn and to share with our coworkers.  Client relations are always the hardest part of any job.  I am challenged often by difficult people but enjoy the opportunity to help them.
good,"I enjoyed the challenge of this company. I always add to my knowledge here. I like the atmosphere, the work and the people I work with, as well as the Office Manager and District Manager.When a stumper came up, there are always more seasoned people to call or ask questions to solve a dilemma. The hardest part of the job is when clients don't like the bottom line. The satisfied clients are the most enjoyable part of this job.I learned that there is always an answer to any question-you have to know what questions to ask and where to find the answers."
good,I loved this job as it gave me an opportunity to meet people from all walks of life as well as gain a strong knowledge of taxes in both individual returns as well as business returns. 
good,really nice people really nice area People always had a smile and i like being on Capitol Hill
good,my only problem was it was a seasonal position .would I work for the company again yes
good,An enjoyable place to work with friendly and supportive coworkers and management. I enjoyed assisting clients with their taxes. I did not enjoy the often vague and difficult to understand tax laws.
good,"I start classes in Sept/Oct for the upcoming year and work Jan - April."
good,"great people to work with, interisting clients. assist people with understanding tax laws. "
good,My duty was to process tax returns for clients. I learned about clients lives and worked to solve any problems they had and answer questions as needed.
good,Had a great time working for H&R Block! They truly care about their employees.
good,"I always felt comfortable asking for help and voicing what I have learned to someone else needing info. There are glitches in the computer program that sometimes presented a challenge, but someone was always willing to provide their expertise. I learned that although customers can sometimes have a bad experience (they owe $$$)--there is always a tax tip that we as tax pros can provide to end their experience on a positive note and that the training I was given prepared me quite well to do an exceptional job and that doing taxes in the right environment can be fun!! I really enjoyed my leader and my co-workers."

good,Excellent knowledge and training. Tax specialists.
good,"Checking all appointments, for all tax preparers in the office, and confirming appointment with client making sure the office ran in a steady pace. Learned people need to know whats available for them. My manager was such a sweet person, she treated everyone in the office with such respect, making sure everyone knew their job and responsibilities, and that she was there for everyone. The hardest part was leaving at the end of the tax season. I really enjoyed helping the client understand their taxes, because when they understand the preparer gets each client processed quicker."
good,Clients want someone that can provide them with an accurate return that will give them the maximum benefits of tax reductions. This was our main focus.
good,"Loved the fast pace during peak. Bonuses were great. Some clients were unhappy with their refunds. However, with the proper explanation, they were less irritable."
good,"Very busy, and crazy cause people blames us for them not getting thier return either on time or at all. But over all a great place to work for the 6 mo out the year."
good,A business that provides income tax services to the general public. Duties included
good,"My days working there was fun and learning something new all the time. I've learned a lot of there software. My manager is a fun and exciting person to work around always keep a smile on his face. the coworkers that worked with they was more rude and have attitudes when it comes to preparing taxes. The hardest part of the job was my first day operating the new software, but I've pulled through it. Every day I've work was a enjoyable day."
good,"Was a nice job, loved what I did. Prepared tax returns for clients gave tax advice. Love working with people."
good,Had a wonderful time with this company. Learned alot that can follow me through life. Great management .
good,Build your volume by the amount of tax returns you do and you must market yourself to maintain and/or build your clientele. Very good training to make sure taxpro's stay up on the new laws and are aware on the new IRS guidelines.
good,"A typical day at work was fun. Its was a very large environment. I really learned a lot while working for this company. The management, and the co-workers was wonder i meet a lot of new people. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the anger customers that called in when they did'nt get they tax return. The most enjoyable part of the job was i got to meet alot of people and i enjoyed the company overall ."
good,"This job seemed like a family. Everyone interacting with one another and knew their position and played their role. A typical day at the office would be meeting & greeting customer, asking probing question to see the reason of their visit, scheduling appointment, data entry, switchboard operator. This was the best job ever minus the compensation!"
good,"This job taught me how to conduct myself in an office setting. It was a job that operated only during the tax season so job security was low. I did, however, learn much about work ethic and interaction with clients and coworkers at this job. I also learned how to correct errors in timekeeping and how to present myself professionally with those in authority."
good,A typical day at H&R Block is ensuring that the office is well stocked and neat. Receiving and making calls to confirm and schedule appointments for clients. Also managing that the front office is controlled and that all customers have been taken care of as well as taking payments from clients. I have learned more information about taxes while working for the company. Management for the company is always experienced tax professionals that have worked for the H&R Block for years and have great organizational skills. My co workers have always been very supportive and helpful during the busy part of the season and I enjoy working with them every year. The hardest part of the job is when the waiting room is filled with clients and there are not many tax professionals available. the most enjoyable part is talking with all the clients that come in every year.
good,Enjoy going to work everyday as every day brings new challenges. Everyone helps each other to get the job done in a timely manner. Customer first is the main objective as well as retaining the customer for future referrals and business.
good,Employees enjoy what they do.
good,"Working for H & R Block was educating, you have opportunities to grow and return yearly. Classes to better educate you on new things for the following tax season. Working with others and alot of computer work, really a great job."
good,Company provided good instructions and adequate orientation.
good,"When working my hours would fluctuate based on anticipated client appointments. When arriving I signed into the secure system, checked the client appointments for that day, prepared client paperwork for professional staff. Made coffee in preparation for first client appointment. Welcome the client when entering door, check them in on the system, ask if they desire coffee or water and inform professional their appointment has arrived."
good,"Working at H&R Block my co-workers and supervisors were fun, knowledgable, and experts at what they do. The hours were good and the pay was decent. When its really busy your on your feet and doing alot of multi-tasking. I enjoyed this job the most compared to my other jobs."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is finding clients as many tax breaks as possible to give them the largest tax refund they are entitled to. The hardest part of the job is coordinating clients appointments when the office is short handed and the clients have to wait for long periods of time. Every year H & R Block provides its employees with classes that update the tax laws and provide us with the most up to date information as it becomes available from the IRS.
good,"nice place to work, friendly co workers, positive atmosphere, flexible schedule"
good,"My typical day was assisting the tax pros with anything they may need, answering the telphone, answer questions and checking clients in and out of the office. The hardest part is to tell someone that they will not be recieving their refund for one reason or the other. The best part of the day was the interaction with the clients. I had a great office manager who was very understanding and will to do whatever she could to help out. I also had great Co-workers."
good,Hardest part of the job-sometimes the clients get unhappy. I have learned to let it go as they are not unhappy with me. Sometimes it is the system or they are just unhappy to have to pay taxes. The co workers are very nice to work with. I love going to work most days.
good,"I liked working for owner & manager & coworkers as well, this job is a seasonal job. I would recommend working for H & R Block if a person is looking for seasonal work."
good,ive been at the block for a few months now and I seem to enjoy it. I learn new things everyday. new things that can help me for the future. Only thing I disliked was its only temporary.
good,"It's a sensitive environment and often clients are not comfortable with leaving their credentials with a person other than their tax preparer. Once paperwork is filled out, the client receives a document/receipt, they are more at ease."
good,Well I will say that I'm very well at organization and I'm very well at being on time at work never late and I'm always on task and do what I do best that's works for me
good,The company overall is a good company with flexible hours and pay.  I would like to see more lunch provided by management for working tax professional during the season.  It will help during the busy season.
good,"Very productive place . Also, managed a lot of things at once . Made sure that clients were satisfied and great customer service in person and through the phone . Made appointments as well and persuade people to come in /advertising ."
good,"Good part time job from January to April 15. Smart, Ethical employees within a professional environment. Good temporary place to work with the possibilities of advancement based upon taxation education training. Their stock is a buy!"
good,Good company to work for with many ways to improve knowledge and stay current on tax law. Employer cares greatly for client and employee management. Always looking for employees to move up in company
good,It's a good part time job . I wish they paid more. I wish it was an all year job . Training is very good . They should really pay more for the kind of work we do.
good,"Big company, lots of resources to assist employees.  Pay is commission-based, which hurts new associates' morale usually.    Not a lot of job security for managers so must be self-starter, extremely motivated."
good,"As a CSP ( customer service professional). The job is pretty simple, if you don't mind sitting at a desk. The hours depends on your store location. The pay was average"
good,"Good place to gain some experience , filling tax returns , gain customer service experience . Also you will have some challenges for achieving the target"
good,I loved working at HR Block. I worked hard and learn alot and was promoted to office leader in my second year. I loved the environment and the people with whom i worked. There was always some kind of internal friendly competition going that would keep everyone interested and motivated. I loved teaching new systems and technical skills as well as learning new ones. It was a great experience for me.
good,I worked CSP four days a week really enjoy the clients and co-workers. Very good location for me only a mile from my house.  I worked from 7:30 AM til 5:30 PM most days four days a w
good,"Good on the job learning, lots of customer interaction, can be a bit stressful during peak tax return periods, get to meet lots of new people, generally a fun place to work."
good,"I enjoyed the staff and upper management. They made a 9-5 job fun and relaxed. I was a client service rep. for 6 years until I moved to TX. i enjoyed my co-workers and clients. This is a tax office environment so, clients who come in are usually repeat customers an you see them every year during tax time. Confidentiality, is a must with documents and information being given out. Overall my experience was Great!!"
good,What I like about HRBlock is the ability to be in charge of what I make. If I’m willing to devote the time and grow my client base I will be rewarded. I can have a flexible schedule but I choose to work very hard for 3 and half months. I truly enjoy what I do and I love working for HRBlock. Being that this is mainly a seasonal position HRBlock has a hard time attacking qualified office managers. This can gender being able to do my job to the best of ability.
good,I love the fact that H&R Block is willing to work around my life not the other way around. When looking for a job that was one of the major requirements due to me being in school at the time.
good,"Extremely fast paced environment during tax season. Off season is much slower but you encounter lots of complex tax issues, IRS and State audits, which call for much tax research."
good,Great experience I learned so much about business overall and took alot away from the experience itself that I could easily implement in other places.
good,H&R Block is a Awesome team to work with. my time with them was short but i learned a lot from very experienced supervisor. the shifts were flexible and i enjoyed every day of it.
good,"I enjoyed working there for the time I did, My manger was very down to earth and understanding, but firm when needed.The travel pay was great also, I enjoyed going to the various site locations interacting with the staff."
good,The work environment was very friendly. Everyone was always willing to help in difficult situations and help the learning process in the beginning. Definitely recommend to others.
good,Great place to work.  Exciting work atmosphere.  Meeting and greeting new customers.  A very proactive learning environment.  Great tax professionals to work with.
good,If you don't like staying busy don't work don't work at H&R Block you you work up to 16 hours a day non-stop you get good communication skills you know how to work with the public
good,"The district managers of the Sacramento area are wonderful.  They train their office managers before tax season in excellent customer service, acheiving office goals, and get your office ready. You will attend weekly meetings to keep you current on how well your office is doing compare to the other areas of the district.  It's hard work but rewarding!"
good,Open the store about 8:00 am. Made coffee. Set up appt. vacumed. Turned on all computers. Made sure all paper packages were set up. Put in cash for the day.listened to messages. Opened doors turned on the signs. Started the day. Had lunch. Made calls to clients for payments and appts. Left at about 4:30pm.
good,"I enjoyed my time with H&R Block. Good people that made the fast pace easier.   More training would have been great but for what I had to do, it was fine."
good,great place to learn and work in team.Specially for people who have interest in taxation they can learn all about taxes and apply that knowledge in work .
good,HR Block is a very resourceful company to work for and the training is very well thought out . This company train you very well to succeed in the business.
good,I like the job because they gave you training before. And the people there were very very nice and the job was just a wonderful job it was just seasonal that's the only thing that wasn't good.
good,Learn valuable information. Keep you current on tax laws. Urges you to learn more and advance position. Excellent work life schedule.  They work around your schedule
good,This was a good seasonal part-time job. I moved back to my hometown which is the only reason I left that office.  I hope to work at my new location. It has been 4 years so I will need to take the tax class again.  After I worked at the franchise office 5 years I taught a college level tax class at the local private college.
good,"I loved working here! The staff is wonderful and helpful! The downfall is season is 4 months long. Not ideal for the working parent needing 1 job. As income from January to April, perfect fit. Their up season is Branson’s down season."
good,Job at H&R Block provided lot of opportunities for learning and develop the skills related to tax planning and development.  It has opportunities to improve your education.
good,"H&R Block was an enjoyable place to work.  The only reason I didn't continue working there was that it was seasonal, and the next year I had a different PT job."
good,"While most immediate work environments are rarely high tension, I prefer franchise offices over company-owned as the corporate environment has in the past prized selling fee-loaded product over providing customer service, and tend to micro-manage things out of your control such as customer acquisition and the extra products. This is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is client relief at the conclusion of our job, and the opportunity to advise them to avoid adverse tax consequences in the future. I've learned over the years to adapt to a variety of client needs and concerns, be it a speedy refund or aid in maneuvering more complex returns."
good,"The clients are the biggest reason that the employees come back. Every location is different of course. The coworkers, then environment, and of course the pain is all different based on what location you work. Regardless of the benefits or the time invested it’s always the clients that we smile for every morning."

good,There is a lot of required training that every tax pro needs to do. If you keep in close contact with the mentor they will keep you on track. ON a typical day you are consulting others on their taxes and tax law. The people were fun to work with and learn from. Being a first year tax pro was a big learning curve and all the tax pros were eager to help you learn.
good,"Overall a very good place to work. Lots of hours and fast paced.loved the clients , Management and the Tax Professionals. Fast paced often stressful when a customer has an issue. Some customers submitted or failed to submit all their proper information. Which is not the Tax Professionals error but rather the clients lack of completeness in the process. Then they blame H&R Block Tax Professional for their own errors or eliminated items."
good,I got along with the employees very well became cool with many of them .. at times it was very busy then it became very slow but it picked up but overall it’d cool

good,"I work there as a part time and it's my first year so it's difficult to give an accurate review. However, I do enjoy working with my co-workers. I learned so much about tax through this work place. Furthermore, I enjoyed working there too. The hardest part of the job is when there is not enough tax pro to help the client at a certain level. I once have to help a client that is way above my level so I have to reschedule her to make sure I did her tax return accurately with another tax pro."
good,"First make sure the office is clean and coffee is made. A huddle begins each shift.  Began helping clients."
good,I really enjoyed the work I did for H&R Block. I worked there every year during tax season and started out as a receptionist and worked up to being a professional tax preparer myself. I had to take a tax class every year during the off season as a requirement to be employed under H&R Block. I liked all of my co-workers and had the best manager anyone could possibly ask for. The only negative thing about this job was that it was seasonal so it wasn't a year round paycheck.
good,busy and challenging must take continuing education credits to return but are not paid for by H&R block. no commission during your first year working.  Pay was not compatible with level of job

good,The franchise I work for is wonderful. Each associate is treated like a family member we have each other's backs and we help each other grow. There's a low fee for taking classes every year where you can choose to take the minimum hours of Education or shoot for the Moon. Earning potential is based on a multi-tiered commission and depends on how many clients you serve. The more open your schedule to work hours the higher your earning potential
good,"Fast paced at times, learn about the company and how the culture is.  Learn about the tax system, filing, confidentiality, what to look for about scams and how to educate the client.  The hardest part was during tax season as the closer the deadline came the more intense the bookings and hours got.  The most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,"I enjoy working with HR Block, get to meet new and old clients every tax season. Helping the clients to get the best refund possible and giving tax advice."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the clients. Management has a strong personality, chooses favorites and does not distribute the incoming clients equitably. In order to advance there is a considerable amount of unpaid education. In addition, there will be additional class time spent on the tax law changes for 2018."
good,"Great Place to Work. Flexible Schedule. Your Compensation is based on how hard you work to grow your book of business. Also, on your advancement in certification levels of tax knowledge."

Their hours are flexible enough for me to work and care for my family. It's a good company to advance professionally.

Each season you will have access to the Block online training courses to assist in meet the IRS required 15 hours of annual training credits. Additional classes can be taken at no additional charge. As you increase your knowledge and clients experience you can advance job titles which will increase your annual income. Hardest part is pulling it all together: greeting a stranger, interviewing and asking personal and financial questions, processing based upon IRS regulations, giving them the good or bad news of the outcome. Oh yes, this can be the greatest part too!"
good,"it was very good, company rightly balances the work load and fun activities. Corporate has very good management. It provides seasonal employment of 2 to 3 months every year."
good,I learned that every client has a different need.  Our job is to figure out how best to assist them so they get the best tax out come.  I worked with very professional people who were very helpful in assisting me.  Making sure there were no errors in completing the tax return and getting all the information from the client as accurately as possible.

I learned over the 2 years being here how to answer tax related questions, help a client that frustrated, and lastly to better my personal welcoming/ retail skills. The management is always here and/or checking in on us to make sure things are moving good. She can frustrate us all at times with the scheduling or consist changes. Hardest part of the job is to bite your lip and stay professional when a client flips out on you. The most fun part of the job is seeing all the clients and getting to know them along with the kids they bring in."
good,"At this place of employment, it is highly respectable. A typical day for me is to make sure that the customers are happy anyway that I can, which I enjoy thoroughly. The management here is on top of their game and very professional. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing people leave happy."

I like H&R block because i am able to learn as much as I can and there is a lot of opportunity of growth with in the company. The co-workers in my office are very nice and helpful when you get stuck. There are a lot of office activities and those are fun at work. The hardest part is only when you are not well trained enough, you may run into a few difficult returns. Also some workers might like to steal clients or be very selfish trying to get them all."
good,"great place to work, wonderful people and setting. Willing to work with you for availability. makes you feel at home very comforting. highly recommended work place for season"

I honestly love the job, however I feel like prior CSP's who keep coming back and growing with the company should be given at least a raise. it's not easy for us to be in one office and have to take other shifts in other offices knowing we have our other full time job to tend to. Great environment, the management is excellent and the TP's as well. it is a diverse family within the office, everyone is kind and open with each other. You get enough hours when asked, if hours are cut because of downtime they offer other offices for you to gain hours and marketing events to get a couple of more hours. within the time i worked here i have no complaints, very good job. however, CSP's should also get same benefits TP's do."

good,"Such a great job, provides you with affordable training to move yourself up in the company, hours are pretty flexible, seasonal work for the most part, unless you are an office manager, than you get to be in office or two days in the off season, pay is great, benifits depend on the franchise owners. Which stinks, but for seasonal work, it's hard to work out payments for the insurance. Otherwise a great place to start, and aquire skills you can use in the future. Love my time at block"
good,Had a great supervisor and dm!!!! Great professional addition for resume. Flexible Scheduling. Some delegation but Zero micro management!!! Encouraged to take advantage of next level available.
good,I loved working for this company..team and management were great.opportunity for advancement. They offered on the job training.they offer flexible schedules and clean work environment.
good,I love working with HR Block because they care about their clients and make them feel welcome. Tax Preparers have the opportunity to improve themselves and jump to the next certification level.
good,"If you thrive in an ever changing environment, H&R Block is the perfect fit. Tax laws are constantly changing and you have to stay in front of them. It is a very motivating environment with a great work/life balance!"
good,I loved working at the Block in Rocky Mount because we had a great team. It was a very friendly atmosphere and everybody made sure the customers were well taken care of. If there was a problem it was a team effort to solve it.
good,"I really enjoy working for H&R Block. The role that I have allows for a great deal of flexibility. My managers are excellent people and good leaders. I travel a good deal for my current role, which I enjoy, others may not."
good,"Receptionist,  great place to work for 3 months out of the year during tax season. You get your taxes done for free at the end of February. You can take a tax class to learn how to do taxes."
good,"H&R Block gave me the opportunity to learn how to earn money in the off season also. It gave me skills I needed to land other jobs and brush up on office equipment including computers, fax, printers, calculators, and multi line phones."
good,Great place to work. Good company to work for. Great chance for advancement in the company. Support management. Opportunity for Learn. Many locations to work.
good,"Everyone assisted anyone in need even if they were busy, it was very family oriented and I look forward to working with them again each year. I would advise anyone to put in an application."
good,They keep us up to date with the tax law and learning the the changes.  They really promote becoming an EA and learning as much as you can to help our clients.
good,"I learned a lot at the Block and was equipped for the job at hand.  I was motivated to work there.  The only issue was the trainer’s attitude changing towards the beginning of peak season and talking in Spanish around the trainees, which made us feel uncomfortable when we were still learning."
good,"I loved working for Block.  I was able to work on my own and at my own pace.  I would recommend this job to anyone if they are interested. You really don't need a lot of experience, as long as you can work a computer and talk to people on the phone, you're golden."
good,"Management was understanding, flexible, and treated you like a human being. Training was a priority and they invested in their employees. Would definitely work their again."
good,"Good company to work for. Good team work. Plenty training. Convenient locations around the country. Flexible schedule. "
good,"I worked in two locations.  A small village office that was not as busy, and a medium city office that was extremely busy."
good,This job was for the Tax filing season only. Learned a lot about filing you tax and how important it is to keep records and file the correct information. Very interesting. S D
good,"The company hired me on through training and understanding of the theory of computing and filing tax returns for clients.  It helped me breakdown the method of computing the mathematical formulas by hand without the use of calculators, computers etc. The training helped me push myself beyond my expectations that I had set for myself."
good,I have worked at 2 different locations and they were both equally great. Feels like I work with family and they make the job more enjoyable. I worked in a franchise not for the actual company. Great atmosphere
good,I have nothing to say at this time it is just a nice place for seasonal position for part time work I would definitely work there again my manager was a wonderful lady
good,"Opening office, setting up cash drawer, preparing for clients on schedule and for walk-ins, answering incoming and making outgoing calls, follow through with clients to schedule new appoints or rescheduling appointments missed.  "
good,Working with H&R block was very rewarding. It also offered a great way to earn supplemental income. Its offers flexible hours and training opportunity.
good,"Management is very understanding of changing school schedules for college students. Coworkers are very helpful and treat each other as family.  Everyone is very prompt to assist with any situation. Overall, it's a great place to work."
good,"The leadership we receive on a local leave from our District general manager is unbelievable. I truly do enjoy the work and the leadership opportunities but a huge reason why i would love the opportunity to continue working with H&R Block is because of My DGM. God Bless her Always,"
good,Currently working here for seasonal and I love it. The associates are very caring and will help you with any questions you may have. They work around your availability.
good,"fun friendly family like atmosphere, everyone is close with each other, everyone works well together, they have fun but get there jobs done also, love it"
good,"A typical day includes making phone calls, organizing files, greeting clients, taking payments and understanding people's individual tax situations. H&R Block provides a good opportunity for employees to learn and prepare taxes. Hardest part of the job is understanding how tax law affects people. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing someone get help with a tough tax situation as well as learning something new every day. The location at Sudley Town Plaza has wonderful tax pros to learn and work with. Only complaint is how corporate micro-manages their offices and the appointment manager. They will move appointments for clients around the scheduling program with out talking to the client, or anyone in the actual office first."
good,"Great place to work. Very family oriented and management is very team oriented. Between January 1 - April 15 is the busiest time of the year. After that, flexibility in work schedule is a real plus."
good,"Although customers can be hard to handle during tax season due to the stress of the moeny they will receive, the work enviroment at H&R Block is usually more relaxed and easy going. Calming music is played and a positive attitude is always encouraged. Time scheduled and management can be stressed during the seasonal peak, but is usually more flexible the rest of the season. It is a more serious workplace but it pays well and has good company standards and work culture"
good,"I was a CSP/Receptionist as a seasonal employee. The management was great, very understanding and easy to talk or ask questions to. The co-workers were great and very helpful. There isn't much drama, which is a major plus for someone like me. During ""peak"" you will work a lot of hours and overtime, once it slows down you will find yourself looking for stuff to do to make the time pass. The job tasks itself are fairly easy, anyone could do this job given the availability. It's overall ""easy money"" and I would definitely recommend this position to someone else. There is also a guaranteed opportunity for advancement to become a tax preparer and then higher ranks as a tax preparer. If you have the CSP position, you will get a large discount for the tax course if you choose to advance as well! The only part of the job I really did not enjoy was the ""connect calls"" where you make outbound calls to prior clients, missed appointments, cancelled appointments, reminder calls, etc. There were far too many of them to do, and H&R Block coporate expect you to call them numerous times to the point it feels like harassment. If someone gets angry and walks out because of the wait time during peak, you will need to call them a few days later to try to bring them back in. Hope this helps anyone considering working for H&R Block. Oh, and also, Cash Express brings you donuts, pizza, and candy every couple of weeks along with the tax preparers and even some customers at times so most days you shouldn't need to pack a lunch."
good,"Great staff, this is my 3rd year and I will be back next year. I am treated with respect and have a chance to learn a lot. Work place is professional yet relaxes."
good,fun and great place to work at I love meeting new people and see old clients and I love talking with clients about anything new or old that has been happening in theirs lives
good,Learned alot about taxes and alot of training classes are offered throughout the year.  Availability days and hours are offered upon your need. Meet and build clientele as each year goes by.
good,Benefits vs. Low Salary for new hires. Great training opportunities if you want to know taxation. But the hour may be few per week and the starting base pay is low. You  have to have an entrepreneur approach in the beginning if your location is not popular or you are inexperienced.It is a great opportunity for new accountants.
good,"Enjoyed the work experience here is incredible the opportunity to learn is equally as incredible I'm looking forward to continuing to work for in with HR block and the enjoyable work environment the associates the csp the other tp all are a joy to work with uplifting and educational this will be my permanent avocation, hopefully become my vocation"
good,Friendly environment with flexible hours and plenty of room to grow. There is easy access to education and the teachers are always well prepared and knowledgeable in their fields.
good,The company really pushes for it feel like one big community. Management tries to make sure that you keep a good work/life balance especially during tax season.
good,"The job was relaxed but with deadlines. There were opportunities to learn new skills. Management was knowledgeable and knew the rules and regulations, always available for help with questions. The hardest part of the job was helping people who sometimes didn't want to cooperate or didn't like the results of their tax liability. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the relaxed office environment."
good,I Loved that all the employees are Christians and treated customers and coworkers with kindness. The customers are treated with kindness and respect. Everyone does  their jobs and seems to enjoy their jobs. I love that there is no backbiting and gossip like most jobs. It’s a very peaceful atmosphere to work in. I’m very grateful and blessed to work For such an excellent Business. I’m so  blessed is all I can say! Thank you H & R Block for giving me the opportunity to work for you even though it’s a seasonal position. I’ve enjoyed it.

good,they are very family oriented and want to see everyone succeed.  They are very helpful in trying to keep family and work life balanced.  If you are in need of a listening ear they are there to help you through whatever you are going through.
good,"I loved working for H&R Block. The job has very slow days at the beginning of tax season, although as the season come into full swing business starts to pick up VERY quickly and that helps the long days go by faster!"
good,"•	Preparing T1 Personal Tax Returns and successfully E-Filing the returns"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing tax returns via computer submitting them electronically. Opening and or closing the office as well as the cash drawer.  Making and confirming appointments, filing, keeping a clean work area and customer service."
good,"as the tax season progress the clientele grows therefore sometime you don't have the opportunity to give everyone all the financial advise needed to they can invest in their future. Many clients just want their refund and need to look toward the future as far as 401k, IRA and savings. I enjoyed ever bit of advising clients and helping them understand their refund."
good,The days at H& R block were fast paced when it came to peak season. It made the day go by fast. Being able to see clients leave with a smile on their faces was priceless.
good,Working with H&R Block was a wonderful learning experience. I met so many talented advisors and worked along side so many passionate about their career and helping others.

good,"Salary is the minimum wage plus bonus. "
good,"I loved the people. You cannot imagine what people will disclose at the tax desk, but I will never tell. I liked the idea of finishing a tax return and watching the client is at ease when they leave."
good,"It was a fairly easy job and i enjoyed what i did , i loved the clients and my co workers it was a fairly fast paced job and i would do it all over again"
good,Management was excellent in trying to work with employees hours. She was willing to go that extra mile to assure her team had everything they needed to do their job.
good,"The education that H&R Block provides is excellent. The workplace is supportive and everyone works as a team. H&R Block is a great seasonal job. I worked days, evenings and weekends. I basically worked with people to get their taxes done in the most beneficial manner."
good,"Was a very well rounded office that ran smoothly. Everyone got along and worked well together. Loved working in this office and with my coworkers, The only downfall for me is it's seasonal instead of year round work."
good,"Upon arrival, clocking in on computer system, balancing cash register, verify appointments schedule for the day and returning calls left on voice mail. The end of day balancing and closing cash register and depositing checks, cash and receipts in vault. I learned a lot about tax preparation and to work with pleasant and unpleasant clients. There was nothing hard about the job.  All the tax pros were very helpful, patient and kind while I was learning the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clients and getting to know them."
good,My boss said I'm not your boss.  Your your own boss.  I loved the fact that i didn't have to answer to anyone and it felt great and it also gave me a sense of empowerment.
good,Great place to work seasonal.  You can advance from receptionist to a tax preparer. You can choose an shift or mid shift or evening shift . You can pick up extra hours at different stores
good,"I was impressed with the corporate policies and the local management.  My supervisor was kind and truly wanted his team to succeed.  "
good,ALL IS GOOD!! with this company the management is great to work with. company is a outstanding and employees are treated fair. security should be looked into for further for measures to detail.

good,"was taught how to use there computer systems and eager to work. looked forward to going to work everyday. I would show up half hour before anyone to have coffee made, clients folders to prepares desk. Made good friends"
good,"They try to keep you current and interested in your job. You do under go extensive training yearly but, their training is sometimes hard to understand."
good,"At times it's ideal place to work, work the hours you are available  only, overtime during peak.  One on one with clients, continuing CE, learning tax update. Help your own family members and friends with tax problems or concerns, Get to file your own tax return free! You can choose the office to work at for example near your house or if prefer near your job."
good,I loved working at H&R Block!  It's a very friendly environment to work in and you always feel welcome.  I would work for H&R Block any time!!! Great place to work!
good,The job was very productive and very easy going and fun to learn. the management was very polite and helpful. the only problem was the business was slow and there was not enough work for all the employees.
good,"Typical day includes taking phone calls, making appointments, calling consumers to pay for the services, and organizing files.  Not a highly stressful environment to work in."
good,"Excellent place to work. Nice staff.Get chance to interact people."
good,Great place to work. Can learn through hrblock classes. Lots of local stores. Advancement with learning and Great team players.  Lots of years of experience. Great management.

good,"Interview & prepare income tax returns for clients."
good,I was able to work when I could and at the office I could get to. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with but one of the hardest part was some of the people I worked with.
good,H&R Block has provided me with the opportunity to gain valuable experience in Human Resources and I have taken advantage of the tuition reimbursement benefit to advance my career.
good,"Gives the clients the most they can get out of their tax return.  Gives the best tax service in the country.  The company gives good opportunity for advancement.  Courses are free off season.  Your advancement depends on your willingness to learn about new tax laws and better, more complicated returns."

good,"I've worked with them seasonally for twelve tax seasons now, and have enjoyed almost all of them.  My coworkers are wonderful, and my managers have been great to work for.  Although I've not ""moved up the ladder"" I've increased my tax knowledge and  learned new skills every year.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to do everything that every client wants me to do for them (because sometimes I legally can't).  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with an office team that enjoys serving clients."
good,I absolutely loved working here! Training lasts a few months when you first start. You have to complete the tax course and pass to be offered a job. They work with you until you understand the tax program efficiently and build your confidence. Every month they recognize everyone’s progress and encourage you to be the best you can be. The one I worked for gave points which then turned into money so when you were doing a good job you got bonuses although they were not much it was nice to be appreciated. Every year after the first tax season you have to take I believe it’s 20 hours of continuous education which is all done on computer you can do at home or in office. I learned so much working here! Great place to advance too!
good,"I love working there, even though it is seasonal. They even honor your availability as many have full-time jobs outside of the company. Working with numbers is my dream, and this gave me the opportunity to do just that, and help people."
good,I enjoyed working in a team environment. My manager was awesome and answered all my questions about work. Everyone there was great in their wealth of knowledge and willing to share.
good,"It was a fast paced business, getting customers to a tax preparer and helping them get all the tax information processed, so they know what they have to pay in or if they get a refund."
good,H&R Block provides all the necessary resources for me to do my job. My company also provides a great atmosphere to work in. H&R Block provides the necessary curriculum for my continuing education every year I need to complete. Allows me to take as many courses I need to refresh or learn new talents. Provides courses to allow me to increase the money I make every year.
good,"Lovable team work, learning more than what I learn from the school,  safe environment for women employees and flexible hours.  I enjoyed working there and looking forward for the future."
good,"Upon getting my seasonal position with HR Block I was able to can additional certifications that assisted me in providing services to additional clients.  Within the virtual tax preparation workplace, I was able to complete tax returns for all states including the Virgin Islands."
good,"Loved working with H&R Block would like to continue working with them, Great workplace, a typical day was fast paced and phone was always ringing. The hardest part of the Job was determining which Tax pro needed to see the clients based off their needs. The most enjoyable is the family setting and getting to know all the employees and being able to enjoy working."
good,"It's a great place to work, it was a little to slow of an environment for me but the people, hours, work load, and management are wonderful. will definitely be going back next tax season."
good,"A typical day is assisting or advising clients on tax laws and issues. Preparing taxes and informing of upcoming tax changes and how they may impact them.

Opening and closing out cash register and documenting Petty Cash."

good,"Its an opportunity to learn as much in this field as you like. Gives college accounting students a chance to learn as they go."
good,"I enjoyed working for H&R Block for the 12years I was there.  It allowed me to be home with my children and still provide for them.  I loved the learning process for preparing taxes (not like the other guys).  The Agents and CSCs and Manager all worked together and we were like a family.  I became very ill one year and though they stated I was still an employee, I had to take the year off and have not been able to return.  I really do miss working here."
good,H&R Block allows their employees to freely use their tax profession skills on paid programs to help a wide range of taxpayers. The company provides the tax pros and their clients base with flexible hours throughout the week to accomplish their tax within the federal government time frame of the tax season. The programs H&R Block offers is specialized for the tax to compete with the best software on the market.
good,Being a seasonal associate you have to grow your expertize really fast. You need to be good at research and self-management. Communication skills is a must for this job.
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work,  everyone is down to earth and supportive through office goals and personal goals. Some days there is downtime to call clients and work on taxes returns that are dropped off, and some days you will have clients coming at you from all directions. The downside, you don't make a lot of money until you accumulate your clients and learn learn learn. So, it's a process.....But, it's worth it! If you stick with it, you will learn a LOT about taxes and advance your goals."
good,"We had 200 cases per day"
good,"Meeting and exceeding office records and goals, attending all meetings, leadership development, scheduling staff, ensuring that tax professionals were knowledgeable of current tax law and in compliance with HRBlock policies and procedures for tax preparation.  The most challenging aspect of this position was gaining the respect of long time HRB employees who surpassed me in knowledge and seniority.  I overcame this by expressing a genuine desire to learn and appreciation for their expertise."
good,"La cultura laboral es muy agradable, existe un ambiente muy cooperativo, amigable, y de mucho respeto. Se trabaja muy bien el manejo del estrés, y se ve reflejado en el servicio al cliente."

good,"My time at H&R was informative, and a great learning process. I took to learning the system very quickly, and I believe I benefited greatly from my time there. My managers were very friendly, as well as, the rest of the staff."
good,"everyone I worked with was great. The tax pros that had more experience were always willing to help out us 1st years, when we were stuck or didn't know what to do. Our manager was really good she was helpful and understanding when strange things came up."
good,My manager was super nice. The whole staff was nice. They were patient with me while I was learning. Everyone helped each other. Encouraging to advance on my job.
good,"Good staff, good management but low salary. For me, the job is hard because you will deal with any kinds of people. They are mostly mad and upset because of their tax returns. But I learned how to deal with them diplomatically and professionally."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people here. I wished it was open all year. The hours are flexible and the training is great. You can return each season if you prefer, but if you work another job it's hard to return to them."
good,There are many advantages to working for H&R Block.  My tax return is prepared every year by on of the most highly trained individuals in the industry
good,"The duties for this job include answering phones, scheduling appointments, greeting customers, alphabetical filing, accepting payments,  and office cleaning duties."
good,"Greeting clients in a personalized, warm, friendly, and inviting manner by phone or  in the office helping to meet each clients needs. Nothing Negative to say about working at this office. The hardest part of the job is when a client or clients expectations were not fully met. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and the relationship that is built between you, co-workers and the clients."
good,"I don’t have enough hours but I do like to work with my coworkers and the environment is nice to work in."
good,I enjoy working with the tax professionals and the public. The hours are flexible. The work atmosphere is professional and relaxed. The Customer Service Professional position is sometimes fast-paced.
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work, the growth opportunities that come with H&R Block careers. I would suggest them increasing the hourly pay from min. wage."
good,"Work varies from fast paced, to logistical information handling. Lots of team work, and great communication between management and employees. Highly recommend working here as a flexible part time or full time employer."
good,Great place to learn new skills. There is a peak time where there is more fast paced action. During down time you are able to sharpen your skills with more training.
good,"As a receptionist, you make phone calls and file papers and occasionally clean the office but that's it. The employees are great, the managers are great and the customers! Seriously the easiest job I've ever had! Sometimes I'm bored at the office because its so easy."
good,I enjoy what I do and working with my clients yearly. I like the fact that I can work whatever hours I wish to work with obligation. environment is relaxing and very entertaining.
good,"Its a wonderful place to work in. The only thing I wish I could change is that I wish it was an all year around job, but unfortunately it is not. This job is only seasonal for the taxes."
good,love the people and the job. I am a seasonal employee so the hours are not great because the hours vary depending on how busy the office is. But over all its a great place to work!
good,I am in a seasonal position but so far it is a great place to work. It isn't that many hours due to lack of funding in some locations. Everyone is really friendly and nice to work with.
good,It is fast paced and stressful but that is only during the peek and after it will slow down. You will have plenty of hours at first and then they cut your hours since it does slow down.
good,"Duties included:"
good,"The St. Helens, OR office is a great place to work - Tax pros and management are supportive and the teamwork is amazing.  In all my years of working I have never experienced such teamwork and enjoyable work atmosphere as we have in this office.  I wish it was a full time position and all year long instead of just during the tax season!"
good,"I really liked this job, I was a receptionist and then lead of two offices. I would start my day by going to a meeting with other leads from the other district offices and pick-up new advertisement paperwork or updates for the tax professionals throughout the tax season. I learned from this company that the customer was not always right or they would be doing their own taxes, I believe that this is the only company that has that philosophy as far as clientele is concerned because the clientele keep coming back.I did at two times take the tax preparation courses but found that I was more interested in the back office scene. The hardest part of this job was dealing with angry clients but showing them concern and apathy helped to calm them down to the point at which a conversation could be held without the whole office able to hear."
good,"I appreciated all the supervisors I came in contact with.  They were all understanding, respectful, and loving.  They love what they do; it was obvious in the manner in which they treated their clients and each other."
good,I went into this job to learn how to do my own taxes. It was a seasonal position but if you did well enough you'd be able to work full time. One student in the course even went on to be a manager because of previous experience. I learned how to do my own taxes and I got a job for a few months. I could have gone back and continued to advance within H&R Block but it wasn't the job I was looking for at the time. Just a skill.
good,"Our office manager really made work pleasant as in she trusted in us to do our jobs. It made for a very relaxed and productive environment. With every client you learn new things about tax. And besides, the information becomes tattooed in your brain after a few days. My co-workers were always eager to help with any information needed. "
good,"It was a n atmosphere to get great practice of what you have learned in their training classes"
good,They are the most friendliest people ever. Most helpful people ever. It’s only seasonal job but it’s fantastic to work with. The manger there is the best. She was always positive with all her coworkers. I would  definitely  work for them again.
good,I was a customer service rep. I made appointments. It was so easy. But a lot of computer training. But I never felt stressed because there wasn't much to be responsible for . just don't get the calls mixed up.
good,"You have to want to  files taxes or its  not for you, training at that time was not so well but I mad it through But I think its better know. I would recommend  I someone wanted to learn about taxes"
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with Block. An opportunity was presented and I worked out of two offices. The tax pro's are very competitive but friendly and very helpful. The position was only temp as it is seasonal. I could not ask for better manager! How lucky can you get? I worked for a minister. This was my first receptionist position and a lot to learn. The tax pro's were always willing to step in and help when needed. When it comes to their clients the tax pro's are very, very competitive. Yet they are always willing to work as a team for the good of the entire office."
good,"H&R block was a fun place to work. I worked there while in college and they were extremely considerate as far as schedules went. I worked daytime hours most days and part time. I was a CSP so my time consisted of making sure the office was clean, notifying tax pros when their clients arrived, managing a multi-line phone system and entering client info on the computer. I sometimes took payments and would call to confirm appointments as well. Basic Office secretary duties. Would definitely recommend."
good,"I love my job, I only wish it wasn't temporary. There is advancement to those that want it. My work is steedy and I have learned a lot. The people I work with are great."
good,"This was a fun job, meeting new people, keeping in touch with regular clients from year to year. Loved my co workers and my supervisor. We always made the office a fun environment to work in"
good,It was very good working at H&R Block. Excellent team members. Excellent management.Everything was so good but unfortunately my job was seasonal.I wish I could get a full time. The only drawback is that they hire lot of seasonal associates.
good,"Marketing is part of the job"
good,"I had only a 6 week training course but, it is usually a month or longer. Work there is only seasonal. I brought in a lot of money for the company. The job was serious but, fun."
good,i worked here for a number of years up untill three days before i had my daughter they were very kind an generous people eager to teach an all seemed to love what they did.
good,"I was just the receptionist at H&R for the tax season, I answered phones, made appointments, got people to their tax preparer and made sure that the office looked nice and clean throughout the day. It was pretty relaxed but it could get busy during the peak of the tax season."
good,Bunbury Office has a fantastic team environment.  Very busy for month of July to mid August so every staff member is on the ball and ready to ensure all clients have professional service.  Management is always willing to assist and happy disposition throughout the office.  District Manager and State Managers always helpful.
good,It is nice working with all the wonderful lady there. Also we had very nice clients that made our day go by faster. It a good experience working there.

Answering the phones at times was hectic, and the beginning of the season was also hectic, towards the middle it slowed down, and then picked up fast again near the end of the season. I kept the waiting area clean, prepared coffee for the clients, answered questions to clients just coming in the door, setting appointments for 8 different tax professionals the most enjoyable part of the day was working with the public and just understanding what was important to them, the most challenging part of the job was when it got real busy.It could sometimes be difficult to answer the phones, take care of the clients, set appointments, make sure there was enough coffee made, keep the waiting areas neat and organized, accepting payments, and fielding complaints to the Office Leader."

I was a receptionist at the canyon store office and it was not too hectic for me , but the tax pros had their peak days/weeks in which I tried to help out with as much as I could to eliminate unnecessary tasks for stressed out tax pros. and those tax pros were very grateful. My other position was Store Ambassador which I was going to neighboring businesses to promote the company with hand made gift bags to give  away as well as hosted and help assemble out in the community events to bring more attention to the company to obtain more clients. I love to work with the general public. customer service is something that i do naturally so its easy and enjoyable to be able to be out and meeting new people as much as I did working here id go back every year without a second thought"

The job itself was pretty easy, you answer phones, set or change appointments, and make sure the customers are well informed in regards to what to expect when they see our tax preparers. There were a couple downfalls. We would take the heat for IRS at times and get some angry customers so you have to hear some choice words occasionally, but for the most part the customers were very friendly and understanding. Your managers and coworkers were more like friends and family than they were coworkers. I had a blast. I only left after losing my vehicle in an accident so had no way there. They actually kept me hired for 2 months before they let me go."

Also did a lot of filing paperwork. I was pregnant while working there so my manager was very kind and considerate. The tax professionals there were wonderful and so helpful to the customers and receptionists. i learned so many interesting tidbits working there. The best part of the job was seeing so many different clients every day and the social interaction. The hardest part was when customers would call or come in angry at our staff, when they were having problems with the IRS, which were clearly out of our hands.

I picked up the work fairly quickly. We all got along very well and we helped each other out as best as we possibly could. Some days got very hectic but, we would always have each others backs on those days and we'd each take on a task to accomplish. Our management was great and always helpful when we needed it!"
good,"You do have to put a lot into building yourself to the full benefit of the pay structure and this can take up to three tax seasons. It is worth it if you are in a position to lay that foundation.

Overall though, I loved working for HR Block."

good,I love this job but some people apply thinking it's going to be some easy sit down phone job. It's not easy. You have to know how to use a phone and 2 computers. And when it's tax time the phone calls are back to back and it can be very busy and sometimes stressful.
good,"I worked at a franchise where family came first, And job second, which I appreciated and made me work harder. Love the flexibility and also the camaraderie environment."
good,"Great co-workers; always helping each other as a team should.  Always doing things to keep morale up--luncheons for office and client appreciation days."
good,Great place to work seasonal.  There are always jobs available to advance but the work is always seasonal  the most you could work is 5 or 6 months out of the year.
good,"I have been with H & R Block for 23 years.  I have been able to grow with my office, both in the number of returns that I have done and in my professional capacity.  I work with a fantastic group of people who support each other personally and professionally under a very demanding schedule."
good,You really have to put work in to grow your clients. The better service you provide the more clients recommend you. It's definitely a place were everyone helps each other grow. I enjoy that it is self motivating and your continuing education really keeps you updated.
good,Management very understanding. Just like any job rules have to be respected re: attendance attitude and #1 Customer Service. Learned new skill set which is great!!!!!
good,"H&R Block is an exciting place to learn financial planning, tax preparation, networking, and build new relationships through knowledge of tax laws. The world of taxes is always changing and a never ending challenge. Encouraged to work alone; but, given resources to assist with answers. Team work and camaraderie is developed in this short span of 4 months.  I think: it challenges a  Tax Professional to be the best. Overall a good place to learn and make extra money."
good,It could've paid more but I was great at my job. I caught on really easy and I love it. Some customers was rude but I dealt with it in a friendly manner and before they left out they would tell me I like you
good,"Desktop support.  Customer service.  Log into system,  ticketing system.  Resolve issues for users. Issues with laptop, pc, printers. Install or hardware issues. Installed 1000 pc for tax season."
good,"I enjoyed working at H&R Block.   It was a humbling experience for me.  The compensation wasn’t nearly what I am use to making, but I was able to use my years of experience as a tax professional and skills to assist others (which is always rewarding to me).  Also, some of their experienced preparers were an asset to me.   I was treated with respect and always praised or rewarded for a job well done.  That made me feel appreciated.  I plan on staying on board for another season because it’s not about the money, but being in a good work environment, satisfying clients and working my way up."
good,"If you the type of person who excels at challenges and likes recognition, This is a great job! Nice working environment. Only work at the times and days your available"
good,"Handling of money. Phone calls are a must. Be available to answer questions. Customers may be a bit upset, be prepared to find means to settle them. Seasonal job"
good,Loved the work environment. Enjoyed the work. The position was close to home and I felt part of the team when the season ended and I was included with a couple of get-togethers.
good,For seasonal work this is the place to be.  Great for career development.  It is really up to you how far you can go.  Continuous education.  Be sure to be with an office with good client flow or you may be sitting for a while twiddling your thumbs!!
good,"H&R block is a great company to work for the only thing they need to do is to increase the payment structure for the tax professional just to compare the payment with other tax prep company , the other tax company pay time and half more than H&R .... in a short term you will see tax professional will be trained in H&R block and  get the knowledge then will move to another company to get paid more"
good,"I like working with people and problem solving.  Taxes can be very challenging and this business is certainly one I love."
good,Excellent place to work. Very helpful team and lots of learning via continuous training. I'd recommend this company to anyone who likes to deal with all kinds of clients. The company deserves a good reputation and one of the best out there to get your income taxed filed.
good,"Working here is amazing. No mater what part of the country you work in, it is easy to transfer out somewhere else. Though it is seasonal it’s a great opportunity for anyone who wants to understand and help others understand how taxes work."
good,Pleasant atmosphere and great staff with flexible schedule and a lot of customer contact in person and on the phone. Seasonal work for most employees but most preparers return each year.
good,"I started as a Client Services Rep during the seasonal tax season. The second year I was a Tax Prep I.They provided training in a group setting that clearly prepared us on what to expect when working at the front desk and supporting the tax pros."
good,I love the flexible schedule and opportunity to learn. Management teams are great and always helpful. Interacting  with my clients is my favorite. I look forward to each new season.
good,"The pay was low, but a very nice place to work. Atmosphere very comfortable.  Room for advancement with training.  Hours were flexible, work load not too demanding depending on days worked."
good,There is a difference between working for a franchise and a corporate office.  The franchise is definitely better because the owner/manager gets to know you as an employee.
good,"usually a day consisted of making coffee, processing payments, scheduling clients phone calls and walk-ins. filing tax returns, sending faxes, making copies, scanning documents."
good,"Working for this company was an experience and accomplishment for me to get back familiar with office work and renew some skills.  Good pace, workable schedule and overall great experience"
good,I went in early every morning got my workspace ready to start my day. I took care of clients tax issues or questions either in person or over the phone.
good,"It had been awhile since I've worked due to being a military spouse, but I enjoyed it as this was just a step back into the work field. I recommend it."
good,"Work with clients on their taxes, review any deductions that they may have.  Call on client to schedule their tax returns for the year."
good,A typical day at work sometimes are very busy. I learned to have empathy for the public. The workplace culture is professional & clients are the number one priority.
good,I work at a franchise. So my experience may differ from that of corporate employees. The franchise owner is very good at helping employees learn and grow.
good,"H&R Block is a relaxed but sometimes fast paced job. During the tax season there are times when it can be slow, but it can pick up at any time also. You have to be ready to answer multiple phone calls, make on the spot appointments and remember to match people with the correct tax professional."
good,I love working for block. I've worked as a receptionist for a couple years now. Hopefully when I return after this tax season I can take the course offered and become a tax pro.
good,"I enjoyed working for H&R block, It was really interesting learning a new thing every day, because this is all about, there is something to learn every day"
good,"Busy"
good,"Developed my accounting skills and customer service skills at the same time as a tax preparer, learned to deal with all type of people attitudes, and learned to teach people finance budget."
good,"Im a Customer Service Professional (front desk, recepcionist)  at H&R Block  and I love it. I enjoy working with the Tax Pros. The job is easy. And I have blood for people"
good,Its a great place to work. I am in school and it helps me to better myself for my career. The employees that I work with are very helpful. I am hoping to one day be a manager at the company so that I can be on top of my game. All in all its a great company to work for.
good,The office staff is supporortive and fun always willing to pitch in and help team work was always a plus! Making the clients comfortable and happy is a plus no matter the extremes to makesure our clients return back as well as referring new cleints to our office!!
good,This job allowed me help so many people and also myself.  They offer great discounts for employees on their own tax returns and also their family members.  I heard they are now offering jobs year around and not just seasonal.
good,"as  a  receptionist  its  a   great  beginner  job , but  as  you  continue  to  work  there  it  gets  a  little  boring,  and  repetitive.  the pay  is  okay."
good,"Answered phones, Scheduling appointments for clients. Creating and organizing clients files. Hardest part was knowing it was temporary employment. Management was kind and patient, helpful in instruction and training there.I enjoyed assisting the customers and working in a productive environment with my co-workers."
good,"I love my job at H&R Block, We are a family organization. They just do not offer any benefits. No medical or retirement benefits are offered through the franchise offices."
good,Hands on experience with customer.  Building personal relationships with customer while gathering there information.  Has daily training programs to ensure growth.
good,"H&R Block is good; however, I don't feel like the culture supported my desire to advance my career. Most of my fellow associates were content with career advancement only through experience. It's a good company and very similar to my own seasonal part-time business."
good,"I have worked with HRB for 8+ years. I absolutely love the culture and the structure. Wonderful work/life balance. The only reason I seek other work is for year round work instead of seasonally, and the option of health benefits."
good,loved working there and learning. other workers were very helpful and the atmosphere was great. H & R Block is the best place to get your taxes done with excellent customer service and the opportunity to develop a client/tax preparer relationship.
good,"I think from my experience it is long days, I felt that we would receive work from other office and I felt the training was lacking. We had staff that came to our office on loan that had been doing tax longer then me that knew less."
good,"Enjoy the clients and helping them, but feel keeping up with tax changes and required learning should make pay more than their base salary.  Hours can be arranged to meet your other commitments.  Fellow workers are all there to help clients and make a great team."
good,"At the Sydney office, was great everyone was friendly gave me all the hours i could want.  All helpful and understanding.  I would work there seasonally again but i moved away"
good,great if you just want a few hours a week. great for full time students. the place is great. the staff is cool. fast pace sometimes but can also be very slow.
good,"It is a very fast paced environment when peak season hits. Management is very friendly and supportive at all times. It is a very family oriented environment, and if any issues should arise someone is available at all times to help figure out a solution. A typical day is phones, fax, and filing as well as customer interactions which is most of the day."
good,"H&R Block was a very relaxed place to work, not hard at all to get the hang of. The work environment is good, all the other employers were extremely nice and helpful."
good,"Small but effective unit to work with and learn."
good,"The company values their employees and does its best to invest in their future. They have paid training for all their employees and have very flexible hours. they will work around your schedule. They encourage the employees to advance and promote within. It's a fast paced place to work at during tax season, but it's fun and exiting."
good,"The environment is so rewarding and supportive!!! My coworkers were not afraid to teach me different information, which is refreshing. I felt like I was on a real team, and it was a wonderful experience."
good,"I enjoyed the yearly updating of skills, tax laws and advance learning of new tax areas increasing knowledge. I enjoyed tax preparation of client's returns and helping them avoid unnecessary taxation and penalties."
good,"I love working for Block!! Great pay and great people!  Very team focused!  I love going to work and making my clients happy!  End of the season bonus is great, if you work hard for it!"
good,"My manager was the best. I was the CSP for H&R BLOCK. The only downfall is you have to take advantage of overtime when it is offered and depending on who your manager is you can get tne hours you need.   Also, to make up hours you can work at a different office if you want with both manager's consent because CSP's get hours as needed by your office. So, if your office is busy you have more work and it is fast paced but my office was mellow and I love my coworkers. My manager is awesome."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was only seasonal but the hours were flexible and you basically make your own schedule. The management was awesome and supporting and the training was easy and helpful.
good,This is a great season position It is extremely flexible and a laid-back type of position. You eventually get to know the clientele by face/name if you stay there long enough.
good,"- Quick pace "
good,This is a very good place to work.  The pace at times is very busy but it is always stressed to know your work and do it correctly.  Being a tax preparer can be very demanding when you deal with clients finances but you are given all the training you need and require to do the job.
good,The hardest part about the job was not being able to help tax payers get approved for same day tax returns or advanced loans around the holidays. The workplace environment is great
good,"They are very flexable with your hours, you can work as much or as little as you would like.  Overtime is authorized druing peak times. Plenty of training at your fingertips, easy to advance."
good,The manager was very good to work for and the people were friendly and pleasant to work with. 
good,I enjoy meeting people. I enjoy helping make the clients happy. I enjoy the crew that I work with. I enjoy sceduling my own hours. I enjoy learning new skills
good,A typical day consists of making phone calls reminding clients they have an appointment and to confirm. You start off the day by filing reports from the evening before. I worked in a great office with some pretty awesome tax pros. They made the office feel more welcoming which made the workplace enjoyable.
good,"H&R block gives opportunity for advancement, and learning tools. Flexible hours and a team environment. The only down fall is the compensation for management does not fit the work they require as well as the time they want us to spend at work. You make more money as a regular tax professional than most mangers."
good,"Everyday was different, meaning the scale of customers needing their taxes prepared.  The job was well executed by management by creating an environment with team spirit.  I learned quickly and efficiently the data system and linking CRA information to clients.  "
good,"A typical workday depends on what part of the season we're in. During peak season, it's busy, but the flow of the workday is pretty steady."
good,"This is a seasonal job that requires a 4 month commitment. On a typical day I would check and respond to all voice messages. Answer calls and set appointments. Contact previous clients to set new appointment. Make reminder calls of upcoming appointments. Check in clients and match with appropriate tax pro. Track returns and notify management of any conflicts. During peak season it can become very stressful and challenging, I think that's what I enjoyed most."
good,I had a very good experience working with H & R Block. for the environment was very professional and friendly. I enjoyed it so much I often return during seasons I am not working full time.
good,I enjoy this company and how helpful they are for employees and customers. There is a real comraderie and people work together. A lot of resources and flexibility
good,"Good company with great educational classes. In my opinion the instructor lead classes are the best, followed by virtual, and then the online. The management is great also."
good,"Excellent working conditions, locations and management encouragement and helpfulness. Training is OUTSTANDING.  Scheduling work times is very flexible"
good,Hr block provides felxible schedules and outstanding training for its employees.  I only wish they provided full time rather than seasonal employment.
good,When I started working at H&R Block I had no experience working in that type of field. But I received the proper training to effectively perform my job duties.
good,Employees conduct themselves professionally and are dedicated to helping their clients.  Management is supportive and is sincerely interested in the well being of their staff.
good,"H&R Block was my first receptionist job, and they were very helpful in training me on the various programs and getting me situated in a new role and environment. The tax professionals I worked alongside were very welcoming and pleasant to work with. The overall atmosphere is very comforting with a focus on taking care of the clients."
good,"I would recommend this seasonal job to anyone. The atmosphere is great, along with the staff and management. A typical work day included: answering the phone and setting appointments. Following up on tax information."
good,"At H R Block every day is a new and wonderful experience."
good,Enjoy teaching clients about tax laws and assisting them to make good decisions related to tax status. Like giving good news and how to improve if the news is not so good.
good,"Greeting clients was a big factor of the job.  To understand the clients it was beneficial to listen to their questions and concerns, to better assist them.  I had to work with a wide diversity of clients, each having a different situation. At times it was hard to understand because of the language barrier, but with patient and time the desired goal was accomplished.  I enjoyed working in such an environment that had ever changing issues to address and different outcomes, depending the situation."
good,"This is a fun workplace. Everybody here is very nice. This is a great workplace. Any issue just contact with District Manager or any senior tax professional,they will help right the way."

good,"its a exelent company to learn tax, confortable team, always "
good,"Tax preparation is just hard work, period.  Working for H&R Block makes it a lot easier.  They provide you the education and tools to make it happen.  "
good,"lots of hard work. working conditions great. good hours.  great clients. management is good. I mostly was on phone, and meeting with clients at front desk"
good,Great company to work for with plenty of opportunity for advancement. I just wish I could work there year round. Everybody I worked with was professional and helpful to coworkers.
good,H&R Block is a great place to work.  A typical day at work began by sitting at the front desk greeting the clients.  Tax time can be busy but management is always available to assist whenever needed.  The hardest part of the job is staying busy when business is slow.  The most enjoyable part of the job is scheduling the clients appointments and seeing the happy smile on their faces when they receive their refund checks.
good,This is one of the better employers that I have worked for.  The management and culture are solid.  I had enough autonomy to run my Area and produce results.
good,for 5 years during the tax season I went to work for h&r block. I loved the people I worked with and the district manager was the best manager I have ever had.
good,H&R Block provides classes to increase knowledge and certification in taxes. So on a typical day when we are not servicing our clients we are constantly learning.

good,"Great! I learned to be a real professional at greeting clients, scheduling appointments, making clients feel at home while they are getting confidence in our staff and our company"
good,"Working for H&R Block is a great experience. Being able to assist a client in finding a solution and or solving an issue, answering questions, taking calls and also making calls.Working the social media site daily and creating cases. There's always a happy atmosphere and management is great on every level."

good,"I was the receptionist for H&R Block which is just a seasonal job. during my time there I answered the phone calls, I booked appointments, I greeted the customers and filled paper work for this office."
good,H&R Block is an interesting place to work. You have the opportunity to meet all kinds of people in all kinds of tax situations. To me it is a pleasure to assist my clients to understand their tax situation and help them to reach their financial tax goals each year.
good,"I started as receptionist and will have the opportunity to obtain a tax preparation certification for free for the following year. The management is fantastic, very understanding and flexible. Since it is a seasonal job, I worked a lot of hours. This was not required, but when I asked for more hours they had no problem giving them to me and paying me overtime. Highly recommend."
good,"General Administration, Client Contact, Booking & Making appointments,Preparing documentation, Invoicing & receipting Payments, great place to work..."
good,"During Tax Season and the two months leading up to it, our work environment was very fast paced. During the off season, we enjoyed a relaxed work environment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of filing, answering phone calls, greeting walk ins/appointments, and placing clients with proper tax professional. I've learned how to use their computer systems and how the company functions on a day by day basis.  I enjoy being an H&R Block employee."

good,All co-workers and manager(s) were all really great people to work with. Had no problem being flexible with my schedule hours. I highly recommend it there!
good,"I stared it here as a Tax Prepared, full time, and I ended as a Customer Service Professional, Part time, it was a nice extra money for me. I had fun with my coworkers, I love it there..."
good,"Great job, but it is seasonal, people and mangers are great, training is above and beyond then any other company I ever seen. There are options to work on seasonal basis throughout the year on different products when your expertise level goes up."
good,"I enjoyed it Immensely. It was very fun to hang out with all the other number nerds. We had the same humor. We all liked to work, quietly and diligently, but when it was slow we laughed."

good,"On a typical day you're behind a desk with a couple monitors, and checking in customers who come in and setting up new customers and matching them to someone in your office. Also expect to do plenty of filing and auditing documents. After all that, you have the opportunity to take a free class to get a Tax Pro job."
good,"I loved working here for the short period that I did. It was very fast and up beat. Loved the customers, loved the experience and the new people that I got to work with."
good,Great place to work with all the classes you are willing to take to better your education in the field of tax accounting. Work place culture is accommodating for those with family.  Satisfying to answer questions of clients so that they are informed.
good,Prepared personal and business tax returns for new and returning customers. Seasonal work during tax season which meant the work environment was fast paced and had little room for error.
good,"Perfect position for the upcoming graduate or developing high school senior..at home Mom or recent retiree.  Great atmosphere, great management, and loads of training opportunity if you like analytics, finance, or independent accounting.   Proficient software and cutting edge technology reduce all the guess work of taxes and tax related issues."

good,I love working here hope I get the opportunity to work here again this coming tax season.  I just which they paid more because the pay scale is very low for a fortune company.
good,People were very friendly at the Carbondale office. You could always ask questions as well. This is a great learning experience if you like accounting or working with taxes. The program is great!
good,"I have been reappointed as a receptionist for H&R Block for the past three tax seasons. Of all the jobs I have ever had, this is by far my favorite. The job itself is a piece of cake, it's very customer service-oriented. You have to be self-motivated, have the ability to take initiative, improvise, multitask, and be a quick, critical thinker. The job duties required basically everything that I excel at, which makes me feel competent and adept. Most of the time it didn't even feel like I was ""working"" because I loved what I was doing and I did it well so it was like second nature. Everyone does what they're supposed to do and helps each other out, I literally couldn't ask for a better group of coworkers. My office functioned so efficiently, even during peak season when the phone rang nonstop and the office was clients galore! If there was a ""hard"" part about the job, it would be the clients. Of course there were some difficult ones but for the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. I never had a problem going above and beyond for my team, especially my manager; Oh my God, she was a dream. I am the youngest employee there but I still developed close relationships with some of the older tax pros. We typically ordered lunch every day around the same time, and the office manager would frequently buy lunch for everyone on Fridays. Upper management is pretty hands-on and involved as well. I can't express enough how much I love this company, particularly my district. These are some really genuine, dedicated people. I plan to continue returning for as long as they will have me."
good,"Typical day you see a dozen or so clients, you are constantly learning on the job and taking extra classes all year long.  The hardest part is digging into peoples lives, without making it feel intrusive."
good,The people that work here are the most intelligent people I have ever worked with.  I learned alot from them.  This company is not afraid of questions and likes to hire people who are intelligent and detailed.
good,"As a temporary receptionist for H&R Block during tax season,it was a great working experience. Both my coworkers and manger were a pleasure to work with. In the short amount of time that I worked there, I learned quite a bit about how taxes are done and the process it takes to complete them. I would consider going back again to work their during the next tax season."
good,I enjoyed working for H&R Block. I was welcomed in as if I had been there for years. I think that anyone that would like to try something new should check it out.
good,"H&R Block is a nice place to work preparing income taxes. I started working for them in 1976 and at various times and dates after that. I went to school for updates about every 2 years when I prepared taxes at home after working for block. The job is challenging , fun and I learned so much. It is a great part time home business but it is only seasonal."
good,"I loved my job and the people I got to work with! I learned more quality skills to be able to continue to broaden my career options with. I will go back to H&R Block every tax season, as long as I don't already have a full time job."
good,Some days are busy and some days are slow. The work is easy to do and very low stress. There is always  known solution to any problem that occurs and your shift ends at the time it was set to end. There is really no reason to stay late or have overtime hours.
good,"Love to work at HR Block because of company's culture and people are kind and supportive. Lots of opportunity to grow with the company. Great team playe, as well!!"
good,Friendly work environment. Learned lots of new things and gained experience. Manager and team were very understanding with me being very close to having my baby and letting me attend doctors appointments. Would love the opportunity to work there again.
good,Job culture was great additional tax information was always available continuing education was provided which was great enjoyed serving the public .Co-worker very knowledgeable about with tax Laws there was always additional help and support provided from corporate and local offices.Family atmosphere.
good,"If you ever need a job where it is flexible, seasonal, easy, fast paced, and you can learn , this is the job for you. This company was amazing to work for and the pay isn't bad, but could be better for those that are returning. I recommend this job to anyone. Plus you can grow with the company."
good,H and R block was a very good place to work. I learned information about taxes that I was not aware of. I enjoyed the flexibility in the schedule and the people that I worked with.
good,everything in this job i also liked. i tried to partake in the tax season again i wasn't able to get in when i was there for many years because of assessments i wasn't qualified
good,"It is a good place to work, they really engage their employees to make sure everyone is meeting their goals. If someone is falling behind the whole team brings them up."
good,"i worked for a franchisee and the owner was amazing.  co-workers were all friendly and helpful.  you work on commission, so the hours are flexible and easy to work around my family life while still getting in lots of time at the office."
good,"Most employees at H&R Block are temporary, required to be off for 8 weeks each year and then rehired. Working conditions will vary by job site, but they are very interested in their employees and want them to be successful."
good,"The office and district I was in is outstanding.  Team was great and invested in overall success of the team. DM was great and worked to help succeed.  Speaking with some others, this was not the perception from other newer preparers."
good,"A typical day at work was busy with a lot of challenging situations due to different customers and the difficulty levels of different tax returns as you process them. It was a perfect environment to continues learning how to process in depth tax law and changes during the preparation of the return."
good,"H&R block teach me how to do tax return in correct way. I like to work with This company again.I am very comfortable to do taxes in Block work.I learned how to handle with different types of client.My senior are very helpful , The most good thing about H&R block is providing lot of Training to employees.The time consumable part of the work is, doing schedule D (Investment stock) and Schedule E ( rental income) but I like and enjoy to do schedule C especially Income from Taxi services. In my office I did most of the Uber and lyft income."
good,I've learned more about tax information by working there for the two years. Also I became interested in becoming a tax professional for the following tax seasons.
good,"This is a typical seasonal job and was really great place to work, with a lot of support regarding training and advancement, flexible hours a long the week."
good,Culture at H&R Block is fast paced and always changing. It is a wonderful place to work and to grow. Benefits package could be more. They are going through a restructure change so benefits may happen in a few years.
good,"Good people and work environment, good work/ life balance except for crunch time or when short staffed. Always a positive atmosphere,  Taxes are not a fun subject for anyone of us so to see our clients actually smiling and hugging our tax professionals, expressing how happy they are with our office and team professionals says a million words."
good,I loved my manager and location. Great tax professionals and advancement and pay raises were available if a person worked hard. Great company! Wish it wasn't just seasonal!
good,"Worked with a close knit bunch of people. If one had a question, we all helped. It is a challenging job, it can be fun and rewarding, you get to know a lot of people. If you earn a bonus, that's a plus."

good,I loved working a H & R Block I was able to help lots of clients in completing their tax returns and was able to assist and give them positive advice.
good,"I fully enjoyed working at H&R Block. I learned how to prepare taxes with this company. My typical work day consisted of answer phones, preparing taxes, and scheduling appointments. Management was amazing. Hardest part of the job was when clients didn't like the outcome of their return. Most enjoyable was the people I worked with. It felt like a family not just coworkers."
good,I enjoyed working here. I meet so many people . It's an interactive place and they always make sure they take care of their employees. I loved working here.
good,Salaried as a manager plus bonus. Good people to work with. Salary was fair and so were the bonuses. Left the company to start my own business which I later sold to Brass Tax.
good,"Great place to work"
good,No two days are ever the same. Your day is based on the number of clients that your prepare returns for. I have learned that each office has its own culture within the guidelines of the company. The hardest part about the job is when others do not want to help to achieve the stated goals. The most enjoyable part of the is the co-workers and helping our clients to achieve their financial goals.
good,I loved that it was a family oriented business that understood that with my baby/small child there would be days that I needed to handle doctor visits and other family needs so they worked with me very well to see that it was balanced and non stressful when things came up at last minute.  I would also go in when I wasn't scheduled to help with last minute needs of the office personnel  - that made it a balanced trade off.
good,Loved the job. The commute and language barrier were a problem. I enjoyed the management and upper management of the organization.  I could not relocate was another concern.
good,"As a receptionist, I assisted customers with their income tax preparations and decisions that needed to be made. I offered coffee or water on a daily basis as they waited for their turn. I also filed income tax returns and made phone calls to the customers. The environment was always steady and peaceful. It was not a hard job and I enjoyed being with the crew everyday."
good,"All employees at this office (Niles) got along great this past year.  Awesome District Manager!  Had a contagious laugh, great personality & always had your back.  She was willing to help out anytime there was an issue."
good,Take advantage of the training and classes offered. Senior management and culture is good at listening. Hardest part of the job is having enough time to learn everything you want to know about taxes.
good,I really enjoyed working for H&R Block it wasn't just a place I called work at some point it became somewhere that I felt right at home. I really loved being able to come to this as my second job and know that no matter what kind a day I had at my full time it would only get better from there.
good,Very friendly work environment where you can work independently and set your own schedule/appointments. Constantly researching and learning. Flexible.
good,I loved my seasonal  job at H&R Block but the season was over to soon..  coworkers are and were awesome... management was amazing. Good revies overall
good,"Open office procedures, prepare coffee and ensure there is water and cups for clients in the waiting area. Ensure there is enough office supplies needed for professionals, post reports and check emails, answer phones, make appointments, customer service, assist tax professionals and manger. Friendly atmosphere, gain lots of tax knowledge. Peak is challenging as this business and season is on demand. Enjoy client and co workers interaction. Got to love working with people for this kind of job."
good,"I worked for H & R Block due to not having a job in a year, when I started working here is was stressful learning the new systems but I am a quick learner and will return next year"
good,"Processing of personal tax returns for individuals is enjoyable because it feels good to help people.  As a tax professional, I can help a client understand where they could possibly make changes to their finances by changing something as small as the pre- or after-tax deductions within their payroll."
good,"The Company does a good job communicating about changes or decisions that affect employees. "
good,"Love to coming to work every day, the job itself is not hard and the people I work with are great! Duties include answering phone calls, gathering paperwork and preparing a folder for the customers to go in and see the TP"
good,"HR Block is a great place to work and an awesome company, only down fall is it's a seasonal job. Great chances to advance with company provided training."
good,I wish I had more hours and could work there off season. I genuinely loved working with everyone there. Management has been extremely flexible with my schedule when I was ill and could not work a few of my shifts. I can't say enough about the entire group working there. Feels like a family. I could see myself there long term! Very accommodating management style.
good,I currently keep the office running smoothly on the busiest of days. I take incoming calls and make outgoing calls. The management staff here are great people to work for. They are pretty flexile with your schedule. They are very family oriented company.
good,A typical work day consists of filing client paperwork and keeping track of the daily revenue for the whole office. The best part of the job is interacting with the customers and making sure they have a day filled with as little as stress as possible.
good,I think this is a good place to work. They are very invested in the growing of the employees. They are a top place to work to advance the knowledge of taxes every year. They accommodate your schedule bases on you available time.
good,"good company to work at. everyone is nice and don't get in your business, very comfortable place to go in every morning and make that money. will like to come back."
good,"Great place to work overall.  Very sad that the mortgage industry crashed and they sold Option One.  The pay was great, leads were provided.  They perhaps should have more sales training classes to improve in areas.  It was very sad that they went out of business."
good,Excellent environment to learn more and extended learning in to the world of Taxes. Opportunities for extended learning available at reasonable price for schooling.
good,"H and R Block is a very good company to work with. You earnings are based on how hard you work. The clients are great people and it is a pleasure to help them. The work is seasonal and that can be a great career move. The opportunity to advance is there, you just have to want it."
good,"Working in the tax season is a fast past and can be stressful, however with the people I worked with it was fun.  All instructions were given from the beginning."
good,The atmosphere of H&R Block is laid-back and relaxed. The clients are usually welcoming as well as the other staff members. They are family-oriented and always do their best to help a friend in need.
good,"Every morning I arrive to open the office. I count the till, start up all PC systems, and I change the daily report board. From there I will begin contacting clients on the schedule for the next day to confirm their appointments. Throughout the day I process mail, collect signatures on private tax documents, and take calls and emails to confirm, schedule, and cancel appointments. I assist with walk in clients, and collection of private personal tax information and documents from the clients. "
good,It is a good place to work other than it being seasonal. I would work there all year round if I could and never look for anything else.The people are friendly and it can be a challenge sometimes. Potential to make a good income though
good,"maintain waiting ares"
good,"easygoing, friendly atmosphere, not demanding, good pay and hours, perfect seasonal job, fun staff, job related events, I like it and would recommend especially for someone looking for part time"
good,A typical day would be answering phones and resolving customer issues. The managers always helped in a timely manner. We all had our own space. The hardest part of the job were difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers were happy before the call ended.
good,Answering phone calls making appointments or rescheduling. Checking in clients and letting know the tax pro that there next appointment is here. Some days would be super busy and other would be clam.

good,I find the atmosphere within the office I work to be supportive and encouraging. I enjoy what I do with H & R Block very much. I am fortunate to have had this experience.
good,"I would start my day off by pulling reports and conducting the morning meeting. If there was a deposit to make I would do that. Unlock the front door and greet customers, offering coffee or water to client. When the phones weren't ringing I would be calling previous to schedule appointments and also let them know about current incentives or contests taking place. I would call current appointments to confirm or reschedule them to a tax pro better suited for their needs. If the client wanted a specific tax pro and day I would clear it with the tax pro and manager. I would kook at future booking to make sure I had enough tax pros to cover the shifts."
good,"Nice temporary job"
good,"It's okay. Job security is excellent but you barely receive hours unless it becomes busy, obviously it's a seasonal job but it's very good regardless."
good,"Equipe excelente. Empresa muito boa para trabalhar, me proporcionou um excelente treinamento, sou imensamente grata."
good,"it was a great and fun and it was one of my best jobs since I start working in 2003. I loved my co-workers and supervisor. I like working with computer, using the phone and helping other.

good,"I work in this environment for over 15 years.  A typical day was an office environment, but also different everyday.   It was a wonderful experience where  I was able to interact with different people from the public and the staff and able to assist in many different positions. The hardest part of the job was the seasonal position of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was ability to assist and have different responsibilities in the company. The Management was very helpful about assisting employees to grow in the company."

good,Continued Education Classes is a plus. Yearly reviews and promotions when productivity exceeds pre set standards. Flexible working hours.
good,"I enjoy working for this company; it is my intent to return every year as a part-time seasonal employee.  The hours are flexible.  I meet soooooo many people on a daily basis, and it is fulfilling to assist people who are often frazzled during such a time as tax season.  The atmosphere is professional, yet we work hard as a team of laid back individuals.  It is truly a pleasure to wake up and sing on the way to work!"

good,They Care about the Employee's like family. They want to see you suceed. Co-worker are friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is we can bring our children to work.
good,"As a tax professional, you see a wide variety of tax situations.  I enjoy helping every client find the deductions they were not aware they qualify for. "
good,There is a lot of growth availability in this business but it is something that comes with time. With endless ways to specialize it always gives as a challenge and working and helping people is so rewarding. I do hope to continue down this road till I retire as I have seen so many of my family members do. However it is seasonal so I would like to have a job that I can maintain all year round.
good,"A typical day at work begins with greeting your co-workers and possibly having a cup of coffee (before clocking in). "
good,"This is a great company when you are looking for seasonal work. I learned so much through this job, and I was able to help so many people. Also, I learn a lot for my own personal life in regards to taxes. "
good,"Everyday at work was always different, different groups of people coming in everyday. Its a nice and safe enviornment, the work flow was continuous and consistant. Plenty of room for advacement. i started as a receptionist and quickly got promoted o office anager within 2 years.."
good,People are friendly at H&R Block. There is not much hierarchical system that every employee helps each others. This is my first professional job to expand my knowledge. I interview my client and learn how to organize their folders in a proper form.
good,"Wonderful people to work with.  As an employee, the taxes are done free.  It does get difficult when the phones ring and clients come thru the door at the same time.  Only one computer can take payments but there are two computers to be able to set appointments."
good,"H&R Block is a great company to work for with flexible hours and management. Although the pay could be better, you learn great skills and knowledge in tax preparation and office based skills. H&R Block works with your personal schedule and allows you to advance in the company."

good,I have learned to enhance my skills as a receptionist and an upcoming tax professional. My co-workers are the best. They encourage me to try to advance within this industry.

I have learned that I can really enjoy a job; and it is true what they say ""if you enjoy your work you never have a dreaded Monday feeling""  to me it isn't work, it is fun.  I have been looking for this type of job my whole life.  My manager is great; co-workers are great.  Hardest part of the job is leaving to go home.  Most enjoyable part is answering the phone or meeting clients face to face to schedule or reschedule appointments.  Thanks for giving me a chance!  I love it and will try to go above and beyond my abilities the best I can."

good,"Company having very good culture. Best for freshers.Good exposure for professionals.Friendly environment. Many things to learn link communication etiquette, presentation , how to work in a pressure, conceptual clarity."
good,"I worked here for one tax season, and had a great experience. Very early in the season and at the very end of the season were very busy times due to the early birds and the postponers. Mid-season was very slow, but it also gives time to really connect with clients and coworkers alike. Management was great, as was the regional manager, and you had a great opportunity to move in the company. The hardest part of the job for me was making phone calls to prior clients, some of whom did not have as great an opinion of the company as I did, or reaching clients who were difficult to understand over the phone for any various reason. Also, trying to schedule appointments for tax preparers could sometimes prove tricky. It was otherwise very enjoyable all around."
good,As a tranee I just attending class. I love to study this Tax Course. I'm very glad that I passed the course with flying colours. I'm planning to continue in this field in the future.

good,i had a great time working at h&r block it really kept me busy an i enjoyed what i was doing but i just feel like its time for me to advance to something better
good,"The review is just is a corporate chain and culture. You have to put things in perspective when dealing with a large company. If you want this culture great, if not, it's not for you."
good,"great company, room to move up, friendly staff, understanding reliable management. the only down side is it is seasonal unless you are a pro tax prepare."
good,everyone in the HR Block team that I have come across are very helpful and polite. The office manager is one of the best I have worked with.
good,A typical day is preparing taxes for clients.  I learned so much from the company and the clients.  It was a joy to service the clients and fulfill the tax requirements of clients in need.  The co-workers were all helpful and full of life and energy.  The hardest part of the job was letting people know that they owed and were not getting a return.
good,"I really enjoyed working the public. Attention to detail, answering phones, setting appointments, preparing federal, state, city,school district tax returns."
good,"I have enjoyed learning about Tax Prep. thru H&R Block. They are very patient and knowledgeable. This will be my 8th year working for them. The only problem is that it is seasonable. I wish it were all year round. It would be easier to learn the changes that take place every year with the government. One other problem is that once I decide to quit H&R Block...I am under contract that states I cannot work for another tax facility for 2 years. H&R Block is outstanding with all of the education they offer their employees. They also have a  friendly staff that makes everyone that comes in to get their taxes prepared, comfortable and confidant."
good,I would refer my friends and family! I was treated as one of their valued team members even being a seasonal worker. I am hoping to get the opportunity to return to this office again this year for tax season!
good,"Kaysvile, Ut"
good,"This is my favorite job ive ever had. I get to interact with clients daily in person and on the phone.  They are flexible and generous with hours. I enjoy managing an office. It allows me to organize and rearrange things while i add new profiles and clients into the system. I also learned so much while working there and i cant wait until next year to learn even more. I worked in three separate offices and juggled the hours between the three. I had great supervisors at all three offices and they made me feel so welcome and comfortable it really made my job that much easier. I was very happy to go to work everyday and always expressed that in the way i ran the office. At times things can be stressful, but i found for the most part the clients just misunderstand and get defensive. My job was to calm them down and explain and keep them as a client. Which i found to be quite easy. All in all, this was a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at HR Block as well as the employees and managers.  The job was fairly easy.  I enjoyed speaking with the customers and being able to help them out.
good,Very pleasant experience working for Block.  Friendly staff and easily manageable.  Supervisor was also pleasant and encouraging.
good,Great place to work ad training is provided. You can return every year. It is a great place to advance in the tax world and training is offered at a discounted rate once you are an employee.
good,"With  a vigorous client schedule,  it was challenging but also"
good,H&R Block has been very good to me. I have had a long career with H&R Block and experienced many roles. This has taken me through many exciting changes.
good,"Your experience will vary greatly depending on which branch you work for. Mine has been good. They give you the opportunity to tell them which hours you are available, so you can work around another job if necessary. They have a strong training program and continuing education. Then they pay you more for advancing. It's like getting free college then paying you more because you took advantage of it."
good,I found H&R Block to have been a great learning experience for me as well as a good opportunity for me to grow as a professional in the field of busniess
good,"Hrblock is a great company to work for. The training in is unlimited and there is advancement in the company. I enjoy working with the comany, hrblock is a very flexible company"
good,I really enjoyed the time that I worked for H&R Block my only issue with it is that it is seasonal employment and I was unable to make a living at it I was only compensated 1% and couldn't make any money.
good,I worked as a tax professional and also as a Customer Service Receptionist.  It is a wonderful seasonal position.  Hours are flexible and management is very easy to work with.
good,I truly enjoyed my time working at H&R Block and although the position is seasonal I will reconsider applying for the nest tax season.
good,The people are what it is all about at H&R Block.  The customers and the employees make this experience very worthwhile.  A typical day would be helping people to answer questions about their financial situations.
good,Slow on incoming clients. How to manage time in a crowded situation. Coworkers here took the time to teach you your job not just tell you your job. Hardest about it was dealing with difficult clients. Being able to know you helped someone do their return and watch there face light up if receiving a refund.
good,A typical day at work was keeping everything very orginized and confiming all appointments at least three days in advance. The Highest professionalism of custome service I have ever learned and I am very greatful to have learned and I can carry it with me everywhere.

good,I enjoyed meeting and working with the skilled staff as they delivered an excellent service to clients.The company offers necessary training for advancement.
good,"I would start my day by clocking in and checking appointments for the day and getting paperwork together. Then taking calls and in my free time I would straighten up the office. I learned a few things about taxes while working here. My manager was an extremely nice woman, she seemed frantic at times so I took it upon myself to make sure everything in the office was at ease to keep her at peace. There were two other receptionists that worked at different times as me. I was really close with one. We would meet up and take lunches together and she would give me advice on life. The hardest part about this job was to just make sure you knew what to say when the mystery callers call in to test you. The most enjoyable part of this job was when I helped market at events."
good,"The obvious con here is working for a naturally occurring temporary company and, subsequently, most positions are seasonal. This notwithstanding, it's a great place to work, the management is sound, the opportunity for advancement is there (if you don't mind seasonal, though there are full time positions, too) and they take good care of their employees. Definitely one of the better companies I've worked for, and if I find full time position, I'll stay as long as I can. Compensation could be bumped up a little and I'd be happier, but it's not bad, either."
good,"Preparing taxes for clients, data entry, working on my own, and able to ask questions if needed."
good,"I love working for the owner, she is so smart and intuitive.  The people are the greatest. The respect and integrity that H&R Block provides is stellar.  The worst part is the pay is not the greatest to start.  Once you become a tax pro you can work on your book of business so you can work as hard as you want."
good,They are really friendly and a fun work environment. I am on the call floor taking clients calls of questions about their account balance or their card is not working ect. or just go over the clients tax return fees with the client
good,The offices are like teams and the majority of the people really do care.  This has been a wonderful experience for me personally and I do not see myself leaving this company.  The managers are supportive and it is a constantly changing environment where you get to learn as well as grow.
good,Opened and closed the office. Cash handling. Scheduling and confirming appts. The one thing that was challenging for me was the cash handling and balancing the drawer. But former CSPs and TPs were very helpful. A great part time job.
good,"You meet a lot of new people and customer service is Number 1.  You Schedule appointments, check people in when they arrive and let the person they are seeing know they are there.  You collect payment for services.  The people in my offices are wonderful and I really enjoy working with all of them."
good,The culture is very unique with mentor and office manager support. Always strive to do the best for the guest and the right thing.
good,"Office busy greeting walk in clients and appointments.  Making sure all preparers have the necessary forms to prepare taxes.  Make copies, answer telephones, make sure documents and identification is current to pick up mail or checks in office.  Receive payment for services rendered."

good,"*Answering phone"
good,"Enjoyed company trainings, very informative. Company ethics are the tops. Client relations are excellent, can help a client through small or large financial advice."
good,I very much enjoyed doing taxes and meeting new people. In a typical day I would meet about one hundred people sometimes more. There were times when I would have to go through a box of reciepts and sort and decide what could be claimed and what could'nt .All in all I enjoyed the work.

All of the co-workers worked together.  I also managed the office on an as needed basis, worked during the summer when requested."
good,"I complete the tax return of individuals which I find to be very fun, not only because of the enjoyment that the work brings me but also because the people I work with in the office are very supportive. The hardest part of this position is gaining any further advancement within the company."
good,Management and co-workers were great to work with. Really enjoyed working with clients and co-workers.  Typical day would be scheduling and confirming appointments. Receipting in payments and making deposits.

good,"There is no typical day here. I learned that you have to adjust to the different kinds of pace needed.  Sometimes you have to go fast sometime slow, it just depends.  The management was great.  My co-workers were awesome.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the law changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is how well everyone gets along with each other. This is a place of real teamwork."
good,"H&R Block was a great place of work. My co-workers were so easy to get along with, they never made me feel uncomfortable when i first started working there. The management was great. I love the owners and my manager!"

good,"enjoyed working for this company"

good,"I really enjoy working for H&R Block technical support. We have training as soon as new aspects of the job occur, very supportive management, and a wide variety of shifts. Coworkers all help each other out, very handy if you're new. Only difficult part of the job is assisting callers who are not computer literate. As all of the callers are coworkers there is less stress since almost all of them behave professionally."
good,"Helping clients in many ways."
good,"This job provided a challenge everyday, I love to be challenged and to learn new task. It provided a new task everyday that allowed me to gain more knowledge and experience in the position."

good,"This is now my second year here at H&R Block and to tell you the truth I have never loved a job more than this one, and trust me, I've had my fair share of jobs!! I absolutely love it from beginning of my shift til the very end! Comfortable environment with the friendlist of friendly co-workers and even the clients make me smile ( or get frightened ) haha overall fun work and great place to work for with so many benefits and added quirks each year! I even get extra pocket money for doing different things around the office like cleaning or being helpful!! GREAT JOB ALL AROUND! WOULD RECOMMEND ANYBODY WHO ENJOYS LIGHT CLERICAL DUTIES AND GREAT ENVIRONMENT TO APPLY WHEN POSSIBLE!! :)"
good,"I really enjoy working here, my co-workers are super sweet people and we make a great team. I stay busy with greeting clients, taking information, filing, answering the phones and scheduling appointments."
good,"H&R Block is a enjoyable place to work. Very busy during peak time. Co-workers are usually very friendly. Sometimes you may have to deal with rude clients, but most clients are friendly and understanding. I enjoy helping clients and making their tax preparations a little easier"
good,Open and run daily reports. End of day close out. Preparing taxes and assisting clients in understanding their tax situations. Multiple phone lines. Meeting and greeting clients.
good,One of the best jobs that I have had in my life.  I feel completely comfortable with the staff and the customers through the years that I have been there
good,The proprietor is helpful and patient. The manager is pleasant and attentive. From the first day you feel welcomed and one of them.
good,my day at work was putting out all signs before opening. i would answer phones and make appointments for customers made sure all customers were taken care of. i learned great customer service and how to do typical office work the management team were awesome really taught me everything i needed to know. i couldn't have asked for better co-workers they were always willing to help. the hardest part of the job was during peak times when it was real busy but i got the hang of everything. the most enjoyable part was helping the clients with the questions and the people that i worked with. it actually was my favorite job so far
good,"A very productive H&R Block franchise office operated under Walker Financial Services, LLC."
good,Very good company  Management is very co-operative .we were like a family.
good,"A typical day in a tax office is busy. Files must be sorted and secured, schedule client appointments, and handle all client payments. The phone is constantly ringing, as people always want to make sure they know the cost of services and when to expect their tax refund. I field a lot of questions to ensure tax preparers have more time with their client, unless it is an in-depth question that only a licensed tax pro can answer. Our office, under new management, opened for the first time this year. I had the privilege of being the primary daytime receptionist. The job is not always easy, as some clients are not always happy about their refund. With the tax laws constantly changing, refund amounts vary each year based on a number of factors that clients don't often consider. The job is also rewarding, as many clients depend on their refund to pay additional bills or purchase larger items, like new vehicles. The staff and owners are very kind and easy to work with. I learned a lot about customer service and built on skills I already possessed. I completed online training in order to continue employment. The training was very easy to complete. I enjoyed working for this company. Although I am a seasonal employee, I am cleared to take other jobs, and will resign my position if an opportunity presented itself that met the financial and scheduling needs of my family."
good,Keep you current with the tax law changes.  Every year you have to take courses to be rehired.  Some of your co-wokers your become friends.  Explaining the process of the tax return to a client and telling them the important of good record keeping.  Working according to your schedule when you have full time job.
good,"I have worked at H&R Block for several years.  The reason I chose them was their extensive training requirement, as I want to work at places that are reputable."
good,One of the three offices I have worked for was very professional.  The other two had staffing issues.  The office managers set the tone for the office.
good,"Answered phones, set appointments, confirmed previously set appointments. Made tax packets or tax professionals, file completed tax info. Assisted office and district managers in any additional tasks they needed."
good,Meet people from all walks of life and financial siutations.
good,my only complaint is that this job is only available through tax season
good,I enjoy customer service because I am able to help and assist individuals with their needs also handle any type of questions or concerns they may have. And I enjoy this profession.
good,I enjoyed this job so much because the hours were very flexible and it allowed me to continue going to college while working a full-time job. I learned from customer service that customers will come in with different attitudes and it was my job to make them feel comfortable enough that they would leave the office smiling and happy because of my co-workers. 
good,"Review of things to do list, accounts payables and receivables including greeting clients and answering phones as well as other duties assigned to me. Worked with Principal of office at the end of work regarding everyday office issues. "
good,Every day is different.The office manager was always more than willing to share new information and assist each employee in being the best they could be. 
good,A fantastic place to work.  Unfortunately after tax season work does slow down and low seniority people are laid off.
good,Enjoyed working for the company. Became good friends with co workers.
good,"My day starts with clients at the door waiting to get their tax returns process.  I usually process anywhere from 1- 12 returns a day depending on the complexity of that return.  In my down time I am calling clients to set appointments to follow up on returns and to answer questions about those returns.  My co-workers are fantastic and fun to work with as helpful, when their is an issue that needs help resolving, the office leader is always there. The hardest part about my job is not being able to get money for my clients but in turn they have to pay and the most enjoyable part is when a client is satisifed with my work"
good,"I work here year round.  We do employ seasonal tax pros that I have a major hand in training and getting them ready for tax season.  I also am in charge of the office setup for our 5 offices.  During off season there are about 5 employees that work together mostly under my supervision with the franchise owner.  We do work long hours and every day during the first four months of the year.  After that we are fortunate enough to have some down time.  I've learned alot working with this company over the past 13 years, I enjoy advancing in the company."
good,"Exciting, busy, long hours due to tax season crunch. Hardest part of job was its software."
good,Besides the fact that this company only runs during tax season and the pay is low everything else is great.
good,"Lots of multi-tasking, clients are very friendly."
good,"HR Block was a great place to learn the ins and outs of the brokerage industry, Excellent management team."
good,"Interview customers for tax preparation. Meet a lot of different people. Great co-workers, always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,typical day is just making appointments. i learned taxes. management is great. co workers fun to be around. hardest part of my job is to learn taxes. most enjoyable is laid back
good,H and R Block is a wonderful company to work for. Every coworker I have is extremely knowledgeable and kind. I enjoy the challenges and fast pace of the beginning of tax season and the constant buzz of customers. Each return is vastly different and I meet many new people from all different walks of life on a daily basis.
good,Quiet calm environment
good,"H&R Block is a great place to work if you like numbers and helping people out. The environment in the office I work in is great because of my coworkers. We all work as a team to meet our office goals and to get as many people in the office as we possibly can. This company has some of the best management out there. The hardest part of the job is managing the volume of tax returns that come in at peek hours but it is very enjoyable to meet the many people that walk through the doors. Also, the seasoned tax pros offer tons of help and everyone's knowledge of anything tax related is always shared amongst tax pros."
good,"A typical day as a CSP includes answering all incoming calls, scheduling appointments, greeting clients and walk ins, matching new clients to the proper tax preparers and fulfilling all basic office work."
good,Classroom or online training is the most up to date in the industry. You are able to go as far as you can with the company if you desire. Very flexablw work hours.
good,I loved being on the phone and doing desktop support. I love helping end users solve thier problems. I love being detailed orientated and useing my comunication skills as well as being multitasked.
good,My first year was great with applying my Tax knowledge. I show up to work and have a full day booked then finish my day in another office to get the hours I desired. The Co-workers were a great help always ready to answer questions and help me solve problems beyond my level. The hardest part of the job was remember all the tax information and the most enjoyable part of the job was the closeness and familiarity of the staff with each other.
good,I work in H&R Block for 3 season. I learn how to do tax return and how to work in an office. I good relations with my co-workers. I learn that I enjoy doing taxes.

good,"I love working for this company. Working in an office gives you the ability to become friends with your coworkers. Some of the time, those friends become family. HR Block is a company that is fair, family oriented and puts their clients and employees first!"
good,This job was by far my favorite. I loved the people I worked with and for. With hard work it was extremely easy to move forward with this company. The hardest part of the job would be working late hours. My most enjoyable times were all the games we played to make the office more productive on our goals.
good,I have learned so much there. Very busy place to work for. but at the same time you learn too.
good,"Typical day involves helping clients prepare their taxes, learning more about tax laws. A friendly environment."
good,"Its a pretty basic format job. come in, sit at your desk, and begin. The customer is what really makes the job tho. Seeing them stop by at their convenience due to their work/family schedules.

good,learning about taxes was a great experican greeting customers and preparing taxes
good,.
good,H&R Block provides excellent training and advancement opportunities for advancement.
good,"I worked a seasonal position as an Assistant Manager. My day consist of daily greetings to all employees, and clients/customers."
good,My office is a fun place to work. The people that I work with are all team spirited. Since we get very busy everyone there is not afraid to do a little extra to help out. The manager is always available to answer questions & give everyone a pat on the shoulder for the hectic and precise work we have to do. The hardest part of the job is some of our clients who get upset or who try to cheat on their taxes.But the best part of the job is when someone comes in thinking they're going to owe taxes and I'm able to get them a refund. The joy in their faces & the hugs I get make it all worthwhile.
good,"Great place to work, very flexible, you control your success"
good,"I got a great education from H&R Block, met amazing people and loved working for them. But I only worked for 1 season in 2008 and I gave 2 to Management as when it was very busy time in February and I could make money my office manager just never called me though I have an accounting education and any tax return would be easy for me. At the same time new 1st year professionals who came with me to that office but belonged to some definite group of population - got hours every day and made pretty good money. I do not want to discourage you as it is really a great place to work."
good,Typical work day was smooth
good,"The company gives lot of opportunity to learn. During our tax session, we meet different persons with different backgrounds. I love to work with people."
good,loved this job even though it was only seasonal. wished they were a year round employer for tax preparers.
good,This Job keeps you well informed and advanced.
good,"A typical day consisted of greating clients, making appointments, keeping the client area clean,being helpful and answering questions."
good,"The day-to-day business was always busy and face paced. I'd learned how to work with the public and how to anticipate their needs while listening for needs and following their cues. Management was not very supportive, but they did offer/provide opportunities for positive competition to excell or exceed our goals. The people I worked with and who'd worked for me were great people who were always willing to help and go the extra mile to work with their clients. The hardest part of this position was management support. When client resolution went beyond my power of assistance, they often dropped the ball. When I had, although it was rare, disciplinary actions with employees, upper management was not supportive or was not proactive. But, the most enjoyable part of my job was working with our clients and helping each tax professional grow."
good,"Somedays were very busy, but with the friendly staff we were able to make oit through without being stressed."
good,"I answer phones schedule appointments, filed the tax returns. I learned how to interact with people. The manager was great. In the office I worked in it was like a family. The hardest part of my job was to tell the customer that they were not getting there check due they owed the irs. Coming to work and interacting with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"You are able to work with an amazing team of people. It is a wonderful company to get started and grow with. Often promotions are done from within and the company is driven to grow its employees and grow their business. The people that work for this company truly ""bleed green"""
good,Very Busy interacting with over 100 clients using the calling queues.
good,I loved the people I worked with and they really worked with thier employes so that we could provide great opportunities to the public.
good,"Very fast paced environment open primarily during tax season Jan - Apr so it could be full time or part time if you work elsewhere. Options for greeting clients and checking them in to tax professional to office manager. Very flexible working around family life and as long as you are a good worker you will be called back year after year. Probably the best perk is once you are an employee, you can have your taxes prepared for free!! I can't wait for next January!!!!!"
good,"i enjoyed my working with my co-workers, also enjoyed the fact that the schedule is very flexiable..just wish it was a year round job for CSP, but due to taxes for the majority of the public CSP are only needed for a short time frame."
good,"I would come in at 9am and make coffee, start confirming appointments and answering any incoming calls. When someone wanted to schedule an appointment i would enter Data in the computer. Hardest part of the job was sitting all day."
good,"Tax preparers meet one-on-one with clients, allowing us to access the financial situation of clients and discuss future tax saving actions. The best part of working at HR Block is that they employ very knowledgable tax preparers, so when a unique situation arises there is always someone to answer your questions. The management is very responsive to your family life and allows you to pretty much dictate your own schedule. The hardest part of the job is dealing with nasty clients. It is hard to be patient, and if it gets difficult someone in the office will usually step in and try to difuse the situation."
good,I love working for H&R Block because we not only strive to provide great customer service but the company strives to provide a relaxing environment for the employees as well.
good,"It really depends on the office, but mine was great. I was sad to leave at the end of the season (but planning on coming back next year). The office is full of smart, hard-working professionals that are the best at what they do. The company has a solid reputation and works hard to maintain customer trust and loyalty. It's a great place to work, with an atmosphere of recognition and tons of opportunities to learn and advance. One of the best jobs I've ever had!"
good,"The company culture is very relaxed and flexible, as tax season gets very hectic therefore they allow you personal time off when needed and have flexible hours that meet your availability."
good,Professional friendly atmosphere with room for advancement
good,"I love working here, especially for just a little extra during the tax season. This was perfect for me to have an extra job for a few months."
good,Company has been in business since the early 1900's and is a good company to work for.
good,H&R Block has been providing tax services for over 50yrs. Their level of expertise is not comparable to the so called competition. I have been a Client Service Professional (Front Desk) for 10 tax seasons (Dec - April). I continue to come back as I enjoy my co-workers & those we serve. Free Second Looks!!! We find the $$ others missed.
good,"If your looking for a career in tax law H&R Block is the best place to start. I recently taken a Individual Tax class at my local college the book they used mingled individual and small business tax together confusing everyone including me and I have several years of tax law under my belt (good thing I did).H&R Block has mastered the market on teaching all kinds of tax law they break it down into individual classes and you learn about one area at a time such as individual, small business, farms, self employed, corporations, out of state, ect. One advantage of working for Block is when your ready to move on and add another area of tax law they train you for free and very thoroughly. Another advantage is the professionals that are teaching you are your area supervisors and are there to help you. Plus Block stands behind everything you write, your not on your own."
good,"Salary was as promised going into the position, and I was hired on a part-time basis. Great culture, and good management; I would recommend others to apply."
good,Clients become your once a year friends always feels good when you connect with your clients   Hours are available if you want to work extra and advancement is always encouraged
good,No one watching over your shoulder. Team work. They give you your work and if you have questions they are there. Otherwise everyone is doing their own thing. Good fun place to work.
good,I work for a franchise of block so its different than the corporate branches a lil bit and  im a seasonal worker thats kinda tough.  However all continuing education is paid for by my employer also they pay a commission and it increases as u build clientel as well as when u build ur credintials! I get yo help people who dont have time to study tax law and theory its Awesome!
good,personally have enjoyed my and learned so much from working in a tax office. management and office owner have been nothing but great to work for! very comfortable and enjoyable work environment
good,"I loved this job. I could have a life outside of work. Great hours to work! I really enjoyed working for H&R Block, if I could I would return. The pay is awesome and the people were great!"
good,"The job is what you make it honestly they don’t force you to do anything your pay is determined how much you want to give to it. Consider it full time seasonal in 3.5 months you can make 3,000-20,000+ depending on you alone. Plenty of room for advancement if that’s what you’re looking for."
good,Good place to gain knowledge and experience but compensation needs to be improved.  Allowed to work with minimal management input.  Co-workers willing to help out each other with issues.
good,Well you have to go to school so you can learn about taxes. An you have to make sure you get a 80% overall average. But you are also given the opportunity to either do front desk  or to do taxes. It's amazing place to work

good,"They are a good company to work with."
good,"Great co-workers and good location = good clients. "
good,"I had unlimited support from my colleagues, anyone would be willing to help me in an instant if i asked them. The only thing I would say is a con is you start to feel used in your availability time. Once you start they want more and more from you. It is common for the company to lose employees as the season progresses either because it is too much stress or life events happen."
good,happy to be apart of a family for soooooo long and in soooooo many different places with lots of interesting people with varied backgrounds and charisma
good,I loved my job at Ivyside plaza. They are the best people ever. Recommend anyone to work there with the Ivyside Crew. This job is seasonal so that is the only downfall to it but it is also a good thing for those who want to excel in a higher field.

Every day has been an learning experience and I am very grateful for the opportunity.

good,"Receptionist at the regional district office H&R Block. A key player in the branches organizational structure, helping out with administrative tasks, preparing the files for the tax pros, dealing with the inflow of walk-in customers and bookings of appointments."
good,"This was a major step up for me. I was happy with how much I got to learn and do.  My fellow associates were very helpful, and I like how I got to return the favor. There is some downsides. Getting in touch with the Office Manager was a bit hard due to them needing to often deal with other offices. Also, it's a seasonal job where you will need to reapply,  so you getting the job back is no guarantee.I hope I can get back in."
good,Loved it here ! Great opportunity for Someone just starting ! Always up to date training! You’ll always be learning and becoming a better receptionist with this position!
good,I have had the pleasure to be both a manager and tax preparer with Block. The training and continued training is bar none. Going into my 10th year and have no intention of stopping. Gives you the ability to work full time or part time depending on your schedule and if you have a full time job elsewhere.
good,Good atmosphere and co-workers. Small staff of friendly folks willing to share knowledge to get all the work done for clients. Helpful and down to earth-
good,Great company to work for! Fast paced work environment because it is seasonal but it is a great team. Everyone is like a family if you need help they all have your back.
good,I really have enjoyed my Time at this company even though it was only temporary I will miss my fellow coworkers. They gave me a chance and I will ne forever grateful
good,Good opportunities to start up your career. You can understand the working environment and customs from the job. The working time can be scheduled flexibly.
good,"The office where I worked was small, and I only saw about 3 or 4 of my coworkers daily. A typical day at work included answering phones, making calls, filing paperwork and booking appointments. I had a great manager who was always there to help whenever I needed it. She answered any question that I had and was always ready and willing to help. She was a great leader. While working there, I really felt like I was a part of the team and the workplace culture is very familial. I thoroughly enjoyed working here."
good,relaxed environment with professional staff. Great training and opportunities to learn and grow/advance in career through seminars hosted/taught by HR Block.
good,H&R Block give you all the tools you need to grow and level up to the next tax level and they have tax pro's that will help you out when needed. A great place to work and learn. Will be taking classes this summer to get ready for the next level.
good,This office is part of a franchise. The owner is a nice guy. He is positive and easy to talk to. I enjoy working here. The manager is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The other tax preparers in this office (and in other offices if you need to call) are very helpful as well. I have learned a lot about tax law and finances.
good,"Environment is stable place to work, staff is awesome. clients are generally friendly, trying to help a client with special situations is a feeling that makes one content they are able to do what is needed for a satisfied customer"
good,"This was my first season as a CSP with H&R Block and I loved it. The team was great and extremely helpful our office manager is an angel, she is the most kind and honest person I have ever met. I couldn't have asked for a better team, unfortunately I had to leave early due to another job opportunity, but if I can go back next season I definitely will."
good,"Depending on the time of year, a day can be laid back or going at 110 miles an hour. Both have their pros & cons. There is always something new to learn. The management & workplace culture are both awesome!! At least in my district, they are. The hardest part of the job can be when a client doesn't have a good outcome. The most enjoyable part is when a client has a good, or better than they expected, outcome. I enjoy working with numbers & people so this job is great for me!!"
good,"I am currently working at H&R Block in Maumelle as a Seasonal Client Service Professional (CSP). While at first, it was a little overwhelming because I was still getting use to the work pace and environment, it has definitely become one of the best places I have worked at. Before you start the job, you will get a chance to meet the District Manager through a paid training. They also have an app ""Block Academy"" which allows employees to see what trainings they need to complete or trainings that they can do. There's also room for advancement and the people around you are also pushing for you to grow and go on to the next level. "
good,its a good job daily we strive for revenue we strive to provide exceptional customer service quality .most enjoyable part is helping and educating our clients
good,"I Love the company and the environment, just wish it wasn’t seasonal. It’s hard to take care of a family on a seasonal job, it makes me feel unstable during the summer months ."
good,A typical day involves preparing income tax returns for individuals that can involve a wide variety of topics. I learned that people trust and appreciate a knowledgeable individual who can help them get or save money. The management is always very helpful and responsive to tax preparer needs.  The workplace culture is very professional and customer satisfaction oriented. The hardest part of the job is informing the tax payer that they have a balance due to the IRS. The most enjoyable part is informing the tax payer that they have a refund coming or in helping them to resolve an issue with the IRS.
good,"wonderful staff."
good,"Opening office ensuring file cabinets are open, login appointment screen. Set coffee out for clients, make sure copier and fax machines are well stocked with paper. Answer calls, take messages, put clients in contact with tax pro's with inquires about filing taxes or just general questions. Process payments, file away clients confidential information, update Hold drawer through the use of Excel. Greet all clients and employees as they enter office. Maintain the inner and outer office area for cleanliness. Keep break area and restroom clean as well."
good,HR Block is a very nice place to work. I enjoy the people and the management. The job is easy and pleasant. The other employees are very easy to get along with.
good,Love working with the company. I have room for growth and the staff is amazing. I would recommend working for this company. It also allows for you to meet people from different walks of life
good,My manager is spectacular. Always willing to teach and coach through any situation. Runs a very organized office. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.
good,"Hands down this was one of the best places I have ever worked. Management was awesome, work/life balance was on point, salary/benefits/bonuses were almost always great. I really have no complaints about working here and would go back to working for them in a heart beat."
good,Working for H & R block felt like I was apart of a family. Everyone was supportive and there if you had any questions or needed help what so ever. I was proud to work there.
good,Wonderful employees and just an all around great atmosphere. It’s a very friendly environment and they’re always helping and supporting each other in any way they can.
good,"Even though I feel they could pay more, I really enjoyed working there! I loved the people I worked with, I returned to work another 5 seasons! However, if you want to eat or take a break you only do it when there is time. Unless you're a tax pro. They usually if they can, put in their appointment manager time for lunch and such. I liked how the training went, it wasn't super difficult, and everyone was really nice and helped each other."
good,"It was a great place to work. It was fun, and easygoing. They were very appreciative, and took the time to notice what you did for them. I would love to work there again."
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet clients as they came and offer them coffee, answering phones and scheduling appointments, pulling files for the next day, collecting payments and checking clients out as they were leaving. The hardest part of my job was when 3 calls came in at same time as I was greeting clients and checking clients out. Lots of multi tasking. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and keeping the waiting room in good spirits. I enjoyed my coworkers which we worked well together."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent working for H&R Block.  I had been placed in a smaller location with just a few Tax Advisors so the environment was very relaxed and worthwhile.  They were all very helpful and it was easy to do the job duties.  There was a good number of slow days but that was expected.
good,"I absolutely loved working at h and r block here in Sparta, NC. The owner is always busy but still makes a way for her clients. The manager is so friendly soon as you walk thru the door you’ll ALWAYS hear “Hey, how are you?” We try to serve the best with the best prices! Come check us out!"
good,"Great place to work, I love making our clients happy. Nice office environment, and fun co-workers. Nice atmosphere and the office is nice and clean. I love the hours too!"
good,H&R Block 's work environment is personalize. Everyone made me feel very welcomed and it was more as if we were (and still are even after I left) family. There was never a dull moment and one is constantly learning due to the different needs of clients. Overall H&R Block was a wonderful place to work.
good,"H&R Block is and can be a very busy at times especially in the evenings. At times it was stressful when businesses would walk in with all of their documents and not enough tax pro at the time of their visit. But, most of them would just drop off their papers and we would call them to pick up or for any additional questions. I love the people I worked for and the manager was awesome. Always thoughtful of his employer's and would treat us at time to Dunkin Donuts or lunch. It was very enjoyable to be a part of the H&R Block family. NO REGRETS...!!"
good,"This was a temp position, Seasonal during tax time. Relaxed atmosphere. I handled the front. Answer phones, Schedule appointments. Make copies or run errands for tax preppers"
good,"Seasonal  extra income. Training was great. Explore as a new career option. Meeting new people each day and new co workers, Great boss and mentor. We keep in touch"
good,This was one of the hardest working and fun jobs I have had. There was hardly a dull moment all tax season! The hours were long all season but it was almost always a good time.
good,"If you do your job well, then you get rewarded.  You also get recognized by the company and your manager.  If you are a Tax Pro, you get more hours and more days per week, but you do have to retain a certain amount of clients to be able to keep your salary from the year before.  I enjoy what I do there and will continue with H&R Block until I find a year-round position with another company."
good,"I enjoy working at H&R Block. I get to meet new people everyday and I like working with numbers so this is the perfect opportunity to do just that. Although it is a seasonal job, it gives me spending money during the season or money that I can use for vacation each year."
good,Great Job it is seasonal so extra money you can count on for a short period of time.  You can stay at one office and grown clients.  Fun co workers everyone is helpful
good,"Loved working at H&R Block.  Had a great manager and loved all my peers!  The work was face paced at times, but workable.  I enjoyed the commendatory with the tax analyst, and learned some tax stuff I can use in the future.  "
good,"the fast work pace made it quick to learn."
good,"I worked for the Best people and worked with the Best people. I was there in Geneseo, NY @ H & R Block and loved every minute of it. I made many good friends that  we would come in every year. It broke my heart when I had to leave. I did stay on for 2 more years,but it was to far to go. I learned how to do my job in a timely manner. The job culture was great, we all got along, well most of us. We all took a turn and baked and brought it in to share. It was hard to have a bad day there. The hardest part of  mym job was explaining  why a agent was still working with their client and making them wait. They just didn't understand that the agent would  spend that much time with them if  that is what  they needed.  One of the best parts of my job was seeing all the people every year."
good,"I absolutely loved working at H&R Block!  The only thing I didn't like is that it was a Seasonal Job and not enough opportunities to get the education they want you to get through their systems.  I've tried several times without success.  What I loved the most was actually working with our clients to get the best outcome for them, even when it didn't turn out in their favour, I worked hard to make the experience a positive one."
good,Meeting new people and helping them get the most for their money. Representing the company and helping the community. Getting to meet people and making an impression for them to return next year.
good,"I was hoping to be able to work more hours, but based on the tax preparer experience I was not able to work the hours I needed. It was a good work experience over all."
good,"Our location was a great place to work. All tax pros are helpful and very knowledgable. Manager there is the best ever. Peak weeks get stressful because it becomes even more fast-paced, but over-all good work environment."
good,"I love doing taxes, so this is a great job. The pay is great once you put a few years in and become an Enrolled Agent. It is wonderful meeting with clients year after year"
good,"I was a front desk Administrative Assistant. I was expected to set schedules and answer phones. I loved getting to know my team and trying to make their days run smoothly. They rehired me to help set up the office and train new people after my first season. I enjoyed being left with my tasks and just opperating the whole place open to close, getting coffee for my coworkers and writing them messages. I will greatly miss my coworkers there."
good,"I learned a lot about taxes and customer service while working at H&R Block. I scheduled appointments, answered phones and ran errands. I enjoyed helping my coworkers and the customers the most."
good,Working for H&R Block was great! I had a great box and was flexible with me. This was a great opportunity and I learned a lot. I would recommend this company to anybody.
good,"Must be an independent self reliant worker, and sales promoter of additional products. You learn a great deal about tax law and preparing accurate returns as well as excellent client service is required, great for a people person. The clients are the most enjoyable part of the job, no manager in office to look over you, and you set your own hours to work. Lots of training every year without compensation is the drawback."
good,"Very productive and client-oriented environment.  I enjoy the tax professional-client relationship.  The opportunity to meet people of different race/religious, has been an awarding experience. Working at H & R Block provides you with the skills and ability to grow your clients."

good,"H&R is a fun place to work at. You meet different people daily, The management is great, friendly and always willing to help you out even on their days off. Fellow employees are all willing to help each other out, this is a team orientated environment."
good,They welcome you with open arms. The company trains well and accommodate you in any needs. For a seasonal job the pay is great and the hours are amazing. Management can use a little more support from DM but overall amazing place and good company to work for.
good,It is hands on learning process with public tax return filing. The learning level is high and fast. Management support is awesome. All associates and the leader help you to learn and do it right from the beginning.
good,"A typical workday as a CSP (Client Service Professional) consists of Answering client inquiries whether it be in person, online, or over the phone. I like to keeping a clean, organized, and alphabetized workspace. In addition I set schedules, driving sales, take transactions, and record information. I choose which hours I work and how often. I learned how to be the best I can be in the customer service industry. Unfortunately the training has changed drastically since I started working for them. When I started the training was live with the CSP lead in charge but now they are mostly computer training courses with the very basics one needs to work efficiently. Every year about November H&RBlock requires all of it's employees, first years and returning employees, to take the training courses. YOu can develope your expertise at your own pace, whether you are a first year or five year tax pro you can develop your knowledge the way you want to. The best part of the job for me is the people. All of the employees and the clients take care of eachother and are the best people to be around. I will keep coming back to work for H&RBlock as long as I can. They are amazing."

Calling clients to get them to schedule an appointment, checking the files and drop-offs that clients leave for the tax professionals to work; administrating paperwork for the client to complete, handling payment transactions and interacting with the clients.  Giving any information the client might inquire about.  The culture is very diverse and I love that.  The hardest part of the job  "
good,"I love my job here, plain and simple.  My only complaint is the positions are largely seasonal.  Good managers, good people, good work that feels like it has a purpose and I always feel accomplished.  There is also a course offered every year between tax season to train new tax professionals, and employees get the course for free"
good,"Its a good job for 4 and a half months a year. Does get stressful, as can most accounting jobs. Lots of laws and regulations to learn and share with your clients."
good,The working environment is laid back and intense at times. Being in a tax office during peak is very busy and a bit hectic but during slower times there is a very easy going atmosphere. Our boss is one of a kind in her leadership and knowledge.

good,"This is a wonderful place to work. I love my Co-Workers and my job. Easy Going, as long as you do your job. There are really busy days, and some slow days, and then some between. I did have to deal with some conflicts, but normally the manager or one of the most experienced Tax Pros would take over for me and deal with it themselves. This is a great job for someone who needs extra money, and they will work around your work schedule If you have another job. It is a seasonal job and after peak, your hours will go down, and then in early-mid April the job will end. I do recommend a job with H&R Block. they will get you the most money back, and help you if you have any questions, or issues. They are good with IRS letters that you might get.

good,"Every client has different life story, to create a beneficial Tax Return for the client, dig their life story by asking so many question and keep record of necessary documents, during interview with the client time management is most important so consider time management also. Hardest part to encourage for the savings and the most enjoyable part when they received a good return, i can not explain the happiness of their faces."
good,"This is a temporary job, but it has been a professional environment with cooperative coworkers.  The hiring process was intense.  It went smoothly and I learned a bit. I would be happy to work here again any tax season."

good,"Work independently under supervision"
good,Great place to work. Especially if you are self motivated.  HR Block allows you to build your clients. You get the chance to help people prepare their tax return. You are also in a position to show them what to do in future years to insure they get a return and not owe federal or state taxes the legal way.
good,I would get in early wait on customers and do taxes all day. My employers were nice to work for they were fair and balanced. Dealing with the IRS was most difficult.
good,"I'm a lifer. They are awesome, very flexible and I'm able to fit in the work to other work schedule (s). I have been working for them since I was 19 and they are super reliable as an employer."
good,"Great Job, Great Training, to Bad It;s Seasonal, enjoyed the positive environment, upper management is great and encouraging finding ways to help you learn and build your career and clients.

People who have been there many years, and who have a good client basis receive good compensation, depending on their level.  The more you market yourself, the more clientele you will build.

The management I worked for were AMAZING and I would recommend working for this company if you are looking to advance your career as a tax professional.

A typical day for work is calling appointments that have not been confirmed, helping walk ins, connecting with customers, helping them complete their taxes and educate them on benefits, deductions, credits, and the like that they can qualify for and giving them tips for next year.  I have learned so much before employment and on the job from the senior tax pros.  Everyone is always available to help me if I need it and we all help one another on a difficult return to ensure a clients satisfaction.

good,"There really is no typical day at work. Everyday there is a new task at hand. You can do simple tax returns then instantly be thrown into one that you have no clue about. You have to keep your cool and just work your way through the situation. I have learned patience, and that every situation has a way to be solved. Our management is hard to explain. With a new manager on hand she is still learning so we have multiple people trying to help run the office. My co-workers and I have been self running the office for over a year and we have become a family that can make sure everything runs smoothly.

good,"I have no complaints about HRB; the rather modest starting hourly wage is arguably compensated for by possibilities for commissions on sales of products and services and for potential advancement and, as I recall, free advanced training.

I have some lasting friendships with coworkers as well as some managers. The hardest part of this job was trying to keep clients happy if they had to wait to see their tax preparer and judging how long of a wait it might be. The best was getting to know the returning clients and seeing them year after year.1500"

The most enjoyable part was hearing how clients valued and appreciated the way their tax professionals handled their situation."
good,"I absolutely loved working for H&R Block! I was hired for the Client Service Professional/ Receptionist position. They have a very unique hiring process that requires a significant amount of online training courses. As a new hire you are tasked with a check list of assignments to complete. They provide their employees with all the necessary resources to help them take control of their own success. The online courses allow you to train yourself independently so you really need to develop a strong sense of self discipline and accountability. Each training course has a test at the end and once you pass you are awarded a certificate of completion. I personally felt that I gained a sense of accomplishment every time I passed a course. It was such an effective way to motivate my self confidence and prepare me for the job I was hired to do. I've never seen a company offer so many opportunities for empowerment. It's your responsibility to achieve success H&R block provides you with the tools you need to reach your goals!  They offer flexibility, support and encouragement. You also have the ability to choose your own hours and adjust your ""commitment"" whenever you want. The job itself is fast-pace and exciting! If you like interacting with the public then you will love the way H&R Block has structured their customer service model. It's a lot of appointment scheduling and calendar management. Once you get to know all the tax professionals in your office and how long they take to complete a return that's when you will really need strong time management skills for accurate scheduling.

Opening and closing of the office. I learnt there are a lot of really great people out there.  The management was extremely nice and helpful. Everyone that worked there was super super  nice. Hardest part of job would probably be taking the occasional large payment from customer knowing they really couldn't afford it. Most enjoyable part of job is meeting a vast array of new people, and being able to converse with them abit."
good,"My overall review is very good!  Management is very good, because of the knowledge pasted on by management.

I have great co-workers who are always very helpful and informative, ready to answer any questions I might or could have.  I learned a lot just from them and never once had to deal with office cliques. They were true mentors.  There were occasionally difficult clients who remind me of someone running your nails down a chalkboard however they are few and far between.  They are the ones that no matter what you do, you would not be able to make them happy.  Management is always ready to work with you.  I'm not usually a ""people person"" so imagine my skepticism upon starting this type of job, however the job made me rethink many things about myself and people in general.

In the position that I held I often opened up the office, did deposit information for the day, made sure that the cash drawer was supplied, ran office documents needed for the Office Leader.

While, of course, there are some grouchy people who hate to get their taxes done each year, there are still many people who just love to share their stories with you.  And on top of that, the tax professionals in the office sure do know how to make your day.  They always smiled and said hello, and offered to buy me lunch.  Management could use a little bit of brushing up, but I can understand, we only have four months to get everything done.  The hardest part was dealing with rude and angry clients, but that's a given almost anywhere you work.  The best part is working with people who really do care about you as an individual.  And I got to take a nice break!"
good,Really enjoyed the job. My co-workers were great to work with and we helped each other out when things got really busy during peak season. Learned about the different tax forms and dealing with all kinds of people. The owner was wonderful and helpful. Hardest part of the job was trying to complete several tax returns during the day (I did online tax returns). Enjoyable part of the day was being with people that cared.
good,"I prepare individual, small business, and farm returns. I love this job as you can see I have been there many years. I love my co-workers and the company is absolutely wonderful to work for."
good,"Prepare clients taxes, Prepare Schedule C's, 1040A, 1040, 1040EZ, Skills in preparing clients taxes that have rental property, Schedule A's, military taxes, gambling expenses, Business expenses etc... "
good,every day was always a challenge very busy office but I enjoyed what I did. I was cross trained in a various of office duties and management skills so I have learned so much and very appreciative of that opportunity to do so
good,the staff was friendly and fun to work with there was never a dull moment! the compant works with your scheduel. the manager wasfun to work for and helped in any way possible in ant situation
good,"From the time you start until the time you end, you have great people to work with and to help you if and when you needed extra information. Hardest part of the job is when the tax season is over and you miss your co workers.  The most enjoyable part is when you are able to help the clients prepare their taxes and show them where they would be able to improve their refund or if they needed extra information forms for different situations."
good,I work seasonally January thru April. During the year I have to maintain education credits to be re-hired in January. I take classes from August through December.
good,"With any growing company, there have been moments of stress. But through strong leadership and a clear mission (I help people get jobs), Indeed has been an amazing place to work. The challenges are daily and varied and leave me satisfied. I have grown a lot working here and see a lot of potential for more in the future."
good,"Had a great experience working with this company. A typical day would be assisting the tax prepares, making sure the clients needs are met and keeping the office clean. The hardest part of the job was answering the phones and talking with people at the same time."
good,one of my favorite places to work I wish tax season wasn't seasonal I wouldn't mind working full time in this type of atmosphere.
good,I would arrive at work about 45 minutes before I opened the store to run the required daily reports.  I would also update the weekly schedules and ensure the store was ready for opening.  The most difficult part of the job for me is to keep the store properly staffed.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with both my staff and my clients.
good,"This company has moral and team building procedures which I so appreciate as this is a high stress job at times! While attending school, with H&R Block I could basically set my own schedule around my classes. There is always room to grow and advance!"
good,"A typical day at H&R Block, I had the chance to help individuals and families with any issues with their tax concerns. No situation was the same, so it was always a learning experience. Other than preparing basic taxes, I learned how to interact with my clients so that they knew I was devoting my time and knowledge to help them with their taxes in the present, future and also the prior years. My manager and co-workers made me feel comfortable because we always worked as a team, if I needed help they were always there to answer a question. They would also call upon me to help them with any problems or concerns that they came across. The hardest part of the job was telling clients that they were not going to get the amount of money they were expecting. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing clients excited about getting the maximum amount of money."
good,I love working for H&R Block because the office manager is very helpful and co-workers are respectful and enjoyable to work with.
good,"The best thing about H&R Block is the training. The basic 1st year course is 70 hours long. The off season is training season. We can get advanced to the next levels very easily, just by taking the time to attend more training! Once you do advance, the compensation changes to commission and bonus, which allows the preparers to make much more than the initial $9.00 hourly wage that the first-tear preparers get. The more levels one advances, the greater percentage of commission one gets! There are higher levels of proficiency that allow a preparer to work full-time! There is a need to do quarterly estimated taxes for the self employed and enrolled agents who are allowed to represent clients in legal proceedings before the IRS."
good,I love my job and appreciate every opportunity I get to speak with clients. I have gained a lot of knowledge about taxes and protocol.
good,"I work in this company mainly for tax experience.  "

good,"H&R Block is a very relaxed and happy environment. They have great managment and they work with you schedule. They work with you and understand that things sometimes happen in others life, out of nowhere. Great place to work!"
good,"My Day starts of with doing my daily administration work, checking my appointments for the day. Constantly greeting new incoming clients and answering phone calls."
good,H&R Block is one of the most fun places to work for. You get to work with the most unique of clients and most of the tax professionals and managers are friendly. I loved the fact that most of the clients had easy returns even though Every return is unique.
good,Love working here! Only downfall is that it is only seasonal. The office is very welcoming and like a second family! The TPs are very knowledgeable and helpful. Management is wonderful as well. Each person in our office pulls together and makes things happen!

good,"I absolutely love my job but it is only a seasonal job.  I deal with people every day either by phone, in person, or through email.  Doing their taxes is a very important but also confidential to each client.  Answer phone calls, help clients file their tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, their state return as well. My co-workers are absolutely wonderful to work with, and enjoy going to work every day.  To me the hardest part of the job is during our busiest time that we call peak and usually those days are long.  During this time it may be that we work 10 hours each day with very little time for ourselves to eat lunch, or go to restroom.  However, it doesn't last forever and it slows down.  I enjoy helping each client get the most amount of money that is entitled to them.  Each client has its own situation and that is challenging at times but well worth it in the end."
good,"Co - worker are helpful and very nice, great time working with them the only part I don't is the work hours because it's too little. Typical day of work is when you are waiting for a client to come to ask you do their return."

good,I really enjoy tax preparation.  I like working with the public and the fast-paced activity.  I work with a really great group of people and both supervisor and manager could not be any better.  The hardest part of the job in the continuing eduction and finding the time to study.  I enjoy everything about the job and would be extremely happy if it were full-time employment.
good,"In this position I am assigned to oversee all aspects of daily office life, including equipment operations, scheduling, coaching and training associates, providing timely reviews and daily charting of employee goals and achievements. Most importantly I am the frontline support for client service. It is my job to ensure all clients are provided the support they need and to make sure this is done with respect, integrity, and empathy when needed.  I have 27 associates that I am responsible for guiding through the tax season.  I treat each of them with the utmost respect, as they are the backbone of our operations.  The most enjoyable part of my job is watching my associated develop and grow their skills and becoming successful in their endeavors. The most difficult part of my position is balancing every task and making absolute sure every task, whether it is compliance paperwork for the IRS, training, office appearance and tax preparation are done in a timely matter.  This requires dedication, long hours and diligence. That being said, I love being in a position where I can help people, whether it be associates or clients."

When I made mistakes they were there to help me out and to learn from them, when I did a good job they made a point of letting me know they noticed.  The staff and management are all supportive of each other and work as a team.  Everyone helped everyone out.  Very fast paced work during peak season, dealing with many tax returns a day so the day went by very fast.  Management would give sweet little gifts on special occasion like an easter basket full of chocolates for easter or flowers, and encouraged you to make work fun."
good,"There is plenty of room for advancement.  I love the people I work with and the customers I serve.  Teamwork is encouraged and utilized on a daily basis.

I've learned so much about taxes while working here."
good,"The hours are very flexible and working for H&R Block is always exciting. The job is seasonal and I will continue to go back until it no longer fits my schedule. We always have perks and incentives to meet our sales needs and client retention. Management was awesome, always keeping us informed of our daily and weekly goals. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help certain client's due to the need of management or higher-up and the most enjoyable part was assisting our clients, I love to interact with people and enjoyed the fact that I was able to build great rapports with them which made their tax experience much better and in some cases much, much better!"
good,The office works as a team with the goal of customer satisfaction the number one priority. The management was supportive of all staff and whether you deserved praise or needed a reprimand it was given in a timely and professional manner.  You were given an appropriate amount of training in which to do your job well.
good,being a H&R Block employee give you the opportunity to grow your knowledge about tax laws because they have classes all year long and you get have a lot of clients.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in answering calls and meeting your clients, making sure they are attended by tax professionals and also attending to their needs. I learned how to deal with the public as in a professional manner and ensuring a smile a soon as they walk in to our store. As for our manager she was a outstanding person that would help if you we were stuck multitasking and also very professional and courteous with the clients. The hardest part of my job, was on those snowing bad stormy days getting to the job but getting there on time. My most enjoyable part was making sure the clients went home with a smile at the end of there session and knowing they were attended in a professional manner."
good,"As soon as I get there I do filing. Then there is calling to do in which I would call clients reminding them they have things to pick up or letting them know their taxes are done. Later in the day there is money to be deposited in the bank and mail to be dropped off. I learned how to deal with people, and communicate more with others. My co-workers were so helpful with every question I had. My boss was probably the best one I'll ever have. The hardest part would be first starting out and learning which papers to fill out, where people have to sign, and explaining what it is exactly that they are signing. You get the hang of it after quite a few people come in. The part I liked most about the job was the cookies and baking that some of the co-workers would bring in."

The management is excellent and easy to talk to, always willing to try the best for their employees.  My co-workers are always fun and willing to give a helping hand when it is needed.  The hardest part of the job were the training classes because everything came from a book therefore did not know exactly what it was going to be like in the actual working field.

good,"Formally known as ""Tax Works"" or ""Red Gear Technologies,"" the H&R Block call center in Kaysville Utah is one of the BEST places I've ever worked. We met the site manager and one of my co-workers, as a joke, asked for his personal cell phone number. He did not hesitate to give her his ACTUAL number. Everyone here is fun, they have such a relaxed environment, and the you don't have to keep your headset on the entire time as the phone rings through the phone. You see people with decorations up, there are assigned desks, and the desk are situation in such a way to allow you to talk to your neighbors. The site manager and call-center manager walk around everyday and all the time. They shoot the breeze, they crack a joke, and it's just fun to be at. The wages are epic too. $14.50 an hour. Since tax work is seasonal, they give you 2 months off throughout the year and it really helps with burn outs. You still get paid by the Government for those months too. Internet rules are lax compared to most places, and you can eat at your desk! Best call center job I've ever had."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. I consider my co-workers a second family. If ever a problem or question may arise, I never have any difficulty getting or asking for assistance."
good,"A typical tax season day (from mid-January to early march will require working more than 8 hours a day. This is called the first peak.  Clients are those  who usually have refunds.

good,You can learn a lot from the tax professionals and your multi-tasking skills will greatly improve.
good,I loved working as a manager at H&R Block because I could make my own hours. They train you extensively and there was always help just a phone call away. I went from a CSP receptionist to a manager in one year. I also taught the tax course after two years of employment. Hardest part of my job was dealing with in office issues with the staff. Other than that I enjoyed helping my clients and educating them on how to use the tax laws to their advantage.

good,everyone needs to take a tax course and this job pays you for on the job training.  you meet lots of people and it really challenges your interpersonal skills.
good,"Workday varied due to position advancement. Office manager work had narrow flexibility due to demands and general nature of tax season. Employee scheduling was critical to office efficiency and ability to deal with difficult situations is a necessity. Technical Support work was more flexible but also demanding due to availability of equipment, size of districts and independent needs of each location. HR Block was also upgrading form dial-up service to network based technology during my employment. The hardest part of the job was long hours and being on call (I was a single parent as well as a care-giver for grandparents). The most enjoyable part of all three jobs was working with people. This includes clients as well s other employees."
good,"I performed basic administrative tasks, yet was continually encouraged to learn more about the tax field. The people within the company were helpful, enthusiastic, willing to answer any questions, and were a very good team. Amazingly diverse office in culture and personalities.

good,What I like about this company is that they are so helpful and very informative. They help me to develop my skills and capabilities. They back me-up to the very end.
good,"My work day usually started at 9:00 a.m. The phones are usually ringing as soon as I get in the door. I make sure the coffee is ready, the office is clean and start submitting info in the computer system and get it ready to be filed. Greet clients as they enter and offer coffee or water to make them comfortable. Management is very friendly and easy to get along with. Our office is like family. The hardest part is when multiple clients enter at once, the phones are ringing and people are paying. The part I like best is dealing with the clients. We have numerous clients who return each year and it is always good to see them.."
good,I loved working for HR Block. I worked there for 14 years and may continue to work for them part time during the tax season or even full time all year if available.
good,Great place to work and the employees/tax pros are very professional!
good,"I was a receptionist with H&R Block for two tax seasons. 2009 and 2010. I would open doors, walk clients in, serve coffee after making it, run the register, take payments, schedule appointments, confirm appointments, cleaning seating clients with their preparer. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my position with H&R Block was we were not allowed to sit while on the clock. It was a standing reception position and it's hard to look nice and wear comfy shoes while standing on my feet for 8 hours. What I enjoyed most was getting to meet new people and giving the clients their tax checks. That was the fun part for sure!"
good,This is absolutely a great place to work. I started because I only wanted to fill a little bit of my day. The people and attitudes made me want to stay with them. I have learned a tremendous amount and I now teach classes for them. We are allowed or decline any hours we wish to work with no complications.
good,Loved meeting new people and helping them with their problems. Learned how to manage my time and abilities to help others. Helped with managing office when office manager was not available. Got along very well with all of my co-workers in my office and all other offices in my district. The hardest part of the job was the pricing. The best part of my job was knowing that I helped a lot of people who needed my services and prepared them for the next year.

Management is great, very professional and always encourage us to keep increasing our knowledge. My co workers are all great people, and always willing to help with questions. The hardest part of the job is that tax law is sometimes difficult, as it can be interpreted differently by different people. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have built a large client base over the 10 years that I have worked there, and my clients come back to me every year. I will continue to do taxes in addition to working a full time job."

The most enjoyable part of any job is the accomplishment you and the team have done for the company.
good,"I love being the first person people see when they are coming into the office. Just opening the door for them makes clients feel welcomed and can really change their outlook of the day. Our co-workers are like family and it does get difficult with some of them, but isn't that the harsh reality of it all? It's a great experience for the young adults and adults/single parents that want flexibility."
good,* First year is the build up clients for future.
good,"The best of this job is the constant growing opportunities during tax seasons. A tax preparer in a given season can be an office leader the next one. Also, the tax professional has to be up-to-date with all the recent tax laws and take courses every year to keep sponsored by the IRS to file tax returns every season."

good,"I learned a great deal more about tax benefits. I had a wonderful office manager that would always answer questions when asked or offered advise. She is very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the clients, talking to them, and helping them get money they were allowed. The hardest part I would have to say would be if a client would get upset because the IRS didnt give them their refund as quick as was expected to calm them down and try and help explain what was going on."

The managment resources was very helpful. My co-workers were friendly,honest and hard-workers. I enjoyed being a part of the company for the time that I was an employee there,"
good,"H&R Block in Greenville, PA was a fantastic place to work. The owners/managers were commited to helping employees get the most of their training and were always available to assist when needed. Since employment is part time/seasonal, they understood that employees had other jobs and family responsibilities. They did everything they could to work around our schedules. If it had been a full time, year round position, I would have never left."
good,I love that you can go to any of the workers and ask questions and no one made you feel less of a person.
good,"I started with H&R Block in the lowest position available to see if it is a company that i wish to work for in the futre. Being a business that only works 5 months a year, i may take the courses to become a tax professional for addition income but i want to start somewhere i can be perminate."
good,"I prepared tax returns, checked other employees returns and assembled returns. I also answered the phone and made appointments with customers to have their returns done. I was an office superviser for 3 of the 13 years that I worked for them. I went on audits with customers. I had a staff of 9 to 13 to schedule and to make sure office ran smoothly."

The management was very respectful and very helpful during my time at H&R. My coworkers were very nice and they helped me a lot of the time when I had questions.

Classes are offered at the end of the year for the following season. Lot of room for educational growth. If you enjoy doing your own taxes or helping others, its a great part time job to have."
good,This company has been such a life changing experience. They built my skill set tremendously and made it a fun place to walk into everyday. I’m currently searching for jobs only because I’m moving to a country where HR Block does not operate.
good,Management including the district manager is actively involved and cares about your thoughts and comments. I have experienced their care of your advancement in the company and will help you to advance. Management makes you feel you are cared about on all levels.

good,"Working at Block for me was rewarding, fun  and I loved helping and serving my clients. I usually worked only evening and weekends while working a full-time job.

They work very well with you're available days and times. Management is amazing. I have worked regular tax season, 2019 Summer Service and was a 2019 Summer CDAS Captain. You must take a mandatory eight weeks off per year."
good,"H&R Block is a very family oriented company. They have both corporate and franchise operations throughout the country. The initial training is free. Your only obligation for the free training is a one season commitment to the company.  They submit all the necessary documents to the IRS to obtain your PTIN. If you enjoy helping people and keeping up with current tax law, this place could be for you. "

good,Owner very involved making sure both employees and clients were served in a professional way. A nice place to work. Additional training was also available.

good,"Everything is excellent but sometimes the problems were in certain location because of the tax prepare people compete so much in an unhealthy way not in a healthy and professional way, But I am glad that I was not preparing taxes at those location but at the end my permanent location was the best in everything."
good,H&R Block was a great career investment! Meeting and helping clients with their needs was rewarding. Learning about the tax laws and how to manage the IRS was a great experience. There are many opportunities working for H&R Block and I will continue my seasonal work with them for as long as I can!
good,"I have not worked at a company that has such a teamwork environment! It doesn't matter what question you have or what help you need from co-workers or management, someone will ALWAYS take time to help you find a solution! Even if it means taking time from their work.

good,"Enjoy working at H&R Block during tax season. Very fast paced, but the employees as well as the managers and supervisor make it as relaxed and stress free as they can."
good,"The work wasn't hard, just a matter of learning the ropes. There were times when it could be hectic and definitely the ability to multi-task is needed. Excellent customer service is required too as some clients will be anxious about their situation, but it is the job to put them at ease. Management was great and so were the people in the office. Loved the job and wished it was permanent"
good,"Loved working here. I worked in the office as a csp, my co-workers were wonderful, I was trained very well and had access to lots of information. Just wish there had been more hours available."
good,Fun place to work. Staff is awesome they help each other. Management was nice but a little over barring. I was trained well. CSP( client service professional) only works seasonal. Wish position was longer.
good,"I literally LOVE my job and I'm so sad that I've leaving. My team is awesome, our manager is so down to earth and understand. They take the time out to actually teach you outside of trainings so that everything is crystal when it comes to our work.

good,"I was a tax specialist and was responsible for the preparing and filing of individual and corporate tax returns. I met with the clients, reviewed their documentation which led to the filing of tax returns with the IRS"
good,"Overall this job is really awesome. It is a perfect part time, seasonal receptionist position that provides you with about 4 months of valuable experience. I would say it's also a perfect job for a college student or a mom with kids in school since the hours are flexible and based on your availability. "
good,"A typical day at work is getting the office ready to open i.e. make coffee, straighten up cubicles, print reports. Then answer the phone and set appointments for clients. Check in clients that come in and/ or set appointments for them. Retrieve copies off of the printer for tax pros and make copies. Make calls to old clients to set appointments for this years taxes to be done. We had all ladies in our office and it was a fun place to work. I'm going to miss working there. :("
good,"My overall review of H&R Block is that they are a company they cares so much about their clients; they’re more than clients. We see the same and new people every year, we learn about their lives, their families, small and tiny details that they may have to provide and makes them feel vulnerable sometimes. But the people and the culture at H&R see our clients as family, because we grow with them and talk about life milestones; build bonds with people and that brings a new and comforting level of trust and professional relationships."
good,"I have worked for H&R Block off and on since 2009. I love everything about working here. In the office I work in, we all know each other and we all get along. We enjoy hearing about each other's days and sharing information that we have newly uncovered on all work related items. We are always there to help one another and we are happy to do it!"
good,"I loved my time at H&R Block in Union Square in Middletown. It was one kd the slower offices, but it was still busy enough. Kept us all busy without wanting to tear our hair out because we're overwhelmed like a lot of other offices in the area at the time. I always recommended my friends and family to get their taxes done w H&R  Block. I STILL get my taxes done with them every year. I always have & I'll continue to get them done here."
good,"I loved working for h and r Block. "
good,Culture in the workplace is great.  Applying the knowledge you acquire with the block academy makes you feel successful at what you do.   Best management I have ever met.
good,This was my first receptionist position so I was very nervous about making sure I did my job right. The tax pros in the office were very friendly and very helpful. They were always very supportive and encouraging.
good,"Working at H&R Block, it is the best job that i ever had.  Very professional environment, i learned lots of doing computers, issuing a cheque, booking appointments, opening & closing the system & store, making a report."
good,"I love working for H & R Block!!! Between the flexible schedule, available training to increase levels, and support from management is great!! I just wish I could work year round!!!"
good,"The company is strongly created and destined to deliver values of "
good,"The title says it all. Great job satisfaction and enjoyable work mates. The company wants you to grow and learn because it means more earnings for both you and the company. The more complex the return you are able to do, the more you both make. It's a fair deal for both. It's a fun and adventureful seasonal job as I experience it."

good,"I have worked at Block for 5, almost 6 years.  I have enjoyed my time there and the challenges that have presented themselves.  I have learned a great deal in my time there."
good,Starting Off in tax season its really slow but once after them few weeks it gets very busy. Hardest part is sometimes you in your desk all day not able to leave for breaks. Best part tax season is not full year and you can make good money if you do enough tax returns.
good,This is a very fun place to work as the clients are for the most part happy and friendly. the staff are fun to work with and very encouraging and helpful.
good,I love working for block. They are the best company. The environment is great. I have met many people and gotten to know many of my clients. I will stay there even after I find other work.
good,great place to work for and great hours. customer services with people friendly. love and enjoy doing taxes for great friendly customers. fast place to get a year-to-date payment and your hands.
good,"This company is so much better than I expected. People are great, and the new CEO has energized the business. The office is gorgeous and right in the middle of Power & Light.  Lots of opportunities to win free concert and event tickets, and you can park free in the downtown office garage all the time, including evenings and weekends.  "
good,"Learning to empathize with clientele.  No two days the same. Work well under stress. Hardest part finding misfiled files."
good,"I am so happy to work for H&R Block for 3 years, and I learned a lot from my team, such a nice place to work and learn!!! Everyone in the team is ready to help others any time."
good,HR Block has many educational options and rewards employees for learning and keeping clients coming back year after year. Building your client base helps you with your compensation.
good,The manager at my office was amazing. The pay was great and though it was flexible scheduling I was able to get around forty hours per week. I loved working there though I had a tax pro and clients that would slander me on a daily basis.
good,"H&R Block is a fun company to work for.  I enjoyed preparing taxes for clients in the office.  It is rewarding to take the stress of filing taxes away from people and give them the assurance that you will take care of it and you will do it correctly.  The company offers a wealth of online training.  When you feel you are ready to level up and take on more complicated tax returns, a test is available to test your knowledge and upon completing you are able to assist clients who have more advanced tax returns.  The company lets you do this at your own pace and it is completely optional.  They allow you to pick the times and days you are available to work, recognizing that many associates have other jobs, and schedule you in accordance with your availability.  It is an enjoyable, flexible and at times a challenging company to work for.  I enjoyed taking on the responsibility that comes with preparing taxes for others."
good,"This is one of the best employers I've ever worked for. My District Manager is committed to ""family, then company"" and embodies that practice in all of his offices. Our region is #1 in sales in the country. We work hard but we are supported in every way. Unfortunately, standard benefits are not available to tax preparers due to the seasonal nature of our jobs...the only drawback to working for thos company in my view."
good,"Tax law, good management skills, good professional culture, very good and easy software application, cooperative and encouraging employees, friendly atmosphare"
good,to meet people from all backgrounds and cultures. Good management and co-worker. You become a big HRBlock family. Good administration and offices. Flexible working hours. Good office locations.
good,"I have worked for H&R Block for two years during the tax season. I work the front reception desk by setting appointments with the correct  tax preparer.  My duties include assisting the tax preparers whenever possible, and keep the office maintained and stocked for each day.  Calling clients to schedule appointments, and following on these appointments.   I work with great people and plan to re-apply for the next tax season."
good,Great management and coworkers who are more than willing to help you. Plenty of opportunity to increase your knowledge and improve your skills. The work is seasonal but you can get around this by becoming a tax professional and working the off season.
good,"Although tax season is one of the most chaotic times of year, my coworkers and manager made the experience well worth it. Even though it was my first year doing taxes, I was able to ask questions and learn through experiencing tax issues first hand. My boss was professional and motivated to make sure that we were taken care of while being booked day in and day out. She brought in cheese/vegetable platters when there was little time to eat and thanked us often. Truly the best office to work in in the area."
good,Hours was flexible and manager was understanding and made the job easy & comfortable. Learned a lot working with the people here and life skills for the future.
good,"The office culture is incredible! My coworkers were amazing and such a joy to work with. the management is incredible and so understanding. They go out of their way to give you the tools to succeed and there is no such thing as being off the clock for them, they encourage calls at home for questions. I loved that no one just wiped their hands of the workplace at the end of the day. Despite being a tax office the people I met were kind and friendly and I had very few negative experiences. the manager would bring in food when we went above our goals and treats were almost always in the break room. I never passed down the aisle to refill the coffee pot without a smile from someone. I cannot wait to go back next year."
good,"On a typical day, I would answer phones, book appointments, and just help with anything that co-workers or managers would ask. I learned how to better communicate with customers. I learned a little bit about tax information. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some angry customers, and some days it was hard to get a hold of the manager.

good,". My store manager keeps a tight ship and makes sure the clientele is spread throughout all tax professionals and makes sure all staff including Client Service Professionals, AKA CSP's, are on the same page to make sure thee store is running smoothly through the peak of tax season. The tax professionals make sure to communicate with the CSP's to make sure things run smoothly as well. I believe the hardest part of the job for me personally is when clients with a language barrier call in to make appointments or ask tax questions, sometimes its difficult to understand the heavy accents so it makes conversations difficult and sometimes clients get irritated when I ask for clarity.  The most enjoyable  part of my job is how busy we are, there is always something to do whether it's catching up on paperwork or preparing file folders for clients."

You work from January to April 15th, you can choose to work in the summer or not. I enjoyed my time there. Every one is very kind, they are all business but nice and were always willing to help me. You learn alot about a person's life when you do their taxes, so you learn quite a bit about customer service and how to remain calm even if some one has some unexpected news, questions, or situation. The training they provide is really great!"
good,"I like doing taxes, and doing it well.  Taking care of the client and making sure their needs are met.  It is a good place to work during tax season."

good,Working at H & R Block is a great.  The co workers are friendly and the customers are great.  Clients will call in or walk in to make appointments to have their taxes done.  There is no tension really in this job.
good,I enjoyed my position and each day I learned something new because tax laws change daily.  Fun co-workers with excellent management.  The hardest part of the job was when clients did not want to pay the fees for preparing taxes.  Winning prizes for accomplishments.
good,Fast paced and friendly place to work. You learn a lot about taxes which is a plus.
good,"Working at H&R Block was a new experience for me. I never did Front Desk/Receptionist work, but it was not that difficult. The coworkers were genuinely friendly, and always helpful. The hours were excellent at peak time, but not so great at non-peak time. The hardest part of the job was finding work to do in the non-peak hours. the most enjoyable part was being able to learn a new experience as a Front Desk, Client Services Professional."

good,Great experience and learned new things on a daily basis.seasonal position
good,"•	Answered and forwarded incoming calls  "
good,"People believe that the tax business is about number crunching.  It is far from true.  The software does the number crunching.  Tax Preparation is about relationship building.  You have to be able to quickly connect with clients, be able to earn their trust with your tax knowledge as well as maintain their privacy.  The highest praise a client can give - is to recommend you to their friends and family."

good,"great working place, great people, and great work."
good,"One thing I know for sure is every tax season is different.  Being able to continually grow and learn the ever changing tax laws, regulations and codes is an exciting challenge.  Research of complex or unusual tax situations with clients is not uncommon, as is the occasional technical glitch from your federal, state or place of business that may affect clients.  I've learned the greatest asset to have in this job is adaptability and exceptional customer service.  A real benefit to H&R Block is the feeling that everyone is supportive, whether it's contacting corporate, technical support, upper management or your co-workers.  One of the hardest aspects of the job is being able to adjust to the unexpected, especially if something is negatively impacting clients, or if it is during peak and it's so busy you have to really balance your time.  Off season, there are usually continuing education requirements that often need to be met before rehire to stay sharp."
good,"I worked at a call center in Miami,Fl. A typical work day was hectic with a large call volume of clients needing help  with submitting their taxes.

Laid back, office attire, co-workers are cool ( most, lol) and help is always there if necessary."
good,H&R block is a great company. Everyone is friendly. It is very fast paced and you have to learn quickly. If you can't take your own initiative this is not the work place for you. The hardest park is dealiing with customers that don't have common sense so patience is needed.

In a normal day the office as a team would prepare 100 plus tax returns to submit to the IRS. Every year that you would return to work you would have to update all your credits to make sure you knew and understood all the new tax laws. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help clients with their tax situations.

Each year you come back your pay goes up, you get your taxes done free, and my manager and coworkers are very kind people. Typically you take care of clients on the schedule, anyone working in office can pick up the phone, take client questions, and work on returns during the day. Takes time management, a lot of talking and empathizing with clients which I like.

That’s paid though as well"
