rating,review
bad,All im going to say is once you apply here be prepared. Hours change managers start to nag on you harder people turn into more of a dick than normal. Just trash
bad,"Would not recommend this place to anyone. "
bad,I would prefer to keep my personal opinion about the company to myself. I left the company on good terms and didn't have any negative feelings about anyone.
bad,"Kapstone was the worst place I ever worked period."
bad,"I've been at this company for 2 years. When I started it was already headed downhill but it has continued to dip in that direction. Management utterly is clueless, they never consult with the people on the floor who know what's going on. The schedule is terrible and is always changing, rodents frequent the break rooms, they never buy parts to fix our machines, etc..."
bad,I worked in the dry kilen and stacker. Was a forklift driver for 7 months. I trained 6 people and none of them stayed because of the way the opp treated them like they were there workers. As the kilen operators would sleep in Kilen office #4
bad,"Customer Service supervisor acts like she's in junior high, doesn't know the job and plays favorites if you're the kind of person that likes kissing up."
bad,You actually need to run to keep up with production needed. The management knows nothing about the floor only charts. A very poor stressed out place to work. Some of the floor supervisors are good but they are stressed to max also because of high overage.
bad,This company will work you a long time and then will make out as if they are going to hire you but never will.The job is good but you never know when you my get hired
bad,"Management did nothing but blame others for their inability to run a successful business."
bad,"Terrrible union "
bad,"The pay is not in an equitable range of other employers  for electricians."
bad,"Management will lie and throw you under the bus for anything and everything, no matter who you are."
bad,"Literally hate this place, sooooo disorganized and unprofessional. The AP management is a joke tbh, the company does not care for their employees. I am surprised this place is still up and running. I will not recommend this place unless you can put up with totally bs work. Just wasted my time here. Becareful whom you trust, never know who will turn on you."
bad,They have a plant manger that doesn't care about the people who works for them wasted 2 years of my life there. No matter how good of a job you do he always finds something wrong to say to you.
bad,"I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy. The company does not care about its employees AT ALL!  You can never get a straight answer from anyone in management. They tell you what they think you want to hear.  They work every employee excessive hours and do not care if you have a family of any sort of life outside of work. You make decent money if you're uneducated, but for any educated person this job will make you crazy."
bad,I worked so hard for this place. And right before our 90 days to go full time.  They let all us new hires go. They do this over and over again.  Stay away.
bad,"Terrible General Manager, Plant Manager was lazy. They brought me into to change the culture and help with back log management. "
bad,"I was hired and thought things were going well. Went in to work on a Thursday called in to office and told I was being let go. No other reason given. This is what I know new manager hired crunching numbers. And 2 previous men being brought back. One will only work days the other nights. A busy of mine had signed acceptance for a position they told him there was a hiring freeze."
bad,"I worked at the Lake Mary FL facility. The hours are fantastic 6am to 1:30. Very attractive 401 Contribution."
bad,Terrible place to work.  Work every Saturday from April to December.  They do not appreciate their employees or give any consideration to work/life balance nor do they care.
bad,Management is awful. They just bully you into non stop overtime and threaten to punish you if you can't stay. The place is always dirty with dust in the air and machine leaks constinatly. All corporate cares about is money and doesn't care about employees and it shows. I would not recommend this job to anyone. It's just not worth the stress and constant headache management throws at you.
bad,"This company is a very turbulent work environment. They advertise family environment, but won't hesitate to ""eliminate"" your job any day. The day to day environment is very harsh. There is way too much politics for this to be an enjoyable company to work for."
bad,"the only good thing about kapstone which is now wesrock was the pay, other than that it was a terrible place to work. they treat you very poorly and don't care about anything but what you produce. They don't care about your personal life or if you even have one outside of work because your life is your job working 12 to 16 hour shifts 6 days a week. with no notice till 30 mins till you are supposed to go home. so you cant plan anything because you don't know if you will have to stay over for 12 or 16 hours. they wrongfully fire people and do a lot of illegal things that could get them in a lot of trouble if caught with L&I."
bad,a typical work day is at least 12 hours. I learned a lot about the paper industry. management however is lacking in every aspect. workplace culture was good for the most part the hardest part of the job was dealing with poor management and the most enjoyable part was putting in a days work knowing I gave it my best everyday and working with my coworkers.
bad,"Its not a good place to work they are more about themselves and complain about production when they have unqualified people in places that need the highest production numbers and the ""union"" lays down for the company ."
bad,"I do not recommend anyone work here unless you are desperate for a job and out of options. They care little about the employees all that matters is that the work gets done at any cost. They will tell you all sorts of wonderful things at first but as soon as you are in there you realize what a sham it all is. Stay away, this place is awful there are no other words to describe it."
bad,"the worst company to work for ever. employees are cancerous at best. management haven't a clue how to fix the very broken company, building and employees, corporate management kept in the dark as to what is really happening, everything out of building management is operator error."
bad,"Management is horrible and doesn't care about employees. Long hours, often forced to work overtime with little warning. Frequently worked 12 hour days 6 to 7 days a week. The benefits are excellent and pay is decent though, so if you're single or don't want to be home with your family very often its perfect."
bad,"Horrible on-site management."
bad,A cut-throat company full of lazy people that want others to do their jobs. Full of drama and rumor spreading and full of lies from management. You always have to watch your back for fear of someone spreading lies about you.
bad,managment is horrible dont care about anything but them self only and quik to blame the workers for problems from the old machine that are 30 years old and run down and dosen't good must of the time and alway's firing new workers before th 90 days so they can't make it in the union don't train people that well at all and working 10 to 12 hrs a dayand saturday they don;t care of you have a familiy that you want to spend time with its not there proplem only production is what matters to them.
bad,Very unorganized very low moral through out plant.Plant is not equipped to run the volume they want through the plant.warehouse is very unsafe and unorganized.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend at all. If you need a job & this is your only hope well go for it. Superintendent is the worst. Out of all my jobs, I haven't felt so disrespected in my life. The only good thing is the pay and that's why half of the employees are still there. I would look somewhere else."
bad,"I was there always had awesome feed back. I learned the job well and help train others. I was fired two days prior to passing my probation. union did not help no one did. Employees were great felt like family. Management was ok the plant manager was a very dishonorable, dishonest snake."
bad,no family time. six days a week with the seventh day option. management cant figure out how to schedule the work so they bring in employees on overtime. deny time off.
bad,"You will be required to work for weeks at a time with no days off. if you call in for any reason it is counted against your attendance, doesn't matter if you have a Dr note or not. The pay and benefits are great as long as you don't want a life out side of work"
bad,"10 years as a instrument tech. BY FAR,  the worst company I have worked for.  Pay might be decent, but constantly being overlooked and stabbed in the back will take its toll. They say we treat you like family, they'll treat you like a piece of trash dumped into the Columbia river. New hire instrument folk, be ready to do all the b**ch work, don't plan on going home at 3:30 when the day is over, need to pick up your kid, have fun plans with friends family or wife, be ready not to do those things. Good luck to the union and company contract negotiations, wait what negotiation."
bad,This is one of the worst places i have ever worked for... They don't care about any of their employees just production and money. One manager has terrible little man syndrome and no respect... The plant manager is a huge coward and is far from a leader... Don't waste your time theres more to life than making good money at this place.
bad,"management!!! They make an easy job difficult. production is never enough!!! They also treat their employees like garbage... just look at the turn over rate, it is disgusting... mind you, I worked there for 5 years!"
bad,"Oil and safety hazard everywhere, smell is horrible and gets in your hair, clothes and car. Poor management with little to no direction given to employees. Dreary and unmotivated place to work."
bad,Poor management and there's not a great place to work if you have a family. if you want to work a lot of overtime this is the place for you. they always try to change your schedule at the drop of a hat
bad,Less than 10 years became a $4 billion.  Growth through acquistiion.  Selective and productive spending to maintain infrastructure.
bad,I'm all about my money but imagine working 5 days straight of 12 hours minimum everyday. The machines they're using are all on the verge of breaking down and its up to the operators to use ducktape and what ever possible to keep the machines running.
bad,"They do not communicate with you due to poor management and expect you to know exactly what is going on. They train you on something different each day, not giving you any time to learn. They will tell you your schedule before you start but once you get in there it is completely different. 12 Hours shifts 7 days a week leaving no time for your family and you get two 10 min breaks and 1-15 for 12 hours of working. This is not enough time to even eat your lunch. In order to have safe employees with good attitudes  they need to take care of themselves and fuel. Pay is great and was never and issue. There is no stability in this job. If you have another I would recommend you stay where you are or find somewhere else to work. I did not listen to the reviews and thought it wont be so bad. I so wish I would have instead of putting my time in to leave my old company. This place is a joke and they do not care about you or any other employee who works for them."
bad,Poor management. Unorganized. Unprofessional. When I started I thought it was ok then realized how the hourly employees were being treated and how management played favoritism to certain employees.
bad,"Recently Plant Manager was let go and the issues are deeper rooted. Management is mindless, employees are not treated fairlly and equipment is in poor condition."
bad,"Management had a terrible attitude and lacked management skills, did not set up training-was told to ""make it happen"" and cover my current position with no relief."
bad,"12 hours a day, with most Saturday's as well. No real training program. Poor management team, not on same page with one another, no teamwork between shifts, I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,Unstable management with low value on the employee.  Emotional decision making process at high levels.  always room for employment in supervision.  Training is on the job.
bad,Company works almost every weekend and 12hrs shifts because cant keep people working there.  Employees get burnt out and find other jobs.  But if like working 60 to 70+ hours a week year around then yes someone would like working there.  Family will come second because of the hours.
bad,"Pay is good, benefits decent. Expect long hard hours, 12-16 a day/night. Rotating shifts. Very hot nasty environment. Paper dust and oil leaks everywhere. Better options elsewhere for around same pay. Management has a bad attitude towards repairs and employee concerns."
bad,If you are young and single with no children then this is a perfect job and you make some good money. but if you have any type of family life then you will lose it working there.
bad,"I appreciate the experience I have gained throughout my years with the Company. "
bad,Power hungry management that does not care of your life outside of work. The Co-workers are great and some benefits are good but it does not out weigh the poor management.
bad,"I feel my review could be biased, due to the strike we are currently on.  As far as work is concerned, its a quick paced and challenging environment.  Employees are very bright and easy to work with. They carry years of experience and knowledge to make jobs easier to complete correctly.  As far as the company is concerned I feel they have not followed through on the promises they have made to the employees.  They promote that they are a company that cares for their employees and their families, but their action prove otherwise.  Due to the ULP's filed against the company I cannot elaborate, but I am not impressed with the companies actions or the treatment towards their employees."
bad,The pay is great but don't expect a welcome in the mechanical departments unless you went through their apprenticeship program. I was honest about my experience in maintenance during my interview and a job was offered based on that. I was told that with basic mechanical experience I'd be fine with being trained on the job. 
bad,This has to be the worst place I have ever worked. The management of the company is more of a dictatorship. The only thing I can say positive is that my coworkers and operators were some of the most talented I have worked with.
bad,"Corp. management does not have a long term plan. They change short term goals month per month rather than putting out a long term plan and staying with it. plant had no long term goals. You get people trained and they turn around and cut back because they had one bad month, then turn around and bring in new people the next month."
bad,Good money but poor management skills. Your there to work and anything less than perfect will get you into trouble especially if it goes out the door to be shipped.
bad,"unrealistic goals, mandatory overtime almost everyday. The pay was nice and what was keeping a lot of people working there, it was a hard working job, and the factory was constantly humid and hot."
bad,"Very hot conditions, operating machinery which never work right. Supervisors are always right on you. Had several new mangers within my 2 1/2 years working there."
bad,If you are ready to work very long hours and a lot of overtime.   This job is for you !     There is no family time and no life outside of work.    Sometimes having to work through breaks and lunches
bad,"Management hardly listens to employees working with machinery. This company is not where you want to be if you value your time away from work. Good pay, bad working environment."
bad,They make boxes for various different companies. I would describe the work environment as slightly unorganized with a lack of communication
bad,The management are good people the hardest part of the day when break down happen learning different position and the workplace have plenty of hard working guys
good,Management does not know how to do our jobs so they have a difficult time getting a grip in their minds on what we do in a typical day. It's a very fast paced job and most of the time machines and things break down that make it difficult for us to complete our tasks. My co workers spend most of their time playing video games on their cell phones so it is more stressful for me since I am not in a management position to correct that. Times have changed there. We have been sold twice now and soon to be a third. Job stability is now a thing of the past.
good,Pay is great but that's where all things positive about kapstone end management is terrible they have no respect for the employees what so ever! Favoritism is huge at this company!
good,I enjoy my job when I'm allowed to do my tasks. However management is overbearing and unsupportive of their employees. The pay is competitive yet the morale is extremely low.
good,"It can be very stressful during harvest months, advancement only through seniority, management positions are not union, environment can be competitive and stressful."
good,"When I first started working there I loved my job. By the time I left I couldn't stand to be there anymore. Management is terrible! The point system is ridiculous. They don't care about anything but running the machines faster and faster. Quality is out the window, equipment is never up to par, and don't think for a second that management cares about you."
good,"There is little tolerance for errors & its common for a supervisor to get angry and yell at you if things aren't going right. You have to be VERY focused at whatever you're doing & if you're a temp, they can and will let you go for little to no reasons whatsoever."
good,This was just a job I tried to do my best on. It was a pay check. I would have like to advance further but there was no opportunity to advance. i am looking for a place to advance and use my skills
good,Good place to work if you're tight on money. Hard to advance once you hit level 3. Got to wait your turn. Great fast paced job with allot of sweat....
good,"I learned how to work machinery .the hours are long but good pay. The hardest part about the job is the long hours., and having to work in the heat from all the machines ."
good,This place pays good for the area. In the busy time May - Jan you work a lot of hours. They were just bought by westrock so there are going to be a lot of changes coming.
good,"Pay is ok, lots of overtime, not a lot of room for advancement, very short breaks, great people on the plant floor, multiple shift changes, to many weekend"
good,"Kapstone overall was good but they had poor management and they showed treated other employees better than some plus they was sold to washroom,  and the pay didn't change"
good,"I worked for the company over 20 years and worked with a lot of wonderful, hard working people.  Plant Management worked hard to balance Executive Management (working hourly employees with terrible amounts of OT) while trying to keep employees safe and morale good.  The corporate management team now only cares about the bottom line.  In years past - Longview Fibre worked through the rough times and held on to its employees.  KapStone Executive Management now only cares about their MIP; not their employees that put their heart and soul into the company every day -  while Executives jump from job to job, company to company.  So unfortunate, it was a great place to work."
good,The management is not flexible at all. The fact that it is contracting the union really affects the general culture and work process. The only good thing are interesting projects for new engineers.
good,"Training is horrible. “You’re responsible for your own training”. Constantly pulled from training to work in other areas not pertaining to your position. Given a sponsor, but that sponsor will never do what a sponsor should do, as in guide, help, teach. You’re screwed if you get on the bad side of just ONE of the members of your training crew. It’s like high school all over again. Complete waste of 2 months"
good,"Good work, that I enjoy. But the future of this facility is Very shaky."
good,"Originally hired as a Safety/Quality Manager, but after 6 months I was given additional duties as a DOT Safety Officer, production supervisor and plant manager duties, inventory control, IT administrator, shipping and receiving, trainer, educator, parts ordering, environmental and safety training and new hire orientation for 2 other Kapstone plants. Put in about 70+ hours a week. Very outdated equipment and plant. Kapstone as a whole is a very good company and should not be judged on this one facility."
good,A lot of the positions were filled by temps so unfortunately once you got to know some of the people their contracts were up and then were replaced with someone new.  Some of the employees in the AP department are difficult to work with but overall were not too bad.
good,I used to love my job at kapstone.. But now they are making so many changes that do not make sense with their business plan. If you are looking for a high stress job with long hours. This is the place to be. My coworkers are great. We have a good time. Its just the management that is lacking.
good,"If you like working for a mindless company that only cares about productivity and want to never see your family. This is the perfect place for you."
good,"Great compensation but not family friendly. They don't hire enough people for the work load, instead they make everyone work continuous over-time. Management doesn't treat employees well. Very negative environment and no appreciation for workers. No flexibility with schedules."
good,"this place could catch fire and i would throw gasoline to feed the flames, do not work here!!! guaranteed third shift if you want it though"
good,"Very old facility with every changing management.  Long hours, dirty environment and unsafe typically. Lots of good hourly people there keeping the place running."
good,"Stressful place to work, lack of respect for employees."
good,"When I started 6 years ago at the Oakland Longview plant I was not aware of how old the plant was and the condition of many of the production machines. The corrugator and the various machines that produced all the boxes were being kept on life support by the machinists. It got only worse when KapStone bought Longview. The plant was not profitible and lost money every year. We could not keep accounts due to quality and shipping issues. It was frustrating and stressful bringing in new accounts only to have them leave, some within months, others stayed longer only because of the relationship the sales rep. had with those accounts. After investing several million dollars into fixing the machines over the last couple of years it was evident that KapStone had to either find another location or close the plant. They tried to buy another company but that fell through so it was finally decided to close the plant. "
good,Fast paced work environment with individual responsibility. Manufacturing facility staffed with hard working employees tasked with operating challenging equipment.
good,Pay is ok. Union job and management does not like it. Safety is number one. If you make a mistake it will always be your fault as far as management is concerned.
good,"I love the people I work with and the company itself, but it is hard to have a life outside of work at my particular plant and it is getting worse."
good,After the family sold Longview Fibre and it became Kapstone Paper everything went down hill.  It was know longer a family organization and they let you know as much.  Very unorganized and not ran well
good,"KapStone Paper & Packaging is an American pulp and paper company based in Northbrook, Illinois. Since November 2018 it has been a subsidiary of WestRock Company."
good,"Overall Kapstone was a decent place to work, primarily because of the friends you made.  The management was lacking from day one.  Managers only seemed to promote employee's they liked instead of one's that were deserving.  Not a great company to move up in. The company was acquired by another, and ever since the announcement, the moral at Kapstone has been negative."
good,i learned how to operate a box machine. the hardest part of my job was  working 12 hour shifts 6 days a week. the most enjoyable part of my job was maintaining a good production goal.
good,Safety first. I learned very much in the 30 years at Kapstone .My most enjoyable part of my job as a Millwright was installing and repairing equipment
good,union job so always that tension between management and front line workers. Tension between machine shippers and warehouse shippers. Long work shifts and then management expects people to work overtime.
good,Supportive environment. Learn new skills. Multitask. Project teams are helpful. Proactive job searching. Listen to feedback. Flexibility. Success driven.
good,"busy place to work with alot of drama, loved being in the office, disappointed when they moved jobs to chicago and alot of people lost their jobs, disappointing"
good,harsh atmosphere to work in... management does not seem to value its employees as well as other companies..time off and other benefits seem to be diminishing...
good,Payroll done daily I learned how to hire new employees didn't like to fire no one but had to. The smile of the employees when I gave them there checks
good,Job is decent and involves a little intelligence. Industrial environment is dangerous and outdated. Budget can make or break career here. Do not recommend.
good,Come in set up the machine make sure everything is safe and is in perfect working condition. Worked 12 hour shifts days and nights. End of the day clean up the area for the next crew.
good,"Kapstone is a great company to work at. The company is constantly growing through acquisitions, which creates many opportunities to learn and grow. Through these acquisitions there are many challenges from system integration and process and procedure improvement; all that an employee will be heavily involved with."
good,A typical day is a very hectic fast paced work environment with more duties than one person can perform . I learn that teamwork is everything to be successful.  Management is always right even when there wrong and they never take responsibility for there actions. My co workers are very goal orientated . Multi tasking 10 different tasks at the same time . Knowing that i help the company succeed and grow .
good,I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and learning from them. I also enjoyed working for most of the management. It is a very safety orientated work place which I believe is a great thing.
good,Everyday was full of extraordinary with the presence of safety amd plant rules led as number 1 and leaders that wanted safety to be first!!!
good,"Decent company to work for, lots of different processes to learn here. Many different types of instruments from old, to new state of the art. Same goes for their control systems."
good,Wonderful co-workers - learned many more facets of payroll.  Would like to see management help with advancing the employees.
good,"12 hours shifts rotate between night and day, never have time to get in a sleep pattern. Body is worn down and accidents happen easily. All employees encourage each other to keep injuries hidden or you will be blacklisted."
good,"Not much room for advancement. Good place to work, needs improvement in management."
good,Overall KapStone was a good place to work with opportunity to advance.  The company grew by acquisition.  As a result there was the opportunity to learn new things.
good,we had a pre shift meeting every morning before the shift stared. after the meeting all employees went to their work department. we talk about working safely and making quality product to our customers
good,Management was fantastic. The people I worked with were fantastic. The benefits were great. Unfortunately there was a group lay off so the possibility for advancement was non existent. I will miss everyone there and hope to find a place where the stress of work is helped by working with wonderful people.
good,My typical day at work involves loading bales down conveyors.  Unloading bales into the warehouse or onto trucks with the forklift.  Checking the computer system to make sure the bales are in the right location.  Data entry.
good,Working at Kapstone is fulfilling in that I get to interact with the maintenance employees on a daily basis. They are genuinely concerned for my well being and I have a great working relationship with each of them.  The work is fast paced and sometime demanding. Knowledge of the Union contracts is essential and the Union officials rely on me to understand the details of each of the 3 contracts that are in place at this time. I work closely with management as well and they to rely on my knowledge and relationships with the employees to bridge any gaps that may come up.
good,"My day begins of modifying loads from product that did not run. setting up trucks going to cedar city for the same day, also making sure all loads are being delivered, line pullers floaters and loaders are being doing what needs to be done for the day that no machines are shut down do to lack of productivity from Line pullers floaters. Also that the loaders are loading the trucks in a timely manner. doing toolbox meeting daily. "
good,"Very outdated mindset, software and tools with little to no opportunity to learn new technologies.  Their IT department moved very slow in determining future direction."
good,Decent place for starting your IT career. Plenty of IT professionals to learn and grow from. Uncertain of current IT future there with impending company merger with WestRock.
good,Fast paced environment. Fair wages with good benefits. Strong job stability. If you are motivated and willing to work Kapstone can provide a long term employment opportunity.
good,"I enjoyed many things about working here, but I was not fully satisfied with the communication system. I believe in constructive criticism and corrective action, and consistent feedback on performance and expectations. Unfortunately, it needs improvement."
good,"I learned a lot about myself at this job. It is a manufacturing job that runs 24/7 and I work nights there. The job isn't hard, but the work isn't rewarding when management has been really bad. Morale is very low at the plant right now and I can't wait to find another place to work."
good,"Very good relationship between co workers. Overall morale good intier plant. I was underpayed and over worked. And expected to cover two positions for most of time employed there. My department suffered from qualified workers, and was responsible for covering and making sure everything got done on time and efficiently.i was good at it but it led me to be over worked and felt under appreciated. And never felt like pay matched work load, and responsibilities of position. Didn't feel like had job security,there were more temps than full time employee's."
good,Kapstone is a young company with some challenges.  They have very good people however work life balance continues to be a struggle.
good,Good place to work but the managment sucks. The GM is not very friendly if he doesnt like you. He def picks and chooses who he wants to be friendly or nice to
good,You can fully support a family on this salary. Fast paced stressful. Low hourly rate. High deductible health insurance. Great 401k. And stock options.
good,"This was a decent place to work with Kapstone "
good,Good company with good benefits. If you don't mind shift work it's a good place to work with occasional overtime and a fair amount of time off. It's been open for over a 100 years
good,Good for anyone that wants to be reliable and dependable. It's hard just within the standing of a 12 hour shift but it has a good environment to keep you going!
good,Okay to keep working here. It's not the job of  my dreams but it does provide a good living. While working this industry do expect to work shift-work. Sometimes 2nd shift or sometimes 3rd shift and if your lucky sometimes first shift.
good,"I do have contract job every day manger give me new project."
good,Very good work atmosphere. Coworkers are dedicated and are willing to help should you need a hand. Leadership is very focused and dedicated to everyone's success.
good,"a typical day would be standing in one spot for a long time frams, changing printing plates and ink. breaking jams and re-stacking boxes"
good,"Assist customers"
good,"Decent company. Some job advertisement. Mostly in house, which is good. Pay could be better, but you can get some overtime. Management can differ from shift to shift.  A little bit of racism in it's leadership representation."
good,Must have a good work ethic and learn fast. It is a good job but you need to be flexible. Work hours can be a little long but good Job Security/ Advancement if you put forth the effort.
good,For production work it was good.Fast paced.Long periods of standing. most coworkers were easy to get along with. Good pay. Was paid twice monthly.Close to home.
good,I wish We weren't closing I like going to work everyday I went and still do.. There are so many people I will miss.. This place has became like a family away from our families.. I have learn so much about my job and the people around me and their jobs also.. I will take the knowledge I have gained from here and the additional educational guidance's to move on with a future in Accounting and Human Resources.
good,I enjoyed working at Kapstone because the hours I was working. Ten hour shifts and weekends off. I helped run the Die Machines and Make Boxes. As well as checking the Quality of the product.
good,"My position here as quality manager at KapStone is typically an interesting one. I have the opportunity to interact with customers as well as members of production staff. If I receive a customer complaint or return, I log the complaint and investigate root cause with production staff as well as provide data and documentation to shift supervisors to review with operators to educate and avoid reoccurrence. This is usually interesting but sometimes root causes can be difficult to discover. The atmosphere is pretty comfortable. I work alone mostly. I manage procedures and their proper usage more so than people directly."
good,"Very heavy workload tend to take it home. Co workers are great, management is ok. The compensation is great, the benefits are ok."
good,A typical day at work was about 10.5 hours long. Management was good to work with. Caring environment. Hardest part of the job was sourcing and training people to do the work. Enjoyed working with all the people.
good,"If your looking for a fast pace production facility then this the place, it offers crew input, premote from within, and team support. The hrs can be long and 6 day work weeks are the norm."
good,"People that I work with are great people. Kapstone is a very busy place. Pretty much all year, plenty of work. plenty of overtime. I would recommend this place of employment."
