bad,"Used to be a great place to work.  Not so much now.  Management is terrible and there is little room for growth.  Organization is very, very clique-y."
bad,This place has a union transfer local 29 and both management and union stabbed me in back before I ever work there and act like they never did  THIS IS A TRUE STATEMENT
bad,"It was a great place to work for 5 1/2 years,until Dannon yogurt bought Whitewave.Everything changed,you were required to spend most of your store call time stocking yogurt at the expense of  most all Whitewave items,with the result being the loss of 27 items in Albertsons and Safeway.its a shame all the hard work we did to promote Whitewave items and see that work go down the drain"
bad,"This place has way to many rules when working for them. For instance you can not be a smoker, and work for them. Also once you are on the property, you are not allowed to leave until the end of your shift."
bad,Company cares about money and often disregards enployee needs and safety. Union job and if you support that the company finds ways to go after you. Politically based
bad,"All levels of management, supervision and HR will lie to your face about anything and everything. They claim to be ""family oriented"" but will force you to work an ungodly amount of hours(sometimes 60 plus) & give you points against your attendance if you want to go to family functions. They also claim to be concerned about safety but do not give proper training to people working around moving machinery and pressurized systems. They are condescending and aloof and do not care about you."
bad,Management is unsupportive and Supervisor is often angry and takes it out on subortinates.  Expectations are overly high and it makes work there very stressful.
bad,"Long hours management treats you like garbage I hate coming to work everyday. They pretend your safety matters it does not. I really wish it was better here, but you are reminded constantly that you are replaceable."
bad,"It pays well that's all I can say good about the company, their not fair when it comes too terminating employees so if you need good pay its a good place"
bad,Working was always impeded by bosses protecting their own from producing at the expense of the rest. It didn't matter what you did as long as the management liked or disliked you so take into account that you can grow or remain stagnant with or without working or without education or not.
bad,Major changes and now our insurance isnâ€™t being accepted by major hospitals. No help on shifts. Management runs sectors poorly. Compensation is okay. No job advancement opportunities.
bad,Management or the lack of real Management really hurt this place. They don't value experienced employees. Too many different Management styles present all at the same time. A good old boys culture was very present.
bad,Management team is not good. You come in have a small meeting with your team depending on area you work. after that you started working get a break every 2 hours on a 10-12 hr day
bad,"Great coworkers but the company expects you to work more than 40 hours a week.  If your manager doesn't like you you're stuck in your position without any opportunities to move.  Compensation and benefits are outstanding, but with terrible management and work/life balance there is a lot of turnover."
bad,"Company has a strong set of values but they are not followed by most Plant Management teams until they are forced to. Production first over safety, and there are a lot of politics at the management level. The company is focused on numbers and profit not the individual employees. Turn and burn mentality with high turnover. Work life balance is non existent, you are expected to be at the plant dark to dark everyday, on call all the time and taking accrued vacation is frown upon by some plant directors. hourly employees are forced to work OT and fill in for others because the plants cant keep positions filled. The company and plants need to take better care of the employees and they will drive results. Be careful about the people you put in management and protect even though employees make multiple complaints to HR. Operations needs to focus more on values, safety, professionalism and the employees over production numbers."
bad,"It was great with the old management, When they changed over to new management it was brutal . At the end I was forced out just before my tenth year anniversary because I had a mild heart Attack and I was considered a health risk employee."
bad,The Hardest part of this job is staying sane. The rules only apply to some people and it is not uncommon to find a warehouse person sleeping in a corner of a warehouse. The Hr Manager runs the place and if she does not like you that's it.
bad,I was a person that took my job to heart .  I enjoy my job the passion that I put into everything that I did when I did my job the Ideas that I gave to help the company ..
bad,"My manager was very poor! No direction, guidance, assignments, check-ins, etc. His boss, the Plant Engineer, was very competent.  Place is a little scattered though."
good,"Good solid product brand. The health and wellness product mix fits well with healthy trends in the marketplace."
good,"It's a good company if you are full time employee, then you can enjoy the company benefits.But they generally they like to use a lot of contract workers so as to avoid paying benefits like holidays, vacation etc."
good,Worst company by far I ever worked for.  The lack of management and the lack of responsibility by management is so poor.  You work hard for nothing.  Great pay and benefits but it doesn't make up for the constant headache and stress!!!
good,"It is what it is: trendy and new plant under direction of a trendy and new company. There are some wonderful perks to the company that can be a joy to be a part of (mostly at the Corporate location), but there are many growing pains evident for both the plant and company in general. If you are a beginner- mid range professional searching for some new experiences, I would recommend looking into a job here as it's a great place with great people. However if you are a more seasoned professional looking for a place to plant and grow your career, I wouldn't recommend even pausing to take a glance, yet. Give them a couple years to get their feet wet and get some ducks in a row- one day this place (and company in general) will be awesome."
good,they do silk milk there...is not a bad place to work at....reasonable pay nd ok benefits....fell like I should have a higher role than just an ordinary operator....
good,"Enjoyed photographing for them. Had a wide variety of projects and was able to execute them clearly, with clear communication of all teams. "
good,"Good work, life balance"
good,"I was not there long enough to know the fine details. At the time I worked there the relied heavily in external labor. "
good,"very stressful and unorganized, couldn't accomplish any major projects due to always ""fire fighting"" and having to deal with to many meetings. People were friendly but upper management needs reorganization."
good,It was okay don't treat contractors to well. No documentation and security was not setup well at all. Not sure I would come back.
good,"Company is growing rapidly and work/life balance is taking a toll on the employees.  Good company to work for in general, but they need to add incremental FTE's for each company acquisition."
good,I run 3 different machines-2 sets of each one. I have many responsibilities and a great deal of expectation from management. 12 hour shifts.
good,The company is growing fast which is good but they also have the wrong management team and philosophy about employee relations. The schedule is a rotating schedule so vacation time can be extended pretty easily which is good.
good,The moral is down and can use a boost in employee recognition. Pay is good but somewhat unstable due to operational failures.
good,"The company tries to make the work environment pleasant. They placed a cafe on-site, which helps when your job limits you fom leaving for lunch. The management staff is average."
good,"Organic Food Industry and provides conventional products as "
good,"A typical day consists of customer service and logistics work, as well as vendor managed inventory, on time delivery analysis, and any needed Ad Hoc Reporting."
good,The thing I liked the most was the opportunities to advance your career and work for a company who was looking for ways to help the communities around them.
good,"I loved what I did for WhiteWave Foods.  Once it was sold to Danone, I was not respected, paid fairly or even given attention as an employee.  It was a mess."
good,"High energy company with lots of flexibility. Provides learning opportunities, and development. This company has a large presence in the food bank community."
good,"While WhiteWave is a decent company, they have yet to establish a good program of growth and development. The work / life balance is lacking, as well."
good,"Jod advancement opportunities are few , pay is decent , work life balance is good."
good,"The company is very active and well compensating"
good,"WhiteWave seeks to grow by selling better for you and the planet products. One of its values is the ""Integrity to produce food responsibly"""
good,good company.  weired manegement but a good company to work for and cares about the quality of food they produced
good,Good people to work with but management is lacking. No direction and fly by the seat of their pants most times. Do not get a straight answer or are totally evasive and give no answer.
good,"Learned a lot working at this facility, good team work within associates"
good,Great place to work for. It is a fast paced environment with multiple changes on a daily basis. It is a start-up plant facing many challenges with processes and personnel. It is a World Class Manufacturing.
good,â€¢ Complete internal facilities and building maintenance requests
good,This company is expanding at a very fast rate and it shows with poor  decisions being made by upper management. A typical day would include Backing up VFD Parameters to our server to preserve them if something should go wrong with the VFD's. Also with constant change comes lots of commissioning of the new machines. Another thing done was adding in new flavors for the Markem-Imaje Box Coders.
good,"White Wave was a wonderful company to work for as a learning experience. I was satisfied throughout my employment with White Wave. "
good,"This company is excellent to work for.  The employees are extremely intelligent and talented, offering great learning opportunities on a daily basis.  There have been some set backs with the new acquisition by Danone, however the culture remains the same."
good,"The company overall is good, providing work/life balance.  Free yoga, crossfit and pilates.  Director/manager level has issues.  Tend to promote people based on who you know rather than performance."
good,"Do not agree with a lot of what management does and I'm in management, but overall its real good place to work for pay and benefits."
good,Each position is demanding with very little down time.  They gave the employees various activities to join to help the community.
good,Whitewave is a great company to work for but I am interested in my Associates degree in accounting to work for me. I have worked over 25 years and manufacturing and am ready for a change.
good,Whitewave was a great company in the beginning and then it went public and everything changed.  I really enjoyed my time there and my co-workers as well.
good,Love this job. Management tries but are held back by corporate to make more and more product per month as other plants in company cannot perform.
good,Enjoy my day-to-day work and relationships with others.  Very fast paced and challenging.  Everyone is striving to do better and create better ways to do things.  Great team environment and atmosphere.
good,This is a growing sound company. There are some questionable processes going into place that have been a cumbersome addition to the daily processes. It is mostly growing pains as the company continues to get bigger and bigger.
good,"Maintain and operate, trouble shoot any problems concerning palletizing.  Receiving and labeling multiple lines of product. Ensuring all labels of product is correct."

good,"Maintenance meeting then work assignments, troubleshooting line calls. Worked well with all co workers and I enjoyed the challenge of the position."
good,Was a very nice place to work. Sure there some management that could be better but it was a pleasure working for them and would gladly go back. Also tell many people there a good place to work.
good,Typical manufacturing job. Good pay for job duties. Long hours and off shifts. Must be able to work weekends and holidays. Production schedule is up and down. New programs created.

good,"I only left because of a lack of advancement options, but other than that I enjoyed working at WhiteWave Foods."
good,Great culture of collaboration and keeping everyone on the same playing field. The upper management was very reasonable and provided the necessary tools for success.
good,Loved working here. WhiteWave has a wonderful corporate culture and employees are encouraged to learn and grow. The benefits are exceptional.
good,"The process of moving all the antiquated legacy systems into SAP has been an arduous task.  There are many milestones yet to accomplish with regard to old processes being replaced with newer and better ones, but with willing participants, the company should see the positive outcome sooner rather than later."
good,Great place to work. Should have it left but had to relocate. It is truly a dream job especially night shift. Culture is great and relaxed and not cut throat
good,They are very invested in their workers and there are a lot of perks. Cafeteria food was very good and super cheap. it is a great place to have a career
good,"I can actually say I loved working for this company. I stayed 8 years and decided to relocate the state. left on perfect terms and would recommend anyone to take a career at this facility. It is a family environment, the hours are long but the day is filled wilt support and good management. the hardest part for anyone with the job would be getting accustom to the long 12.5 hour shift. I enjoyed most about this job was being recognized for accomplishments and he advancement that was offered to me to grow."
good,environment-friendly surroundings satisfying workload
good,"Best and most professional company I have ever worked for. Staff was highly qualified and very talented. The work environment was professional but laid back, and team oriented. The Denver area is beautiful. I left only because I could not sell my home in Idaho and had been contacted by a recruiter in that area."
good,My day was continuously productive and there was always something that needed to be done. Some of the reasons i enjoyed working here was for the simple fact that i had a great team supporting me and helping me to grow within in the company. The hardest part of my time spent there was the day i said good bye to everyone after being offered a different position with a different company.
good,White Wave is a great company for anyone looking for full time work in a friendly environment with wages that can't be beat by similar companies in the area
good,"* I would go to work, see if their were any fires to put out. Attend an operations meeting, go over my to do list by priority, add whatever needed to be added and work diligently to complete all tasks while keeping an open door policy"
