bad,They send you all over the mountains and don't pay you for any drive time. Too much to focus on even before you get to your jobsite. Need to find a better way to let the technicians know wether or not they can perform their jobs before you get to a isolated site. Way too many pay cuts!!
bad,"Be patient with your job search and don't settle for this job"
bad,To many negatives to list. Christian based organization that discriminates against other religions! Over work for no compensation. Lied about everything with no company support.
bad,MASTEC at is a joke. They treat their technicians horrible. Very very poor management. Technicians are overworked underpaid. If you’re not a 20-year-old single person this is not the job for you they don’t like anybody with a family. Do not go to work for Mastec! They are dishonest they short you on pay when you try to get your pay fixed they tell you do you have to take it up with HR and then HR tells you to take it up with local management. Human resources for Mastec is a joke all
bad,Disappointing and stressful. The good personnel gets overlooked and pushed out. You get treated as a stat and not a teammate. This company is only good for short term employment. Especially if you can get over being lied to in your face.
bad,"Company has declined steadily since AT&T purchased Direct TV. No advancement opportunity, No pay raises,  No job security, No reward for doing your job well. I've worked for Mastec for close to 10 years, and now see the end is near, my pay has dropped in half since AT&T took over Direct. Mastec is becoming ridiculous to work for, there is no loyalty or incentive to be a committed employee."
bad,"I worked two weeks pulling 5 days of 15 hour days, and brought home $421.68. nuff said. I quit immediately after. I got paid better while in training."
bad,"I spent several years of my life working for this company only to get treated like another #"
bad,Definitely would not recommend working there. You get paid by the job (piece rate). You are not compensated for travel time which could be four plus hours a day. It is a poorly run company
bad,"Unless you are living at home with your parents and have no bills, this is the job for you. Ridiculous pay, you can work tons of hours a week and get paid under $400 for a two week pay period. I lost my car due to my checks being so small, cant pay my house payment and other bills.  They cheat you when it comes to pay. It'not salary nor hourly, its per job. And"
bad,"If you're an Installation Technician from any other field, looking for a different experience, don't apply for MasTec AT!"
bad,"It was worst work experience  I got it. My supervisor he didn't know anything about anything. The company against connectors alawys they looking for anything to take your money."
bad,U work to much and u naver have time for family and they pick eveything apart and u naver get s brake and u have to worry about outer tech taking jobs
bad,They treat you like they are doing you a favor to work there. This is the only company I have worked for that every year I made less money per year. Cost of living goes up life gets more expensive and you go broker. Management say they care but act COMPLETELY the opposite. They also keep adding rules and regulations making it harder to do your job. If you're thinking of working here consider working at a gas station because you will most likely make the same money with a lot less stress. I moved on and found that my hard work and talent was more appreciated somewhere else and now and making more than double the income with half the hours. I will always stay techy and enjoy what I do. MasTec is good at making you feel unappreciated. Trust me they will turn their back on you...
bad,"Run, don't walk.  This is the worst job I have ever had.  The work itself if challenging, but management, warehouse, and dispatch make it 20 times worse than it needs to be.  "
bad,"No life, they route technicians 2 hours away from home expect them to work very late then drive back for 2 hours and not get paid, local management just simply dont care about any body but them selfs, they preach safety, quality of work/life balance and yet 99% of technicians leaving this company its because those exact same reasons.The only decent thing this company provides is benefits but after working for them and not being able to have a life after getting home almost every day after 9pm sometimes getting home past midnight (fact cause it happened to me a lot not for being a slow tech, it was for having to work 2 to 3 hours away from home and expected to still be picking up work after 7pm) After going through all that are the benefits worth it, like having insurance? cant even use it since there is no time to even go to the doctor cause the only time off is to let your body rest and get to meet the family again. If technicians try talking to management about this problem almost in every meeting they are ignored and accused of being bad employees. Leaving the house at 5:30 am every day to be at first job by 8am drive between jobs very often 45min to 1 hour apart, spend more time driving than making money (piece rate). This is a big issue in this company and they know it they just simply dont care. Remember attending a roundtable meeting with HR and Managers to improve moral and employee retention. Manager started talking and oh boy!"
bad,"MasTec is a great company. They treated me well, took me under their wing. MasTec's employees are friendly and good hearted people. Unfortunately I wanted to change routes and pursue a different career."
bad,". Racist and discriminatory, managers with no managerial training, None of the Companies Policies and Procedures worth the paper it's written on!! Full of family and friends."
bad,"Mastec AT is not a good place to work, very stressful and continual pay decreases, the company's only interest is profit margin and liability and will take advantage of their employee's to attain those goals."
bad,"Low pay, crazy long hours. Piece work pay so if a job goes down you dont get paid. Will work 6 days a week for atleast 6 months of the year. Management is very shady and clicky. Lose a tool or it breaks and it's a nightmare to get another one without being given a hard time. Rules change literally every other day. 0 work/life balance. Try having personal time when you work 6 days a week and 65 to 80 hours."
bad,"Highly recommend not working here "
bad,"Go in at 5am to load your work van for the day, drive hours without getting paid between calls even if is is a 2 hour drive you get $0, no support from ANY of the management and they do not care how long you are out. Work you as many hours they want 6 days a week. I was out until 1am at a customers house and fell asleep behind the wheel driving home. Did they care? NOPE!!!"
bad,"bad managerial attitude towards employees ,"
bad,Horrible place to work..You will not be compensated fairly for work performed..Outragious metric score-card standards..Substandard work conditions..Management was poor from upper to lower levels...You will be treated as just another number
bad,"Jobs were assigned by the manager and include 7 or more jobs of which you were expected to complete before going home. Toward the end of my employment we were expect to work 6 days a week. The assigning of the jobs was nothing more than stupid. I would assigned jobs 60 miles from my home only to find out techs who were closer were given jobs in my neighborhood. To top things off you were charged $35.00 a day if you didn't get your truck back to the shop, which closed at 17:00."
bad,Managers could care less if you or your family was sick. Written up every day you miss. Pay per job decreased and extra duties added to your job with no insentives.
bad,Horrible place to work. Never home. Work dark to dark. They play favoritism where they give all the installs to certain employees while you do all the horrible work. Company gets big money for installs and you get 20 percent or less of it. For example a 3 box install would pay about 250 to 300 dollars and you will only get 30 to 40 dollars of it.
bad,"work till you go to sleep, less money every year and worked more hours.  Management was terrible with no room or point to advance.  Very shady company to work for. Good luck!"
bad,"long hours and decrease in pay over time. early mornings once a week, crawls, attic and outside work make for nasty days,  time not paid for after hours work"
bad,Management lies to employees so they meet there numbers. They keep bonuses that are for employees earn and hide them away. Also they ridicule you for everything wrong from customers calling dtv to there internet from att is off line. Then they punish you for the customer calling in.
bad,"Long hours, low pay, constant ""charge backs"", rampant racism... we literally had to fight for equipment every single day.  The fleet manager didn't know how to use the vehicle monitoring system and would constantly lie about it to try to cover his tracks.  I would never go back."
bad,"They hire just anybody so that’s a plus. Their HR department is extremely biased even though they have limited contact with employees. They are more concerned about whether you are wearing the right shoes or not, than they are about whether the work is being done properly. They have so many software applications they use but you will have access to almost none of them. That add to your work load a tremendous amount but the pay is not nearly what people deserve. They have agents/leads/supervisors that do nothing but harass the employees that actually do their job just because they personally don’t like you. This is one of the most unprofessional poorly run companies I have ever worked for."
bad,"Overworked and Underpaid. Technician works 10 to 12hrs daily, then is only paid for half the work day. 6hrs. Unpaid drive time, techs are forced to drive for multiple hours everyday unpaid."
bad,Not the best organization inside the office. Management was not caring for employees. Company did not pay well enough. Schedule was inconvenient and strict for me making it hard to go back to school. Made some new good friends. Some supervisors were very unprofessional. Some technicians were also very unprofessional towards the dispatchers.
bad,"Bad place to work ! Mastec does not care about the techs yes the ones that make the company money. Micromanage everything you do . Don’t be tricked into thinking you work at your own pace because you don’t. They decide what jobs you will get for the day and where you will be working .. never near your home. What you put into it is not what you get out of it lies . I was reading the reviews and most are true very true . If you are not kissing butt or buying food for the them or taking home cooked meals to a supervisor or site manger plan on getting the short end of the stick ALWAYS . I worked at Mastec in corpus for 5 years . At first it was great fellow techs always willing to help each other out. Don’t dare ask a supervisor they no nothing about the system and everything about running a business yeah right . They push you to sale a Directv protection plan . Supervisor will tell you just to get the signature to get their scores up. Lots of bs they make you do that is against company policy trust me don’t get caught up in that mess if you decide to apply .  Do not recommend and wish the SUPERVISORS , RDO,  VP OF MASTEC WOULD READ THESE REVIEWS AND  CHANGE IT . THE TURN AROUND ON TECHS IS HIGH. in my 5 years I must have seen 100 guys and girls apply and all quite for the same reasons . LAST THING DO NOT APLLY FOR THIS JOB IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY OT JUST LIKE TO BREATH . WORST JOB !! Stay away !!"
bad,This was a horrible place to work. The site manager was a drug user and a jerk. They constantly messed up my pay check. They tried to take money from my check several times. They sent me to every nasty house in the area.
bad,"This is not a company that you should work for. The expectations are unrealistic, Back charges and nickel and diming is the norm, Combative warehouse management."
bad,this is a bad place to work.the pay is bad .the people you work with are bad. just bad bad bad.you must pay for every thing your time wasted and not seeing your money.
bad,"You are paid per job, not hourly, with jobs often being 2 hours drive. So, you're out 12-16 hours a day with actual pay for only 7-10 hours of that day. Some jobs pay $23 but take you 5 hours to complete. They always promise to pay you for the actual work, valued at much more than $23 but they rarely approve it. They tell dispatch you live 2 hours away from your home, so all of your jobs are hours away from home. If you aren't one of the ""cool kids"" you get crapped on. Very few people are a ""cool kid"". This location is truly run like a high school drama club. They charge $80 a paycheck for use of their van"
bad,"Long hours and strenuous work that does not match your pay. You work outside in all types of weather. "
bad,"management is terrible that's the worst part of the job working here "
bad,No life.. Extreme micro managing.. Bias supervisors with hidden agendas. Preach safety is #1 yet do not practice it. Will have u working on ladder 30 ft up with winds at 65 mph.
bad,The director I had was great and very knowledgeable however when new management took over it became a terrible place to work.  Their objectives changed with the wind.
bad,this is really hot hard and hot work. installing satellite tv for direct tv' they need to be installed on the southeast side of buildings. this means your always working in the sun. from sunrise to sunset.
bad,The time I work at MasTec I never know if I had a job the next day or not. I literally had to wait until the next morning to see if there was a job on my iPad. I was called too many times by my supervisor to have a good day the next day because I was not needed due to no work. After 2 manager changes in less than six months and a very unstable working dish it was time to go.
bad,"It's not worth it. Over 12hrs a day, drive around most of the time with no hourly pay. There will be days were you will make no money. Company doesnt care about their employees, I worked there 2 yrs. Just don't, take my word."
bad,this company and its management does not care about you or the customer and will blame you for the problems that they caused
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had in my entire life. Everything about it is a joke. The company is disorganized and unprofessional when it comes to it's employees and customers.  Yes you do work long days, but time flies by so that wasn't an issue to me... Just the complete ignorance and incompetence of ""management."" I would not recommend anyone work for this company. The pay may seem good, but they'll find every way they can to screw you over for no good reason."
bad,"Management doesn't  care about employees and their corporate department does nothing about unethical behavior from management team members, Not a good place to work."
bad,"Underpaid "
bad,"you need to work with out managements and they will ask you to do a lot of things for free "
bad,"They were not friendly accommodating or anything. they fired me with no explanation after i got hurt. I was out for 3 weeks, and once i was released they simply acquired all my equipment and left me hanging."
bad,"Started out a decent job, the money was ok. Became a nightmare when policies changed making it difficult to make money. Mastech will monopolize your time and offer little in return"
bad,"This place is a joke the supervisor's act like they are the king of the world. The management tells you do"
bad,pay was not what was told pay was very low. had to pay for own gas in a company truck. the only good thing was that I work on my own and no one ever bothered you
bad,"Paid by piecework, and timed for each appointment, Long days, long hours, no support from management- they will get mad at you for calling them, and dont answer half the time, and tell you to call other techs, you are required pick up other techs workload if you finish up your appointments so u can't go home earlier, no time off for family, birthdays, great job for single people."
bad,"You have to dedicate your life to this company, work 75 hours a week and you dont get paid for 30% of those hours because you dont get paid for driving.Would finish at 8 and wouldnt get home until 10. Management is a joke, they only look out for themselves, They can care less about their employees."
bad,Bad company to work for. They don't at all care for the employees. Your day starts at 6 and doesn't end until 9 or sometimes even later everyday. You work 6 days a week and have no time for family life. Days are long and exhausting. You don't get paid for drive time and you drive 5-6 hours daily. The supervisors were cool but the site manager is incompetent. There is no job security.
bad,"Long hours with no appreciation from management or acceptable compensation for your work.  Corporate seems to find any excuse to lower pay rates.  Also their ""bonus"" program is more often than not unachievable.  Wouldn't recommend this job for anyone."
bad,"Sounds good to begin with, they rope you in with lots of promises. When you get started in the field by yourself is when it all goes south."
bad,"The training is decent. After training is over.. Your life is over the supervisors don't care if u ever see your family again. The East Hartford office is a joke save your time and energy and work at Macdonalds, you'll make more money."
bad,"worst company to work for, they dont give you enough training and they send you out on a job and expect you to figure everything out on ur own, you have to keep track of inventory on ur truck which in most cases is so hard to do especially if ur trying to finish quick and go home early, and if ur off by a lil bit u get written up, management tells u should start counting ur truck and take care of ur inventory on ur day off, OH REALLY!!! ya that sounds like a very exciting thing to do on my day off"
bad,Company is disorganized. Trains well in the installation and activation of satellite receivers but not well organized in routing out work for employees'. I left the company after working 2 days in a row for 10 hours each day with no pay.
bad,"Management so unprofessional.  No job security.   No dedication for employees. All they care about is PUSHING OUT INSTALLS, dont care about customers.   Use and abuse you till you cant take it anymore.     Very Bad place of work. If you care about what you do for a living not the place to call home, A job or a career. Funny if you work hard, show your worth they, just push you harder, Those that dont care about what their doing, They let slide by. Unorganized, no structure  no passion nor dedication"
bad,poor management and work ethic. Mastec makes you go to customers home at 5-7 pm to try to squeeze in a 6+ hr install and customers don't want you in their home till midnight or later.
bad,Very good organization but the management sucks. This is a case of hiring and firing. Poor employee management and too many complaints but no praise for the tech who is the engine room of the company
bad,"Its a very horrible place to work, supervisors don't care about you or your family, it's hard to get equipment for your job for the day from the warehouse supervisor. His attitude stink and he don't respect you. The site manager is full of his self everything that's coming out his mouth is all lies. Tampa site is the worst site point blank"
bad,"Drive to job site Install equipment if it was there if not drive to another job site to try to find your stuff and take it back and forth , and drive all over trying to reach some type of standard . thy lie about every thing and want it done know ,and if not you get the blame for all there Mistakes."
bad,the pate rate is piece work to where when you average you hours put in to the pay you get is aweful   they make it to where you drive at least 2 and half hrs to your first job   impossible to move up in pay and also to work 6 days a week
bad,I worked for Mastec as a contracted Technician for Direct TV. We were paid piece work ( By the Job) which at times equated to below minimum wage. Poor communication with management Unsafe working conditions at times.Just an overall bad experience
bad,Work  late all the time when you're traveling and  jobs dropped  on you at the last minute
bad,"This company is a joke. I have been in the industry for 10 years and never made as little money as I did with Mastec. They will find excuses to send you back on job without paying you, and when you refuse they threaten to fire you. One day I had two jobs (yeah I know should have stayed in bed) six hours apart from one another, and no pay was given for the drive time. They also charge you to rent their van, while I understand this industry usually requires own vehicle if you have one they do not allow you to use it. Do yourself a favor and go work for Dish or local cable company. Do not do this to your family. You will not get paid for work you do accurately,and will put you in a financial burden."
bad,You started way too early and worked way too late for way too little.  There was no incentive to advance. Training was almost non- existant.  Site managers were football bone-heads.  Vehicles were worn out.  Getting product for your van was a political joke.  Your spouse better have been making a ton of money because YOU WEREN'T !!!!!!!
bad,"Management leaves something to be desired. You never get your check on time ever and sometimes they don't turn in your hours so you don't get a check, they don't care that you have a family to feed or bills to pay. Just all around bad place to work"
bad,"I like to Thank all the former and current employees for these posts, because I was thinking on employment with Mastec, but the more I read on I will never apply at this company. Another company that lost complete focus on who is the actual worker. They must have that what ever attitude like all the companies that get to big to fast, sales people that lie to sell product and also have no idea what they are taking about, then you go to do the install and you have to deal with the angry customer who was over promised and under delivered by what the sales person said. I work for a not to name huge corporate cable company and the sales staff is horrible, mastec sounds exactly the same. Instead  these companies need to focus on training for there sales staff so they get better on product knowledge how it works and cross training them in the install field so they can see the other side. Instead it's easier for these corporate big shots to just blame it on the tech anther reason why turnover rate is so high also better communication from sales with the tech who is preforming the install, oh that's right they don't care who does the install,  they just want there commission."
bad,"Bad company, very unstable constantly changing the rules.some job you work you are not compensated for.Poor pay scale and the customer sat is confusing for the customer so you get bad reviews.i could go on but it gives me a head ache."
bad,Mastec is a good company to work for if you want to be happier somewhere else. Everyone that has worked here truly disliked their job. Once they moved on to another company they were happier than they have ever been before.
bad,Or my god there is no description for this company their management is a disaster. They do not care for their employee. Direct v need to know about this even thought they know  and they do not do any thing about it. Please do not consider this job you will regret it for ever. Former employee in orlando florida.
bad,This is a place no one should work at. The pay for the job is not worth the pay. They make you work two jobs and only get paid for one. They do not care about you as a person or for your family all they are worried about is if you are sitting in the chair and answering the phone
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of lots of work which wasnt bad! I like to keep busy!!! I learned to work with new softwares and programs and have a dispatching experience!! That part I like very much!! Co-workers, well it wasnt as pleasant as you would hope but when it came to getting work done the team came together. Management i would have to admit was very un-professional, the treatment to the employees was not good. No chance of Advancement, the company seemed to be very unstable and un-organized. Managemnet and the company itself never showed appreciation to the employees for the hard work. Expected so much from employees but not willing to do anything for the employees. Lots of discrimination, and no respect for personal lives."
bad,The payed training is good. But when you get out in the field good luck you are basically a slave. They tell you to not go on roofs because if you fall you won't be covered and you will be fired. But then when you start training your doing the exact opposite of what you learned. It's really screwed up and the turnover rate is unbelievably high.
bad,"Been working for Mastec for two months and must say this is the worst job i've had thus far in life. Management is a joke, they are unprofessional and make you feel like your job is constantly in jeopardy. Warehouse personnel are useless and snide(get used to not getting what you requested and pulling most of your own orders). If you are used to working with a certain level of professionalism and proficiency i suggest you keep looking because you won't find any of that at Mastec."
bad,"Trerible experience and inexperienced management with craig hoivik in charge and workers. Because they good workers and not pay for it.$16-18 I was hired and fired for no reason, they had no complaints from my manager and no reason to be fired. I quit a good job to work here and this is how they pay me and my fam. Of 4."
bad,"I have been working for mastec for about a month already and I can honestly say this is the worst job ever. They work you so much you never get to see your family and when you get home you are to tired and exhausted to do anything.I was recently let go because I had gotten sick with the stomach flu and was in the er so I forgot to call in before 8 and so they marked me down as a no call no show. I was working at an apartment complex here in south Texas with no wind and at least 100 degrees and when I go to take a 30 minute break the supervisor calls me saying I'm taking too long. Upon explaining that I was dizzy and nauseous from the heat he proceeded to tell me I should be working and not resting, this job had taken me 5 hours and all I got paid was 35 dollars. $35 for breaking my back and coming close to heat exhaustion. If you don't mind working for idiots and working in extreme conditions with hardly any pay this job is for you"
bad,Overworked
bad,people in wrong managment positions.Not a healty work enviorment. Not structerd.
bad,"I was not employed here long, after I finished there training course for satellite installation I was told we would all be provided a company van to drive to our jobs, everyone who completed training received there van except me and another co -worker, they kept promising us we would get our vans but expected us to use our own gas money and vehicles to drive from job to job some being hours away from my home, as the warehouse is in Martinsburg and I live about and hour and a half away from there. They only payed $10.00an hour and there was no way I could afford to commute from one job location to another job location."
bad,"Their is nothing more to say then just don`t do it. You will be walked on and expedited to work like a robot at all time, even when you are sick or sum thing goes on in your family."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Spent three years with Mastec and left on good terms, so don't read this and think it is sour grapes from being dismissed. Mastec uses their employees up like dogs."
bad,Its all based on Commision pay and well you just dont make any money at all.
bad,All past and present employees are suffering from the lack of management. Nsoro employees are blackedballed from other Telecommunication Vendors.
bad,"The technician is to blame for everything. They don't work with their techs, and even if the equipment fails, the tech reaps the negative."
bad,It’s all numbers for them. Applied for tech years later your selling stuff and doing Best Buy etc etc. Have to beg for equipment. Or don’t have equipment. Beg to get van fixed. Then they will send you to office mgrs father Aamco shop that no one likes to go because you will stay there all day and don’t pay you for being there. They don’t like when you go to other shops . Lost 3 years of my life.
bad,"Usually unpredictable hours, manage has their head buried in the sand except when it comes to micromanaging EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING! An outside job where you mostly work alone feels like a manager is sitting in the passenger seat all day. Their overreliance on fallible inaccurate electronics and performance scoring based on uncontrollable factors makes it impossible to live up to their expectations and be profitable. Promotions are a joke. 8.5 years with the same title and all of my management team was newer than myself, many of which I trained. I had so may supervisors that I lost count. This place has a revolving door that is spinning out of control but as mentioned before, heads in the sand."
bad,Do not recomend it they tell you alot of lies when you are in training that you could make a more money if try to sell and they are constantly lowering your pay cause you get paid by piece
bad,"really poor management, work load varies from one day to the next, stressful job. poor pay structure, and you have to deal with impossible to please homeowners"
bad,Was told I be paid an hourly rate regardless if I made their quota for the day and that ended up not being true they lie from day one they do not supply tools you have to pay for everything and management is very poor no communication at all between management and employees I would not recommend anyone to work here and dont expect to get ahold of any management if you have a problem in the field they will not answer and god for bid you are out past 9pm because they keep sending you jobs you get yelled at because they sent you a job that put you not clocking out untill 11pm this place is a total joke their was 20 people in our class and as of now their is only 2 left and one of witch will be leaving soon oh and they charge you weelkey for the van at 40 but at 40 a week thats 180 a month on top of the toold you have to buy from them so at the end of the work week your lucky to bring home 500 for 2 weeks. This is not worth the time or stress
bad,The job was long hours 6 days a week they train you very poorly and throw you out there the figure it out for yourself most people don’t last for more than a year
bad,I started off with this company installing and repairing Vivint systems. Then slowly they started to incorporate other systems such as ADT. So there you are having to work two systems with less pay than working directly for those companies. I would however recommend this company for the person with little to no technician experience.
bad,"Management is pretty bad.  While I was there it seemed they did bulk hiring to fill chairs for upcoming spikes in workload.  Qualified individuals took the majority of work and responsibility.  Realizing that the standard Project coordinator pay would never be offered most leave within 8-12 months for jobs offering more competitive pay.  "
bad,Bad experience. Terrible management .have no life want you to work 12 to 14 hrs a day  with low pay send far away for a jib sometimes service call if the job not go through you don't get pay and sed to an order 45mn 60mn travel for an order service call with you get $20 for the call
bad,"pay cuts, amount of work has decreased, sub contractors take half the already cut in half work because its cheaper to pay sub contractors. micro managed for the worse. the technician that pays the company's bills gets pay cuts and upper management gets 3% pay raise. cut throat environment"
bad,"no respect for the techs,"
bad,"At the MasTec orientation, they tell you that half the class won't see the end of the orientation. There's a reason for it and it's not because the benefits are great. MasTec is hard work in all climates and weather conditions. They will work you for ridiculously long hours some days and send you home around noon on others. There's a learning curve, and if you want to see a decent check before you reach the 80 hours per week, you will need to invest in some decent tools, keep your truck clean and (although they officially tell you not to con people out of their money) you'll need to be immoral and con people out of their money to meet the company upsell demands. "
bad,You dont become eligible for insurance until after 30 days and it has to be on the 1st of the month following 30 days. Management in the area is terrible and constantly degrade.  Per diem pay is a joke and isnt paid in advance or on time some times paid weeks late.
bad,"To keep this short, this job was a total nightmare!! Doctored timesheets,and poor route/customer assignments. Because supervisors would give friends the higher paying installs, only to send another tech back out to re-do the install and that tech would receive next to nothing."
bad,The site manager is a joke. He makes he makes the supervisors stay office. And provides no field support there is no moral if you leave or quit you are blacklisted by the site manager and you're not able to come back if considering this place make sure you ask a lot of questions before accepting the job. Was once a good place to work really enjoyable but now it's just become very dismal. techs always complaining about how bad it is how they're not treated right how unfair everything is the site manager he plays favorites skip over good techs to put people with non experience in leadership roles
bad,Don't ever work for this company unless you enjoy being underpaid underappreciated. They don't care about their employees just the bottom line.  Day is hard and long and expect you to work until job is complete then turn around and be there by 6:30 a.m. most of the days don't expect to get home until 9 p.m management is lost do not know the cable industry and expect employees to work ridiculous hours and not get paid overtime they are Crooks and shouldn't be doing business for Comcast
bad,The training was useless. You watch videos and slide shows that teach you nothing. The trainer was more into herself and her girlfriend than instructing the class even to the point of telling us to go home for asking questions. Then they put you with another installer who is supposed to show you what to do but they make them work so fast they can't show you anything. You work 15 hours a day for nothing cause of piece pay. The management is useless you call them most the time they don't answer the phone. Worst job I ever had. Would not recommend anyone to work for them.
bad,This company claims to be family oriented but most of the Austin managers will through you under the bus in a heartbeat just to save their selves.
bad,"6 days a week work week, no work life balance, written up for petty bs, 10-14+ hour days. never off on weekends unless you take PTO. bust your rear for moderate pay. pay varies based on amount of WO closed."
bad,you will be paid a good wage but there is absolutely no work/life balance plus management is horrible. You might be working 6 days per week for 10-12 or more per day. Good Luck.
bad,"This place is the worst place anyone can work. They had referral bonuses of which I made 0 because i would not want even my worst enemy working at this place much less a friend or someone i know. "
bad,"the hardest part of this position is keeping yourself motivated with the amount of data entry that is expected. Tasks are repetitive which makes the day extremely boring. New tasks that are assigned consist of more data entry. No room for advancement or opportunity to learn new skills. Beware....there are no deadlines which account for tons of errors and requires long hours. If you are not part of the majority culture expect to be isolated unless you have the ""go along to get along"" mentality. Office politics are an ongoing practice with management."
bad,"too many unpaid miles driving,leaves little time for family,not paid for multiple hours"
bad,"No family life, no peace or job security, you have to record every conversation and keep all paper work to cover yourself because supervisors and management will lie and deny everything they tell you to do. They lose great technicians every day because of management disrespecting and using technicians to make their jobs easier and help their numbers for their bonuses. High turnover due to management."
bad,"Run, run,run.  "
bad,This company will typically contact you via a recruiter who will say anything to get you signed up. You have to buy several of your own tools. You are required to wear a company uniform yet they only provide you with one for a 6 day week and if you want more you have to buy them yourself.
bad,"I have worked for mastec for 6 years. Their philosopy, employees come and go. they dont care retain good employees. worst company to work for."
bad,"If i could give this company ZERO stars i would. the only reason this company has employees still is because we haven't found another job yet, but as soon as one tech does they leave ive been here for awhile and have seen over 20 different technicians come and go cause of this company. that should tell you something about the company mastec or how they run things. But don't take my word for get hired and find out. The job itself is actually easy i love this line of work just not this company's way they go about running everything"
bad,For the first year they were great. Then they cut our pay 4 times and expected more. They wanted us to cheat on signing people up for insurance ( though they didn't come right out and say it) and one supervisor was as dumb as a post and never paid attention to what was going on until the end of the day.
bad,Do not work here I was promised 40+ hours and a minimum of 12 $ an hour but only got that during training. After that I was getting minimum wage and barely ever even 40 hours. Biggest waste of time in my life they totally lied the entire time and always had excuses. Would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,Poor quality of life and horrible management. Managers and site managers are very unethical and very vulgar. I worked very hard for this company and many times was promised a management job and never given the management job. Before the new Dallas site managers came in it use to be an enjoyable job
bad,Company Lacks the ability to compensate technicians with reasonable pay you would have to complete each job in order to get paid if you do not complete the job you don’t get paid and they were constantly taking money away cutting back on budgets for certain things and it became a problem
bad,I had to cancel my daughter's dentist appointment twice because I was sent out of town and rescheduled a third time and they tried telling me if I didn't come to work there would be consequences.
bad,"If you like to be told to do one thing and after you do it the same supervisor tells you, your getting wrote up for doing and denied telling you to do it. Then this company is for you have fun and good luck."
bad,"Bad experience,there is a business under the table with jobs and route if you know people you get a good route supervisors make your days really hard and they put jobs like adt and vivint and the pay is really poor because you never work directly to those companies I don’t recommend it...."
bad,Poor Management communication followed by 10-14 hour days all while being paid “piece work”. Meaning they only pay you for how many satellite dishes you can put up. Some or most installations if done correctly take approximately 4 hours with a lot more being 6-7 hours. You get roughly $55 bucks to do an install. Which equals HORRIBLE PAY!!  That doesn’t include driving hours every day and not getting a cent while doing so. If you equaled the hours with how much you get paid. You will Freak
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. Management has no idea what they are doing. Company does everything backwards. Treatment of there staff is disgusting.
bad,"Well being that they laid off this department less than a year after they created it, I am pretty sure they had no idea what was going on, because I certainly didn't."
bad,"Work 6 days a week, 1hr away from the 1st customer and average 30-40 mins drive on the next , always out of stock of equipment and 30-1hr away to find it on other van, always work on holidays, snow or rain. monthly pay of $160 for the van.  1 week PTO in 1 yr and that’s it. Summer time you need to watch out for insects and snakes in the crawl space, winter time frostbites.  Some supervisors they don’t even care at all. And after the job, customer will rate your performance you need 10 on survey, if you get 1 your in trouble. And you need to submit pictures in everything you do in every house. I will recommend this job on people that no time for family."
bad,they lost there contract with the company that they was getting work thru so i had to find another job i was a laborer with this company and flogger so i flagged traffic
bad,"No training provided.  Management too busy taking care of emergencies and not mentoring employees."
bad,I was forced to leave Pennoni and work for Mastec due to the Dominion Power Strategic Underground Program. It was a horrible move for Dominion and they dropped the company as designers immediately after . I do not recommend this company to any human on the earth!
bad,"Management is terrible. I could hardly ever reach my supervisor as he never answered the phone. I would be scheduled off random days that weren't my off days. The pay is too confusing and they don't tell you all of the pay information and specifications when you get hired, only the yearly salary that you will make, which I made nowhere near. The benefits are ridiculous because the more you make, the more they take out of your check, which is weird because benefits should be a flat rate for everybody. Where is the extra money going?? You get your own work truck and gas card, but I could never get gas because they have two trucks under my name and the guy works in another state! It still hasn't been fixed even though management knows .I just have to call every time I want to get gas. Working here is very unorganized and I wish I would have known that before."
bad,"Basically from 7am to 7pm, installing and fixing satellites systems. Pay is base off install and service jobs. Mastec has cut our pay twice in the last year and a half by $14.00 per install. This is the only company in this field that charges a weekly fee to take your van home. They have cut management jobs on the bottom end were there needed to help the technicians, while upper management stayed the same and are INCOMPETENT! I have been here for over 6 years and it's time to go. Would not recommend this company at all. Corpus Christi gets the lowest pay scale and the cost of living is higher than Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio.This company does not care about their employees, employee's family or the work conditions. Just get it done no matter what. It's all about the management team getting their bonuses."
bad,Poor Management and over stressed work environment that doesn't have to be that way most techs love our job and the work is fairly simple if not for unnecessary stress from upper management it's a you're only as good as the last thing you did good a mishap and you're the worse tech ever
bad,Very poorly managed company . Senior staff was looking out to protect their jobs at the expense of others . lacked experience in their job roles and not effective in developing any team spirit and collaboration in the company. No attempts at doing a good job were ever recognized and this shows in their recognition in the industry and what other companies think of their credentials
bad,This job is a point pay job so if u have a job that has only some points that all u get can’t change much Get company vehicle they watch you like a hawk no speeding no turning to hard note accelerating too fast very strict place He might as will just live it work
bad,"A lot of micromanagement, Fts are nonsense people, some great coworkers, site manager doesn't care, supervisor is a fat joke. Management blames theirs mistakes on the techs"
bad,Very Stressful with long hours and no company loyalty. After many years with the compnany my position was eliminated and I was put ack in as a tech status at the lowest pay. Company is only interested in the  bottom line and not  their employees....
bad,"Employees are not paid for performance. Management is more concerned with playing games and tearing employees down versus empowering their growth. You may not have work assigned to you by the onsite deadline but are given points for not being onsite. "
bad,"This company & job is a joke. The supervisors are a joke also. They expect you to do so much with little pay. They don't pay you hourly so it's paid by the job. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy. Worse decision ever was working for this company smh, so glad I left"
bad,Yo have no life here be prepared to work crazy hours and weekends. No family or personal time. Management is okay. Breaks are 15 minutes. System is base off points.
bad,"Supervisors are rude and unhelpful, there is always a shortage on equipment which is needed on a daily basis, piecework is good but be ready to drive hours every day between jobs and not be paid for it."
bad,Piece rate with very little work available. You will be put in training class with people making more hourly than you doing the exact same training. Then there is no hands on training at all. And when you get to your area everything you were self taught goes out the window and management knows work around but won't teach them to you. And expect to get the biggest installs the company has right out of the gate instead of smaller installs to get you familiar with the workflow and the product. And their install workflow system is highly flawed to the point that it's impossible to make decent time on a job
bad,"Bad training, bad hours, no personal time, no chance of finding good management. worse place ever.  never have i been so depressed in my life then while i was working for mastec."
bad,"I am approaching my year mark at MastecAT as a Field Technician for DirecTV.  In the time I have been here I have seen things go from bad to worse.  The work load since the merger has doubled which on one side of the coin is good given the money you can make is exponentially increased, the other side of that coin though is the 6 day work weeks accompanied with the 14-16 hour days in the heat (which is what were in now) to the freezing cold literally bring you to the point of insanity."
bad,"This company the way it is set up in large markets has no option but to fail. The management style they want you to follow works well in small markets. Larger ones need more support for the Security Manager position. Expect to work 100+ hours a weeks and on your on day off, expect to answer calls from upper management. Mastec will tell you it is your market and call you a part owner in the company but will not listen to requests to what you need to get the job done. The company seems to have a unwritten rule to just burn you out and replace you."
bad,"Since day one Mastec hasn't been very welcoming to new hire employees and current employees. The management is very high strung and not supportive of their technicians as team players. They try to get you on board with promises such as out of town training, work during normal hours of the day. 2-3 weeks of paid training which is no where near enough training. So after shadowing with another Technician for a week then feel to throw you out in the field no where knowledgeable or comfortable to complete installs. Instead they try to sweet talk you into going and doing a 6hr+ install at 6pm in the evening. Then when a customer doesn't want you in their home late at night due normal day lives and schedules Management tries to blame you and make you feel imcompetent. Also your told you will be working in the area of where you live which is a complete lie. Management uses your none paid commute to and from your 1st and last job to their advantage so they don't have to pay for your time."
bad,They are not organized. The upper management is not honest with the employees.  There is no care or concern for the employees.
bad,"I had previously done satellite installing in my life and was completely taken back at how much it had changed. A typical day for me was to arrive at the warehouse to retrieve van, which I did not take home due to a 40 dollar a week charge if you do take it home. From there I would check my first job and figure out what equipment I would need. If I didn't have a piece of equipment then I would have to call other techs and see if they had it and make arrangements to pick that item up. Keep in mind that I was already at the warehouse which has an endless amount of equipment but will not give it to you when needed. So on to the customers house. Setting up the dish, running all new cables(per policy),installing receivers and then customer education. Technicians are graded on about ten different metrics. One is connecting receivers to internet or phone line. Well a lot of people don't have either and that is a hit on your stats. Customer also gets a survey after you leave and if for any reason any question is not a ""10"", then it's a fail and counts against you. Very high stress and unpleasant working life. You have to provide your own drills,shovels and other specialty tools that will make your life easier. They only provide some small cheap hand tools, the aim meter and cell phone. Oh you are also tracked and graded on your driving. Can't go too fast,take a hard turn or hit the brakes even moderately hard cause you will get a call or email. Oh and if your receivers age over 14 days and you don't return them immediately, you will get charged out of your check. Some receivers are"
bad,"This is by far the worst and most stressful  job I ever had. The training you get sucks, and when you get stuck at a customers house and ask for help nobody is there for you. You get paid by the job which means if it's slow you might make 20-50. Dollars a day. You won't have a social  life if you do this job because it doesn't matter how late you're on the field they still send you jobs till they done, some days i stayed working till midnight."
bad,"They micro manage you to death, send you an hour one way to jobs make you pay for everything you need to do the job, and you have to have a truck or van you don't mind working out of. I had a very bad experience working with them. They tired to charge me over a thousand dollars for supplies I turned back in then dropped it after I told them to take me to court for it but of course they took my last two weeks of pay. I would live on the street before I worked with this company again."
bad,"This job is the WORST! I used to work for this company for about a year and a half and as a ""minority, there is a lot of nepotism and politics. "
bad,"Anything you can imagine could go wrong with leadership in this company - has. After reviewing the company a couple of years into my employment, I was astonished how poorly nearly everyone has rated them and in many different offices. They sell you on everything from the position from the beginning to any raises or promotions just to keep you. It's cheaper for them and only when you are fed up and give notice to quit do they try to keep you with a little pat on the back. They pay you very little as an hourly employee and require that you not exceed 40 hours per week. If your work demands increase, they will make you an exempt (salaried) employee and work you nights and weekends without additional compensation. They will take credit for your accomplishments, they adore themselves and walk around the offices as if they are God. They have all gotten their positions only because the person that used to have it quit, not because of their experience or qualifications. They are flamboyant and clicky - show favoritism, specifically to the young attractive women who ironically don't run into these issues and receive rapid promotions and pay increases. They eventually are on the outs though and experience the same mistreatment as all of the other men and women there. This situation is not an isolated incident. They will cuss at you, threaten your job, make commitments to the client for you that you cannot possibly meet and then yell at you and cuss at you more when you don't."
bad,"MasTec Advanced Technologies used to be a great company. Over the last 2 years or so, it has rapidly trended down. All of Management has been replaced from tech Supervisors to President. Department stripped back to one person running multiple positions.  Working under the Advanced technologies division, installing DirecTV, the company owns you and all your time. Whether a tech or management, you are pretty much expected to work from the time you wake up till you go to sleep 6 days a week. occasionally more. Holidays consist of Thanksgiving and Christmas but requires volunteers to cover. Techs are required to take responsibility for more than what they do as well as management. There are known issues with equipment that take money out of tech's paychecks instead of the company's. Managers are expected to work 6 days a week and from 5am to 9pm, or until necessary. No work/life balance. There is always a threat of losing your job. Very stressful work place. The only reason I gave management 2 stars is that there are a small handful of individuals left there that made it worth showing up to work."
bad,they drain every bit of who you are as a person and everything you do doesn't matter if equiptment fails or customer needs a service call for anything
bad,overworked and underpaid position.
bad,"I worked there for six months installing directv. In any given week i was working 60+ hours a week and only recieving minimum wage for 40 hours because your not paid for hours worked, or travel time, only for work completed which is only partly under the employees control. my paycheck for two weeks never exceeded 600 dollars and was usually closer to 400. you can make more money on unemployment."
bad,"Difficult, with low pay for unskilled labor. The ""score"" sheet is set up against you. An employee can lose his raise just because of the actions of the customer, at no fault to the tech. Everyone who works for this company absolutely hates it, but stay because a job is better than no job. That is actually the saying you hear from the management. You can spend 4 hours working on a house and only be paid 20 dollars. Going home is the most enjoyable part of that job. You are paid at piece rate, which means the faster you can install the more you can make. If you don't make enough in 40 hours, they just pay you minimum wage."
bad,The only thing mastec is good for is to learn and get ur certification then people should leave and be a sub contractor they dont care about anyone but the jobs.
bad,Mastec is a bad company to work for. They will continue to add work on you and not pay you for the extra work. Supervisors are a joke they have no training for there position. If you like working for free this is a great company for you. You wont have much time around your family.
bad,Management sucks they don’t care but they want you to care about they numbers so they can when prizes or bonuses while the technician that’s doing the work is awarded a key chain and a thank you  If your pod numbers are right your supervisor wins a trip of his or her choice not you. You get nothing but you need to keep your numbers up or get wrote up and can lead to termination.
bad,Not recommended unless you're desperate. you have class for about 4-5 weeks then an exam before becoming a technician. Company did not give me the company van offered in time frame given. I explained the situation of my personal car and the head manager did not care. Management can also seem racist.
bad,Can’t knock mastec as a whole. The Charlotte hub needs a lot of restructuring. Immediate supervisors are good. Higher than that are for themselves. The systems they use are out dated. They wanna work you like hourly associates but don’t compensate you like your working hourly. The company takes money from your check every two weeks for you to drive a vehicle. That’s not to bad but when you get scored on systems that they want fix and expect you to fix a system they can’t. That gets old very quick. You will always get or have a target on your back no matter how good or bad you doing. If you are not in their buddy system your screwed. Once you let them know that you are not going to be forced to something when you are mandated to so they hate you for it. If you do decide to work here good luck and stay on your toes
bad,"Forced to work after hours. Management cared for profit over employees. No paid time off, no sick leave. Very difficult to order equipment for the day."
bad,"Company is a joke."
bad,"A typical day consists of clock watching. You have to account for every second of your day. You have to be at your job by 8am, regardless of the traffic situation or else. This company does not care about their employees. The safety program they have implemented is about keep money in their pockets. Seems that upper management is extremely inexperienced with absolutely no idea what it take for a tech perform their job. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out how to make money, due to the pay cuts. The best part of the job is the friendship between techs, because that's all we have."
bad,"First year was good but as time went on it got worse. Upper level management was created through friends, not who was the best for business. Typical day was not good."
bad,You are poorly paid work long hours at time 6 days a week You can't plain  nothing dont  you know what time you are getting off of work. To  them you are not a human being Your just a number to a machine to keep working. With really no family time.
bad,some people enjoy it and others DON'T I wouldn't go back even if it was the last job that was hiring. just like I said not for everyone...................
bad,Very poor operation and management. You put in hard work and receive pennies in return. Very selfish company and I will never recommend anyone for this job
bad,"This job was a good job 10 yrs ago but has turned into the company folding in and taking money away from technicians. Wanting you to work to many hours, when situations at jobs make it longer and no help to get other jobs away when run into problems."
bad,"Run as far away as you can from this company. I have worked there for one year. Out of the 15 techs I worked with, 12 have quit, including me. Extremely stressful and unrealistic. Management expects employees to work on weekends without pay!"
bad,"MastecAT in Summerville, SC was an experience.  The money is good if your willing to sacrifice every aspect of your life whether it be family, social and etc to putting the company first.  The hours are long but again the pay is worth it if your willing to go get it.  Management is a joke.  The most commonly used phrase by management ""Make it work"" or ""Get it done"" no matter the situation or problem.  If you are young, single, no social life and without children this is a great job to get lost in.  If you have a family or social life you may want to look elsewhere."
bad,"Job in it self is great but the company sucks. Management doesn't give a shot about you. Lots of broken promises. Example told there was a work/life balance and there's not one. Doesn't matter what time you get home as long as you do your job even when it's unsafe. Warehouse does everything to get in your way. Things you order you don't receive and warehouse personal don't care. They don't check in all the receivers like they need to so when they end up lost you get charged for them. They tell you to get your recipets from them but they take so long to get them checked in you get in trouble causee you will be 2 hours late for your first job. "
bad,"Working 6 days a week 14 hours a day is just not for me. Crawling in attics, running cables in 90 degree weather is brutal. Supervisors want you to work fast even in the first weeks of being alone. Training was minimal. Pay is based off closing jobs at a piece rate."
bad,It's an Ok place to work but not a place to advance your career. The CEO does not care about you. Flexible schedule but a lot of travelling.
bad,"I liked it at first because I started as a temp..after eight months I was made permanent.I was praised for a job well done if you didn't speak Spanish you were left out of the loop and most of the time ignored.Management had no idea what they were doing and when they started losing money they blamed everyone else for their poor management.I never understood the high turnover I figured I would work hard and have some sort of job security.One Friday, I was told my position was moved to another office. The office manager was a joke.on her cellphone all day long picking up men on a dating site and telling everyone about it. Glad I don't work there anymore!"
bad,"I'm a technician for Mastec/Directv and the jobs available during the day are next to none. Most of the time techs are struggling to get jobs and are off work very early. They say you can control your own pay but if there aren't any jobs around, there is no money to be made. It's a great company to work for, but there are too many workers to jobs available."
bad,"I like working outside and working with customers.  Install DIRECTV satellite dish systems including upgrades, troubleshooting and repair"
bad,"The job required you to lift ladders and climb stairs with equipment, but overall I loved working there because I got to meet many different people. My Boss was good he did what he could for me when he could. Very dissatisfied with how HR did me when I was pregnant with my daughter, they place d me on leave before I was ready to go on maternity leave, and then ultimately fired me because I could not return after having a c-section, and could not be cleared to work a week after the surgery."
bad,Under paid no care for how many hours on the job it used to be 4 to 5 $ a client 10 for the main box 25 for install but if you get service  calls all day Its 25 and you rebuild all you take pics of your job than you get scored on driving too they always try to make you think your gonna be fired
bad,"Get what you want coming in door. Raises are unheard of,they will promise you everything you want to hear .then forget as they walk by you smiling in your face. Long as you a machine your good show one sign of being human they try can you."
bad,"Was a great job, very interesting.  Everyone has TV.  Rich, poor, everyone.  You get access to places you would never believe!  Everyone is happy to see the cable guy!"
bad,On call basically 24/7 without proper pay for the work they call you for. Fully trying to control your outside personal life with no compensation. Communication is horrible. Getting assistance from a higher up is next to impossible.
bad,"This company paid well. However, they work you for 12-16 hours per day. With only one break, and minimal sleep at night. (Home by 10 pm up by 4 am) 6 day work weeks and sometimes your asked to work on your only day off. I fell asleep driving after working a 96 hour week. (16 hours a day times a 6 day week) and I rear-ended a small car with the company vehicle. It was deemed my fault and the company took no responsibility for the accedent. But, if you call in, you get penalized. The company is full of catch 22s like that. They have no regard for their staff"
bad,"poor working conditions. no set schedule working 6 days a week only one day off working 10 plus hours a day. paid by the job and not the hour, poor management do not inform employees and fire on spot those who cannot figure out the next move. left due to going to college."
bad,"The communication of policies and procedures was almost non existent. There were numerous times where the upper management could not even be contacted for assistance. The whole process of completing a job was a JOKE. The tools and tactics for performing specific duties was so misunderstood that the upper management didnt even understand it. The company ran on ""passing the buck""."
bad,Mastec as a company is very corporate in that your local supervisor have no say in what is going on.  They will not show you what is wrong just a score card with some numbers on it and no way of proving the numbers accurate.  Also benifits were bad before obama care came about so i expect it to get worse.  And as a tech the house suck and they don't care if your wife is in the hospital or your on your death bed you better get your work done or you will get a write up.
bad,Worked with a types of voice and data communications equipment in AT&T central office facilities through out the upstate South Carolina areas. worked with field engineers.
bad,"MasTec is a dealer company with ADT. A salesman from MasTec was supposed to sale services, different types of packages, for home security to customers, but never sold anything. We were supposed to be doing new installs. Then they changed it up, so now we have to help out ADT and Protection 1 on service calls. If that was the case, I should’ve just applied for ADT and gotten paid more. We did not get the right proper training for service calls. If we ran into a problem we would have to reach out with management or tech support and they weren’t any help. The goal was for us tech to complete at least 5 calls a day. Doesn’t matter if you finish your calls early you would still clock your eight hours for the day, but now they want to change that and will assign more calls until 4:30pm and you must finish all calls. There are times that if we finish early and management would say “we are good for the day or call it a day,” a few hours later we would have to go back to work because another tech is behind and will only pay for the time you worked on site."
bad,"When I started with the company, I was promised opportunity to advance in position and pay. None to which have been fulfilled. In my time with the company , I have consistently worked 70-90hr weeks , have to drive an hour or more to my jobs ( with no paid drive time) , constant negativity from management. There is no job/life balance....you will have no life. They will work you to the bone and you wont have much to show for it. Pay is by the job and overtime is HALF of your hourly average. Not worth the trouble."
bad,it was a great place at first   then i ran out of lube and stgarted taking it raw. constant pay cuts and constant increase in work load and what they expect from you. its a piece rate position and they find any way they can take money from you and pay you less
bad,no time for family system in place is set up to punish the tech for missing equipment and damages to property so be careful.. Waking up at the peek hours of the morning set meeting days would have to be at the warehouse at 5 am added to a full 12 13 hr work day...
bad,I worked my hardest for the company and did everything I could to make sure I had job security no they through me to the side like a old toy. Because I washed my van on my day off and picked up my dry cleaning for work.
bad,"this is a career you used as a stepping stone, but if you can pull off perfect customer service, connecting receivers to the internet, and the 8 other ratings that you will get. this job is for you."
bad,A company more worried about the numbers then customer service.
bad,great employes to work with hardest part was having to get in to attacks to run wires.management would not work with me in a family emergency. i would have to travel to costumers to set up receivers and satellites.
bad,"A typical day at work: significant training responsibilities.  Downside:  no room for advancement.  Pay not equitable compared to other jobs.  Would not recommend,."
bad,I've worked for this company for under 2 years and each department I've worked for was shut down without prior notice which left my family behind in bills
bad,They hire you with a promise of a high rate and after they down play your hours and your wages. Once your working they tell you you gonna make $16.75 the hour then demote your pay after training and tell you the minimum you make is $14.75 the hour then tell you now you earn piece rate! It sucks to go to work not knowing what your pay check is gonna look like for 2 weeks! Several guys would come home with a bi-weekly check of $800 that's like working minimum wage at a temp agency! Also they never give you work in your area! You must be at a customers house 8 am sharp mind you your commute could take you up to 2 hours depending on your home address and you don't get paid for drive time to customers home!
bad,"work all day, doing a little of everything: rigging, inventory material,"
bad,As a tech you do not get paid for road or travel time which is often a large majority of your day and training covers basics which is hardly worth anything. The most useful thing is provided at the end of basics HANDS ON EXPERIENCE however it lasts anywhere from only 2-4 workdays depending on your mentors schedule which is absurd.
bad,"you don't know when you can get fired, which can happen at any moment, people are quitting everyday because they are soo straight about some little thing, even is not your fault, you can get fired at any time do pleuse don't consider that like career"
bad,"Horrible management, bunch of lazy people who don’t do anything but breathe. Training was fine because I worked under a mentor. You go through a “dispatch” to get your work but the moment you hit the field, managers don’t answer the phone and “dispatch” doesn’t respond so who knows when you’ll get a job, or one that pays enough to make it worth it. They give you an email, then they send you 1 important email in a 1000 junk emails, and expect you to see it within 24hrs. If you don’t respond within their unspoken timeframe, they’ll fire you or threaten it yet they can’t pick up the phone to answer you or even call you instead of email (it’s 2017 and directtv, come on). The WORST experience with a company ever, loved the job but MasTec is like the army. Offer you great benefits and make it sound amazing, then you start and it’s a bunch of BS."
bad,"Used my own PPE"
bad,"It used to be a good place to work ."
bad,"I would never offer this job to anyone of my friends or family. "
bad,You can have some pretty easy or very difficult installs to do. Some houses are clean and others arent so clean. Be prepared to go crawl under houses and you never know whst your're gonna get.
bad,if you are single and have a simple non busy life  this might be for you.   no set hours done when they want you done. overall stressful job. some sections underpaid. every department is fighting against each other
bad,"So... let me start off by saying that working for Mastec helped me out tremendously. I was in a bad pinch for a job after loosing mine of 7 years. I will forever be grateful for that. "
bad,"Very long hours, for very little pay. "
bad,"Its Walmart, what can I say. Its an okay place to work but I wouldn't say it would make a great career choice. but that's just me. it can be a good family oriented place to work though."
bad,nothing good here they only worry about numbers that are not accurate. company always does all layoffs at Christmas every year. Expect you to work on vacations and days off. then it is never enough and managers do not even understand what your title is . if you are not in the group you will not advance
bad,Worst place you could possibly find work. Will hire anyone but treat employees terrible. No time off. Will call you once you are off to go back to work and if you don’t they will threaten to fire you. Absolutely terrible management
bad,I personally would not recommend this company to anyone. I'm home every night but that's pretty much the only thing this company has going for it. Upper management is the worst part about this company. They do not care about their employees.
bad,direct supervisors where great but there is a lot of shady stuff going on in upper management with new contracts and pay not recommending this job to anyone unless you are a single person without a family because they keep you in the dark with confusion.
bad,"They are the worst company I've ever worked for. The leader ship is lost, they blame you for everything they do wrong. I wouldn't waste my time with the company."
bad,I really don't wish to be disparaging about a company that may be right up some people's alleys and actually work for them. I will say my experience with them while having a family was not conducive to me supporting my family. I will say the benefits are decent though.
bad,"the job was not too bad, but when you came into a bind management always seemed to throw you to the dogs, over work you everyday, didn't care if you were stuck on a call, until midnight"
bad,multiple jobs booked for same time. can not get to every customer. do not care about quality. just sales. not a good place to work if you want to do a good job
bad,"Management has a few personnel who are bringing the company to the ground. Everybody is leaving them, and they are not expected to stay in business for long."
bad,"The company was extremely disorganized, the employees regularly stole equipment from each other, and supervisors looked the other way when policy was violated."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to work there! Management is`nt right,and they do`nt treat the techs right."
bad,This job offers no advancement. They micromanage you. Ridiculous mangers. Worst company I ever worked for.
bad,"Daily meeting, pushed to make appointments on time, no help from the supervisors. Piece work pay, which means people get paid by the job and not the hour or salary. "
bad,"Don't do it. It's all true! I just turned my van in, no one there cares if you starve or not. They will take your hourly away and then expect you to know everything after the training with a guy that could care less whether you learn or not what he is supposed to teach you. It totally sucks, the customers want freebies and want you to do free work for them. DirectTv makes all kinds of demands on you even though they are not paying you hourly. They expect you to have a smile on your face when you arrive at a customers home, when you know that you are about to get bent and they are about to try and make you wrap that house with cable and they will want it for free and then you walk away with a measly 45 to 60 dollars. After you spend about three hours doing all of that they will want to give you a bad review after you leave their house. Mastec will then give you jobs at 5 pm, when you've been at it since six that morning for a meeting with supervisors who threaten you with loosing your job. It's the worst place to work. Don't do it, you will notice that people leave and get hired weekly. It is a revolving door, they hire and hire and hire people all week long 24 hours a day seven days a week. It's a complete nut job of a job, if you are crazy you will work here for very little money and will survive on all the lies and stealing that you will do to customers. The people that have been here for longer than five years are either scamming the customers, and the company and pocketing the custom work money, or they are completely insane for working so hard for so little. The smart people"
bad,good place to work if you are trying to learn skill or trade you can learn how to lay pipes plus have fun on the way the hards time was to see them go
bad,"but 14-20 hrs almost everyday and 100,000 miles a year is too much."
bad,Job was great at one point. But went downhill as satellite installs left. Company became centered around keeping upper management happy and not caring about the lower levels of employees.
bad,"The manager of our team was a total joke. Didnt listen to anyone. The upper management states they are there for you, but when you address an issue, it is extremely ignored."
bad,They constantly are making up more rules just to fire people. And if you break those rules they tell you to be straight out with them and they will work with you but you tell them what's going on they just try to put you on a final or terminate you. They stack way to many Job's on you in single day. Technicians were only going home just to sleep and wake up for another day of working a full day. Instead of raises we got pay cuts.
bad,fair work place just has limited management and training resources. short staffed and over worked and the always taking money away. this job is not hourly
bad,"Long hours and strenuous work that does not match your pay. You work outside in all types of weather. "
bad,in this company you have to improve everyday in rush again the cloock because the paid wasproporcional to the job done.the co-workers were really friendly and the gave you a hand all the time in the job.
bad,"The company purposely hires people they consider to have less intelligence and then mistreats them. The level of prejudice that exists is astounding. The pay is low, the benefits are that of third-world compensation and management is less interested in leadership . The company is built on the back of un-professionalism, with leadership using abusive language and mistreating technicians. The company does not like to pay for work performed and it uses this to leverage excessive work out of employees."
bad,Mastec was a contractor for Cox Communications until they were not happy with the pay and did not warn us it was our last day. We were transferred to Florida with no perdium. We drove the company vehicles over night to a hotel that the company had not even set up for us. It was not guareenteed mooney either.
bad,I loved the job for 14 years.  New management and new company goals caused too many ripples. Improper management training; long hours and very demanding company expectations kept me from home.  Ultimately led to my separation from the company and my now ex wife. The company doesn’t care about your personal life even though they tell you they do. If you’re thinking about doing satellite installs go to a contractor.  You’ll be happier doing the same work for people who care about you and your family.
bad,"Will lay you off for no reason. "
bad,Worked for Mastec as a contractor for At&t Digital Life.  Worked 6 days a week and they wanted us to work 7 days a week.  Worked 10 to 12+ hours a day month after month with no end in sight.
bad,"Mastec's sole interest is making money, face value they seemingly show interest in their employees. However, behind the scenes they are verbally abused, talked about and discredited by their superiors in most shops."
bad,"Where to begin......"
bad,"Management wants you to work 14 hours a day and thank them for it. Its always about doing more for what they pay you. Advancement is only offered to outside candidates. Dangerous work environment. Warehouse was open to employee misconduct, technician smeared blood through all areas when he was reprimanded and it was not cleaned up, technicians would openly threaten coworkers with retribution if they didn't like job assignments. When my department was closed I was given a 1 day notice and not offered any job options within the company."
bad,The work was unfairly issued out to technician who had favor with the dispatcher. The System would crash constantly during installation. The customers had a difficult time register their account for service.
bad,The employees barely know what they get paid for. I worked my butt off for this company and barely got paid any money on piece rate. Employees complain everyday about their checks and how this company is only growing by cheating people and making it sound good to get workers to work for them. A lot of employees quit while the other half is only working until they find something else to do
bad,"Work hard nearly every day, negative work environment, little time left to take care of your own needs, no time for family"
bad,"Horrible company, worst job of my life, jobs never guaranteed unstable pay horrible management company doesn't care for employees."
bad,"I've worked at this place over a year wit almost perfect attendance.Still wit in-house company rules concerning promotions, I was still not promoted along with other techs."
bad,"For the most part, it's true that this is the lowest paying job if you're smart enough to add up your hours of work. The job isn't hard, but it's not easy and it's not for everyone. I'm not going to go into to full details of the job because most of the bad reviews are so true about this job. But if I can truly help someone make a good decision about accepting this job. Only do it if you know you just want the experience, and to use this experience to get something better. THIS IS NOT A LONG-TERM CAREER."
bad,"I used to work for them and even had been promised advancement. Once the person left the company I was fired and so were the higher end techs. They do this repeatedly. The only ones that will stay are the supers and they will continue to train new up and coming installers. This will only be a temporary position. They will make you train new installers. Everyone gets fired when they get evaluated for a raise. I was working 7 days a week with only 4 days off a month if at all with less then $30 a year working in hurricanes and no benefits and working in other dangerous situations (think of cottonmouths, they will make you work under a house that is infested with them)"
bad,"If you want to work long hard hours with little to know support from administrators and management, as well as a lack of financial compensation for doing so, then this is the employer for you. "
bad,"Working for MasTec was not only unprofessional , but also very uncomfortable. The inappropriate conversations that went on continuously was just not ok. Management did nothing about it, about being confronted and informed numerous times."
bad,Paid by the job. Being forced to clock in/out at job site and then on the company time clock when you don't get paid by the hour. More time driving to jobs due to dispatch not placing them close together. Long days due to not being given time to do specific/hard jobs and not being able to return the next day due to tight scheduling.
bad,could have been a great place to work if not for poor local management.   They were could at planning but very poor people and management skills.   I can only assume the higher level of management hired the local management team so I have no faith in upper management at MasTec
bad,"45k pay cut the last 2 years,  management is horrible, the warehouse doesn’t give you the equipment you order so you can’t even do your jobs. You’re paid by he job but w2 so going to the warehouse or meeting a tech you’re doing it free. You also don’t get paid for drive time even if it’s in a different dma 3 hours away. Oh and you work 6 days a week!"
bad,"start day from 6:30 a.m. and end day at 11 p.m. everyday,  learned form others of how to be a better manager, enjoyed being a mentor to new hires and other supervisors"
bad,company does not care about employess personal life. the work is fun and exciting and would be fantastic if not for traveling assignments that takes you away from the family for 15/16 days at a time. also would be nice to have days off back to back rather then split.
bad,Going to work by yourself was the best part about the job i learnd how to wire up a house and run lines drill holes through walls and do wall drops as well as installing satellites ..the hardest part about the job is working on the older houses
bad,Typical work day a lot of driving and you never know where your working until you sign in.  Piece work pay if it take you 2 hours to get to you job the company is only paying 30 min for your drive time.
bad,"job was stressfull,long days til job was done and travel between jobs out of control and travel time to job not paid for even if it meant getting up 2 hours earlier to arrive on time and getting home sometimes after 10:00 at night without getting paid for travel home."
bad,Terrible company to work for. absolutely no structure in management. Constantly threating your job over things that are out of your control. only thing good is they pay well.
bad,"This company was very disappointing, I started off working at least 10-12 hours everyday. you get payed by piece work not hours, depending on how many jobs you have in a 4 hour block can be overloaded which hurts your overall numbers which they know and make impossible for advancement  in early stages. they didn't properly pay a lot of overtime which there is a big lawsuit against them now for that."
bad,"A typical day was dispatching from home to the job site, which could be up to 1 hour away from our office. They expect you to arrive at 8AM to begin work and do not pay for driving time to and from the job site which is not legal. You were expected to install two systems a day, one of them was usually a premium package which is a 7 hour job. They expect you to get the jobs done faster than the duration given for each job, i would usually get home around 8 or 9 PM. Long days and a lot of driving, i would not recommend."
bad,No happy at all..Never have proper equipment which cost you time and money being that your paid as piece work..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hated it
bad,During peak season which is in the summer there is tons of work and money to be made. However you'd be working 60+ hours a week with little to no time for family. The work isn't difficult however many rules and regulations that work against technicians especially when time is of value for the job.
bad,"Where should i begin....."
bad,"Long hours, I was provided tools for job position, the majority of the time I  would order the equipment needed for my vehicle and I was not issued half the necessities I needed to perform my duties."
bad,"I left my job that I worked at before accepting a job with MasTec SOLELY because I was promised a 4 day, 10-12 hr day work week with 3 days off. This was promised by both Human Resources and my interviewing and essentially hiring manager. HOWEVER, I have been there almost 3 months now and have been working 6 days a week, 10-16 hours a day. "
bad,"Work day starts at 8 AM. No telling when you will get off. Could have anywhere from 2 jobs to 6 depending on the workload. I have learned the concepts of Satellite technology and advanced troubleshooting skills.The turnover rate is extremely high though. Technicians come and go, mostly because the pay starting out isn't all that great but the money comes with time. The hardest part of the job is crazy driving that you could be doing. The most enjoyable part is being able to see the satisfaction in a customer."
bad,"A typical day 6:00A.M start ending time between 6-9 P.M.  You will be working most halidays. Thanksgiving ,4th of july, and New Years Day to name a few. Most of the people how I worked with in the field was great. The hardest part of job is rules changes back and forward from week to week. Best part of job each customer are different ,and you get to meet new people everyday."
bad,it was always a hecti day at work. always some one or something had to square up to u
bad,Mastec AT is drowning as a company.  I was a company man at one point and they have done everything to ruin their name and trust with their employees.
bad,"They don't tell the full truth about being a traveling company, they don't give enough time to preform the jobsite tasks required and always rush the jobsites."
bad,"Management team does not allow front line managers to manage.  Team culture is preached, but only applies to the employee giving everything while receiving no appreciation in return. Supervisors are treated more like administrative assistants than leaders.  Supervisors also have no voice and feel threatened if they speak anything other than absolute loyalty and agreeance to managements directives.  Work-life balance is a joke (14-16 hr days 6 days per week)."
bad,"great people to work for but theres no money to be made..made more money at mcdonalds part time.. not a job for a grown man with responsibilities..if you live with grandma, or you're a bum living with your parents..this is the job for you.."
bad,Management was ok. Really learned how to work computer and learned real good customer services skills from speaking with customers on the phone. It was a very different envirnoment.
bad,"Let's see, where do I start?"
bad,Not the best place to work if you want a life. Long hours but not great on a paycheck. Felt more like a number than an employee.
bad,"In management 12-18 hrs days "
bad,Mastec believs in working you 7 days a week.  They will use contractors and starve out their employees and then when the contrators numbers dont meet the critiria they hire more employees again. Its a revolving door with the higest turnover I have ever seen at a big company.  Management drives numbers down everybodys throats so they can get bonuses from DirecTv but lower managemnet and the technicians wont see it.  Hands down the worst company I have ever worked for and I urge everyone to stay away
bad,Half of the work you do will be for free because mastec is a per job employment. They do not pay they employees for extra work you have to complete
bad,"A typical work day includes me traveling all over St. Lawrence and Jefferson County to install Directv, provide customer service, and to make repairs.  I work on average 60 hours a week and receive one day off."
bad,Mastec's call center acts as a liasion between Direct TV and the Field Offices (technicians and their supervisors). It was our job to calm customer concerns.
bad,"Don't recommend unless you are money hungry and have no other options, when its slow its less than minimum wage, you are paid piecework which is pay per job completed. Typical day when busy has no end time its until jobs are complete, so you may have a small bit of daylight at the end of the day. When its slow Ive gotten off at about 10-11am at times."
bad,Work absurd hours dont get paid for it such as day you may be out for 12 hrs abd only get paid for 5 hrs acutally worked slow periods they expect for you tonsit and wait for work to become available meanwhile you miss out on time with your family they expect for you to travel to another state to work for the same rate of pay when that state may pay more overall this place can use a restructure of upper management they are quick to cut lower employees pay while they still make more themselves our warehouse went from 100+ techs to a little over 40 yet no one in upper management is getting less pay from a 5 billion dollar corporation they dont do much for the little people
bad,the management staff does not care about the success of the workers the always tell you to seek help from your piers no up training the moral and energy is not welcoming the energy in the office i worked out of was bad everyone walks around complaining the money is not great its a piece rate job so when the work gets slow the money you make is horrible.
bad,"I was not respected professionally as I probably should have been. I really liked the boss though...very down to earth and great guy. The business will continue, they require a lot of work and this will continue I think."
bad,"the only way you will make money is if you do have a lot of experience, and if you work super fast with what you have.would not recommend this to anyone who likes to work inside job is not for everybody."
bad,"Run from this while you still can. They don't pay you enough for what you do. The best thing about this job is the brotherhood you have with your fellow techs. Other than that, the pay is not great. The management demands you to do work that they are supposed to do, with particular attention to doing self quality assessments. They require you to take pictures of every wallplate off the walls in the house, even if it was a service call completely unrelated to the system itself. And if its not correct, they have you change everything and they don't pay the proper flat rates for rebuilding systems that were installed improperly."
bad,This company doesn't support its employees. There is not enough training to give technicians a fair chance on success. You would definitely have to have a lot of experience. Piece rate is what you will be paid.
bad,"The workplace was cool, The event started off good until a little more time was spent with the company. No one was properly trained to handle real calls. I was doing supervisor duties when they asked and when it was time to interview for a lead position, I was turn down to a young lady who performance was fair from average. I could schedule my technicians, plus handle reschedule and escalated calls before the end of my shirt. I would also help other regions and other dispatchers. she wouldn't even jump in if we got behind."
bad,"Management can't be trusted.Promises aren't kept and the environment of the company is always talking about a ""family oriented"" company. If this is a family, it's a very dysfunctional one. Stay away!!!"
bad,"Unexpected Jobs added or taken off, long Hours ,Strict Safety Policies, learned to install Satelitte Dish,Dont Trust Managment,Co workers Come and go fast Big turn around,"
bad,Worked piece rate that could either take 15 minutes to 4 hours and still make the same amount.  no raises no incentives.  The employees were good but nothing else..  had to beg for equipment.
bad,"I worked for Mastec for about 3 years. When i first started, I loved it. I made more money than i had at any other job, but I pretty much worked a various restaurants before this, so that isn't saying a whole lot. This company, plain and simple, DOES NOT CARE about its employee's. Literally every thing they do and change is to take money from the technician. They have a metric system, like a report card, which grades you on about 13 different things, many of which are essentially the same and many of which you have no control over. They were constantly changing this scorecard, when technicians were finally able to figure out tricks and ways to get better points in certain areas, they would make those metrics harder to obtain, or get rid of them all together. Everything they do is to save them money, by taking it from you. Don't get me wrong, if you have a minimum wage job now, this is definitely a step up. Its the only company I know of that requires no experience. They will provide you with a vehicle, training and all of the tools needed. Its a good place to START, but thats about it. There is very very little room for advancement. They say they like to promote from within, but thats only to about supervisor positions , which by the way, the average technician makes more than a supervisor. Above that, to upper management, they usually bring outside people to fill those positions.If you enjoy a bunch of BS, then this job is for you! Expect to drive alot (which you dont get paid for) and waste hours of time every day (which you dont get paid for). Overall, horrible company but"
bad,"Work days are 12 to 14 hours."
bad,"I would start my day off by going to the warehouse to get supplies or sometimes for a meeting. Then I would go install satellite tv service at homes that are my list to do. If I needed help in the field, I could not count on management to come out to help me but, I could always count on my co-workers to help out. The hardest thing for me to do was to climbing a roof to get to a dish. I enjoyed that it was something different every day. I learned how satellite tv works."
bad,"Cable related "
bad,"I've been working for MasTec for 6 months now. The pay is not that great and you're gone most of the day. I usually get off work around 10 or 11pm and do not get home until midnight because I have to drive to another city to work because there is little work in my town."
bad,Lots of crawling in homes to install cable lines. Climbing on ladders and traveling long distances to complete jobs.
bad,If you like getting docked for faulty equipment and customer complaints this job is for you. would not recomend as a long term solution to anyone.
bad,"Bad company to work fori would prefer to not elaborate more on this company and be finished with this survey. "
bad,"Piece work pay rate means you're paid per job, but no two jobs are the same. Meaning you will often do extra work for no pay. Also, if workload lightens too much you may find yourself with some free time, but much less pay. No training received for some of the work that was introduced after employment."
bad,"this place has went downhill.  we started off as strictly contract work, but once at&t took over,  everything changed.  the place became unbearable.  and the pay actually went down."
bad,the typical work day at Mastec is pretty based off piece work. If your install doesnt go in you dont get paid. Work place moral was very low and had a high turn over rate.
bad,"mastec was good work. I learned a lot from the supervisor that I was working with, and we had plenty of opportunity for advancement. the tools were top notched tools to work with."
bad,I really did not enjoyed working here becusae of the way managment treat workers as well as how they were short cutting the pay for call backs without any evidence.
bad,"Mastec offered great training and a cadre of people who want to work with you as well as to support you.  The problem is that the piece work pay process and the QC requirements guarantee you will not make much and the quality requirements are becoming more stringent all the time, putting additional requirements on you as the tech.  Not that better work is bad but when you lose your base hourly pay sometime around month 4 in the field your check goes from 1,800 every 2 weeks to 560 and you don't know that until the check hits the bank account.  HR, worthless, and management wants to help but they are stuck in a position where they are trying to handle production and your issue can fall to the side.  Nt to mention your so busy fighting the front battle of trying to stay focused on the next check you have no time to look at the last check."
bad,"Company was great until ATT obtained control of the contract. Slowly ATT was taking the life out of the company. Mastec only cares about metric incentives which have totally destroyed company moral and job satisfaction. Mastec has their core values placed where you can see them however they are not followed. "
bad,I was not pleased working for this company. Mastec promised me a job in the Safety Department and never held up to there bargain. The turn over in employees was real bad.
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs out there, no pay raises ever, no advancement. this job is a joke. literally, everyone who works there is always complaining about how much it sucks."
bad,"After training which was about 4 weeks, they stick you with your mentor to show you the field. Some guys didn't want to help the trainee and let them work alone trying to figure out situation. Then you leave for two weeks out of the month to make little to no money while gone. Definitely wouldn't recommend working for this company"
bad,Management is very hard to get a long with the managers at mastec needed to get some more manager training. My manager was a female who tenned to ack like a male.
bad,work was sparce.  some days you had a lot of work to do then there were days where you would have no work to do.  only good thing about the company was the fact that they gave you a company van do use.
bad,The work load was excessive because they didn't have enough licensed technicians verses the number of jobs that needed installation. No quality control on parts received. Many times brand new parts taken out of the box didn't work properly or outdated parts were sent from the warehouse. No time was allowed to check in parts received from warehouse or inventory your store (truck).
bad,"Paid by piece rate, relaxed job but be prepared to work every Saturday. Very stressful and lack of direction. Typical job day might be 2 hrs or sometimes 8hrs, Your hours varies dependent on jobs. Sometimes you might work other days you may not. 40 hrs is never guaranteed!"
bad,I don't not recommend this job to anyone unless your willing to work outside in all types of weather conditions with limited resources. This requires you to use a lot of thinking and patience.
bad,"My review for MasTec is followed "
bad,Liked the idea of being on my own but some days you have no control of your day.  The nail in the coffin was when I spent all day driving to customers houses that weren't home or had cancelled their service call.  Completed one service call for a whopping 20 bucks.
bad,"Working at MasTec was very stressful due to a majority of the days would end after overtime. I was one of two Pittsburgh employees. We were tasked with taking care of many different responsibilities that we initially were not told we would, without a raise in pay. After being told one thing about how pay raises and bonuses, there were times management would do another. I feel that they were not very honest throughout my time with them. They were dishonest about things that may have made working there less stressful."
bad,Not the best company to work for.They changed the way we get paid.we was getting paid hourly now its by the job.We do not know what time we get off work.i can go on and on.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. The experience i had was horrible. The management is very unprofessional. They expect you to finish work in a fast-paced timely manner, even if you are new. ere several jobs that i've done that were tedious and time consuming, and they penalized me for trying to figure out and learn for myself on my own as a new tech. They were constantly on my tail about the simplest things, and they were very discriminatory. If you want a job with professional management with an opportunity to advance in the field, please DO NOT work for this company."
bad,"I been there almost 6 months and I only do repairs, they will not give me installations to do.  If i do an installation i get timed and only 1 a week if i'm lucky."
bad,unlikely to go back to work after 2x employment. upper management is a total lack of leader to tech understanding of certain guide lines that they enforce.
bad,"I worked here for over five years and it was not a good place to work.  There were good times but for the most part, I stayed because I needed the paycheck."
bad,"its a lot of stress is invlolved with the resposibilities you have to uphold that combined with the lack of pay and the constant whip to install faster makes for an unhappy work environment"
bad,"Contractor for Duke Energy, Basic work hours days are Monday through Thursday from 7:00am-5:30pm. Plenty of overtime oppertunities! Large Turn over rate. Poor additudes from the Management. Did have a have time trusting co workers. Not a very loyal company. Did find some friendships with a few co workers. mornings were the hardest part! Most enjoyable part would be 5:30"
bad,"Monitor 50 call in a week"
bad,"high volume recruiting, unstable management, lots of change, lots of resignations lately, my new supervisor is a micromanager, I am ready to leave asap."
bad,Customer relations was a big part of the job. Install tech. Learned about the satellite industry and how to wire a house for cable TV. My co-workers very helpful. I didn't like being out in all types of weather.
bad,"I can only speak to the Security side of the company, but Mastec is a Telecommunications Contractor with a lot of growth potential. The division I worked for handled the At&t Digital Life contract. The market in which I worked never seemed to balance the work load with the number of techs on staff and the jobs were consistently overbooked, which led to poor efficiency numbers. The average technician would work 10 to 12 hours a day but some might be out for more depending on the size of the installations. The problem was, Mastec mgmt. didn't want more than one tech on a job regardless of its size, which means if the job was supposed to take 8 hours to be done, one tech was dispatched on it. The jobs were almost never without complication which means a install could go over its duration pretty quickly, making it frustrating for the technician but also the customer. There also wasn't a lot of coaching or training available for technicians who might have been struggling in the field due to the lack of feedback from mgmt. There was a weekly scorecard, releasing the Tech metrics but no accountability or support to improve on those metrics. From my experience there really was no positive moral, everyone felt over worked and was never provide any feedback from mgmt. except on forms which generated weekly."
bad,"I personally worked in the Fort Lauderdale office installing satellites for DirecTV. This office is horrible. Unprofessional management who result to scare tactics and profanity on a daily basis.  The site manager doesn't even know the equipment needed to complete one install let alone a whole week.  The field tech supervisors rely on the techs to do everything for them including quality checks, vehicle inspections, inventory management, and more.  Even HR won't help if you need it.  You will be on an island working for this company. There will never be a point where you will feel like your job is safe.  I did a lot of out of market installs for them so I was able to see how other offices worked and some ran beautifully while others were pretty bad too, but there was no office in the 7 and a half years I worked at that was as bad as the Fort Lauderdale office.  You're scored on metrics that you cannot control and charged back for customer callbacks on a daily basis.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because there are some offices that run good, but there is more bad than good with this company.  STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Pay is markedly lower than industry standard. This reflects on the morale of the workforce including management. There is very little care about what needs to be done, who, or how, it's going to get done. It just needs to be done. "
bad,Installing and trouble shooting Directv dish systems. A lot of time is spent driving to locations and not being guaranteed a job. They say you close to home but that is not the case. Actual field training is only a week long and in my opinion isn't long enough
bad,Working with MasTec sometimes constituted in working long days so you really couldn't plan anything with family. You just had to do things at the spur of the moment when you had days off.
bad,"the people there are nice but dont seem to care for you much and just make sure that they still have a job becuase they are always hiring and firing people, they ask you to work on fire island refuse it cause it willl bring your numbers down and you have to push a cart with all you equipment on it and they dont care that you have to hike through sand draging a 100lb cart with you."
bad,"Got called and offered the job almost immediately after filling out an extensive application. Once in training the indoctrination began and you were soon filled with ideas of grandeur and employment insecurities. After the class room training is when the real picture of the company was painted out for new hires. 6 days on working well over what Managers and Interviewers tell you per day. Expected to give you life to the company to complete jobs assigned to you each day. The company as a whole has a high turnover rate, especially for DIRECTV installations. Average employment of each new hire is only 4 months. Not worth the time for the metrics they make you jump through."
bad,The worst thing about this job was having to drive to various places up to an hour and a half with no knowledge of whether you had the ability to install/make money on the job. Routing was poor as well we could have as much as 3 hours worth of unpaid driving to customers per day. I would never work a piece rate pay job ever again.
bad,"My co-workers are ok."
bad,"While not the worst job I've ever had, it was the second-most stressful. The first being in the infantry in Afghanistan. If you're lucky, you'll start out on a normal five day work week, but if you're really lucky, you'll work 10 hours a day. Otherwise you'll be on a 6 day a week schedule working 15+ hours. You do get overtime, but because its not hourly work, the overtime is calculated on the amount of money you made that week. The formula is ""weekly earnings"" divided by ""total weekly hours"" times .5. So if you had a good week making $1000 at 65 hours. Doing the math it comes out to $192 overtime pay. That's less than minimum wage doing the same hours!!! Minimum wage overtime would be $285!!! I'm sorry but working that many hours a week never seeing family or friends for that amount of money ISNT WORTH IT. "
bad,"This is the only job that I had to invest money into. They don't supply all the tools. Just the inexpensive tools that everyone should have at home. I purchased tools before I started work with this company, and during employment. You really don't make any money with this company after expenses. Your day really depends where your routed, can be long hours depending the jobs also. If your desperate for work they will hire and get you certified. I wasn't impressed with mastec."
bad,"This company has it all from working long hours, to forcing you to doctor you time sheet and screwing you out of money even allowing technician with suspended license drive company trucks. The satisfaction of you and your client knowing you've done a darn good job is all to look forward to. They will make sure a promotion is put of reach by setting impossible goals and if you are looking for a career in telecommunications,TRUST ME this place is just a pit stop."
bad,They do not compensate you properly for your hard labor. This company will also blame you for everything done wrong instead of helping you. The benefits were awful and were exspensive.
bad,"I worked there and was a DirecTV Tech for three years. Initially when I started it was the best job I ever had, yes the hours were long but the pay was excellent. Them they dropped the pay which made the morale around the office plummet! As a sub-contractor you are blamed for all mistakes made in the field when in actuality Mastec is more strict on quality than AT&T is. Then AT&T took over the customer service lines and that’s when it all went down hill. The time it took  to change work orders tripled!"
bad,I worked at Mastec for 4 years and as a supervisor for 1 year. and they decided to  fire me just because i had a ladder accident. company was great to work for in the beginning but once AT&T  bought out DirecTV and we got new upper management everything went down hill but cutting our pay about 20%. I am telling you right now this company is not a good company to work for. they will screw you any way they can if they don't like you. and when summer time comes it will get so busy and you will never see your family.
bad,"The work was enjoyable but the stuff that you have to deal with is insane. Inconsistency in route upload, constant system outages that waste your time and money, and horrible routing are just some of things that you have to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,A typical day consist of being on site to the customer house by 8am. and doing a install or upgrading equipment . Also doing a service on the satellite dish. Their is not set hours when being a tech for mastec.
bad,You have to be at first appointment at 8am and you work until your scheduled route has been completed. All upper management cares about is completing every job no matter the situation. If someone isn’t available you have to go to next appointment but then will be required to go back no matter how far away you are which sometimes would be an hrs drive or more
bad,"satellite installation will travel more than 50 miles to do a repair job, and jobs on your return.  Piece work, the work load was not distributed evenly..."
bad,Lots of driving for no pay. Company keeps taking money away from the technician.  I usually drive 2-4 hours per day and don't get paid for it. Have to drive 1hr 15min to the office 1 day per week for meeting and to pick up inventory without pay.
bad,"A typical day at work is going to customer's homes, either providing service for the directv system that they already have or installing one. I learned how to be more handy with all types of tools. Too much  micro-management supervisors usually don't know what's going on at all times. Other technicians that I work along are all cool, most guys will help out the next guy. The hardest part about the job is driving all the way to a customer's home only to find out that a customer cannot get directv due to natural reasons such as, trees blocking the signal, customer not being home e.t.c. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet new people and being able to connect and network with them."
bad,"As far as MasTec is concern, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the management. A typical day is easy work, not hard at all. Per-dem does not cover all of your living expences, when on the road."
bad,"Start at 7am some days at 6 am finish when ever you get all jobs done in the pool. On average an early days is 6am to 4 pm. But between long days paying for tools and equipment, and paying for the ability to have your truck at home. It really cuts into your check. If you like paying to work it's a good job for you."
bad,"this job is for single people that dont care about being home with family, it is fun and very interesting.  Stressful but keeps you busy.  I loved doing what i did and was very good at it, customer satisfaction was my strongest point and would love to return but management is not adequate at the moment.  hardest part of the job is the outdoor weather, heat cold and rain also crawl spaces that exposes you to scorpions spiders snakes and rodents."
bad,"Company is very unorganized, and currently cut piece work pay, low piece rate pay, no pay if customer is not home, no pay if you can't close job, $23 for service calls, and you can be there for 3 hours."
bad,"Your jobs will be a production type ( Install, upgrade, or mover) or (Service Call).  Once you are have completed OJT, you are assigned an area(s) within a 50 mile radius from your home to cover."
bad,I only worked here for a very short time and in that time i was very disappointed with almost every aspect of this company. The pay and benefits are good but almost every other aspect of the company is poorly managed. Its a fairly young company and it shows.
bad,"management has their issues, they push you to the limit and try to make you in a way lie to the consumer so they can up their sales. my co-workers were the best part of my job very friendly and understanding. the hardest part of the job is having to do others work and not knowing the route before starting the day. dispatch is a mess with only 2 dispatchers who would send you a long way away from your zone. when you sign on @ mas tec in the interview they tell you false statements such as you work at your own speed, you can do 2-3 jobs and call it a day, you have to stay in your van on the side of the road or at a rest stop and wait 1-2 hrs too get another job which was ridiculous due to the fact I worked no longer then"
bad,"Management suckedddddd. Had a boss who claimed to help you, but only ever really told you you were doing things wrong all of the time. That's not encouragement. He is going to lose more people because of his attitude. When he was pressured by upper management he would take it out on his workers. My coworker didn't really care about this job. On several occasions she complained that she hated the job and never really did anything extra to help out. Even on your off days at times they would want you to come in and do work at the office. We should have had at least two more people in the Nashville area, but for a good while it was just me and her having to carry out jobs up to three hours away. For the most part I had to make the long trips because she seemed to be our bosses favorite and so she did not want to make those trips."
bad,"My co-workers and  immediate supervisor are great. I wish I had better things to say about the rest of the company. Endless hours, no room for advancement."
bad,"Check for assignment. Call customer to provide estimated time of arrival. Discuss plan for installation with customer. Complete install and educate customer on use of security system. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer education. It is really a joy to see the excitement in customers eyes when they see how the system works. I work independently in the field, so I do not see or talk to co-workers very often."
bad,"Managers have no clue how to operate this business.  The only thing that was good about this job was the ability to work in the field at your own pace.  Benefits were average, but management made it difficult environment to work in due to their lack of knowledge in  infrastructure and business management."
bad,"I started my day at 4:00am and did not get back home until about 8 or 9 at night. My boss was great person to work for. Very long hours, talking to a lot of different people was the best part of the job."
bad,don't work for them. you will not have a life. the pay is not good until your there for 8 mounths if you have the time.. then work for themn . the have a 134% turn over.
bad,Charge backs on jobs when it was faulty equipment not the techs fault.  Seemed like the office didn't really care about it's techs.
bad,A typical day at work is about 140 calls outbound and inbound from customers and technicians.I learned how to manage my time and multitask. My co-workers are very helpful and caring. The hardest part of the job is multitasking. The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving customer issues.
bad,As a Satellite Tech.
bad,"The management was once professional and customer-service oriented. When management changed, so did the culture of the business."
bad,"They make ot harder to make money. They always want you to do more but pay you less. No adavacment,  no raises,  always recieving bad news about the direction the company is going in"
bad,"You are only paid by piece work. You have to work really fast and take pictures of the work and wait for them to tell you to move to the next job. Everything was annotated on the phone and tickets came in on the phone. Some places had no reception and you could not update ticket so you had to drive so you could. You are not paid drive time. Right before I quit we had to had out 10 door hangers  basicly an alarm system fliers. If your ticket was in a gated community you could not solicit, so you had to do it on the way to the next job or on the way home."
bad,Management is great works with you helps out the only problem is compensation is not nearly enough benefits are available but expensive and overall workload has gone downhill and used to be good but now it is slow
bad,There was always tension among the permanent employees and the work environment was toxic.  You were judged on whether you fit in a clique rather than on your job performance.
bad,"Doing the tasks required to meet the customers requirements."
bad,"Days are long. Technicians are treated like second class people. Company constantly changing requirements of job. Do not get paid for drive time, even when it takes 1 1/2 hours to get to next job."
bad,This job was a break for me but to be honest the computation is terrible and the houses are not set from day to day. The have been working 6 days for a solid year and I was never told that when I took the job. Its like they don't care about our lives and all they're about is there client AT@T. Management dose not get it.
bad,Far too much driving for the customer to only cancel.  Your are paid per job as though the time to get there and back means nothing.  Just when you start to make money you get charged back for something beyond your control.  Such as bad equipment!
bad,"This company will drain you for your work efforts and not provide equal pay to what they expect of you."
bad,"As from the one department I was in, there was a lot of disorganization between them and the company they had a contract with. The equipment was sub par and often backlogged, even though it was required for installation."
bad,"No Job Work/Life Balance"
bad,"Company only cares about what will benefit the. No rewards for doing good work, like to focus on the negative. They have taken pay away but have added more tasks to each job. they would rather give work to contractors and have their employees do the service calls."
bad,"when I first started with the company mastec, everything seemed to be great. pay was better than any job i had. unfortunately the company is now loosing money and is taking it out on employee and have already take big pay cuts due to company placing piece rate caps on the technicians which is why i am having to search for a new place of work."
bad,company was great first couple of months then mastec begins to show its true colors. no job security and ridiculous margins set without the resources available to even hit them.
bad,"Don't want to say what department I worked in specifically but it dealt with Corporate and Service Lines."
bad,I enjoyed the work not really that difficult. enjoy working outdoors and meeting new and interesting people every day. Co-workers were great we all helped each other out team work was exceptional. Directv is a good quality product. However management at MasTec seemed more focused on numbers than they were on their employees. instead of helping the techs that seem to struggle they just either pushed them into quitting or found a reason to release them. to me it would be more beneficial to give more training in the area they are struggling in to help those techs...especially after investing all the time & resources to train them than to just cut them loose. But then again they are known for their revolving door..way too much turnover.
bad,They contract your jobs not enough work for the hours you put into it and there's no hourly compensation while you wait for your next job
bad,"This company has a pass/fail attitude towards their employees. If you are looking to revolve your life around your job then this company is for you. Long strenuous hours with heavy travel times, and an unorganised inhouse call center who routs all contracted installations to you electronically on out dated equipment that works after beating and banging through their home fabbed software that they provide no training for yet expect you to be productive and rate you as such. "
bad,"Mastec is a good place to work, if your in between jobs and you need employment soon. But as far as making it a career place to work, no. You don't get paid hourly, it's by the job. So you if a customer cannot get the service, you don't get paid. So if you get hired there, keep looking for work while your there."
bad,The training is very thorough and Mastec provides you with all the information you need to do the job....and tools at a cost.  5 of the 9 supervisors always seem agitated that you call them for assistance or guidance.  A lot of pressure to sell non TV Entertainment products.
bad,"I had many jobs but I can say the strictest one of them all."
bad,"I’m pretty sure the company is going downhill but management won’t admit it. We used to be overloaded with work but now there’s hardly any work, which means small paychecks. I made 40k last year but now I’d be lucky to get 25k. Currently looking for another job."
bad,Typical day required checking inventory and setting up for the day. You learn to be efficient by yourself  due to working alone. not to much workplace culture as you are paid per job and you don't work from a home base. You are given a company vehicle   so see other techs is not something that is typically done. Hardest part of the job is working alone while running cable in someones attic and doing wall drops. Most enjoyable is that you can work at you own pace completing as many jobs as you would like for the day.
bad,"Generally start work at 8am, unless you are at the warehouse for your stock order and for your meeting, then you must be at work at 5 am."
bad,"As a security installation tech, you are paid via a piece rate format.  Essentially, you get back what you put in, so the harder you work, the more money you make.  This, of course, is great, in theory.  However, the reality is the Digital Life system has too many glitches and errors that are out of the technician's control.  As a result, a tech will often spend hours on end, losing money over things that they cannot control.  Be prepared to work long hours, sometimes late into the night.  This is not a job for somebody with a family and/or kids.  When things go smoothly, the job is fun and pays well.  Unfortunately, more often than not, things do not go smoothly and that is out of the tech's control. Also, you will have to pick up and replenish all your inventory at a UPS store.  Unfortunately, the equipment you need is never there on time so be prepared to spend a lot of time driving around and calling other tech's trying to round up the necessary equipment so you can complete your installs."
bad,"It doesn't matter how many jobs you do a day, they will keep you working as long as they can to see a larger bonus in their pockets. Getting equipment for your truck is extremely inconvenient and without it you can not complete jobs and cant get paid. The plus side, free directv and company phone."
bad,"I started working there and thought it was a good career, but the company and coworkers treat new employees differently. Sometimes I would work 10 hour days, and other days I would work 3 hour days. Paid piece work NOT HOURLY"
bad,Work six day a week one day off.  Never know where you are going ot what you are doing.
bad,"They use a piece based compensation plan, so you get paid based on how much you do ina given day. However, as a new technican, you are at the lowest pay scale, and since you are new, you struggle to do a lot of jobs a day. 6 day work weeks and not being very fast lead to long days for a while, with checks not matching the work you feel you do"
bad,"For starters, failure to provide adequate supplies in order to do the job effectively along with the fact that they are paying their techs less and less per job is a tell tale sign that this company is failing. The people who send you to your assigned jobs intentionally make you drive more than you work as a way to prevent you from making the most money that you can. And they expect that you're willing to be ok with this. If you're willing to be ok with living off of $200 a week and working primarily for free, driving all over 2 different counties in order to track down the equipment you need almost daily from other techs then this job is for you. Not to mention, you will NOT  be compensated, it's all for free. It's not an hourly job. You get paid per install/ service call and the equipment that you install to the customers house. Next, most of your job proficiency is dictated via computer. It doesn't matter how good of a customer services rep you are or how successful you are at your job, if the numbers say you suck, then that's sadly how you are judged. At the end of each visit customers are required to fill out a survey, and if they do not give you 10 stars for every question, then you technically fail as a tech and it is held against you. It is your job to direct customers to call the mastec line if something were to go wrong within 30 days of your visit. If they call DirecTV within that time frame for even anything such as they changed the channel wrong, they unplugged a box, it snowed and the dish is covered and there is failure to recieve signal, then you the tech are"
bad,This is a good job but at the same time there is not a lot of time off and you will work every Saturday and it is set up as a 6 on 1 off schedule from the start.
bad,No one helps you the managers just stay in office claiming that they will you but never do your on your own out there in the field and at the warehouse.
bad,This company is pretty good to work for. The hours aren't too bad. You get awesome benefits. There just isn't a lot of room for advancement or raises.
bad,"You will be expected to constantly work 80-100 hour weeks. In the time I worked there (less than a full year) I had 3 different managers. The pay is based on performance so the better and faster you do, the more you get paid. You are given a company truck to drive. The upper management is in constant flux. Overall, I did not enjoy my time there."
bad,Company has no apparent interest in protection of their interests or making claims for change that would result in time extension or cost reimbursement if presented to customer.
bad,"Good people, hard working and reliable people. but management needs improvement."
bad,"everything was great at the beginning from the hiring process to working with the new manager. "
bad,"The job itself was good, but they did have problems with getting the system up and running, there was always system failure couldn't get the customer security online due to certain software programs going out."
bad,Technicians work long hour. Rule and regulations increase amount of time spent at every customer resident or business decreasing possible income gain for day.
bad,"Long hours 6 days a week with only a day off, they want you on a meeting call at 630 in the am that you are not even getting paid for, management does not have a sense of reality anymore after being in a crazy business where every single thing is judged by numbers,work quality means everything but they give you 6 jobs a day to be done perfect yeh right, the management team is set up to where they go down the chain with accountibility to write a tech up for something petty when he is the one working 6 days a week with no personal life,the job pays great if you are good at it but in the long you will pay the toll with no family life and enough stress and craziness to last a lifetime, if you have a family stay away or time will fly by and they are all grown before you know it while you were at work."
bad,"Work Hours Were Good But You Have A lot Thrown On You At One Time , Also The People (CO-workers) Were Very Rude But That's Anywhere You Go As Far As Linework Also Not To Mention Our Team Was Almost Killed Due To Another Coworker Careless Mistake Then The Boss Tries To Cover Up & He Gets Fired After An Investigation."
bad,"One thing Mastec doesn't lack is available overtime.  You can make a great deal of money, if your willing to do the work.   You might find that after awhile your personal life begins to suffer.  One of the most common complaints is that we can never get home at a decent hour.  It makes for high turn over rates, which creates a whole host of different problems."
bad,"a day at work is be at my first job at 8am."
bad,"great place to work to manage life and work"
bad,"long hot days in the summer cold days in the winter, 7 day a week not the job for me."
bad,"I really like the job. Just could not understand the hours they expect you to work. I was never home with my family. And then when I had a day off I was in regroup mode. Because too make money at this job you had better work hard. Because it isn't an hourly paying job. "
bad,Job was not that bad as far as meeting people but had incredibly long hours and not good pay. Medical and dental benefits were good.
bad,Nothing to say about this company at first it was a fun and good olace to work but over the pass 2yr the company just went down hill yiubtry to leave and get a better job they make it impossible for other company to hire you
bad,This job worked us constantly 6 days a week. This company would even call us in on Sundays when we were off making it nonstop 7 days a week.
good,I loved my job however the company is going through some major changes and the compensation is half of what it used to be for double the work. There are no bonuses which make it hard. the job is piece rate but the pay doesnt add up to the amount of work asked of me.
good,"Some supervisors know a lot about the work and some supervisors (like mine) didn’t know how to help me solve issues he would always say he’ll call back and never does, or he will have to find someone who knew the answer"
good,Was not employed long enough to review company. New company came inn with their employees and management team. Specific program I overseen was to be terminated immediately upon completion  of merger.This was not indicated during said process despite assurances to the contrary.
good,"I was recruited under false pretenses, for a job that did not really exist. I discovered this after giving notice at my previous job. They brought me on as a contract employee, knowing I had to accept, under the circumstances. Things went downhill from there."
good,"I was told that my pay rate and hours would be a certain amount and when I started working, it was a completely different and dissatisfying amount."
good,"The people were great, the business was a good place, however some upper management were let to run loose abusing their employees like a battered wife."
good,wouldnt recomend this to any family oriented man. if you like to work in a  company that looks to you as a number then go for it if not then its not for you
good,"Typical contract work, on the road,hard work no one wants to do."
good,Did basic office duties day to day. Office atmosphere for the most part was pleasant.
good,"typical day-Onsite by 8am, done working from 5-10pm"
good,"Field installation, repair, customer service, loading work truck."
good,"Installing satelllite systems is a fun and fast paced job. If the pay was better I wouldn't have left. However, I worked as smart and as hard as possible and my paychecks were horrible. Everyone will tell you that it takes time, and that's true. But if you have bills to pay and a family to take care of, it's impossible to survive. This company pays by the job, not the hour. Mastec uses a metric system for advancement but the deck is stacked against the technicians and it is virtually impossible to meet the goals. People quit all the time and there is constantly a new hire class going on. Getting equipment is near to impossible at times and I spent a lot of time calling other techs to meet somewhere to trade equipment. Part of the year work is slow and you'll starve trying to make money. When summer comes along you'll be on a 6 day schedule and will be working 12-16 hours a day. You will have no family or personal life at all. Management is terrible. The supervisors are competant with the technical aspect of the job but are terrible managers of people. You can choose to take your van home but they will deduct $40 per week for that privilege. Tool and equipment deductions will also eat into your pay. I was able to to stay for 8 months and the biggest paycheck I got for a two week period was clearing $703.00. That equates to just below minimum wage. The smart thing to do is to take the job, learn what you're doing and then find a better one in a similar field. You have to enjoy changing situations and unpredictible jobs to thrive in satellite tv. Also, Mastec starts every tech"
good,"My typical day entales managing multiple crews in day to day field activites. Scheduling, reporting, invoicing, recieving and providing COP deliverables."
good,"long days and nights, great product, good co-workers. sups don't care about employee as long as job gets done."
good,MasTec needs to find other ways to compensate their employees when there is no work when it is slow they expect us to come to work every day for a full-time job but you're only doing maybe three jobs a day if your lucky.. I would rather get a part-time job so I could at least make something rather than making nothing for that day. AT&T new policy of having you take all these stupid pictures for your self qa's  which adds at least 30 minutes too your day. They need too bring back the self qa techs but they won't because they dont want too pay them that's why they took that position away. They seem too keep taking pay away which is a big problem. 2019 think big as they say well let's see how this all works out. They have tried lifeshield before for the home security and that did not work out too well for mastec. There are too many cons working for this company with little pros.
good,Steady employment with good pay. Had to travel for work sometimes and got to meet a lot of good people. If it rain we couldn't not work but all in all it was a good learning experience
good,"No set pay. Some weeks you may spend the entire days doing almost no work and sitting in your van 8hr a day for nothing. Review metrics are overbearing and your pay can be changed every few months( essentially they used 13 separate rating metrics to deny you a raise in pay every three months). Job site scheduling is ridiculous, you may have to travel 2 hours away from home for a call while a guy from 2 hours away is working next door to your house. This happens often while I was a tech for DirecTv installs. We were expected to help other techs without pay for work on their jobs sites. Using time off was frowned upon and must be approved. Vans at the time were in bad shape and we were not supplied appropriate winter tires."
good,I installed ATT Digital Life security systems in residential homes around the Toledo and surrounding area. Contracted for three years then was just recently laid off.
good,"Had been working for Mastec on the behalf of Dital life for over a year. I loved my job,  travel all over the city and  i met new and interesting  people everyday.  Except managers, or so they call themselves cannot manage. Mastec, stop giving kids big responsible jobs."
good,"Boss was a terrible manager, no room to move up. Never been treated so poorly. Work is great and easy though. Pay is based on piece rate and can be decent once you get the work down."
good,installing and trouble shooting direct tv equipment hardest part of the job is the hours u work 6 days a week and sun up to sun down and then some
good,"Management needs structure"
good,"They bring in technicians from other states to work in the northern Virginia area. In doing this he technicians that are permanent in Virginia may not get a job in the afternoon because the system already gave all of the jobs to the travel technicians. "
good,"The job itself is fairly simple if you have some voice & data experience or home security experience. They just don't know what they are doing in regards to management and figuring out how to actually get everybody on the same page. Management are clueless.They don't even know the how to manage the contract they have with AT&T for this job. It will soon be taken away from them and AT&T will take over and then comes the union, and then you are more screwed because the AT&T union is a joke and AT&T is a nightmare to work for."
good,"not a whole lot say other the company is very challenging to work for and will definitely make you a self motivated, self driven employee.."
good,"This review is not directed at MasTec as a company, it is directed ay Advanced Technologies DirecTV which I believe is a subdivision. I had high expectations on becoming a satellite TV installation professional.....loved the work I was performing. Unfortunately this job turned out to be a disappointment for me personally."
good,"hard job ,long hours very little home time and worked most if not all weekends then the backcharges kick in"
good,pulled wire for electric pole and transformer
good,Okay place to work but not a place to look for a career.  A reactive not proactive company. Management was only worried about doing the bare minimum and pleasing the higher ups no matter how ridiculous their ideas were.
good,More about customer than the employee is the vibe I got working at this place.  Everything that went wrong was because of poor management. They will promote family first but the customer is first in managements eyes.
good,The Buddy system where Techs that Knew Managers Whould get treated better than hard working techs  Friends of Mgrs. get constant installs where other techs get service calls that the freinds did a quick installation  . and Constantly lying unless you traveled for them .
good,Gave them everything I had and they simply let me go. I went and served in Puerto Rico but when we returned they cut off all communications and simply terminated me.
good,This is a job for people without kids because they don’t care what time you finish. Sometimes you get home at 5 but most of the time it’s 9pm. They only want numbers!
good,you go in with the mind in get it done and that it it cold  hot raining and you dont get to have family time ths is not a job for you if you have a wife and kid
good,Some Great Crew leaders some not so much but overall not a bad place to start in substation. Lots of traveling involved that was not clear upon hire or was not told of where to go next til the last minute.
good,i was told that business was booming in San Francisco and that i should leave my current job and move on over so i did and it was all good i the beginning but jobs slowly trending down  and we all ultimately laid off do not recruit people if you do not have a way to keep your promises
good,"I enjoyed this job until management decided they could judge your character on what they saw as oppose to talking with the individual  about issues dealing with the job. Absolutely no chance to advance they would use your skills and training however, no chance to move to a different department."
good,80 hours per week typically. Mentally and physically demanding. Pay is good considering overtime inclusion. No weekends off. Split days off makes family activities difficult.
good,Never know what to expect when you go to each house. Always ask questions and be able to identify the running coax available in the house for proper installation.
good,"Its a decent job, get ready to be over worked. Management is ok, depends on who your supervisor is i had great supervisors. There really isnt any enjoyable part of the job..working in dead heat or extreme cold."
good,MasTec is a good idea gone to waste. I hear great stories how the office used to be but no longer is. There are some good supersivors but some that are just disrespectful. The job could be stress free to an extent but most AIM meters are broke. That is the most important tool to do your job. This company needs to put serious money into it's Bethlehem office. It's an experience but would not recommend.
good,"I joined as the team was being built to address the smart energy sector.  As I vetted out the appetite for AT to approach Smart Cities, Smart Homes and Buildings as well as solar, storage, microgrid and EV, it became immediately clear it wasn't a match.  The entire team dissolved and a new direction has evolved for low tech level deployment. The leadership was new to leading, sales, creating a business and creating a vision.  This experience has been lackluster."
good,There is absolutely no room for growth within the company. It is a man's world here and it is about who you know in order to move up in the ladder they would rather hire someone they know from outside than let you grow within the company and expand your wings.
good,"Poor leadership, managment is very reactive-lack of planning. Lack of training.  No employee empowerment. work environment is hostile."
good,Pays the bills that's about it. Little chance for advancement. Long work hours. Fun experience meeting new people. Learning a new trade.
good,"Management staff started out helpful and polite, after 1 month of employment, their true colors immediately came to light. Company Forces all technicians to install monitored Smoke detectors regardless of local and state regulations and guidelines. Will TERMINATE YOU IF YOU REFUSE!"
good,I worked in kingsport . Traveled constantly sometimes home less than 2 or 3 days. I worked offices in Albany NY all the way to Dallas. Made most my money traveling. I loved the work but the fact they dont give a dang bout your personal life and family is a waste. It was also alot to do with Att owning directv causing the storm of work going downhill. Constant pay decreases in the pay per job model. This division wont be around in the next 5 years so I got out.
good,"A typical work day well be you get your work orders on your work phone and then going to places to set up Direct tv . What I have learned is to set up Direct tv satellite dishes and different places on the houses. Work place culture was ok , you get to know everyone you work with. The hardest part about the job was get the big ladder off the van . The most part I enjoy was you work at your our pace."
good,"5 - 6 days a week required. Every Saturday is required. Sundays off. You get company van but it costs you $ 40 per week out of your check. You get a company-provided smart phone for your job. Training is okay, but the trainers could take it more seriously."
good,"Great place to work if your only looking for a paycheck. If your looking for a career this is not a place for you. For the most part my manager started off great. Loved working for him, but then kept asking me things he heard from other managers that wasnt true. A few of my co-workers also had experinced this.There was a few manager in another area that create drama where it isn't and make up things to get rid of people."
good,"When I was an employee, then VP of the company was a good sales man but could not follow through with his promises. The male employees were allowed to cuss at the female employees. When this happened there was no corrective action taken"
good,training was more intense that the actual work and the support I got in the field was more like punishment than helping also the pay structure was very complicate.
good,"The more one puts into this job, the more one is likely to get from it."
good,"the average pay is 30,000 i made 50,000 and more back in the day but those days are over."
good,"It was an ok company to work for... I think there is a lot of favortizm with the company...  Workers could travel and be gone along period of times...  The site managers are not the problem its the higher up bosses that say they will do something, but in the end they don't or they make excuses.."
good,"Mastec is not actually for everyone. The job is for people who have many responsibilities and money hungry. “The more you work, the more money you receive” I worked for the company for few years, and my average bi-weekly paycheck was $2,700. You can get work life balance if you are smart, but you need to work hard. The issue with Mastec is the management. They set unattainable rules and make you responsible for every loss even when it is apparently not your fault, the supervisors are lazy too, but you will make more money than they do."
good,"I love the work. Management is sorry, broken promises, they keep you out late, disregard any thing other than your life. AT&T is involved that's one reason."
good,"Easy job, Very demanding and stressful without enough pay teir, Supervisors would work with you and for you but higher management acted like they didnt care about situations or complications"
good,i was one of the top problem solvers and never got the proper pay for the time i spent fixing the issues other installers could not. then when asking for help you will not get the help you need
good,"Great people in the local office, love working with them, job pays piece rate, not hourly, which takes a little getting used to, but if you catch on to the job quickly, can be very profitable."
good,"Very stressful and required a lot of time to make decent pay. Work is very seasonal. Lots of downtime. most work, pay, and reviews are based on customer ratings."
good,"True you decide how much money you make here, but the time management and compensation for things out of your control are terrible. It makes it very difficult to make any money in this company."
good,"Generally had a hectic work day and unforgiving long over times. The things I learnt about this job was understanding people and what high expectations they bestow on you when have the means to bring excitement to their universe. "
good,"Great company management needs improvement and training. Expectations higher than reality. People come first."
good,"Ok company to work for..Had company vehicle..Good training. Ok benifits, unable to advance with company..Too much of a demand............................................................."
good,"Strictly home security and automation. Good for new technicians just starting in the industry. Pay piece work, not very stable income. Been there and done that."
good,Management does not care about their employees. Management only cares about making money at their employees expense.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. The work environment and people are amazing. This job is located in Austin, TX. I work for the Advanced Technologies branch which installs Direct TV."
good,"deal with micro managing and not what i was hired for. try to meet with my technicians in the field to assist them however they need.  Deal with special projects the site manager gives me.monitor and control work flow to manage all the jobs at hand each day. ensure all my techs are working safely. attempt to do quality control check ups on my technicians. build a team atmosphere . answer a lot of emails."
good,new faces changing quarterly with management. Long hours. Unattainable performance metrics.
good,"This job was based on long hours (8-15) 6 days a week. New and additional duties without a break from others. Upper Management was unsupported when assigning new tasks.The other supervisors were supportive and enjoyable. the best part of the job was truly when i left. No ;more phone calls at all hours, no more emails at 2 am."
good,A typical day is stressful.
good,All employees were the most warm hearted and hard working individuals.
good,"Company vehicle allows you to save on gas, provides healthcare, but has high pressure high demand."
good,I lost this job because they said i was late to a jobsite when i was talking to another technician at the time they said i wasnt there at the job site and would not even talk to the tech who was there with me to verify.
good,worked there as a foreman and as a journeyman absolutley loved the expirience i had in south and central florida we stayed on top of our training new employees and how we handeled day to day operations to include storm restoration over all melbourne florida south was wonderful south georgia was absolutly miserable the have no qualified help and would not train there employees i ended up watching the worst case of good ole boy cost employees
good,"Understanding, that what I did was contact for DTV. It was sweet when the money and incentives were there. There was a time when you could up sale. There were other bonuses. Without those it was no longer worth it."
good,"Great working with co workers, but there is no job security. The manager of the site was great. He worked to make the location a good place to be, and a fun work place."
good,I worked here for about 5 years and I put in alot of hours and just could not find myself growing with the company. Pays well but It does not leave you with too much free time.
good,"I have worked at Mastec for 11 years. I was recently laid off due to lack of work. The company is not doing very well. I did not receive a good severance for the time I worked there. But they do have good benefits, good management, low salary."
good,If you are family oriented this is not for you. Also with streaming tv growing jobs are decreasing leading to pay cuts and lay offs. You have to be self motivated and productive to make money.
good,The job itself can be stressful the main issue was the pay wasn't that great and management didn't care about their technicians. You get to travel alot but it's not that great
good,This was my first job working with Coaxial Cabling and Satellite Dish home installations. The Training program and trainers are excellent. The culture is very brotherly. Fellow technicians always willing to reach out and help with technical issues.
good,What type of work is fun dealing with customers and the customer service aspect of it however the amount of work and the type of work they wanted done didn't want to pay for it or didn't want to pay enough for it if you have a family this is not the job for you you will work 80 hours a week to bring home maybe $400 if you're lucky
good,"good place to get your trained and experienced in satellite and cable. Fellow techs are very helpful, great team to work with don't count on management."
good,"Start early and finished early, place was dirty no organization. Keeping up with the techs and the parts was a big headache due to they would not turn in receivers all the time and would have to track them down"
good,My immediate upper management was not qualified for the job and non existent there was no salesman to get more work so when work slowed up they could not keep you working could not make money in this industry with the management just happy with having one contract
good,"still evaluating, just don't want to place judgement at this time. Can say you have to like a physical job... I've lost 30lbs since working this job. Learn something new everyday...."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Do your route, if someone falls behind on there's, you take that also. If you fall behind on yours, it seems no one is there to help ypu with yours. Money just depends on how fast you can work and how well you really understand the directv system. Customers tend to slow you down along with dispatch taking 30 mins to gove you another job thats 45 mins away, but get mad when you call in to get a job."
good,"The managing staff made it difficult to enjoy the job. You get paid by the kind of installation, not by hour as a tech. to make decent money I had to work out of town about 9 months out of the year. lastly when traveling in the vans they have sensors so if the highway is 8omph you still can only go 65mph."
good,"Things were fine until Nov 2016, contracted with ATT, MasTec or ART began pulling funding and advertising for the digitallife home security system we were installing. Resulting in eventual lay offs, sudden fireing and pay caps and pay cuts. No clear explanations. Even had a conference call from Regional director said ""rest easy"" we have the right number of guys now. 1.5 weeks later our supervisor was laid off, 3 weeks later his replacement was gone and more techs were let go. No one wants to tell anyone why. Great company if your attached to an industry with job stability."
good,Nobody is guaranteed a certain amount of work. So its feast or famine when it comes to making money. There is almost zero opportunity to advance in this department. Long hours and little time to enjoy home life. So in all there is the opportunity to make some good money. Yet with ever changing rules and requirements means a lot of headaches.
good,"Spent 4 years working for Mastec. A typical day starts at 7AM and depending on the season can last anywhere from 3 to 9PM. Installing and servicing Digital Life home automation systems provided me with a stong work ethic, problem solving skills, and how to provided exceptional customer service to every homeowner. The most enjoyable parts of this job is meeting new people every day and working independently to complete daily tasks. The hardest parts of the job is long hours during peak season and troubleshooting system glitches and outages."
good,"Job was great, while it lasted. "
good,"Working as a sub-contractor is horrible, pay wasn't as expected, low seasons are ever changing and unexpected. Management is a hard and complex situation, no leadership from supervisors because they are imposed so much work that they don't have time for employees. training is good but not enough and you ability to learn what you need to be successful depends on your trainer, some will teach you, some will just throw you to the wolves."
good,answer phones and take down schedules for tech. The create invoices based on work preformed.  Hardest part was working the later shift alone.
good,Overall not a bad place to work  The people in the office were fun to work with but the upper management were not transparent enough with the middle management.
good,"Stress free work environment, you make your own schedule as long as you have 40 hours on your time sheet.  However pay is low for engineering, and advancement for management is rare."
good,Thought it would be a good job but your micromanaged to death. Pay and benefits are good but its always changing
good,its a place to start not a place to make a career out of but all in all not bad just need to review their pay scale
good,"I enjoyed the work I did with Mastec, we came to the warehouse every morning to pick up equipment for the days or weeks work. I got to do lots of traveling wish I absolutely enjoyed. The nation was my office, we got to go and assist other markets in case of natural disasters to enable continuous service to customers. I enjoyed helping customers solve problems and helping them build their systems from the ground up. The hardest part of working with Mastec, was the inconsistencies in management, lack of job security and inconsideration for employees family and personal life when it came to work schedules."
good,"I loved the job, the co-workers.  But the work was unpredictable.  It was nearly impossible to advance.  Their Matrix system seems to be design to keep the Techs from advancing."
good,"Rules and regulations are constantly changing within the company. I understand there has to be change eventually but even with change, there are some things that are to stay the same as a guideline. The DirecTV side of Mastec does not know how to do that. I enjoyed the job that I had as a DirecTV Tech but not so much working for Mastec."
good,"will always keep you busy."
good,"Mastec for the past 4 years that I have worked for them have been a good company to work for, but over the past several months management has changed and they no longer care about the employees"
good,"Mastec is slowly but surely moving away from AT&T/directv. They are starting to contract from Best Buy, Amazon, Orby, Lifeshield Security. Short handed on supervisors and techs which makes the days work load stressful and long. Pay could be better but still competitive. Different services have different pay scales and you don’t get to choose which one you want. If you have a family or social life, this job is not for you. If you like working by yourself then this the job."
good,you make piece rate so you get paid based on how much equiptment you install and some shifts can be longer than others you could end up making less on a 15 hr shift than you do in a 4 hour one
good,constantly physical job and required of good physical conditions to do it...non estable payment due to low piece work rate and its depend of seasons...
good,"Long driving, 160 $ charge monthly for van piece work overtime not compensated fairly , if you work hard you make money sometimes depends on costumers"
good,technicians salaries were lowered after the AT&T/Directv merger. we had to travel every 2 weeks and stay out for 2 weeks to help the other regions that needed assistance.
good,"The company itself was not bad, and I actually enjoyed my job there, but once the Office Manager was let go, and his Field Managers left, the office went downhill fast. the workload increased, which meant your hours greatly increased, they brought in a guy from out of town who had no business managing an office, and we lost almost half of our technicians within 2 weeks, which put that much more pressure on those of us that stayed. Ultimately, that is what drove me to leave."
good,This is a good place to work overall. You are able to work at your own pace and you are not micro-managed. The hardest part of the job is working in the cold and rain. The most enjoyable part of the job is successfully fixing a customers system after they have lost service and completing a new installation.
good,Stressful working environment. Working from sun up to sun down most days. Ways to advance in company is limited to a number of opening positions. Poor management
good,Very long hours. Not a good work / home balance. Ver very stressful. Everything depending on making metrics to a certain number. Great management. Overall its a good single persons job
good,"This is a decent place for a young person to begin a working career.  A lot of responsibility is placed on the individual technician, as they are always working alone, and responsible for everything.  I learned a great deal about working with hand tools, using ladders safely and effectively, operating a work vehicle safely, new technology, and how to efficiently complete tasks.  The workplace culture was average, and somewhat competitive and could be cut throat a times.   The hardest part of the job was the excessive work hours required to make a good income, and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers, some of my co-workers and the potential for a really good income."
good,Long hours. Take to long to get raises. Sometimes it takes years to get one. Moral is very low among workers. Hardly ever appreciated with work that you do.
good,Work hard and smart and you'll get your chance really good people to work with formans including labors even though ALOT of people come and go sometimes the job isn't for some people sometimes it is its all on you n how you want to look at it
good,Was not all that good from time here. The pay was decent and the fact that they provided a company vehicle was good. However the amount of time spent out on the field at times was not worth the pay.
good,"MasTec companies have been involved in some of the largest and most complex infrastructure construction projects across the country. My experience has given me a deep and comprehensive understanding of the customer we serve, as well as the ability to effectively manage people, projects and equipment. It allows me to proactively identify challenges, avoid pitfalls, and overcome obstacles, and to accurately set and meet expectations for schedule and budget."
good,"they are not the worst and not the best. There is no management presents in the field. customer interaction is the best part of my job, next to doing my job."
good,"This was a tough job. Many obstacles and hoops to jump through and that is just the management side. Besides that, the field work is fun and inclusive. The field work separated the boys from the men. The field work was what you made of it. I enjoyed my time on the field."
good,Working and learning how to install underground electric lines and ducts. Digging for lines and setting up street lights.
good,not a bad place to work. just be reminded you will have to the elements daily. the work hard but rewarding. you deal with different customers daily and see many different areas in central texas.
good,"A typical day at work starts when you receive notification of the type of job and location via email. Arrival at the first job promptly by 8 am and completion of job in allotted time frame. Time managment, driving and on-site safety are the most important factors of the job. The hardest as well as the most rewarding part of the job is customer issue ressolution. Possessing the ability to resolve customer issues quickly, effectivly while being efficient are other important skill trates."
good,"Workday varies regularly. Experience new situations daily. Opportunities to meet new people every day and adapt to new challenges. Have fun comparing experiences with co-workers and learning from their experiences."
good,they'll treat you terribly. then when people quit because of how they are treated dispatch will simply push all of their jobs onto the remaining technicians overloading them on a daily basis. they'll promise one thing during the interview then turn right around and do the opposite as soon as you're hired. the work itself is not difficult. management simply makes everything harder than it has to be.
good,Mastecs a good company to work for. If you are good with your hands and have some trademen skills you should satisfied with employment there.
good,"I enjoyed my 10 years working for MasTec Advanced Technologies. They offer good opportunities for advancement, decent salary, and other benefits. Watch out for the good ole' boy system though."
good,"things are not as they seem at this company. Its a good opportunity for someone to begin there installer career and learn the basics, however it is not somewhere you would want to be longterm."
good,. On a typical day i get up early go into warehouse greet co woker order equippment to start my day to day function also i have so I reviewed the plan and found a way to make customer buy into the protection and understand it better by printing out and form and walk them through when I explained how helpful it would be to the customer
good,"I loved the work at Mas-Tec. I enjoyed interacting with customers and installing their DirecTV systems and integrating them with their home theater systems. What I didn't like was the sometimes 3+ hour drive times between customers that were scheduled in the same A.M. / P.M. time slot. Other technicians would constantly call and ask for assistance, which I was eager to provide, unless I was completely swamped with work, but when I needed assistance, it seemed that nobody was able to help."
good,"I learned how to wire and and install satellite and phone. I worked there for 11 years and learned many things. "
good,"go in early, work hard, get off at no specific time, low pay for work, flexible work hours, self paced."
good,My typical work day here was just simply dispatching out work to the technicians. Management sucked but co-workers were ok. Hardest part of the job were the constant procedure changes. In the short time was there the total operation of my department changed at least 4 times.
good,"great group of people, I learned a lot from them that can be use in my future work employment."
good,A typical work day would start off with getting a email with my jobs for the day. if i needed equipment i would go to the wearhouse to pick it up. then i would call the coustomers to let them know about what time i would be ariving. i lerned about how satellites work. Management was ok. The hardest part of the job was if you didnt put anything in you didnt get paid. On the other hand if you put in a lot you would get great pay.
good,"installed underground power lines with back-hoe, excavator and trenchers."
good,Nothing good but that its something different everyday. Micromanagement is a problem though. Just wasn't for me.
good,"Work days went from 5:30 A.M. till any were from 4 till 9 o'clock at night 7 days a week. Management changed quite often, co workers also changed quite often those of us that lasted were very helpful to each other. The Heat during the summer was the toughest but as long as you paced your self an hydrated your self it was not that difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was educating an pleasing the customer."
good,"It was a fast pace job and required meeting a daily # of calls. On the phone all day with customers resolving install issues. Also, assited techs with getting appointment arrival times to customers."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity but there was a lot of cultural issues that was going on that i really didn't like being around.I hated to leave the job because they paid well but my pride and ego wouldn't let me stay.
good,starts off slow when initially starting. once you learn your craft you will become more self sufficient. since is telecommunications you spend a lot of time in customers homes so be wary of that.
good,"good work environment but need better pay, have to think safety at all time, mostly great supervisors and cool co workers, hr have a great representative working with the employees"
good,The kind of work and the amount of work completed deserved hourly salary. Charge backs on your check for various items that a company should take care for there workers.
good,More money for the job that we do it's hard and hights is dangerous and we need more time to get the job done and help in the field we get help some times but more is needed
good,Piecework for technicians and usually six days on and one day off. Company truck and equipment provided. Travel to training and hotel room paid in addition to training pay.
good,"Work not too difficult. On the road by 7 am. Usually don't get home until after 7 pm. Pay is piecework. Must work hard and work fast but if your quality suffers, you will be let go."
good,"over worked, underpaid. paid by th job. if you do your job right then you will work all day long and get less in your check. if you hussle and scheme you can have a better check but risk losing your job. i had no problem with doing the right thing. my problem was the constant stream of new hires that did garbage work that i had to go back behind and fix for pennies."
good,"I worked out my home.  Best job, super nice co-workers.  The only cons to job was upper management didn't care about how the division was ran.  Just as long as the correct people they wanted  was in charge.  But they didn't know what to do or how to do anything."
good,"This job is a hit or miss. Some days you can make lots of money, some days you spend more at a gas station. You can't balance your work life/ personal life you work 6 days a week all summer 12-14 hours madatory, winter is real slow."
good,Management was not good/ They hired there friends for management position. Now the company has been bought by At&t and so much in the company has change
good,"Very long days, very stressful, pay could of been better due to the amount of time spent working. Pros were that the company let us managers take techs to lunch."
good,Technicians and supervisors are not held accountable for policy violations. There are too many exceptions allowed for people who do not follow policy.
good,"You get 5 weeks training. Depending on who's your trainer.. you'll make it or end up leaving. After working 2 years my checks every 2 weeks are 1800 a check after taxes. Takes about 6 months to a year before you can maintain about a 1200 check after taxes. "
good,"Good work environment, ever changing work places, networking, and can work at you own pace. Management backs its employees 100 percent, gives you the tools you need to succeed, provides a mentor for training and beyond."
good,It is very easy to move up. The company has no issue with an employee advancing to higher paying positions within the company. Throughout my time there I had three different positions.
good,"You can make a killing and you can lose your butt. You work a rotating 5/2 and 6/1 work week. You must be at the home office at 5am. One day a week to stock up your van. You must be on site at your first job by 8am. On average you'll make anywhere from $50-$150 a day. Sometimes you'll make $300. I never have but other techs do. I worked in the 35 Region. "
good,"No support in the field you are by your self."
good,I loved working by myself and getting to see different places and people every day.  I also enjoyed working outdoors in a hands on environment.  Sometimes you get to work out of town in different market areas to help them keep up with the pace.
good,Company was undergoing a transition at the time of employment. If you are knowledgeable about power tools and experienced with labor intensive jobs; this is a good job to take. Being quick and hospitable while doing installations will take you far.
good,Not a bad company to work for.  Some of their management level actions are sometimes unwarranted but is understandable.  They give you every opportunity to succeed as long as you are willing to do the leg work and put yourself out there to be as successful as possible.
good,"Mas Tec is a good company to work for in Jacksonville, NC. They are based out of New Bern, NC Their training class and equipment is state of the art and up to date."
good,"enjoyed job but money wasnt there, long days and working 6 days a week. piece rate so you dont get any overtime. and you have to pay to take your van home every week"
good,"I worked for DirecTV through MasTec.  I loved that you don't always have a manager breathing down your neck.  You're out on your own getting jobs done at your own pace.  With that being said, it's up to you to get work done in a timely manner, but also to spend enough time to get the job done the right way.  But they pay piece-work, which is not good.  There's no way to predict how much you will make, which makes it impossible to budget.  You have no control over the work you get, so sometimes you make decent money and sometimes you'll make $20 on a job that took you 4 hours to complete."
good,"I loved meeting new people and bring the joy of entertainment to them, or fixing their system for them.  We had a good team of supervisors and technicians."
good,"So far, My complaint is the low pay. I'm getting compensation for poverty level salary, while my hours are through the roof.  While I'm interested and I don't mind working with the technology itself and I think myself as of a natural troubleshooter guy (my former job I was an independent IT tech) , the low pay will turn everyone away, who know well, that the amount of hours they put in in a daily basis, they would be payed twice the amount with other companies. "
good,"Early start, late finish."
good,"A typical day at work is digging into construction site schedules and reporting to managers on the construction start and complete dates. This in turn allows me to set up scheduling to close out construction permits with townships."
good,I learned a lot from MasTec its a good company to work for you will learn a lot for as troubleshooting technique and learn excellent customer service skills.
good,"When you first get started it takes awhile to get the hang of it, constant revolving body cuz people always quit. The head of the company dont care about the employee they just wanna push numbers"
good,at work 6:30 get supplies finish paper work leave office at 7:00 call customers that I had work orders for enter my hand and aknowledge route then do service calls and installs hardest part doing a service call in the middle of a high pitched roof learned a lot about satellite business managers would randomly chack on me forthemost part left me alone because I always did my job well
good,"Everyone competes with everyone in this company, terrible management, not to mention they fire you for literally anything....no job security...good pay if your fast though. The company charges you to use keep your van at home, they also charge you for receivers if you have them longer then 2 weeks."
good,"Very demanding job, 6 day work weeks during peak season and very long hours at time. Great physcail demand on the body to do it for long periods of time."
good,"Managed the procurement of all material coming in and going out."
good,"This is a pretty good job, however, the pay is piecework pay, which means if you don't have a very good week you don't get paid well"
good,"Working on At&T towers"
good,"Nice place to get your foot in the door. If you are a hard worker this is the place for you. Opportunities are there, you just need to take advantage of them."
good,"independent work, able to learn how to handle different people"
good,"the pay is quite good, but the hours are ridiculously long, with mandatory overtime almost a constant."
good,"Working for Mastec helped me to hone many analytical skills. However, I took a big hit on my family life. I was always on the clock, even on the weekends. Management is not responsive (unless they need something, in a hurry no less). Very impersonal environment."
good,My coworkers were nice. The division I work for was allowed to work from home.
good,"I wasn't there too long, due to family emergencies, but the company wasn't bad.  Paid training, get paid for what you finish, management was ok .... the job does demand alot of your life is the biggest downfall. your never really clocked out you have to finish your jobs given in the day and they can send you more if they want to.  most times i didnt get out of work till 930, and i start the day at 8 so you tell me smh"
good,Bastante trabajo apollo  laboral entre compañeros   esperiensa agradable  .
good,This job was very fast paced at times.  Not  many opportunities for growth within the company.   Often times the management would not be available to answer any questions.
good,As it turns out it was more of a pop-up office that was part of laying some fiber optic cables.  Was poorly run from a home base management perspective. Locally they were just trying to keep up with a schedule and keep subs.
good,"This is not a regular 9 - 5 job, the hours are long but if you put in good work and learn the ins and outs about the job you can make pretty decent money. Typical day consists of checking your phone for your work orders, getting to your first customer house by 8 a.m. There are 3 different types of jobs to participate in. They consist of New installs, Upgrades and Service calls, so depending on your order you would troubleshoot, install brand new equipment or swap out a persons old system with a new one. This is a piece rate job, so you get paid for what you install (New installs and Upgrades). Service calls are a steady rate so no matter how much work you do on that call you will get paid a certain amount, so the best thing are to finish the calls quickly. What I learned is how to manage my time better, so that's to take into consideration. The warehouse is usually pretty chill which is where you will get all of your equipment and have a meeting day once a week. Supervisors are usually really helpful but can sometimes come off a bit like a jerk, but its only because they don't want to baby someone grown. My advice would be contact them as less as possible and you won't get a hard time from them when you do. The hardest part of the job for me was just going into small spaces such as attics and crawlspaces, also dealing with bugs and dogs the customers usually say doesn't bite (ha). The most enjoyable part was getting to meet a lot of different people from different backgrounds and knowing I could fix a persons problem to make them happy."
good,"No help desk or support staff, they have an app instead. This can be annoying by wasting time while reading in the field. Then management tells you that you need to hurry up and finish the job while you are reading the updates or new information to install the devices. So when are we supposed to read all the updates during lunch or read this when your off work without pay."
good,"Would go to location and do installation of satellite tv."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and love  working with people and customer base. the hardest part of my job is at most of the I have to drive two hour to get to my first job and the routing can put you one to your next job.
good,"Great company to work for. When the work is heavy the job is great "
good,I have always enjoyed the job. There is a large variety of things to do and it varies often. The downside for me is it requires quite a bit of travel and I have a family now. The wages could be better as well.
good,Was a mainly rewarding job.  Lots of flexibility to do what was needed and set goals.  Upper  Management was hot or miss as far as participation and feedback
good,the work is good when you have it and so was the pay. did not get benefits due to being a sub contractor did a lot of traveling which affected my home life. good work for a single person
good,"Did this job for 9 years and i loved the work until the customers were misled by att/directv sales reps promising them the world and then we get there and have to be the bearer of bad news. it was piece rate which was a love/hate thing but with picky customers and doing inventory on THEIR work vans and not getting paid for hours spent trying to do your job safely and right i found myself working for free quite a bit in my opinion cable and satellite technicians will always be underpaid considering the money we have made the company over the years. you wanted my opinion, you got it !"
good,"I had a great opportunity to learn a lot with this job. It was very competitive and long. It was a dangerous place to work due to the different amount of dangerous insects and snakes that are in Jacksonville, Florida."
good,Typical day involved routing and scheduling technicians to jobs. Keeping track of inventory and warehouse distribution while placing orders for new materials and sometimes traveling to drop off material to get jobs done.
good,"Working for MasTec was a great experience.  It put me close to the career i've been looking for, unfortunately, winter came and i was laid off and had to look for employment elsewhere in the meantime.  I very much enjoyed working for them."
good,MasTec is a good company to work for. It could be better if it had a Work/Life balance and overtime pay for supervisors. if you're single with no family and have a high stress tolerance then this would be a good job for you.
good,This it too much information to discuss but I wanted to explain that the work days are always busy. The time spent as a manger is chasing around grown technicians who don't really want to work. They just want to get paid.
good,"Installing DTV"
good,The work hours are long and the pay was consistent.  Some staff was knowledgeable and others were new to the industry.  A lot of delays on the job because of equipment.
good,"nice place to work"
good,Nice place to work if your a hard worker but can also be stressful and Tiring with the way they schedule work throught the day.  You also have to worry about how your customer service is because you have to tell them about a survey and even though you do your very best they can simply fail you for any reason and it looks bad on your numbers with the company.
good,Local Management was great team was great company was in a bad contract with at&t which in turn they had to cut 17 jobs(which is the entire long island office) But depending on where you go Mastec itself  is not a bad company to work for
good,"I would still be working at Mastec except for the fact that they decided not to remain an AT&T turf vendor. I was able to work from home as a remote detail engineer, and for the most part enjoyed my years at this company."
good,"This job was fantastic, meeting new people everyday. My Manager and Leads were great and informative. There was never a day I was upset going to work."
good,"Mastec can be a great job. Its just that I have five kids and a wife. I get paid by piece work. If I go to a house and they cancel the job, that means I don't get paid and just wasted maybe 2 hour. Its happens quite often."
good,"Paid by job, but spent most of my day driving (with no pay for time on road) so it was hard to earn a decent salary.  Six day week schedule, typically 12+ hours day."
good,"Mastec is good company for starter Technician for you to learn your trade and experience diversity."
good,"Walked customers through new device set up"
good,"Loads of hours, work vehicle, pays for gas for work vehicle. Pays per job completed. BIGGEST downside is the commute sometimes takes you all the way from Fredericksburg to Alexandria, Arlington, Round Hill, etc and you have to be on site at the first job by 800 hours."
good,"Day typically starts 0600 and ends up to 2200. "
good,Installed DirecTv in homes and businesses.  Was a pain at times to acauire the proper equipment to do the job as well as unrealistic performance demands.
good,Lots of traveling with low compensation. Working in the weather was difficult and also dictated work days. Low pay for lots of hours. They did give us company vans.
good,"I loved my job as a Phone Expert and Inventory Manager as apart of Sprint Direct 2 You. Unfortunately my entire department got laid off when with only 2 days notice because Sprint decided they didn't want to fund the program anymore. Mastec gave all of us some bogus $300 for laying us off and not even willing to give us new jobs within the company. Again I LOVED my job, just hated how both companies treated us when they decided to lay us off."
good,I enjoy working there. I like my boss and the other employees. I also enjoy learning new things the work environment is pretty balanced. Sometimes it is challenging but what job isn't
good,"company is an ok place to work, compensation is very low ,paid by piecework, benefits are offered but the plan is horrible and costly, hours can be long and can affect lifestyle,overtime is paid based on an average of work closed, the amount of work is not always steady, so paychecks can vary,no consistent pay can be achieved."
good,Lots of opportunity depending on the workplace environment you are in.  Great opportunity for advancement however some local supervisors positions are filled with unqualified individuals.  I will say that they have to potential to be qualified if they had better leadership and developmental skills.
good,good place but not secure enough. the directv contract seems to be better. never received a raise so that was not cool. sometimes the hours can be long it just depends
good,Once upon a time I worked at Mastec technologies work was very simple easy customer service is not that hard to do business has been real slow need something else at this point time with all the things going on if I could I would go back to
good,Was there 10 years ago but what I remember is that it was very dangerous. Some people love it but it wasn't for me. Wish them the best though. Direct tv
good,"Like most jobs, you get what you put in here.Sr. Management was weak, but supervisors were on the ball. Count your equipment! company vehicle was a plus and the customers rocked. loved seeing them smile after job was completed and getting great surveys about my techs."
good,"The job was very difficult but the management really made it tough to work there. I was entrusted with company car, ipad, and phone. the company downsized the techs after a busy season"
good,"Very unreliable work load, some weeks no work at all to four jobs a day. There is a lot of travel, however, A company vehicle is provided, with a gas card."
good,"No management on site but I enjoyed the job for the most part."
good,"The colic's  are good and very supportive. The office also very helping full but the work load is too much. If you work hard you get paid good otherwise little bit difficult. Because they pay you per job."
good,"50-70 hour weeks in all weather conditions. High demands of responsibilities and procedures. Customer service, tools, heights, and an availability is a must."
good,"The overall feel is the family oriented atmosphere that stay consistent from management to employees. A typical day start from 6am in the office or 8am on the job site. Company provides employees the tools and training to be successful with the job. Company encourage the desire for advancement and hire within."
good,had fun while i worled here but overall the company was unorganized and everyone was confused when they ent in to get there order
good,"A typical day is to be up by 5:30 am, and have my first job acknowledged by 6am. Suit up and be at the customer home by 8am. There is no set time you will be off. Great fun atmosphere to work, but doesn't have great job work/ life balance. I have learned many new aspects from legal to technical. working with low voltage. properly handling power tools and ladders. learning to troubleshoot through coax cables. The Management is great people to with. my co-workers are great people, and easy to talk to. we all network together for equipment. The hardest part of the job is not know what type of job you will get next, being unprepared and, having to locate what you need. Not knowing if the job is even able to be installed. "
good,A great place to work at with a lot of benefits and holidays.  It was a nice and clean work environment with great opportunities.
good,"The company as a whole is OK. Advancement opportunities are slim. Days start early and end late. If you are able to troubleshoot, then you are OK. Not really any employee appreciation."
good,Great place just not enough money. Great ppl and they help out. But yea was not making enough money there. 6/10 5 days week. great times tho
good,i worked by myself and in many circumstances there were two people needed. i loved meeting different people everyday. Management supported the techs.
good,"A typical day at work was constantly going from one place to the next making sure every bit of work got done. I've learned quite a bit about certain machines' maintenance and the tools required. Management was usually efficient, though some times a bit too lenient. Co-workers were usually well-spirited with an appetite for their daily dose of punishment (common work). Hardest part of the job was working up the gut to work in the more dangerous nooks of the underground electrical systems. Most enjoyable was burger night at the bar every Thursday after work."
good,Company was not willing to acquire additional clients which ultimately resulted in major layoffs in many divisions. Co-Workers are great to work with.
good,"I enjoyed the job, my co-workers and the environment until the company decided to close the call center down without much warning."
good,"I love helping employees with problems and easing their mind that they have someone who can be helpful. "
good,"Working for MasTec is an exciting opportunity for young individuals to enjoy their freedom to work independently, while still having the support of a large corporation behind  them feeding encouragement and growth opportunities. MasTec is dedicated to providing the best Customer Experience and Satisfaction."
good,"Provide support to the sales team, ensuring all sales and service objectives were met, Answered incoming customer service queries as well as resolve issues reported. Providing customers with detailed information on new products, Assisted in development of new policies, procedures and training of new customer service representatives and associates, Client follow-up and quality control of after sales service, Installer of Direct TV  and Hi-def satellites, Provided support and troubleshoot for various issue, Ran RG 59 cables, splitters and  diplexers."
good,This company was great. The employees were positive and productive.
good,Great people hard work long hours overtime rate is half of what you make per hour. book a lot of jobs on you can make money. no time for any family great if your single. 70 hours a week during the summer
good,Great paying job but you rarely see your family. You will work six day  a week usually twelve hour days.
good,Good company to work for. You are hired as a contractor and are paid per job completed
good,The typical day would just be driving around from home to home just installing satellite tv. The best part of the job is actually the different people. you never know who you'll meet. there are some interesting people out there. the worst part of the job would have to be management. the company is just a bit unorganized.
good,I would start work at 8am. I was given a route to complete. Some were installs and some were disconnects. The management helped when I needed help. The coworkers I sometimes could not get in contact with them but when I did they did help when I asked.
good,"a typical day here was getting to the office and findng out where the job locations would be. we would get out paper work and head out. get to the job site and bring out the equiptment and start lookin for the telephone cables under ground. had to dig numberous holes in order to find them"
good,Its a good company work for. they need to work on the management skill. They have tried over rate of employee in these company. It a hard job and mental.
good,"a typical day at work starts at 5 am and continues till your done. management is there to help, co-workers are the best, they are willing to help each other out on the field."
good,"challenging and rewarding career, fast paced environment, subcontractor to DirecTV satellite company."
good,"This job is not too bad, as long as you are willing to work long unknown hours. My day typically was 8am-7pm (time i got to first job and time I got home). Even with long hours, the money I brought home was not enough, and it put a burden with online college."
good,"Scope walk sites for pricing"
good,"	Identified and worked to remove barriers to successful completion of the overall project, with particular emphasis on resolving site issues with subcontractors "
good,This was an interesting position and enjoyed my time with the company.  I reported directly to the Area Manager as his personal secretary and was responsible for assisting with correspondence and files for Area Manager of two state Sprint Contract (Washington and Oregon)
good,"I usually serviced customers satalite systems, going to an average of about seven or eight houses a day. I learned to deal with people frequently and how to communicate and solve their problems.  It was nice to be a part of the team, and to learn from your  co-workers.  Sometimes it a little difficult dealing with some of the numbers and expectations of directv, but overall i enjoyed working there for almost five years."
good,Working at Mastec was ok  in the job of install saterllite dishes and receivers.
good,"Enjoyed the opportunity of making a good living.  Tough work, a lot of traveling, and sometime pulled some late hours"
good,Trained for about 1 Month
good,Mastec is a company where able to travel and meet different people everyday
good,"Got to travel all over state of Florida, installing conduit for Fiber Optic cable. Learned how to use Cable Jet machine"
good,They are an ok company to work for. Nothing to special but its a job.
good,great company to start your career with... co workers was great too
good,"not a good place to work. work is slow,unorganized, and pay is very low"
good,Met some good people while here...
good,The company was very cut throat and power driven. Every work day was a day you worried what would happen next. The management was great until the reorganization.
good,Job security is the only thing that I didn't like. As they sold the company and I was out of a job a actually enjoyed and cont wait to gain more experience.
good,"""Long hours, high stress, zero job security"" (in 20 reviews)"
good,"Extremely fast paced work environment. Retaining information is vital with this line of work. This job is extremely dangerous, and following safety protocol is vital. This is a brotherhood, and looking out for one another is key. The job is also physically demanding, and you are always kept on your toes. Working with different people is a plus, for you are always learning something new, and learning different approaches to the job at hand."
good,job is good if your able to perform fast work done correctly. only issue is the lack of advancement. supervisors make less then a productive technician and pay raises are unheard of.
good,"too many variables come into play when it comes to you getting appointments to do installs. Dispatch doesn't care about to Techs, they only care about their numbers. Too many service calls prorated at $25/1 hour service call, but dispatch only gives you 2-4 hour service calls and no new installs... so you don't make any money."
good,"I think it was an okay job, I was there for few days for training and it wasn’t for me, what me and the recruiter discussed was off like I said earlier......"
good,"a typical day of work during the busy season is about 4-5 jobs per day and the paychecks are always nice at the end of it, I learned a lot about customer communication and just how important it truly is, the management was the best part of the entire experience you always have someone to help you, the hardest part of the job would be the long hours and the customers"
good,"Wouldn’t recommend working here unless you really need a job and can’t find anything else, but besides that you get benefits but salaries don’t meet the standards."
good,Other than working with a manager had lack of knowledge for his position. It was a good company to work for. Enjoyed working for the project managers and crews. There was a lack of work.
good,Good job for a younger person very physically demanding pay is steady. Work-life balance is okay not quite what I was looking forward to. Very physically demanding position need to have a pretty good technical background training is okay and extremely young working environment
good,Company closed so their midwest office down with no warning which is why I was force to leave. I was under the AT&T Digital Life home security division.
good,"A typical day of work involves sending statement of works for the construction build of the tower. I'm very good at learning and adapting to constant change because the work process changes often in the telecommunication industry.  My director has done a good job of ensuring that I'm equipped with the proper tools to ensure my success.  The work culture at Mastec has been one of the best that I've experienced.  The majority of the people that I have work with are willing to share knowledge and are team players.  Our culture is one where if someone falls behind, I would help and vise versa.  The hardest part of my job is when the customer want things in an instant when there is a high volume of work to do.  Sometimes the customer revises what we use to create statement of works and still expects the targeted amount of sites to be completed.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that people know the industry is stressful to a degree so they tend to make jokes to brighten the day."
good,"My job involved traveling almost every week, which is common for standard contract work.   It was a very fast paced job that changed daily.   I did not have to punch a clock, but did have a man hour goal on every job."
good,"Long story short, MasTec was attempting to make inroads into the Home Cable installation market for Cox communications. MasTec was actually a great company to work for. They have very competitive benefits as well as providing their technicians with tools and vehicles which is rare."
good,"I would go back to Mastec again, I believe I learned a lot from some of my peers and management. My immediate supervisor was very helpful whenever he could be. He seemed to understand the basics of the work and what had to be done to meet the specifications that were given to us."
good,"No real security. Many changes all the time, most of them not good for employees. I like the work. Benefits are average. The people I work with are good people which makes the job fun."
good,The usual day is 10 hours long. You usually work 4 days a week. direct management is pretty good. They promote from within a lot. so your direct boss usually has a lot of experience. But the higher up the latter the less they have. The pay could be better. The hardest part is now that we have to sell accessories for the new devices. its hard to compete with the Amazons and Ebays of the world.
good,"I came in got my equipment for the install jobs I had that day. Loaded them in my work van and checked out my handheld to see what and where my first job were. I liked all the traveling the job required. You got to see different places and every job was different which was nice cause it never got boring. I learned about electrical work, running cables, wiring, how to install a satellite dish and to work and install direct tv equipment. My co-workers were cool and always willing to help out. It was a good working environment but you also didn't see them much except in the morning. The hardest part of the job was the hours cause you didn't stop working until you either you finished a certain amount jobs in a day or you got stuck late at a job and there were no more jobs for that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling up and down the east coast. I would recommend this job to someone who doesn't mind working in the elements, a lot physical work, doesn't mind driving a lot, doesn't mind working crazy hours and is good with their hands."
good,great company would love to go back and work but no work in my current area. Would like to see more work from the company Mastec
good,"A typical day at work entails placing myself enroute to residential and commercial customers upon arrival meeting with the customer so that I can do an internal and external site survey. This helps me know exactly what I'll be doing at that particular customers home or business within the realms of whether its a service call, installation or upgrade. However, in terms of management and co-workers I rarely see them unless I'm picking up equipment or if my meeting day. The hardest part of the job is that rarely get that much quality time with my family because I average 13 hour days. I truly enjoy interacting with people and getting the job done to standards and customer satisfaction."
good,Install activate services educate customers on there services. jobs are dispatched to each technician. employees work alone unless time is slow or its a job the requires more than one person.
good,"Route based security and home automation installations, sales and repairs.  I love being a field technician, every house is different and every customer is as well. It adds a change to the normal work routine."
good,Installing and trouble shooting. Heat and attics can wear you down.
good,I went from a contract PM to a Director in 1 yr at this company.
good,The job was very flexible and as an entry level worker progress was good.
good,"Was as decent  company b.c. to work for but family  issues get you on bad terms with higher up management no.     "
good,Job is piece rate. You are paid per job/item installed. Some thrive in this scenario and some don't. The work is fairly simple. Install and service DirecTV systems.
good,this job was so stressful do to the amount of jobs and the a lot of metrics that we have to follow that does not depend on the technician  a100 % like repeats services calls because the customer moved the equipment without calling directv and did not work after that.
good,"Overall I loved my job at Mastec.  I have always been an independent person and other than attending an hour long meeting once a week, It was like I worked for myself.  We were paid Piece Rate instead of hourly pay, which had its positive and negatives.  I personally like the Piece-Work Model because the amount of money that you can make is in direct correlation with how hard you are willing to work.  The negatives almost outweighed the positives though.  If a customer cancelled, wasn't home, or the installation could not be done, we didn't get paid.  There were days where 3 of any of the above circumstances happened and we spent the day driving from house to house without getting paid.  Near the end of my employment with Mastec, for months we had been dealing with warehouse issues and equipment shortages daily.  If I don't have the equipment I need to do my job, due to no fault of my own, I can not do my job.  Which obviously negatively affected my pocketbook.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interaction and making customers satisfied and happy.  The management was also hit or miss.  Some of the supervisors were great, most in fact. My direct supervisor had an obvious lack of a lot of basic knowledge of our job. There were times when I thought I was teaching him more than he had taught me about the profession.  Technology is an ever evolving industry and you have to evolve along with it.  Some managers hadn't been out in the field for years and it showed by theiir lack of knowledge on the newer aspects of the job."
good,"great opportunity. learn a lot about DIRECT TV. MasTec is the installer for DTV. DTV is the face MasTec is the labor. greatest"
good,"Working at Mastec you will work long hours. As a tech, we were required to be onsite at your first job at 8 am. You would work until the last customer was taken care of at night. Some nights you would not make it home until 9 pm. During the busy season this will go on for 6 days a week. The pay could be great if you work fast and hard. As a supervisor your day start at 6 am and you do not shut down until the last tech is home. Some nights you might not finish until midnight. The pay of a supervisor do not reflect the hours you work. The reward is seeing a tech move up to become a captain of his or her team to becoming a supervisor as well."
good,Installing for DirecTV was at times stressful. You are paid by the job so there is an obvious incentive to complete your work as quickly as possible to make more money. I think a flat rate daily pay would encourage others to take the time to install jobs to the required standard instead of trying to get as many jobs done in a short period of time. The staff that I worked with was one of the best I've had.
good,"I love the line of work."
good,"Very busy job keeps you going all day long work day is 5am wake up and might get off around 6-7 on a good day some nights could be till 11 to midnight. "
good,"Great team to work with, paid training and travel. caompany van and gas card. get tools to complete job. get to travel all over the city of chicago"
good,Enjoyed working here. I loved the enviorment it was awesome.
good,"I would facilitate conference calls with Vice Presidents and Directors of operations around their regions training needs and goals."
good,A good place to work if you want an administrative role. It is a small office in Centennial so everyone knows each other. There is really a great environment.
good,"Long hours, independent work with some to no supervision. learned to install DirecTv while on the job I encountered many different home theater system. Hardest part of the job was try to get to each customer assigned for the day.. Many jobs had different obstacles to overcome and the estimated time of completion wasn't long enough therefore dispatch will over assign jobs. Being as it was, it called for long hours(10-18hrs) and many upset customers."
good,"Mastec is a fantastic company that gives it's employees many opportunities to promote or take on additional responsibility."
good,"Good job overall. High stress environment, long hours. good pay"
good,"Atypical day at work consisted of hard work and dedication to the project.  i learned the job and duties from the ground up from how to place, locate, and repair utility.  the management was very demanding we would strive to please the goals set for us when we fell short of the goal it was made up in full the following month and then some.  my co-workers where as individual as social security numbers they were all one of a kind i can honestly say i enjoyed working with them they brought there own experiences and ideas to the table and was avid on teaching anyone who would listen.  the hardest part of the job was in summer the tiring heat and in the winter the relentless cold and the hard labor but all was overcome by resistance of  quitting.  the most enjoyable part of the job was of course the paycheck at the end of the week but also the learning experience."
good,"Mastec Advanced Technologies was a good work experience always maintained a respectful work environment. a typical day at work , drive to work location , assist AEP power Comp. with any and all situations consisting of electrical difficulties."
good,"A well managed company,but the pay is not very good.This would be a great company to work for if they paid you an onist days pay for a onist days work."
good,gained plenty of knowledge of the inner workings of satellite systems and different instillation techniques.
good,Pretty tough job a lot of very hard manual labor. Never know what the day will hold
good,"Recieve route"
good,"I’ve been with Mastec over ten years. Your income is totally up to the individual. Our work is mostly DirecTV installations, upgrades and service calls. You, as a technician, also have the ability to also make DirevTV sales for additional income. The pay is piecework, so the more jobs you close and complete, the more money you’ll make. The more experience you become, the more efficient you will be."
good,"The work enviornment is very fast paced at times, good technicians are paid well, it's piece work so the kore you do the more you're paid. Overall very satisfying customer service experience. At&t has made it somewhat difficult to make a good career from being a technician due to the pictures you have to take and all of the corporate guidelines you must follow. Every little bit more time on a job you have to take adds up to less pay over the course of a year."
good,Good place to work. I don't have anyhing negative to say about this company. management was good to work with. the benifits were good. Vacation time was fair.
good,Sell and deliver / install cable TV service to customers. Educate customer on the function of their package. Service and trouble shoot soft ware issues.
good,"Working under and with  Mastec Supervisors is a very Nice experience, They Help Teams to grow up and very focus about there safety, personnaly i refer Mastec."
good,Great interacting with customers in the field. Knowing you are the person that people will look for when they need help and being able to help them in many ways.
good,A typical day started at 7 & and ended around 5:30.I learned how to built transformers and splice wire. My manager was understanding but also a good teacher. The hardest part of my job would be setting transformers and the most enjoyable part of the job was splicing wire.
good,This is a company that you can get a job with however it is tough to keep it. Due to the fact that you are paid per job. and the company will take money from you for customers complaining.
good,"this company is a good place to work but if you like enjoying spending time with your family then this is not the job for you, working weekend is a must."
good,"Production driven, but with rewards for hard work, management is fair, & does offer advancement with hard work, good bosses, & rewards for hard work, free meals, etc."
good,MAstec is a contractor for DirecTv.   As with most huge companies there are many policies that come from above that just don't make sense.   For instance; we were told that our GPS devices should be mounted in the back of our vans so that they would not be a distraction while driving.
good,"Mastec has been a good place to work for my for the last 16+ years. It has provided for my family everything I currently have, There are bad days. However, It is a good place to work."
good,Great company until they were bought out and laid everyone off.
good,"While Mastec is a well known company within the communication business, it is a very high stress environment due to lack of employees based off workload. As a Project Manager, you interact with every level of Management of both AT&T and other communication companies. "
good,Dealing with DirectTv and get paid by the jobs you do. Requires a lot of driving. Get to work on your own and at your pace. Have to work in all type of weather.
good,"Travel, meet new people, install cable boxes an internet modem for direct tv, free, your own boss, own time table, cool people,clean environment, training available"
good,"Be at customers home no later then 8, Have to be polite and very professional with customers. Need to know how to work fast and clean. Not a hard job just need to know the basics,"
good,"Performed safe and efficient installation of AT&T Digital Life Security Systems."
good,"Typical day was running reports for upper management, setting up Fed Ex shipments, helping set up fellow employees DirecTV accounts, answering questions about payroll and benefits. Management was not always the easiest to deal with. the hardest part of the job was watching all the cut backs. The best part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"wake up pretty early get paid in piecework , great team work but sups does not have a clue most of the times demand more and more about things we cannot control"
good,"great place to start, your journey as a Tec, training really wasnt up to par base on what you actually do in field, wish the mangers were a little bit more helpful seems to me that they dont want to be bothered."
good,"Work from home with nice equipment, but extremely long hours. The minimum day was 7:30am to 6:30pm and there were some days you needed to work over. and there was no overtime. but the salary was very generous."
good,"I had a good team, I use to lern every day something new, technicians use to help each other’s , so that was good, stressful job, always running from one job to another"
good,the work crew (techs) are like family but the management team didn't provide much help or assistance..got thrown to the wolves if something went wrong or the site had issues and the never backed the techs in fear for their own jobs.
good,"Mas Tec was a great challenging, fun company to work for. Lots of opportunities to advance and to grow with new experiences to travel and work in different cities. Poor management but overall good company to work for."
good,"Apart from the benefits of DirecTV, there really isn't anything special about MasTec. A very backward company in the way of business in todays technology world. Poor internal resources to do the job. How can you say you have Advanced Technologies when you only 10/100Mbps network and 8 year old hardware!!!"
good,"Technicians are paid by the job (piece work).  Supervisors/Management are salary.  Compensation is very competitive.  Hours are long.  Techs are always paid overtime.  No weekends off.  Some Friday/Saturday, others Sun/Mon, most everyone has two weekdays off.  The weekends are the busiest days.  Work day ends when all jobs are closed out.  Commonly work is from 6AM-until."
good,Job provided advanced training on site to gain skill to perform job at maximum level.
good,"Hired as prime contractor for Comcast after purchase of ATT Broadband.to upgrade a great portion of the San Francisco Bay Area and surrounding counties making it one of the biggest construction programs in the U.S. at the time. Managed all technical and power distribution infrastructure during a four year period managing managers, supervisors, quality control reps., contractor coordinators, vendors and major stakeholdes."
good,Although I highly appreciate the flexability when it comes to work/home life theres only so far you can advance in this company.
good,Pay based on pice work  veryous busy and slow times  company deversifying  asking tecd to do alot more then what they were originally hired for and as a field tec yournow expected to sell multiple different products to customers while at their house while getting penny for doing so in return
good,"Be prepared for long hours out and about, the service area for Farmington, NM is about 150 miles anywhere from Chama, NM to Cortez, CO and everywhere between those two points. Management used to be good before they let go of the two supervisors. Pros Travel on your own and helpful coworkers (not including management). Cons Long hours and very little help from management."
good,"If you like something, you can do it without complaints even though it is very hard, but if you don’t, then do not waste your time. Everyone trys to help you to be successful at your job. Trainer are the best people ever. In conclusion, you will do great if you you like it every where."
good,"Must have great work ethic, pay is determined by the job, the more jobs the more pay and vise versa, minimal management communication but company vehicle supplied with gas card."
good,"Toman mucho tiempo en entrenar personal y poca atención al pro ceso de supervisar "
good,n/a nothing to add at this time. as im still employed and hav etotal respect for the company i currently work for.  in the end if im able to i'd like to revisit a exit review
good,This was a great experience for me I learned a lot of things working with mastec I relocated for more experience I've worked with different types of company and people.
good,we started at 6 AM and you worked until you were done with your orders. you get paid by the job. it is a hot dirty job with a lot of windshield time that's not paid.
good,I am grateful for the opportunity I was given to work with Mastec as well as Xfinity. I learned a lot about being a Cable Technician and I enjoyed working there.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working there, however there were few mostly personal issues that caused me to leave. First was the time requirements. You often begin a day at 5am going to the warehouse and possibly stay out until 7 or 8 at night. The other issue was insufficient training. I ran into to problems that had never seen before and was not trained for. Luckily the supervisors and other employees were cool enough to help if you called, however this is a very hands on job so describing the issue over the food only allowed them to give a small amount of help. The final issue was the pay. You get paid well for installations, but I there way more service calls than new installations which on pay 24 dollars, but might tale 2+ hours to solve. You often go home after a 10 hour day only having made 50 dollars. If you can deal with working in the sun, dealing with insects, angry customers ,and spending hours troubleshooting, then this job is for you."
good,Great Job but terrible pay. The room for advancement is there but the technicians are treated like second-class citizens. It's a great company to work for as a stepping stone into the Telecommunications field
good,The work was not very hard but challenging on a day to day bases. Never doing the same thing everyday . You have to be able to deal with customers in their home. And know that they are not always kind to deal with.
good,"Mastec cable division is just one part of the company. The cable side is very inconsistent with work, lack of work available in the field. mind games to punish workers that are less attentive then others, and a cheap way of bulling workers to do what they think should be done. Its not going to work.., to much buddy , buddy on the job."
good,use company vehicle.load what equipment needed to perform your installs or service calls.use ladder to climb high on roofs.work mostly on your own most of day
good,"I quick the company because my CM sing a contract  that reduce my salary from  28 to 13 an hour. The only problem on HI is the logistic, never had the material to build the site"
good,Great job good management. The job started great. Really motivated manager. Always kept us informed with what was going on for the week. Just too much traveling.
good,like work company not very good would not work for them again
good,Throughout my years with Mastec I've absorbed a extensive amount of information and have obtained many life long skills.
good,"loaded up van and routed out jobs in area that was assigned , and completed installs and service calls assigned for that day"
good,Great environment and great staff! management is ok. most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by positivity each and every day. I have learned a lot working here.
good,They owned your every hour of each day. No work life balance. Great team work and help from coworkers. Met alot of People and learned communication skills.
good,"Excellent job for highly motivated individuals who like to work alone and good money. Company will support you and help you make a lot of money if you work hard, productive and efficient."
good,"Started well, company car, Iphone, Ipad and android phone. Fun place to work, great work ethic. Awesome bosses. lots of changes, then terrible bosses, bad work ethic. Then sales and finally client pulling out"
good,"You get paid piece rate here which is converted to hourly so they can factor in overtime. When the money is good its good but when things or slow or you are stuck doing nothing but service calls, its terrible. You are at the whims of the dispatchers it seems and every week there is a new policy or procedure you must abide by."
good,"Good environment with a competitive culture and yet an overall sense of getting the job done."
good,"Physically demanding and mentally draining. Constant changes make it hard to fully enjoy what you do. Beyond that, it is a great place to work ...IF you don't wish to interact with loved ones."
good,They Have A Lot Of Work There's Never A Dull Moment It Has Its Days You're Hardly Home Be Sure And Know You're Ready And Willing To Work And Do What Is Required
good,"Fast paced, and ever changing. Work vehicle, inventory and continuing training provided. Typical day was to install 5 to 6 Direct TV satellite systems or to troubleshoot and fix up to 10 up to 10 systems."
good,"The electrical side of Mastec is better then the satellite installation department. Satellite department is base off of piece work the more installs you are able to do the more money you make.,"
good,"This job pays on a point-per-job basis and the summer is the good business time and winter is low business. you can make 150 points one day and 45 points the next. Very chaotic. You will begin your day around 7 am and end between 6 and 9 pm. You will get better and faster with practice, but you should know this in advance. If Mastec gets lots of jobs then you will do better but you could end up working 6 days a week (no choice) and if Mastec gets less jobs you may only work 4 days that week (no choice). Mastec does a reasonably good job training you they give you a month or so and a couple of weeks with a veteran cable technician. This may not be enough time for some teachings to sink in though. If you are capable of working under pressure and time constraints you can probably do well enough."
good,"load up the truck, head out to customers house, install, next job. i learned how to work with what you got, management was all over the place, workplace is diverse, different homes means different backgrounds, hardest part of the job is the winter, enjoyable is driving around the state."
good,"Learned to emphasize on safety over productivity without sacrificing neither.  Very fast pace line of work but very rewarding.  Lot of customer satisfaction, inventory management and performance metrics."
good,Great for the self starter. Ideal for someone who prefers little to no constant supervision. Of the varied supervisory styles can impact your understanding of the process but overall almost non-invasive.
good,Its all in your hands. The more jobs you do the more money you make. Good relations with the supervisors helps so much. You have your freedom nobody is on your back all day unless you do not do your job right.
good,"Learned a lot, fast-paced work environment. Opportunity for some travel, and did some out of state design jobs.  Managed and supervised drafters, provided their reviews"
good,i really liked this job ...ranked #2 on my team ...however when i had concerns about working jobs far apart from each other ... in went down hill from there
good,"Perform Installation of Home Security Systems,Installation of cctv cameras,security door locks,thermostats, fire alarms,water senor,window and door sensors"
good,worked long hours the job itself was challenging but was very rewarding in the end. had the opportunity to meet great customers. it help expend my knowledge of technology.
good,"The management team are great to work for. They really try to look out for you."
good,"good company to make decent money, long days of work, 6 day work weeks, typically 75 hours a week. Not good if you have a family. Good supervisors and good co-workers"
good,This was a really fun place to work.  We had fun while at work and the drivers and management team was great. The atmosphere was very laid back and very one was respectful of each other.
good,"Working for Directv was nice in the fact that interacting with several different people everyday, and they look out for there employees by providing the correct tools needed to complete the job."
good,"Reevaluate who is actually performing. Who is merely riding on the coat tails of others. Put a system in place to ensure everyone is responsible for actually performing some sort of function to justify their position and jot merely putting all of their responsibilities on the people below them, recognize loyalty and those that go above and beyond, honor commitments made, stop running a multimillion dollar company like a boys club. Don't close an office and place everyone out of work based on the ineptitude of a business development employee not doing his job, be proactive and replace them when they aren't performing instead of keeping someone that does not perform and laying off anbentire office that has a proven track record"
good,This is a very good company to work for and it is a challenging work environment. Must be able to multi task and handle stress.
good,"have to learn fast or you could fall behind of the updates product, also has to be a handy man for other devices. able to install wireless security systems and establish  good technical experience."
good,would never work there again. hours sucked and waiting on the side of the road for work for hours and not getting paid for it.
good,"Installed DirecTV service in business and residential environments.  Installed dish, and wired premises with RG6 cabling.  Trained and provided customers with all of the information needed.  Wired phone line to set top boxes for caller ID, and ordering pay per view."
good,"•	Handled all of the new hires, employee benefits (including medical, dental and 401K), oversaw child support garnishments and handled the worker’s compensation, child support cases."
good,The company itself was a great company. The training was great and the trainer was cool. The only bad part of the company was some of the supervisors didn't know what they were talking about sometimes.
good,My day start at 6:30am i rearrange the Tech daily schedule route for the day. i learned how to manage 20 Technicians day to day  activities to  make my days easy and be able to help manager with there Team with Team work it make life much easier around the office. The hardest part of my job is when one of your co-worker is not doing their part and you have to do there work and yours but when every one is working together the company run like a well oiled machine and that's where the most enjoyable part of my job comes easy
good,"Installing Directv at customers homes"
good,"MasTec doesn't pay their technicians enough for all the occupational hazards (ex. snakes, spiders, ladders, confined spaces)"
good,This company wants nothing but for you to work all day and all night for little pay... Inventory is always messed up they are charging the employees for equipment that we never get or have just i wouldn't work for them again they just throw you away after there done with you
good,"Since reaching level of Senior Technician, I have been stuck fixing mistakes of up to 4 technicians before me which are called 'Case Mgt' service calls. These jobs are tedious but I always rectify problem but as a contractor they not very lucrative when I could be doing installations that pay four times as much. "
good,"Mostly driving, Different working enviroments, and troubleshooting techniques. Great individuals and very helpful on a daily bases. Not being able to provide service to clients. Meeting new people everyday."
good,Information regarding Mastec employment is prohibted as per there legal request
good,Job  was great always in a new place everyday kept you steady with work and great benefits.
good,Good job to work at it was fun. I love dealing with people on the regular bases. Even more when I am making them happy upon my departure.
good, Inspecting installs and service of all other Technicians
good,Outside all year Certain seasons work slows down Receive work in morning . Over all jobs not bad
good,The greatest thing was a was the supervisor for my projeect gsm harvest. It was a great llearning experence i got to travel a lot .The coworker was great . The hardest part was when employees did'nt want to listen they wanted to do what they want.
good,Great job to begin in but with promotions come no pay raise and your schedule changes every 3 months.
good,"Work at own pace but beware for pay scale is piece work payed upon completion per work order, Learned valuable information in all aspects of satellite installation,repair,integration, as well as customer service. Management as well as co-workers were not only an honor to work with but also very helpful in any situation that may have occurred from shortage of equipment to unreasonable customers. Most difficult part of job would be weather delays, once inclement weather arises creating unsafe working conditions no money can be made. Most enjoyable meeting new people and being satisfied with a job well done."
good,Has successfully services DirectTV for many years
good,There is an unrealistic expectation of producing quality AND quantity of work that MasTec expects there employees to perform. At least that’s my personal assessment.
good,"Great team environment, good opportunity to make a good amount if your into a fast pace working environment. Piece rate work pretty understanding management"
good,"Very boring work, but supportive manager and assistance manager. Was told that night/weekend on-call schedule was a rotating assignment, but was given Saturday shift on a permanent basis after training. I left for a job that I had weekends free, but they've subsequently changed their scheduling to avoid that."
good,get to first customers house by 8am and work threw the day completing jobs (installs and service calls) until there are no more to do and then go home. 5/2 work days. 1 month in the year 6/1 work to days off.
good,Independent work. As a technician you try to do as much work as possible a day so it may reflect on your paycheck. Besides the attic heat and the south Florida heat it was fun working there.
good,"Typical day consists of arriving at the costumer home on time, first appointment schedule for 8 a.m. even if you had to drive over an hour, we made sure we were there. I learn the installation of dishes, where it would make it easy to make cable connections so in the future the technician that might have to service the system would have easy access. Great team efforts, we never went home until all jobs were completed. It was hard to see new comers struggle with installations, but we all had our backs. It was a great feeling seeing costumers happy to have tv service and that the place was left clean."
good,Great environment for work. Coworkers become like family even though you work alone. Got to see a lot of the country with this job as well. Good people from the top to the bottom.
good,Good company over all to work for. There is some discrimination if your not Latin or Spanish speaking. Company has good benefits and flexibility in the departments.
good,The potential for income is very good.  The more work you close the more money you make.  Provide you with transportation and gas card with a phone...
good,Mastec was mismanaged from the beginning and was lacking key management people to help push the Hayward branch to success. The compensation was great if only it was lead by competent people. I hope they come back to the bay area.
good,"Mastec  was my first exposure to the call center environment. "
good,Fast paced and pretty high pressure especially during summer months when we do a LOT of hiring. Fun place to work and very rewarding when you can meet the high bars set.
good,"I actually liked MasTec a lot. I would probably still be there if it wasn't for one supervisor in particular at the florence sc office. I got along with everyone but him, he never liked me for some reason and when my supervisor moved i was forced to work under him and he tried to throw me under the bus for something i didnt do and ended up getting me fired."
good,Had Good Training and was transformed into a productive technician with good track record of completing Technical jobs with excellent customer service.
good,"•	MasTec Direct TV Technician "
good,"Good work environment, good benefits but not very good salary."
good,This is a good company to work for if you are in the cabling field. The management team was good and the work atmosphere was positive.
good,"If you are motivated and organized, you can succeed in this buisness."
good,Great place to work with a big focus on work place safety. The culture starts and ends with safety as a priority. Solid management team in place that help to push the core values of the company.
good,Management lets you take the fall for poor management.  They are not involved in the day to day operations and jobs that are bid jobs were not bid correctly where MasTec makes a profit.
good,"This company is great to work for as long as you perform as expected and stay out of trouble.  BasicallyYou get what you put in, if you take pride in your work than youll like it here too"
good,The work was fun but they had no limit on service calls and where they could send you. I would sometimes have to drive 2-3 hours for a call and they would not pay driving time.
good,The job is very fast pace and the site in el paso is a mobile site meaning they travel sometimes 2 weeks at a time all over Texas doing installs for directv.
good,It was a good company to work for just looking for something else that pays a little better. Had a good work experience with them and they have taught me a lot of good stuff just looking for something better
good,It was a nice work environment. I learn how to work with different types of cables and wires. Also learned how to properly use equipment that was required for installations.
good,"Enjoyed working there, long hours pay was acceptable my particular supervisor was a team player a good leader always had an answer for the problem had no problem getting Hands-On in the field"
good,"•	Troubleshoot, diagnose, and repair units while in the field."
good,some difficult digs but things were done in a proficient manner. Management is execlent they got there job done with very little stress on the workers.
good,"work hard, get ahead"
good,"Other than the pay, it was a great job. Really good and friendly management. I enjoyed being in the public and meeting new customers. I am still a Directv customer to this day, because of their quality of service."
good,"First job at 8am, pull job from queue review order, meet with customers and move to next job. Learned many ways to find signal especially in difficult situations. The hardest part was trying to fix another installers work that was not done properly. Most enjoyable was having great team work with fellow installers."
good,I loved the work and can say I learned so much. The biggest downside was favoritism and didn't get compensated fairly but stuck around until the end up the project.
good,"As I climbed the ranks it was very difficult on personal life. (Non Existent) A company you can grow with but must be willing to work when you want to be off and also be willing to work long hours. "
good,"Company is descent to work for. Just a lot if traveling and time away from home. Pay and benefits are OK. Equipment is not too bad also, needs improvement in qualified people."
good,"job has good pay when company is busy.   "
good,Good people and challenging work.  Opportunities are available around the country.  The staff is friendly and job sites are well put together and safe.
good,Great company with great diversity. Middle and upper management is under a great deal of pressure to perform in a market that has never been able to perform well due to the demographics and the geographical area. I have seen the best of the best fail and the long term employees go by the waste side in a cut throat industry.
good,"Great starting point for young men in life, learning to overcome adversity with customers, type of homes, completing work orders within guidelines, working safely. Being employed at mastec teaches accountability, time management, and makes you very attentive to each and every work order. The drive this job created for me was we were paid my commission(piecework) and management pushing for the best numbers. So you were in competition to make your money for your family and also be recognized number wise for your production."
good,the job itself was awesome but management was not tip top ..they showed a lot of favoritism in the work fields . you advanced only of they liked you not how hard you worked
good,"Sign AHA, Check our trenches box, where we are going to lay Electrical Line make sure we doesnt destroy any other line such as sewer lines or water line"
good,"Work Day: Varies by location."
good,"go to costumer house or locations, install their equipment, give costumer service, managers were unprofessional, co-workers were friendly, dealing with inclement weather was the harder par of it, seen the costumers satisfaction was the best part of it."
good,Learned a lot here about hard work. Discounts on phone and tv. top pay for hard work and get to meet a lot of people and see a lot of surrounding citys.
good,"Gather, sort, and review time sheets on Monday AM. Verify correct codes, employee name, employee numbers, and verify time sheets are signed off by supervisors. Once verification completed, manually enter all employees time sheets by 10AM into an excel spreadsheet that calculates hours and prints out a summary form showing all information entered. From there, supervisor would send uploads to Corporate Payroll department via Oracle. Corporate Payroll would then send out error reports which we would fix in Oracle and then print out final payroll reports. Payroll reports were reviewed and then employee hours were entered manually into an employee list to verify all employees hours. Tuesdays preliminary registers were sent to me and printed to verify all payroll information was downloaded correctly. From there any errors would be fixed via payroll adjustments. Payroll process was done for about 200 employees in offices located in North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina.Other tasks besides being the liaison between Corporate and local offices in Western Carolinas included: maintaining records for all contractors/employee records and paperwork (invoices and daily routes), spreadsheets verifying employee vacation time, assist with new hire orientation, benefits administration and employee reward and recognition program. All tasks were completed in a confidential environment. I was the ""go to girl"". My numerous tasks were unlimited, I assisted in finding a resolution to most employee payroll issues and benefits questions, I also assisted with our audits of paperwork. I would have"
good,"Teamwork, safety and willing to be open to all the aspects of the job. Ensuring that the work completed has been done according to the customers expectations"
good,Training isnt enough for some of those tuff issues they send you on..with no help .so told to reschedule for smarter people to do..so why send those whp just started.??
good,The crew is very friendly but they do not know how to  communicate so well and tend to get on a childish side but over all it was a great paying job it will keep you busy
good,the hard part of the job was to leave home early to drive sometime over 1 hour 30 and up to 2 hours to go to your first job and come back home late. There was no pressure . Management was fine good people and cooperative.
good,"Working at mastec is different you get so see a lot of different people, but you got to make sure your going fast, and you can learn quickly. Some days you get home at 4 or 5 some days its 9"
good,I enjoy the job but it's not for everyone. A lot of travel but if you're willing to work you can make very good money. management is fair and always willing to work with you
good,Hardest part of the job is the pay structure. Management not given much training. They promote good technicians to supervisor but don't give them much training in their new roles.
good,It's a good place to work. I had a good time working here. Staff is nice and staff is really good. It was a good experience and money was good. good insurance
good,decent company.  worked there for 10 plus years. I ranked inside the to 20 techs out of over 4 thousand. in the east region. I loved meeting and helping  the different customers daily.
good,Very fast paced.  High call volume. family culture environment.  Tone of daily conference calls.  Upper management has open door policy. Tones of emails daily that you must respond to.  Work more with less is MasTec saying.
good,The job was a good way to show and bring out a lot of positive things in me. It showed me how to work fast and correct errors on my own. Fast paced and great scheduling.
good,"This company is a great company if you're looking to work as a install technician, they will provide training, gas allowance and vehicles to start your work day.  Company will not praise you for your hard work, if you mess up once, that's it your done."
good,"Mastec was one of the best companies I've worked for so far, however the position was not secure as it depended on the financial situation of the department in which I worked."
good,"Install, move, and modify Alarm, telecommunications and related equipment, according to job order specifications, standards, and procedures.Diagnose equipment malfunctions.Repair voice and data equipment Maintain and report accurate records of hours and materials used.Report and monitor service order changes Maintain and repair telecommunications systems and equipment according to manufacturer recommendations and specifications.Perform additional functions incidental to technician activities.Install electrical and mechanical control mechanisms.Install structured wiring and/or audio visual and video data voice equipment.Install central vacuum systems, surround sound, audio and video equipment, structured wiring, fire and intrusion alarm systems and intercom."
good,"Learned how to install and repaired alarm system, automation door locks and security cameras. Typical day involve leaving home and arriving at your assignment by 08:00 am and ended when the job was completed. Hardest part of the day would be when there is a system outage"
good,"If your afraid of heights dont apply. Its a very easy concept to understand, get free directv and att discounts. workforce is very friendly and helpful to complete your job"
good,Day started at 6am end when you were done all installs learned how to install satellite Dish co worker were great we help each other out when needed hardest part of job was installing dish on roofs most enjoyable was the home  owners delight after install.
good,Usually my day starts at 7 o'clock that's when I know where my route is going to start call the costumer let them know im enroute to there location and go from there.
good,"Mastec is the leader in Construction Services.  It employs very good civil and turf employees who are dedicated to doing a good job on anything they touch.  I have learned a great deal within the Mastec team on how to become a better Project/Construction Manager.  The hardest part of the job is the windshield time, but that is the norm in this industry.  The most rewarding part of the job is knowing that you are contributing to the success of the company and its employees."
good,I enjoy working for Mastec and interacting with the customers. I have good communication with my supervisors and Managers. I enjoy working for this company and love installing for customers. Only down fall is that you are paid by the job so paycheck isn't steady which is hard with a family.
good,"A typical day at work was being responsible for handling on going audits and scoping cell site's for Att, Which included Training Audit crews to be able to deliver information from all aspects of the Job to the customer based on their needs, working with co-workers and reviewing photos, drawings and getting conctractors to perform certain duties needed in the Field. Keeping track of multiple cell sites and trackers, Enjoy working with others to complete asignments on time, Hardest part of the job was keeping up with multiple changes by the customer. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers and Learning new technology."
good,Working for mastec was a delight but they had rules that set technicians up for failure.
good,"A 10 to 12 hour work day but well compensated. Management was, in most cases good. But they went through a lot of managers.  A good bunch of co-workers in most cases but there is always a few bad apples."
good,Great company to work for if you like to work with Advance Tech equipment.Equipment used is most of the time has no problems.
good,"called to schedule appointments, install and trouble shoot Directv systems"
good,The training portion was detailed. The work is good. It is a low stress enviroment.
good,"It would be nice if the contract end period never came.I enjoyed working with the vendors. It was especially nice to be able to travel to different cities. I liked the fact that no two sites were the same. This required that every technical skill I thought I knew, had to be applied in a different manner. I think this enviroment works well for me."
good,My 10 year stint with MasTec Advanced Technology was challenging and fun. It was a tremendous opportunity which I was able to excel at benefiting myself and the company.
good,"I have been with MasTec for over 15 years and have learned alot.  I have adapted to the many changes and challenges that have come along the way and have fully supported those changes.  The company was very supportive when my region was changed a few years ago to allow me to work remotely for the region I serve under now.  I enjoy the support position I have been in and thrive on solving issues, supporting my team and communicating benefits and policies to our new hires.  In my tenure I have learned low level HR information and how to handle specific issues such as clear communication when it comes to delivering information, the importance of privacy and security of our employees, being unbiased when addressing payroll issues but empathizing with employees when in need of assistance.  The hardest part of my job is my inability at times to totally disconnect.  I pride myself on making sure that issues are addressed even when I am out of the office.  The most enjoyable part of my job has been the flexibility in working remotely and traveling to my offices I oversee for support and interacting with my peers and front line employees."
good,My office was my company vehicle where i spend my whole day in driving from one installation or service call to the next.  I was responsible for proper installation and/or troubleshooting Direct Tv into homes and businesses.  My day started around 6am and ended anywhere from 4pm to 8pm depending on the workload..monday thru saturday
good,Mastec was a good company to work for. They cared about employees. There was some traveling but Mastec paid for hotel when out of town. Work got slow at times so didn’t always get 40 hr work week. This only happened a few times.
good,the company I worked for was trash they were a sub contracting company whom I dnt remember but they stole money from my last check sooo who cares right
good,"-drive to customer"
good,"Job is steady, great management. Tasks are manageable. Hours are flexible. Benefits are absolutely amazing. Taking time off was simple. Always opportunities to advance"
good,Fts is an awesome guy out of the Abilene office on the direct t.v side. Your money potentially is how good of a worker you are if you dont like to stay at least halfway busy this job is not for you
good,"Buena empresa, se necesita habilidades para trabajar con clientes."
good,"Overall Mastec is a solid company. They offer quite a few areas of work. I was employed as a Directv contractor through Mastec and it was a very stressfull experience. The hours are inconsistent as you have to arrive at your first customer's home by 8am and the end of day is whenever there is no more work in your area. This means you could have a day where you end at 11am or you could end at 9 or 10pm. Pay is completely piece rate meaning you get paid per job you complete. It is very hard to plan for anything monetarily. Travel is a huge facet of the office. You are mandated to travel to other areas of the east coast such at Long Island, Washington D.C, Virginia Beach, etc. for a minimun of 2 weeks at a time and if you refuse, they threaten suspension with no pay. Travel is as frequent as once a month to every other month and you have no choice but to travel. If you are a fast and solid tech then you can make a lot of money but as far as stress is concered, there is a lot of it."
good,"Very Busy. There was no set time when completing the job because sometimes you ran into problem, like the system shutting down. The hardest part of the job was working outside in extreme heat and crawling in tight spaces. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you complete the job well and the customer appreciate your work achievement. If the customers happy than I am happy!!!!"
good,Good group to work with. Training provided and many knowledgeable guys there to help with anything you may have questions about. Room for advancement.
good,Installation and servicing of DirecTV satellite systems. The hardest part of the job was staying up passed midnight installing a customers system while having to wake up at 5 am to go to work in the morning. The most enjoyable part in my opinion was customer service which in my opinion is bringing a smile and satisfaction to my customers.
good,"great place, great management, team work great. Unavoidable overtime. downside is the family/ work life balance. Great stress trying to balance. Great for single individual can make good money to an efficient self driven individual"
good,Mastec is a good company to work for.  A well balanced work/life structure in which family time is recognized as integral part of employee's morale building.  Cross training across platforms could be improved.
good,Traveled all over as an installer for the company. I learned a lot with this company on wiring of fiber optics and such. The most enjoyable part of the job was the traveling if you like to travel.
good,"I worked as a contractor at a satellite office so I rarely got to meet and deal with Mastec people other than my office which was mixed. I really liked my manager. From what I could tell, Mastec seems like a good company. Who we had our contract with was not"
good,management could have been more helpful after training. Was able to travel with company often which was nice. I enjoyed working there. Great company to work for
good,"Job was awesome,company car provided for everyone with gas cards..work culture was on high percentage.Working for the company enabled me to learn and grow so much in my area  of expertise.management was the best ever i have encountered."
good,I was fortunate enough to experience the very first Cable contracting project in the nation for MasTec in California Bay area. As a cable tech was obtaining daily routes to serve Comcast customer for installing and troubleshooting their services. I was mentoring the new techs based on my experience. delivering the best experience ever for my every customer was crucial and very important for me. Having the opportunity to gain my living based on my production was very enjoyable for me since it helped how to manage and take advantage of every single minute of my daily routine.
good,"It was my first field technician position and they did a good job of providing training and teaching me everything I needed to know to get out in the field installing home security systems. "
good,"Good job, friendly people, hours not exactly desireable sometimes, but worth the job if you love what youre doing. hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were not nice or hot headed."
good,"You definitely meet and work with great people, but the upper management add more to the job than is required per job hiring. The most enjoyable part would be working alone with no one to bug you."
good,"Work environment was typical of telecommunications construction, pay was good, co workers were solid, but purchase of work materials and company gas cards were slow to trickle down. Tools were not provided in a timely manner, most of the tools I had to purchase myself, and had to wait to get refunded by the company at least 3-4 weeks. I enjoyed the perks of a larger corporate structure where hard work was rewarded and they looked after job security for everyone who wanted to stay with company. Unfortunately management at the higher levels were unable to make changes so that we could retain the main contract, and work fell through because of it."
good,"Great company to work for, a lot of unsupervised time so all your work is solely held accountable by you. Great opportunities to move up. Hardest part of the job is going into strangers house on a daily basis and setting up the new device, not knowing the type of person you will encounter. Overall customers are generally nice and welcoming. Best part  is being mobile and not working in a store all day. Great perks and benefits working with the company."
good,the job is a good job to start and learn from. the job taught me a lot of new skills on top of what I already knew how to do. I would recommend this job to any young technician looking for a good job fresh out of school
good,Its good overall but a lot of stress and driving also you have to be very patient with time and equipment also it required some one who can be okay in people's home for few hours and pets friendly.
good,Working with the company was great. The supervisor assigned to me not so great.I would still recommend people to work for this company.
good,The job of a Satellite Technician is a rewarding job.  However pay attention to the interview.  I was asked since I lived in Syracuse if I would have a problem traveling once or twice a week.  I spend 85% or of my days outside of Onondaga county about 1hr 30min from Syracuse.  The company does not care that you have no home life.  The managers and supervisors are always home with their families everyday.  The supervisors and managers also have a life outside of the office.  The Technician does not have a life of any kind outside the office.  To believe that you will be home by 4 or 5 pm everyday is a lie.  The technicians work every holiday and are not home until 6 or 7 at the earliest.  Sometimes longer.  There is no  balance between the job and home life at all.
good,"A very exciting workplace dealing directly with people"
good,Alot of outdoor work and manual labor. You get to meet alot of people and see different things. Need to inform trainees of tools they will need to buy before they start working.
good,MasTec was a fun workplace that I enjoyed getting up going to everyday. It wasn't only the work that so enjoyed doing but also the people that I worked with as well. I must admit to do miss working for the company. They were more about the people they employed as well as the customers serving.
good,"Receive jobs dispatched to my work pad, leave from home to get to customers home by 8 am, perform home survey and placement of devices, then complete installation and customer education.  I have learned that most people are very responsive to being more informed of the operation rather then the installation of the alarm system.  Management is very dependable and my coworkers are very helpful when it comes to helping out with equipment or general help i might need. The hardest part of my job would be the unexpected issues that come up and trying to get done in the time scheduled when the issues happen.  The best part of my job is seeing the customers happy and excited about their new system."
good,"I had worked with Mastec for a long time and would have been there still but the customer I worked for , the company had lost contract with them and had to let me go."
good,"•	Schedule/Rescheduling dispatch workers, work crews/equipment"
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits and opportunity to move in different areas of the company."
good,"Every morning, CoV inventory is maintained. Each customer is called to confirm arrival ETA. DirecTV/Mastec driving safety standards are utilized throughout the day. Upon arrival at customer's house, and following an appropriate and friendly introduction, a site survey is conducted to determine best satellite dish installation. Stringent safety and quality installation standards are upheld to maintain strong client-company relations. A customer education session is performed post-installation. We are not to leave until the customer is completely satisfied with their installation, have a confident understanding of DirecTV functionality, and have information on what to do if their DirecTV system were to have a problem. Open communication with management is maintained throughout the day to bring success to a fast-paced, ever-changing work environment."
good,"Provided administrative support to office team, customers and technicians.Scheduled appointments and provided information to callers."
good,I learned so many things while working for MasTec. I appreciate the time took during training and beyond to promote success on our teams. I started off as a Recruiting Coordinator and worked my way up to having my own territory i was responsible for. I worked two of the busiest markets locally and several remotely when needed
good,"""Great company, employees, mission, and values. Management is open and honest, goals are visible and appropriately challenging.Management is very encouraging and really want their team members to succeed. During my time here, my boss has worked with me to make sure I get the experience I need to grow in my career"
good,"Great managers on site, but some REALLY long days. They're upfront about how demanding the job is. Paid per job when I was there, and you do occasionally get stuck with bum jobs..."
good,Good survey I really enjoyed the company atmosphere among with the team work of my fellow technicians I would definitely recommend working at this company
good,The teams that we work with are there for each other every day . The management team as well looks out for all of the technicians. Sometimes the job can get tough but there is always someone to call for support  when needed.
good,"Great opportunity Good Benefits,  I learned a great deal, moved up, flexibility was what I needed at the time. I enjoyed the People I worked with and the incentives"
good,My time at MasTec was nice. The employees were always friendly and I had all necessary tools to complete my job. I enjoyed having an hour for my lunch and working in a relaxed environment.
good,"great company for work for, learn a lot about networking , every day learn something new and co worker very corporate with helping you if stock at the jobs,"
good,Mastec doesn't require future employees to have any pre qualifications. Mastec provides a paid 5 week hands on learning program where employee can learn the nuisances of being a certified field technician.
good,"It was a great experience that i had here, i got to launch the sprint direct 2 you program. Worked with a lot of different people, also learned a lot of new things."
good,Open the door to many more job opportunities and provided new experience. The hardest part was being away from my family but it was beneficial in providing for them. The staff was very professional and open to share their ideas and experience to help me do a better good. I love interacting with the customer and providing the best service.
good,"install cable for cable company well help people with customer service issues.Diagnose satellite problems and letting the customer know what the problem are, and how i was able to fix the problem to get their cable working again."
good,"Utilized appointment management tools via Salesforce to document appointment statuses through the pre-defined stages assigned and to chat live with Experts"
good,I am a physical person. I enjoyed going to peoples houses and installing cable for them. It was a pretty cool job. I didn't like cliimbing 40 food ladders but like I said it was a cool job.
good,It's a great job with a great potential to make great money. They give you great benefits too. But you must dedicate your entire day and life to them.
good,"I worked here for 3 years and the management is great, loved the job and its benefits but traveling for two weeks every month got old especially if you have a family. I spent over half the year away from home but the management did do its best to help when i needed time off. great pay plus many perks like per diem, free hotel points . Hardest part of the job was when you had to travel out of town to austin or dallas and spend two weeks away from home working six days straight and over 10 hours a day."
good,"Great people, systems, and process make a huge different at Mastec.  While there were needs in improving systems, company was well on their way to make those changes to improve efficiency."
good,"Great working environment"
good,"Good job for a self starter and have a willingness to learn. Work alot of hours and put work in. Good training when you can get in a class. OJT teaches you alot also, on testing equipment."
good,Good place to work. Everyone seems fair and friendly. Everyone seems to know what to do and tries to get the job done. Very pleased with the benefits and overall work experience
good,"Up tempo, time sensitive and team player atmosphere.  Small office attention to big details for Satellite Installation.  Answering field technicians and following up with customers and appointment scheduling and rescheduling.  Routing work orders, inhouse payroll processing."
good,"Between MasTec and AT&T the technicians were provided with everything they needed to be successful in the field. "
good,"excellent place to work. Just a lot less money than Ron's tv, who they bought out, was paying. The same job but almost 1/2 the money? Come on now get real"
good,I enjoy my job with Mastec. I still work for the company. My only issue is that we keep loosing projects. I am not sure where I will have to go or if there is any place to go after the San Antonio job is completed.
good,There's never a dull moment. Fast pace service calls with a wide variety of challenging situations. With such a HUGE customer base to work with you could literally work for a lifetime without ever seeing the same customer twice...
good,Would definitely advise this job to anyone... if your under the age of 24 you should definitely staying at home with parents good idea but if you have a family I wouldn't
good,"I worked with Mastec for 15 years and do not regret a day. Days vary with different challenges and business changes. I enjoyed working with my teams, coaching and mentoring, and seeing others successes. "
good,"Mastec is a great company with great benefits. If you don't mind hard-work and plenty oh hours to make some money, this is the perfect company for you."
good,"freedom, lots of work, good pay, good benefits, good career starter if looking for one, and good people to work with. you learn hor to install satellites and security systems."
good,"very much balance between work and personal life, dedicated team and good manages. very good place for a developer to enhance his skills."
good,good learning job for starting techs that want to learn about the satellite and cable life. fun fast paced work. good work ethic skills
good,"start day around 6 am check the route for the day, check inventory, load truck and have morning meeting, Start route complete installations and work orders. Management was always checking in on you and willing to assist when needed. Co workers would come and help out If you need assistance, The most enjoyable part of this job was having a satisfied costumer and a successful installation. "
good,"MasTec AT is an infrastructure company, the Advanced Technologies branch of which is directly contracted by DirecTV/AT&T to perform installation and maintenance of satellite TV systems, home security systems, and internet services.  It is by no stretch a bad place to work at, but at the same time, you have to consider the very culture behind working for a satellite provider such as this arm of MasTec.  It isn't for everyone.  "
good,"A typical day at work: A productive day in the morning  lots of overtime and troubleshooting."
good,This company looks out for its employees. You are able to learn new things daily and new ways to install cable quicker to get more jobs to get more pay
good,"This company is large and tends to operate in low-end telecom, which means the types of individuals you typically support are technicians installing piece-rate equipment at a low hourly clip. "
good,"started at 8am and ended around 8am"
good,Very good company to work for. Good Benefits and a very good work environment.  Large company with plenty of potential to grow
good,This company was well organized and took care of its employees.  There are a lot of talented technicians and you most often had the proper tools and materials for the job.
good,"Assist win inbound technician calls, chats, emails, customer assistance. Watch service metrics, take escalations, complete daily reports."
good,all the co-worker helped like a family . the bosses were nice an helpful.
good,A normal day for me with Mastec started @ 6:00am and ended when the last technician went home sometimes @ 10pm i was on a 6 and 1 work week because of the lack of technician we had in house i learned alot as far as the mangement part of the company and how it oporates i enjoy meeting alot of new and current customers i am a people person i rather deal with the customer on a one on one then rather over the phone  i believe the hardest part of the job is to try to accodomate all the customers in a timely fashion on a day to day because of the lack of technician we had my co-workers look up to me not only because i had the experience in the filed but i was fair all around
good,good company good pay travel alot fun place to work just looking for something else in my career
good,arrive early to work for route and equip. pickup; team meeting and regular training/feed back from field inspections. team leads and supervisors were dependable to where you could count on them meeting you in the field for high profile commercial installs or for assistance siting in a dish location on over grown treed in properties. co-workers would flex to lend a hand and even pickup work when anyone encountered a delay. the hardest part i found was the size area we covered. approx. 150 sq. mi. what was a good feeling was continual gratitude from the customers we serviced
good,"My overall review for Mastec is a good one, my time with Mastec was very knowledgeable and I increased in my knowledge of the trade."
good,Direct tv Installations delivery and also made deliveries for Best Buy Amazon and other companies. Room for advancement. Raliegh Area Hiring is a great process.
good,"Main focus for the typical work day would be to make sure customers would be informed of when their appointments for their installs would take place. It is an installation company that focuses on scheduling appointments for their service providers. Hardest part of the job would be learning the platforms we would be provided with to schedule these appointments. Management is great, no issues there. They are always willing and open to assist with any questions you may have regarding certain situations. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the work environment. Everyone knows what we do and they treat everyone like family. I enjoyed my time there, that's for sure."
good,Good environment. Work at your own pace. Company provided vehicle. Discount on Directv services. 5 day work week. Biweekly pay schedule. Room for advancement.
good,"Mastec takes care of you. Not just the company, but the employees, too. Sure, we have a lot of drive time. Sometimes it takes a while to get a job done, but the supervisors ensure that you’re making money. As long as you put forth an effort you will get far in this company."
good,DirecTV is a great place to work .working 6 days and only have one day off. I like to stay very busy going through my first divorce directv was my greatest job . The benefits are nice and after one year of working there you receive complimentary services packages as a technician.
good,"Very good sense you work on your own paste."
good,"You have a set number of jobs that need completing within a reasonable time frame, it was your responsibility to manage your time and complete your work."
good,Every week they change the installation process with the same amount of pay.  We are piecework is not good at all. now we do the service calls and the sub contractor do the new installs and upgrades.
good,"I like the company's policy and the work attributes. It could be with a long days jobs, if want to make more money, you need to work fast. Indeed fast working brings the quality down, which I don't like some technicians do this. there are not enough field technician supervisors available to help you out when you need their assistance, good money is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Work orders are provided one at a time.  You complete one job and the next job is dispatched to the technician.  Depending on the length of time that it takes to complete jobs depends on the number of jobs dispatched throughout any given day.  It is policy to be on-site at first customer of the day's residence or commercial property by 8:00 am.  Pay is piece-work rate:  pay is dependent on how many work orders closed and the type of work being performed.  I have learned how to effectively communicate with customers on how to operate DirecTV equipment and services.  My immediate supervisor is extremely professional and will not hesitate to offer advise based on experience.  If you come to work and perform with expected results, there will be no issues with management and will even receive praise.  The most challenging part of the job is crawling on hands and knees and even flat on your belly through crawl spaces where sewer and water pipes are located.  There are often electrical wires throughout the crawl spaces that could result in tragedy if not using caution while moving about these areas.  Weather is yet another challenge.  We work in the cold, in the rain, while wind is gusting, and extreme heat.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the excitement that customers express via face expressions when the customer is being educated on the equipment and TV service.  Some of these customers have been without advanced TV services for a long time and being able to finally have these services is a joy to them and his/her family."
good,wonderful place to be when you want to learn technology. My own personal favorite things are the great people skills this job can teach you.There is nothing that you cant do with this company if you pay attention and put your mind to it.
good,"Training is perfect with good training instructor and training Aids such as books and actual / Mock house Strand , Pole Ladder safety is a serious business with Mastec, My supervisor is not that effective with me.lack of experience with cable and broadband"
good,I really like this company. Im just looking for a change of scenery. I would highly recommend this company to any employee that is seeking employment.
good,"This was a fun job that requires the ability to clearly think things through and have a great work ethic. I learned multiple things such as how to better communicate with customers, how to fully think through a problem, and it helped me overcome fears and build my character. Even though a majority of my work was completed on site by just myself, while at the shop other technicians would help me out by giving me advice and telling me stories of their different experiences. The hardest part of the job was overcoming my fear of heights, It didnt take long before it became the normal and It was something I did with no problems. Overall it was a fun job that helped make me a better person."
good,I learn a lot started from my co-worker and my supervisor because every time we sharing ideas how to build a great team and make the team best of the best through out the company  and I started working harder to help the team reach what we sharing every time and make our goals come true. the management team always cone to congratulate our team because of our efforts as a new team since we started to believe in our team be confident and enjoyable in the company to provide the best service that the company needed to growth with all the employees and management team. I enjoyed being part of a team want to perform great job and great services to help the team growth and help us to build a great relationship as well.
good,Overall enjoyable work environment that keeps me challenged each day to be the best I can. I look forward to being at work each day and working with the people I do.
good,"I was privileged to work with this company for nearly 3 years and was promoted several times. "
good,"That says alot a typical day at work, I learned alot like being a rockstar on the tower yet working safetly and looking out for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was climbing to get to the work area. One thing enjoyable about this job was all the different places we did visit and people i met."
good,"I am knowledgeable about this job.  I am a fast worker, and able to work on more than one task at a time.  I am well organize and neat.  I am flexible, and work any shift, and also able to work under pressure.  I am an honest person.  I am okay to work in team.  I am very creative and progressive.  I have learned about job safty, the rules regulator.  Also I have learned how to use the power tools."
good,"Waking up at 5 is never enjoyable for any job however, not having to be around your supervisors at the office is worth the early rise. Not that the supervisors are bad guys, they're actually cool, but they're still your boss. Leaving from home and going directly to the customers home is good. My trainor, like the rest of the employees, are all wise guys but mean no harm. My trainor taught me alot about the job and the company. I really learned alot from him"
good,Estabilidad laboral salarios podrían ser más justos
good,"Ups and downs but okay. Driving a lot.. long hours sometimes no work. Manager was cool. Good pay.. relaxed. Gave me a Van, phone? Gas card, tablet, and tools."
good,Good place to work. Great environment. Lots of teamwork. Company van and gas card. You could work with no supervision. You get to talk to customers and see beautiful homes.
good,"Where I was positioned, I was in Midland, Tx. However, this post covered the entire Permian Basin area. This included SE New Mexico, up to Eunice; and as far down as Presidio, near the U.S/Mexico border."
good,I learned a lot about dispatching here. The management was always willing to help. There was always room for advancement. They hired within the company.
good,"I love how they trust personal skills, dedication and integrity of each individual. They will set an one on one hands on training for better comprehension of the job requirements."
good,"Typical work day was safety meeting every morning. Setting goals to reach each day. And house keeping at end of day."
good,You never knew when you were going to get off but the pay really is competitive. It can be difficult to balance work and home life because all too often work is expected to be taken home with you. Besides that management really does care about your development and improvement in the company
good,Good team work.The managements its good. Its an organize company .Its a peace work job unstable salary. Stressful . High workload and to much pressure some times to comply with the company metrics.
good,"Easy to talk to management team"
good,"We worked too much but the pay was worth it, management and definatly be way better and i got to travel alot which was nice. my co workers were easy to work with and we would have our bets if we could do a certain thing or not. working in the weather was the hardest, it didnt matter if it was -20 or 120 outside, we had to do it and sometimes we actually had to call it a day early because the machines would ever heat or not start at all"
good,"meeting in the morning about news and trends"
good,Hardest part about this job is the year round outside conditions ... job construction went up in a professional and timely matter while unmanned for going on 2 and a half years
good,"Impressing Customers with product outcome"
good,"It is easy to make lots of money by picking up extra work!  You will drive to customers' homes to service, upgrade and install DirecTV satellite systems.

good,"Installed home alarms and repaired.  "
good,"Don't have any accidents, are you're gone. Even if someone hits your vehicle and your not in it. "
good,"I am happy to have worked at Mastec, because it was my first experience learning about the construction buisness."
good,The hardest part of the job was being away from your family months at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and seeing different parts of the United States.
good,"The problems and challenges at work were demanding. Typically, work hours were long and work there if you can work a lot of overtime. My bosses were fair and enjoyed their employment and the opportunity to develop my technical skill set."
good,This company is great. From the benefits to the environment. It’s off commission so you work at your own pace. But that won’t stop you from doing more jobs. I was making about $2000 a week.
good,"A day would consist of starting out early maybe 6, getting anything we need from the shop an head to our first customer's house. Once there i had to have good knowledge of the equipment I had to install an be able to explain how everything operated before i left. It was always one on one. The freedom of being on the road and seeing new places was a great plus. My supervisor was great and is willing to hire me back if i take that route."

good,"I was in the Direct 2 You department. Everyone was super friendly, and the work environment was great. Pay was more than fair, and they had great commission. We delivered cell phones that where ordered by sprint customers. we delivered to homes, coffee shops. any location the customer desired. the job itself was super easy. you needed to be extremely flexible to work for Direct to You.  on the downfall there was not much job security at all. work would slow down drastically from one day to the next and hours would be cut. you didn't know if you would have a job for the next month, or the next 6."
good,This is a company for digital alarm system the work is based on residential areas only the people was great but has bad management they hired to many technician for the amount of work they had and laid off 30% of there technician.although the technicians there always made a healthy environment to work with
good,"I enjoyed the challenge of meeting new people and fitting our product with their needs. I learned that no house was the same which was fine by me because being a problem solver is one of my strong points. The only difficulty I had were things that were out of my control. Meaning signal issues or product system issues. The people I worked with were great and I still remain in contact with them. Management was always there if you were in need, for encouragement, or just general conversation. Overall it was a great place to work."
good,I found working for this company to be fun and interesting. it was fast paced and the duties i performed were outside of the business office.
good,"A good company, but a high turnover. Due to the nature of the industry it's very physically demanding so in turn, hard to keep technician. At times when there is a low employee count, it causes everyone else to take on more responsibilities. This in turn causes a poor work/home life balance."

good,"Working for this company really was a big break for me , they take the time out to train every employee so they set us up for success , the benefits are great"
good,"Essentially, you will be working hard rain or sun. You will be also required to associate with customers on a per job basis. You will have to wake up early every day and in some cases, get home really late. Beware the SIN30! They're a big NO in managements eyes. My fellow technicians were nice. There were a few guys(and gals) I didn't care for. But everyone is nice enough. They all just want to get home as soon as possible. That being said, if you drag your feet, then it keeps everyone out longer. So if you can't build up a decent pace, then this job may not be for you."
good,Employment opportunity was good fit with advancement and home life affected positively. Very happy with opportunity and continue to reflect about the duties and tasks as an employee. I will keep the skills and professional experience with me forever.

Management is great to work for, and the co-workers, the hardest part about the job would be the weather. But if the weather is no big deal then you will be fine. And the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a different environment everyday."

I learned many thing from this job, such as great customer service. handling angered and frustrated customers. the hardest part of this job I would say was the beginning the learning curve . how the actual system works, however once I got a hang of it.  it became pretty fun and enjoyable to work for the company."
good,"A typical day with Mastec begins with being on the right-of-way before 7:00 a.m. and leaving around 5:00 a.m. Many of the employees and management interact in more of a family style manner. The management to does not constantly pressure the employees but they still ensure that the job is completed properly, safely, and in the time specified. Although it is a smaller company, there is room for growth because no one is looking over their shoulder.  This company also offers benefits for their employees."
good,"This is by far a good company to work for, but, like all ""at will"" companies there is no loyalty for dedicated loyal employees which is the way the work world is going."

The culture there is unique as we are in a melting pot city with many different backgrounds but we always work as a team and help each other out.  The toughest part of my job would be the crawling into crawl spaces and attics during the summer time when the temperatures are high and the s[paces are confined.

The other Technicians as well as management will reinforce you and do what ever they can to help you. The most Enjoyable part of this job would have been working with the customers.
