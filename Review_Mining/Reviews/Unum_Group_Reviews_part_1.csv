rating,review
bad,I was in the second week into training and could not believe the amount of stuff like I seriously can’t even put into words how bad they trick you into this job thinking you will only have to do STD and LTD but then you will quickly realize it’s a lot more and nothing that you can retain!! Be warned I had high hopes for this job with it being remote but they truly set you up to fail and you just learn more lies as the training process goes along don’t bother
bad,Harsh management.  Numbers and quotes are a big deal. Unfriendly and disorganized. Constant meetings and monitoring. Cannot do enough to please management.
bad,Not a company for POC. Had to go on STD and was harassed right out after my return. If you choose to work here make sure your 100% healthy otherwise they will find a way to toss you out like yesterday's old garbage.
bad,Unum is currently being managed by a bunch of Bozos who first let go 25% OF THE IT staff. Then they decided to open an office in Atlanta. It's a sweat shop. If you are older than 50.  They will fire you.
bad,Unstructured but good for whoever likes that kind of management and operations style. I personally did't have fun working with the teams. Too many restrictions.
bad,"Workplace culture is like high school in a bad way. Worst part of the job is having to decline claimants claim.  There is nothing enjoyable about the Glendale office. Management is not helpful, most of the managers been with the company for 10-20 and are afraid of change.  Do not suggest a better way of doing a task, management will look down on you.  Managers do not keep up with the rules and regulation therefore they are not helpful when new trainees start . Managment is only worried about the number of claims you process. They do not care about the claimant at all. Also management thinks that every claimant is not telling the truth  about their claim.  Do your research on Unum.   I'm looking to leave ASAP.  I have been here long enough.  Also everyone is related to each other, either they are husband and wife, brothers, best friends. So beware aware of who you vent to because they probably best friend with the VP or husband or wife a manager."
bad,"Very money focused , if you don't give results your driven out."
bad,"They find ways of getting rid of employees with disabilities without getting sued. They are also very clickish and if you can't dress like you are rich, you are ostracized. They give lip service to diversity but their actions don't agree."
bad,"management was okay, at its best. if you aren't willing to be someone's office pet, this job is not for you. I was there 4 years before leaving and coming back almost a year later, and was not offered full time."
bad,"The lack of ability to perform this job from home is a big drawback, especially when compared to competitors in the industry. It deprives UNUM of many talented employees."
bad,"This was not the job they tried to sell me on. The pay and promotional opportunities are lackluster.  It can be extremely stressful. There has been significant turnover in the past couple years because there is no place to grow, the work/life balance is poor (if you try to take a vacation expect to work 60 hours the week before and the week after), and you are unable to speak your mind.  Independent thought is not encouraged.  Watch your back. You are not valued.  They have promoted unqualified taskmasters to management so it has become downright abusive. Only apply if you are 20 something looking for a stepping stone.  This is not a mid career workplace."
bad,"Unum is a wonderful place to work. I wanted to represent 5 stars for each of the above but it would not allow me to click on all 5. "
bad,The Position of Disability Benefit Specialist should be an hourly position but it is not. We are underpaid and overworked. Stress to the point of getting sick. We not only have to do the claims work but we take all the calls like a call center. They demand that you finish all your work in order to be allowed to take a day off.
bad,"They have really high expectations and do not provide good guidance at all. If you are unable to do a job without policies and procedures, do not apply."
bad,"If you don't have a relative who works here or your not Italian leave it alone!  The CEO who is that?"
bad,Working at Unum is a complete and total agonizing daily life experience! A real life nightmare🤮The harder & longer that you work each day = the less you get paid for you time and efforts! .. 1 flat rate of  pay which  Unum say is for a 40 hour work week.. my but hole! it's always 50 or 60 or more hours a week.. you are constantly feeling the pressure of being fired if you don't complete daily goals!🤮
bad,Mislead about job duties in interview. Not treated like a human. Its all about metrics. Nothing but a negative experience here. Training was poor. 9 hour day on monday and mandatory OT not discussed in interview. Actively seeking another job. Working at unum will make you wished you worked at mc donald' s.  I HATE THIS JOB AND COMPANY!!!
bad,"From the job posting to the job description to the internal policies to the talk at water cooler, VERY MISLEADING AND INCONSISTENT. The culture is miserable, the job is monotonous, the managers do very little."
bad,"Unum training was excellent but nothing like the job that you are hired.  Your work schedule terrible and vacation time, why give if you can't use.  Contact Center treated differently awful job!!!!  You are trained to lie to customers and they treat their customers like a production line.  You are trained to be polite and lie."
bad,"Management is promoted based on fake positivity not on experience, knowledge or ability which creates a terrible environment for any employee with potential which is reflected in the organizations horrific retention rate. Directors are too passive aggressive to address the poor management issues partially because they are the ones who promoted the managers and need to cover it up so they don’t look bad. If you get a job here only give 50% and smile, it’s the quickest way to get promoted and the more management knows you are capable of the more they will give you busy work (higher caseloads-to make their numbers look good and create 12 hour work days for you, not work that will help you grow professionally) for the same pay and an empty promise that it’s helping your development, if you bring it anyone’s attention you will be punished for it.  If you have any type of motivation or career goals this is not a good job for you."
bad,"Unum has moved from a customer focused, employee investing organization to a much greedier version of itself, causing invaluable employees to leave and find work elsewhere.  I fear this is to Unum's detriment.  The company has always looked at both, and worked to balance the longer term plans with the current quarter and year.  Unfortunately, that has no longer been the case for the last 5 years.  The company culture no longer rewards longer term, strategic planning and effort.  Bonuses are paid for the short term, so what is the incentive for anyone with morals to focus on the long term?   I do hope an in-depth evaluation may be done to redefine a way forward and a corporate culture that invests for now, but also in the future.  Managing everything with a quarter over quarter or year over year mentality, and average department re-organizations occurring every 1.5 years, what do you think the primary focus might be?"
bad,A company that causes a lot of stress in the work environment. The company promotes work/life balance but it never occurs due to the work load and forced hours.
bad,"I found a very poor post training environment."
bad,"Work hard, do well, and receive only negative feedback. Terrible place to work now. No room for growth, so mgmnt does what they can to keep you down and justify lack of raises.  Very little transferable skills, so those who have been there for years are stuck."
bad,I worked at Unum for 2 years. I was not happy there due to the unrealistic expectations placed on the employees from management. the management team as a whole lacked compassion or understanding with the employees. The focus on unrealistic expectations created an unhappy workplace. My co-workers were great - I made lasting friendships and there was a teamwork atmosphere among the other leave specialists. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work and help employees during some of the most difficult times in their lives.
bad,"I forced myself to take the job as a contract-to-hire because I was told it was the only way to get my foot in the door to a more reputable company in town.  Managers, no matter their age, act like catty high school girls looking to take someone down that they perceive as a threat due to their intelligence."
bad,There is absolutely NO growth within this company. You have to be employed for 6 plus years before you would be able to reach another level inside the building. The starting pay was 15/hr that wasn’t bad for the job so that wasn’t an issue but there are NO raises given. Also the ladies they have in supervision DON’T have back bones and don’t know anything about the job. I worked there for only 3 months before I was let go! I was told I was going to be compensated for vacation sick hours and other hours. My check was only $7. And I know for sure It was supposed to be more than $7. But I didn’t press the issue of making it a big deal. When you get on the phones the ladies the sit you around are no help and everyone is out for thei selves. Training was a joke. The overall company is a joke. Don’t waste your tome.
bad,"If you're heading into a job at the Contact Center, know that's you're completely expendable. They literally throw walls of meat at their problems. You might be a great EE, but they're not waiting around long enough to find out. Your support will be laughable and you'll be judged off of internet games and absences. Good luck!"
bad,Unum started about being a great company to work for many years ago.  It was very family friendly with a good work life balance.  But as of the last 5-7 years the dynamics have changed to that of a company extremely focused on profits.  Management is no longer invested in the well being of the employees and tend to overlook tenured employees for younger employees with no experience.
bad,"Work life balance is absent. Focus on production, not empathy. Amazing health/employee benefits, however these come at a hefty price. Expectations are unreasonable, poor management."
bad,"This company treats you like a machine/property. All they care about is money and do not care how unhappy their employees are. Unum used to have a great reputation but that is changing. I was warned by past employees that I wasn't going to like working here. There is no work life balance, they expect your job to be your life. If you want to get ahead, you have to come early and stay late and get involved in all these dumb committees they have to make employees feel better. They could just treat us like human beings and show us that we're valued, instead they make us take time out of our own lives to be involved in some committee that's supposed to make us *feel* valued."
bad,"If you are a fast working, good at using an activity tracker, and your manager likes you, you will be fine. "
bad,I worked for Provident which was a great company and merged with Unum which is a terrible company.  AVP and above are absolutely non trustworthy. Directors are just pawns. They are concerned about numbers and playing with audit scores to make their department look good.  They do not care how many hours you work.  40 is never enough!  Very stressful environment. Don't work here!
bad,As long as you work in any other dept. other than medical records you will be very happy.
bad,"Over worked & Under paid. Toxic & Negative Environment. Lack of trust with Management. Unum cares about how they look to the public, but when push comes to shove they do not do anything to increase morale or keep good hard working individuals. Employees are leaving the company weekly and Management jokes about why so many people are leaving rather than trying to resolve the issue. There is no room for growth. Raises?.... Forget about that. Very disappointed with where this company is heading. Please do not consider working here. I am speaking from the heart and would never want anyone to be treated the way Unum employees are treated."
bad,Departments do not collaborate well with each other.  Too hard to advance to other areas despite being qualified.  Did give plenty of opportunities for work outside of Unum in the community with Volunteer opportunities.
bad,"First job outside of college.  Management is very detached from employees who manage claims.  Having a heightened level of empowerment is great, but this structure created an environment where advancement was largely prohibitive."
bad,Very poor management skills no opportunity for growth very political and all they care about was snacks on Friday. The raises were pathetic. Unprofessional mangers that are still there to this date. Alot of people are there because it's steady paycheck. The only pro is their benefits plan. Everyone who works there has been there for 10 plus years.  The only reason they have stayed is because they don't want to lose the seniority.
bad,"I have developed fears and anxieties I never had before while working here! Speaking with people who are calling due to hard life events (e.g. I was diagnosed with cancer today) is stressful. The expected AHT (Average Handle Time) is 11 Minutes. One of the most annoying aspects of the job is audits, there is no consistency within the department, you will have points deducted for Benign things. Be ready for calls to be back to back."
bad,Health insurance was awesome but management was unpredictable. My first manager was AWESOME. The second one we got was in a training program and had little experience in dealing with people.
bad,Working for this company is stressful but there is opportunities for advancement.
bad,They do not offer assistance very well when you are having issues with your director. Human Resources is not for the employee.  They do have great benefits.
bad,Unum used to treat their employees very well until they got some new executives and decided not only to start outsourcing jobs but to trick people into rebadging and losing their severance pay.
bad,"Very corporate environment, you have to play the game if you want to advance at all. Lots of two-faced managers. can't be direct or they view that as being ""too aggressive"""
bad,Not organized and not very kind to employees.  Tough to work for always looking for ways to cut employees out!  I would not work for these people again.
bad,"The company is difficult to work for, with very little job advancement, and no overtime options event if amount of work is high, but the people I met are wonderful."
bad,The job is stressful due to poorly constructed and outdated systems. They crash daily. You literally work hard not smart! It’s literally a sweatshop how you have to work. You really have to triple check to make sure you’re giving the correct information bc all the system don’t always have the same/correct information. Management keeps saying we’re working on it and no results. Favoritisms is REAL. It’s a place to get insurance experience an move on PERIOD!!! No advancement opportunities bc they are so understaffed and keep adding new clientele.
bad,"The department I worked in was full of managers and directors who gossipped and only rewarded those who kissed up. We were forced to volunteer weekends, attend events, and donate money with the threat of reduced hours and refusal to be considered for advancement. Actual work was ignored, quality was  not enforced, laws were worked around with the cooperation of the corporate lawters. "
bad,"It's not a bad place to work, if you are the complacent type that isn't interested in career advancement. I've invested several years, thus far, and have yet to truly feel valued. I acknowledge the stable income the job yields, but it is just a job, unfortunately, nothing more and nothing less. Most all employees are intelligent, start off eager, are hard working and motivated. But, the annual raises are about 1-2% and the annual potential bonus is not amazing either. Managers don't really focus on your development. This is sad. It'd be a much better place if managenent was SIGNIFICANTLY more invested in the professional growth of employees. As that is far from the case, I can say that working here will bring disappointment for anyone who wants to develop any good transferable skills. That being said, enter at your own risk."
bad,"My typical day at Unum within their Contact Center included being yelled at not only by customers, but constantly being under a microscope by not one manager, but five. "
bad,Outsourced hundreds of jobs to overseas. Worked in and out of the company for many years and they have continued to move away from the people and more towards the dollars. They now outsource jobs overseas and the remaining people that still work for the company have no or little home/work life balance
bad,"I see reviews that seem to indicate a positive atmosphere, but at least in Maine, business surveys indicate something very different.  UNUM has steadily fallen from being number one or two best places to work in Maine, to ninth place. I spoke to UNUM’s HR about this steady drop and they acknowledged that UNUM drops one or two places every year on this survey. They acknowledged that UNUM is not the most desirable place to work, as it once was. As with many large companies, UNUM too keeps pushing its employees to work more with little or no salary increase. UNUM expects many of its employees to work 50 or more hours a week and often ask employees to “volunteer” to work on Saturdays, especially in the service areas.  A lot of pressure is placed on the employees to put in these hours, or your review will be severely impacted. I know this pressure is not unheard of at large companies, and UNUM is a big player with this pressure and saying they value work place balance, but, in my opinion, they do not practice it."
bad,"The company is more concerned with how they are perceived by the public. The preach about inclusion, work/life balance, etc but it's just for show. If you have young kids, forget about it. If you have to call out from time to time to care for them, you'll be punished... they'll give you a schedule that makes it even harder to care for your children. The only way to advance is to be a brown noser. You are just a set of metrics to them. Upper management doesn't care about you or your situation... they just want you to provide ""the best customer experience"", BUT you have to do it within 10-12 minutes....smh.dont work here."
bad,"I supported a female SVP who had a bad reputation of treating her horrible. In the beginning things were great. After a few years things changed, she changed. She became bitter against the company and took it out on me."
bad,Pay is way too low for the amount of work required- you are literally constantly working like a machine and are constantly required to put in overtime. Job is very repetitive and will most likely be automated/outsourced soon anyway.
bad,"Worked in management for an independent contractor assigned to run the security department within one of their corporate sites (one of their two main offices to be exact)."
bad,"Very pretty campus"
bad,if you like having poor work life balance and lower positions earning more than higher positions this is a good place. they love to micro manage you and do not extend trust to employees
bad,"Unum was the most unfreindliest place I have ever worked. I was there for over 10 years and can't even claim anyone there my friend. I had back issues and a lot of pain had to go out on disability. The day before going on disability my manager found a reason to write me up so that he could eliminate my job and get rid of me. "
bad,"Management has changed drastically.  Morale is horrible.  Poor decisions are the norm.  The term career path has been abandoned for ""career lattice"" because there is no opportunity for advancement.  Compensation increases are now reserved for the ""special few.""  "
bad,"I worked at Unum for almost 14 years as a Account Consultant/Client Manager.  The company was one of the best companies to work for until  a year and half ago when they moved to the growth strategy model.   I was working 65+ hours per week and the amount of pressure from managers was too much.  They treat you like 2nd graders by yelling and belittling you in front of co-workers.  When the new model rolled out in 2013, they cut our pay and based it on part base salary and commissions for a customer service position.  Even when meeting your goals it still was not good enough. "
bad,"Responsible for processing disability claims, during an 8 hour day, sometimes required to work more than 8 hours. I learned to provide customer service in a timely manner. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job, recently, was working under a specific member of management, who was not adaptable to my position as a claims processor. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I got in providing great customer service to claimants. I enjoyed helping people be able to financially provide for themselves, during a period of time when they were unable to work, due to illness."
bad,They are laying off large numbers of people.  Most of the experienced and long time employees are being removed.  The company is focusing on the younger generation and discarding the experienced.
bad,"Upper management refuses to listen to associates that actually do the work and and forces the ""my way or the highway"" philosophy 100% of the time."
bad,"UNUM was a temporary job for me I was also bartending at the time, "
bad,"Manager is incredibly helpful and considerate. She makes you feel part of a team and does what she can to keep morale up. Rest of the company however has shifted from caring about quality work to forcing as much work as possible onto their employees. "
bad,There is no plan in place for active shooter situations. This is troubling to me. It is very difficult to maintain a good work-life balance while working at Unum.
bad,"I have worked at Unum for a long time.  Things have changed tremendously since I was first employed.  I have learned many skills while working at Unum, including how not to treat employees.  My co-workers are a joy to work with and I would say that they are the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Unum went through a CIO change about 5 years ago.  With the new CIO came a stressful and unfair culture.  She was replaced early in 2018.  The new leadership is trying to right the ship, but at this point, it is still a stressful place to work due to all of the change happening within the company."
bad,The workload is too high which makes for stressful days and makes it difficult to participate in things that would help you to move up in the company.
bad,"I was hired via a temporary staffing agency and offered a part-time position to handle the most tedious and time-consuming tasks for a Finance Specialist. For 4 hours a day, I would enter data from checks sent by disability recipients who had received over payments or data from checks of life insurance subscribers. Both my managers were very nice. The Upper Management  only cares about the money and would not let my manager group 4 part-time employees into 2 full-time employees, so that they did not have to pay health benefits, except of course to benefit one of my manager's favorites later on."
bad,"At today’s Unum, unless you come in to Unum as one of their “Unum Scholar” college interns, your chances of career advancement are slim to none. Countless of older Millenials and younger Gen-X employees have been stuck in that once promising entry/slightly above entry level job for 5-10 years. Their HR strategy is blatantly superficial and elitist. Management lacks basic understanding of mathematical concepts yet they will use the numbers and data to form seriously flawed conclusions on both the business and your performance. (And seriously, some didn’t even know differences between basic statistical concepts including mean and mode) Although they are accepting of a diverse employee background, if you are looking for a place for development and growth in your career, you will likely be dissapointed. I would highly recommend an exit strategy if you haven’t moved up at least two job levels by the end of four years. By that time you will have seen whether or not you were chosen for fast-track advancement. If you weren’t, get out before the Stockholm Syndrome becomes too ingrained."
bad,"The company offers great benefits, competitive pay, and awesome leadership. However, the standards are extremely high and hard to obtain. You are expected to revolve your life around the company and your career as well."
bad,"Initially when I worked with Unum they were actually a decent employer. Good benefits, competitive pay, annual increases, decent bonus and the job was sustainable within a full-time work week. Everyone was decently happy to be working for the Company. "
bad,"I held a few jobs at this company and was absolutely miserable during one of them, but one of the others is one of the best jobs I've held.  Unfortunately, the people who made the experience so enjoyable were all made redundant..."
bad,An old insurance company that is struggling to evolve and become more efficient.  A lot of job duplication.  A lot of old systems that don't work together and a lot of managers who manage to the plan and don't take a risk to improve things and make it a more modern company.
bad,"Insurance Sales at Unum. "
bad,I have nothing to say about this employer other than they had good benefits.
bad,"Unum wants to get all the young kids out of college into the company and phase out the long term employees and will come up with any excuse to do so. Extreme micromanaging, unfairness, you are looked at as a number. All that is cared about is numbers. To succeed you need to be a favorite, don't take 3 minutes outside of your break or you will be spoken too and be careful what you say and who you say it too as they will terminate you on a whim as many of my coworkers were."
bad,"I worked for them many years ago, the expose on 60 Minutes regarding unfair claim closures occurred after I was there. I think it made UNUM and companies like it, think  twice about giving closure goals. Although this still goes on, and there is a mean streak to some areas of the business, the justification must be supported to cut someone off from benefits"
bad,"In a nut shell I really enjoyed working with the nurses, doctors, and a majority of the Disability Benefit Specialists. My follow VRCs were amazing and I loved doing returned to work with claimants when allowed. The CA location does not have the perks of the East Coast locations, like a gym or healthy work/life balance or decent HR people."
bad,"Metrics and audits are everything to the point of inducing stress. You feel more of a number than a person. Hard work doesn’t matter if your metrics aren’t over 94. People and culture is great, as well as benefits. Advancement is possible if all your metrics are outstanding, and low absences. Training could have been longer and more informative before taking live calls. PTO and benefits are the best. Mandatory overtime after every major holiday. Good work life balance. Fast paced and if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to use your breaks. Extremely micromanaged. Back to back calls all day with no time to breathe. Co workers and managers are friendly and supportive. Work from home option available after 3 months. My advice is stay away from call center and get a positin in a different department where you are less micromanaged."
good,Not a lot of opportunity to progress in career. Restrictive management and culture. Low salary although benefits were good. Good canteen. Flexible working hours as a possitive
good,"Slow progression opportunities, management are unapproachable and snobby, pay is poor. "
good,"Unum can be a good place to work.  However after 26 years of employment, my job along with 61 others was eliminated.  There was no job security even with the number of years worked."
good,"Unum once was a remarkable company to work for but they have changed directions and are looking for a younger work force that can be groomed for management.  The problem is not everyone wants to be in management.  I was to retire and was forced to leave early.  Management on the middle level is all over the place, they change according to the most recent directive of the Senior players.  No clear direction that is consistent."
good,"They sell you such a fake dream in training. Once you're done and on the floor you are require to a level II (MUCH DIFFICULT). Menors/Seniros are awful at giving assistance when needed.Auditors doc you for EVERYTHING, you only get 4 audits a math which make your chance of achieving harder .Manager lies and sells you a false dream/hope but working against and behind you. Stressful , high volume, no offline time, Consultants aggy and very picky. VERY HIGH TURNOVER"
good,I am very unhappy with Unum at the moment.  I worked for 17 years and I was terminated.
good,"This company has some of the best benefits packages money can but, however that is not always enough when it comes to culture. The company culture of Unum is their weakest link unfortunately."
good,"High-paced stressful environment where managers sometimes are looking to get more out of you than they are looking to advance you and your career. There isn't equal balance when it comes to workloads  and management can either be fantastic or horrible. Extremely strict Quality standards and practices that make for a very stressful working environment. Stress levels vary depending upon your role - in Worcester branch stress is highest towards the end of the year. Ability to work from home sometimes in some roles depending on what type of data you work with...whether or not a person can do so really depends mainly on their individual manager. Diversity a priority. The best part of the job is the great benefits, the great hard-working people, and the managers that are good and looking to help employees develop."
good,"Unum provides good benefits to its employee's. The pay is good, the insurance is adequate.However, job security is seemingly always in question which creates a stressful environment creating moral problems."
good,The Company itself is great.  The managers and upper management they bring is the worse of the worse.  They are lazy.  They will throw you under the bus if needed.  Only care about themselves and how they appear.  Customers are not first they are next to last with Employees being the last.
good,Interesting place to work with a wide variety of management styles and personality types present and running departments.  It's fine place to work for many people.
good,"That it was time for a job change,  I worked there for 17 years, I was looking for a new type of employment.  I did not like the way the new management team was handling the department and decided it was time for a change. "
good,Work long hours without compensation and without assistance from management. Friendly and professional environment.
good,Flexible schedule and work mostly independent but job had deadlines and no management support. Very long hours and as a salaried employee was not entitled to overtime.
good,"Unum is in a constant state of change, and been since I joined the company in 2015.  The legacy systems are clunky and require more time and effort to work with, for employees and customers.  At one time, they were the thought leader in the disability market.  Many competitors have caught up, and the management has been slow to react.  "
good,"Rapid change executed by leadership that seems to lack the skills to understand the technical challenges and knowledge gaps that are created by an aggressive strategy to off-shore as much of the teams as possible (in some cases 100%) in as short of a time frame as possible.  The culture of IT seems to think they can cost cut their way to prosperity without much consideration for the business acumen required to perform certain IT functions. Morale is the lowest I've ever seen in my career.  This is the kind of company you visit to gain varied experiences, but then move on to grow your long term relationship with another company that is more people focused."
good,"CIO is starting to make the changes that IT has needed for years. Structure, data, infrastructure, accountability. But, the culture being nurtured is cold and toxic. It’s riddled with fear to question. There’s total lack of diversity and inclusion and therefore opinions. Largely male, limited color, limited differences. You are either one of them or you aren’t. "
good,UNUM has provided numerous opportunities for me and has been a good employer until the last few years. The landscape of IT is changing and H1B visa workers are becoming more common onshore and offshore. I don’t see as much upward potential or job security for IT employees as UNUM has tapped into the resources of the large IT contractors.
good,I worked as an Under Writer for four years with low pay for the amount of work I did. Management was not open to new suggestions and everything you did was ultimately in their control. You would spend weeks on one case for them to requote at the request of a saleman who needed to make money. People who lost children would get denied small amounts of child claims because the company was greedy and couldn't make exceptions for a $5000 child life insurance claim due to a contract rule even though they had been paying premium for years. Technology was very outdated and there was a lot of bribing between salesman and management.
good,"The workload can get very high making work-life balance challenging, but on an average day, the claim count is about 5 claims per day. Everyone is friendly and professional."
good,I enjoyed having a job with purpose.  I felt like I was helping people with disabilities by getting their benefits to them as quickly as possible.  I tried to help take their financial worries away as they had enough to deal with besides losing their income.  Management is worried about getting their numbers and keeping a job.  Co workers were great in the area that I worked in.  The hardest part of the job is meeting metrics (their audit system) they made it harder and harder every year to reach your goals.  Your salary and bonus is based on metrics.  Very stressful environment to work in. I really enjoyed being around my co-workers.  I also enjoyed helping people return to work despite their disabilities.
good,"Other positions I have heard are very good at work-life balance. But Intake Specialist was extremely stressful. Expected to come in on weekends to help with overflow of claims. Could never use PTO or take a day off. In the times I was not well and had to call out, was asked why I was calling out and was aggressive and impersonal. Could not apply to new position within company until almost 2 years. For the volume of work as well as information expected to retain, pay did not match up."
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for, but they are going through a lot of changes.  There is the typical corporate politics and changes occur slowly"
good,It was a decent place to work. The benefits and pay were nice. You only get promoted if you know someone and brown nose alot. The work environment was not bad but overall its okay.
good,"Cliquey and not inspiring.  The only thing that kept me going were the fabulous people in the Toast Master's club I joined at Unum--that was a great outlet for which to grow and gain support, but management did not encourage it, I had to seek it out myself."
good,"I was able to learn to lead people, create visions, provide autonomy, mentor employees and manage multiple projects concurrently.  I loved my work and the people I worked with on a daily basis.  I set clear expectations to help employees grow and achieve their goals."
good,"I spent several years with this employer and was well compensated (up to a point) but hit an advancement wall due to my inability to work extra hours and ""drink the company Koolaid."" You can earn a decent living with minimal hassles in most of their core positions but if you are looking to advance or make a name for yourself be prepared to overcommit and grovel a bit."
good,"Good place to work for starters, and great benefits. However, not much transferrable skills, especially as the case load becomes heavier. Little to no management support, and might I add the unanimous sentiment felt across all cubicles---of unrealistic corporate expectations for employees. Nobody ever prepares you for all of the aspects you are responsible for as a DBS. Answer phones, deal with multiple policies, endure conversations with irate brokers, handle difficult calls with claimants, ensure that your scorecard is somewhat decent/within standards, while at the same time, keeping your absolute cool within the slim 8hrs a day that you have for your worklist. It's a great opportunity to work with nurses and conduct medical reviews; but also keep in mind the heavier challenges ahead."
good,This was a good place to work. Great cafeteria food. If you know what you are doing then there won't be a problem. It's a great place to work for people that are used to having their own space.
good,given an opportunity to start a working career. advanced fast. Stable work environment
good,"Unum is great for stability and to gain top knowledge about insurance processes and products.  However, consistently proving yourself as top performer, gaining specific responsibilities and team lead roles, and the go-to person for a team of 12+ with no compensation becomes discouraging and insulting.  ""Lean"" departments that hoard their best employees and block opportunities to apply internally- while adversely affecting their Work/Life balance-  results in my hesitation about recommending this employer."
good,The people at Unum at the best people to work with.
good,Quota Driven and minimum advancement. Their training environment consist of multiple trainers cross training each other and not very helpful. non productive.
good,"IT at Unum is fast paced, always changing things but rarely replacing or evolving legacy policy systems. When I started at Unum emphasis was on new methodologies and architecture. Today they are doing exactly the same thing. However little has evolved or been brought up to the new. Legacy footprint has expanded. Politics plays a major role in software development here.Currently it appears the IT employee workforce is migrating either offshore or to contractors."
good,"As the company struggles to modernize it's 150+ years of business, there is an appropriate urgency to modernize it's business processes. This can cause some stress in some and excitement in others."
good,"Work was good and so were a lot of the people. Even most of the managers were nice, but with the new executives that came into IT it has beocme much fore cut-through and no work-life balance."
good,"Goal oriented company, fast paced environment, room to grow and advance within the company, think outside the box, hiring young people, good place to grown insurance knowledge"
good,"I poured 4 years of my life into the Contact Center. Every 6 months to a year I would get past over for promotions and other positons to ridiculous reasons. Such as, ""you need more consistency"" or ""your rating was 93.5 percent and needs to be 94 percent""."
good,"Overall the company is okay to work for.  There are constantly new updates and changes every week with procedures/software.  And the company could use some work on consistency.  Turnover can be high, but the senior level staff or work at homes have stayed for years."
good,"As an internal consultant that works between IT and business I have had the opportunity to work in different areas at Unum to build a broad understanding of the workplace insurance business and associated processes. "
good,Change in policy and procedure  everytime management changes. Unum is a very customer derives focus company. After a few of training you will have the computer knowledge to assist the customer.
good,"Handling escalated issues, reviewing workflows for accuracy and efficiency, implementing new ways to utilize technology verses manual processing, and enhancing my leadership skills along the way."
good,"Unum is relatively easy to get into through the call center. From there, many opportunities are available. Career advancement with retirement benefits, paid schooling, a wide variety of positions are available."
good,"Long-time employees often talk about the ""good days"" of the past and say it's nothing like that today."
good,This job is a production role where you can create your own daily workflow. Managing your caseload and prioritizing sets the pace for the day. Generally you are reviewing files while using critical thinking and independent determination. You also have to be well versed in communication and customer service to execute the task at hand.
good,"Extreme pressure for production - extremely stressful, office building is nice and free parking is a perk. The subject matter was interesting however professional development can be politically charged."
good,"This company's culture was different prior to consolidating with 2 other insurance companies, thus making one big company. Cultures from the north, south, and mountains clashed. There was a lot of unsettling during these times."
good,Unum is a leader in the disability insurance industry and large company in several states.  They provide good benefits and competitive salaries which can offset the corporate political environment for a time.
good,"It may cost you a pound of flesh and part of your soul to work for them. Some of the projects and people are great, others not so much. I made it nearly 5 years and could bear the bad management no longer."
good,Fast-paced sales office in Atlanta.  People are helpful and very driven.  Management is somewhat old school in their management style.  Very conservative environment.
good,Many changing wheels for the process of change but not improvement.  Management needs more training.
good,"Unum gives you great pay and benefits. If you know the right people, you can advance through the company. If you're willing to sell your soul to them, you can advance through very long hours and a lot of stress.  Unum has a very Northern approach to business and cares more about the bottom line than service or employee relations. Unum has a miraculous way of making money in spite of itself. There is not a lot of job security.  Upper management always gets their million dollar bonuses and raises but not the employees who are out there on the front lines actually doing the work. Management, in most cases, is all about self preservation and not the best interest of the employees they manage and will keep a department staffed just enough to stay afloat in order to obtain their annual budget and keep their fat salaries.  Not a lot of work-life balance; just driveby there offices on a weekend and see how many cars are in the lots, meters and parking garage. That goes back to understaffing by management."
good,"Process, manage and determine FMLA eligibility.  Learned intense information regarding FMLA and/or state/corporate leaves.  Management is sub-par, as they tend to micromanage every thing you do.  There is no freedom to express your own critical way of thinking.  The company has done it that way for years, and they are not going to change."
good,"In my 8 years of service with this company I've been exposed to many opportunities, learned a great deal about myself and made many friends. However like all large companies they have good and bad managers. A re-organization can mean the difference between reporting to a wonderful boss one day and a not-so-wonderful boss the next. These kinds of uncertainties can lead to some job anxiety at times. My departments underwent no less then 12 reorganizations during my time with Unum-That is the most challenging part for me."
good,micromanaging managers coworkers that don't wash their hands after using the bathroom but the food is nice no consideration for work life balance or when it snows bad here in maine
good,"I love working for Unum. The level of support you have from your team and leadership really depends on the department you work in. While working at Unum, I've been in two departments. One I loved and was totally supported. The other is the reason I'm now looking for another job, either internally or externally."
good,"Dedicated over 10 years with this company only to be continuously passed over by recent college graduations with no actual industry experience. Overworked despite being salaried you're expected to meet ridiculous metrics requirements just to stand a chance at getting a minor merit increase and small bonus so if you want to excel you end up putting in 50+ hours per week regularly. Several young, white, males promoted with little to no experience over dedicated, experienced females."
good,"Leadership is not well connected to the people doing the work and does not communicate well. They do not take care of their people which results in overall low employee satisfaction scores. Middle management is lackluster and not responsive to feedback or being challenged. Overall work environment is meh. Open spaces are loud and there is no privacy. I love the job that I do in providing top quality and valuable features to customers and some of the teammates I work with, however the manager does not appreciate or value my role or my contributions, making it hard to feel happy overall."
good,"Management constantly changes, most have egos."
good,Working at UNUM was very stressful and not worth the lack of pay. I would not recommend UNUM to anyone just because of the stress. There were favorites that went far.
good,"I have not worked for UNUM in 2.5 years and don't feel as though I can give a fair and updated comment. However, when I did work at UNUM it was a good place to work."
good,"Good medical, dental, vision, life  insurance, cafe on site, training, awards for excellent work, ability to move up, open door policy, cross training,"
good,"Good PTO plan, great people working within the company. Great location in downtown Chattanooga. The IT department seems to be leaning more toward contractors and offshore resources."
good,I was a Contractor hired through a Security Service to monitor and patrol all buildings and grounds to ensure the safety of employees and visitors. Customer Service was a plus to ensure quality service for this company.
good,"Unum is a great job, deending on the department that you work in, it also depends on the manager that you have. Overall, I would like to work in my field and have 40 hours a week and not 20 hours in the off season of enrollment."
good,Claims handling involves having to manage large caseloads with weekly goals. Many work long hours to keep up with the assignments. Compensation could be better.
good,"i   got to work more of a rotational role: case facilitators, app processing unit and account management. As an intern, you do a lot of the busy work and getting to work with others helps."
good,Work environment was not the best.  Management did not take the time to listen to their employees. A lot of favoritism within the department. A place of gossip and not a lot of productive people.
good,"Many concurrent organizational changes simultaneously with large projects causing stressed employees and decrease in motivation and job satisfaction.  Lack of manager and leadership engagement providing a light at the end of the tunnel, and appreciation for the overtime.  Company seems to be challenged to embrace more work from home situations."
good,"At first, I enjoyed my job and manager. Then, they began adding more menial tasks to our jobs. This created low morale across the bored. When I left due to relocation, I found out that almost half of the department either quit or got fired. When I visited just 3 months later, you could feel the depression in the air and cut the stress with a knife."
good,"Absolutely love it here, but there's always going to be something or someone to ruin it for you and sometimes it's best to leave than to stay in a stressful situation."
good,Unum is a good place to work in Chattanooga TN and they provide good training. They are very involved in community service and allow employees to volunteer as part of this program. They donate millions of dollars per year to deserving not for profit organizations.
good,"When you work for a large corporation, everybody tends to get ""pigeon holed"" into a specific job. Unfortunately this doesn't allow individuals to acheive their goals."
good,Insurance company with large scope for development if based in Dorking HO. Undergoing a period of change which will present opportunities for the correct individual.
good,"While working for UNUM, I learned a lot of information about the Disability portion of insurance coverage.  The company was very customer focused.  The best part of the job was helping  a client filing for disability.  The worst part was losing one of the clients after a long illness or hospice stay."
good,"Overall, it is not a bad place to work. Management definitely needs some improvement in certain departments but everyone is friendly and willing to help you"
good,it was good at the beginning but at the end it was not. good benefits. hard to move up unless you know the right people. they make it seem like you can transition easily but it is not that simple. you must first put in 18 months as a call center representative before being promoted
good,"Unum will give you the resources needed to be a successful CSR."
good,This is a Fortune 500 company with strong roots - but privy to change. The benefits are great. Work/Life balance is a struggle in the sales job. Co-workers were absolutely wonderful. Also like the emphasis on community outreach.
good,Great company great people the compensation. Unfortunately the salary is not reflective of the skills and expertise of the staff.
good,Unum is an excellent place to work with excellent benefits.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to interact with clients and co-workers.
good,Department under constant review and changes by upper management.  Most difficult part of the job was being on the phone all day long.  Most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers.
good,"great benefits, and the coworkers and management were all very friendly. I would have like to have stayed longer, but it was only a temp job."
good,Unum is a good company to work for but the volatile state of Health and Disability insurance will be a challenge.
good,A well-run company with solid procedures and clear direction.
good,Worked my way up from Desktop Engineering and through other departments until I got into security.  Challenging environment but can be a good fit in its current configuration for many people.
good,Plenty of room for professional development and growth opportunities.
good,"quota, quota, quota. Complete corporate environment. The management is very capable and always looking to assist. co-workers always willing to help."
good,"The team and culture are great and supportive, but the home office is currently struggling to provide the necessary resources to support their sales/field offices."
good,"Back to back calls, going into your break to do things, and overall not really something you'd want to do as far as call center wise. I was let go, but was not clearly told why outside of how I handled a call that was per the policy. Helpful mentors, but they seem to be stressed about their job themselves. I have worked call center forever and this job was far the worst for call center."
good,"Working as a CSSI and CSSII was a total nightmare. I was bombarded by calls all day long. There was no time to breathe between calls. You get one minute to finish up documentation before you are expected to take the next call, which is guaranteed to be routed to you as soon as you are available. This is because call volumes are extremely high at Unum. It may be due to understaffing, it may be due to confusing website navigation. It could also be the frustration claimants deal with in trying to reach their assigned specialists. And the caller you speak with WILL be unhappy. They're injured/sick, feeling harassed by paperwork, their income was suddenly cut off, etc. "
good,"This is a professional, well-run company with opportunities for advancement. The company is well-known, has wonderful benefits, and is located in a great city."
good,Good job-balance and interesting benefits. Management should get more involved in the different branches and listen to employees' complaints. The CEO seems nice.
good,"Unum is a pretty flexible company that has served me well, as my first job out of college. I began as a contractor for 3 years. Since I got hired full-time, my role has changed a few times, giving me the opportunity to expand my skill set and improve my resume."
good,Work was challenging yet manageable.  Learned a great deal about individual and group disability insurance as well as working as a team with different personalities
good,"Unum is good company to work for overall.  They provide good benefits and work/life balance is flexible.  Some departments focus on high production, which can be stressful at times."
good,"Unum has long been a great company to work for in the communities in which it's located. Great benefits (especially PTO), good work/life balance, great mission and culture, Due to low interest rates and a very competitive environment though, the company continues to restructure its workforce and eliminate positions at an alarming rate. Even those employees who have been recognized as top performers are losing their jobs. "
good,"I liked working there but there was any room to advance. I worked directly for the Director of Operations. I ran reports and checked his emails. If there was growth, I would most likely still be working there."
good,Unum was a good place to be introduced to the larger corporate world.
good,Compensation was good a a manager. Just not made for a cubicle environment and looking at a computer all day. Co-workers are fine but as a manager it is hard to make changes with the people that have been there a long time. Training was poor
good,"If your system goes down for any reason make sure it’s documented, call someone, report it because if not you will get fired. They will ask for an explanation and then they’ll conduct and investigation. There’s no feedback on the calls and the manager would not listen to your calls unless she’s out to get you. QA listens to your calls every week and the manager does not follow up so there’s not way an employee can improve if there’s no feedback"
good,"It's a good company and you can advance if you work very hard. They believe in a great culture at Unum and that's a positive."
good,Getting a merit increase (raise) is almost impossible and instead you just need to get promoted. To be able to make more money I had to change jobs several times in the few years I worked for the company.
good,You learn alot mostly self taught. Trying was ok bit when you got on the floor there was lack of assistance to help out. You were told to use your resources but not told what and where these resources were.
good,"Excellent Management, competitive salary, great benefits, however unrealistic metrics and lack of work/life balance with heavy case loads makes more stressful work environment."
good,Great balance between your work life and home life. Scheduling aspects are a bit tight though. Nice place to work overall.
good,"Lower the average salaries, good work life balance, overtime expected."
good,It was a typical office career. Various duties requiring office skills.
good,"This is a great place to begin straight out of college for experience. Management is really helpful and coworkers will go out of their way to help as well. This is not a place to slack off though. It is face paced and you will receive a lot of work. You will also be audited, so if you are not doing the work correctly, it will show and management will discuss this with you."
good,"Unum has great benefits and training and the environment is friendly. However the calls are back to back, over time is mandatory after a holiday and unplanned absences are held against you. Management tries to make it pleasant with the incentives they offer but the Contact Center is a difficult place to work."
good,I found Unum to be a positive atmosphere. Having standard 8-5 days with little to no extra hours and no weekends made balancing home and work easy. Compensation was fair and good. Management was always looking to improve the process for the employees to make it better for them as well as the clients.
good,A lot of politics.  Made a lot of good friends.  Too corporate.
good,"You can either get way too comfortable here, or get laid off quickly when they want to change things up. While recent cosmetic updates are overdue and welcomed, leadership hasn't changed much. Some areas have great team culture, others nothing at all, except maybe all talk and no action. Hardest part of the job was finding meaning in the day in-day out cycle of wasted time, and promises. The top leadership wants to be modern, and trendy, but the decisions made are often antiquated in the modern world."
good,"If your life focuses on raising one or more children, this is a great company for you. You will take home good money, have great benefits and you will have time outside of work and low stress to be with your children. Also if you like dressing nice and trying to live high class and lacking a good personality, you will enjoy working here. For anyone else, try to look elsewhere. This is a for-profit insurance company, and it is behind the times with technology. Outsourcing to cheaper contractors is becoming more common, and benefitting your career for outside of this company is very difficult. If you enjoy your environment and job here, you can be very happy with staying with the company until retirement - but if not you need to get out as soon as you can."
good,There were plenty of opportunities for advancement. They also a lot of games and compositions. Celebrated every holiday at work. Management and co-workers very helpful.
good,I enjoyed the process of researching the and investigating each case and understanding each claimants story and how they've come to be in a position where they need the benefit I provide. We do work on a list based system so you're constantly aware of the amount of work you have left each day and often times it fluctuates with the amount of work you have. It's difficult to feel satisfaction when you do not see the end result of a product that you helped contribute to. It's also difficult dealing with the idea that you can't please everyone; unfortunately you have to interact with difficult customers which is definitely a challenge however it's helped me to learn to develop my customer service and empathy skills.
good,Team work is pushed daily which is awesome in its original definition. Teamwork at Unum means doing others work everyday while they work slowly or not efficiently.
good,"Corporate environment, good benefits and competitive pay.  CEO is currently in transition.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that work there."
good,Fantastic company with good ethics and staff benefits. Salaries are low compared to other similar companies and work can be very stressful (depending on department).
good,"It really depends on who your Manager is, and I had too many to count. You either have to conform and be very flexible to different management styles, or you may have difficulties."
good,"A culture of disenchantment exists with fear of the office being closed, uneven management, little promotional opportunities."
good,"Great workspace, flexible schedule and work at home capability.  A required written review of my current employer should not be required to apply for a position through Indeed."
good,"Unum has a great job advancemenr opportunities, but the work/life balance can be challenging in such a corporate setting with alot of policies. There isn't alot of flexibility."
good,"If you are extremely ambitious and hard-working, Unum is an excellent place to work with great salary and benefit. However, the culture is stereotypically corporate and averse to change."
good,"A typical day includes, when working in the contact center, getting to work, starting up your systems, and taking calls, assisting customers."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to interact with the other Unum employees on my delivery routes. I got a lot of exercise at that job.  There was a lot of change in the layout while I was there.
good,Good company to work for.  Great benefits.  Stable environment.  Opportunity for advancement.  Not the most exciting industry but they try to make it fun.
good,Unum insurance is a great place to get your foot in the door. Everyone is very welcoming and want to help you reach your goals.
good,"loved it there...was rewarded with several promotions"
good,It is the place where I could get a chance to get well versed in Agile Technology and Web based Testing. Fun place to work where I had got some good friends.
good,"Project managers and corporate staff available for questions, help with travel and supplies in the field.  Enjoyable to work for."
good,"It's extremely hard to rate the company as an employer.  All components vary depending on your position.  Some departments are great.  Overall the jobs are demanding and fast paced (which I prefer).  They offer great benefits, pay.  Some areas are much more flexible than others."
good,"Unum can provide a lot of opportunity for those willing to job shadow and really network. The employees are helpful, smart, and team-oriented. Management sometimes misses the mark relative to developing employees and building a strong, successful organization. It's up to the employees to form the right relationships, and bring ideas (based on facts and experience) to Management to improve the work environment."
good,"Unum has a laid-back work environment that provided the opportunities I was looking for in order to progress in my career.  They do a good job of developing employees, through technical challenges and management training."
good,Unum offers great benefits and in general a good place of employment.  Compensation however is behind industry averages for Business Analysts.
good,"Unum is a great company to work for. Relaxed environment, great benefits, competitive salary and bonus. Overall a great company."
good,"A typical day at work was very production orientated. Tasks assigned throughout the day with multiple interruptions. I did learn how to mentor new team members and became a technical expert in Short Term Disability contract knowledge. Daily conference calls with employers, medical professionals and claimants. My coworkers often came to me for claim file reviews and contract questions. The hardest part of the job was exceeding company standards set that were not attainable during computer outages or system issues. I loved working with the employers and the field offices on customer issues, contract questions and working with the public."
good,Good to work in such a big organization and with good friends. Nice friendly atmosphere and good infrastructure work place.Thank you so much for a wonderful journey. Love my company.
good,I was responsible to research files and help attorneys with cases
good,"A fast paced environment requiring the management of up to 80 long term disability claims that required: "
good,I found in this position I was really able to employ all medical knowledge that I have learned throughout my years in medicine. it was a wonderful experience.
good,"Unum looks after it's staff by having performance related recognition awards, which for me along with positive feedback boosts my confidence and makes me want to drive to achieve the best that I can in my career."
good,"I met with Claim Adjusters daily to go over potentially fraudulant claims. We would arrive at a decision to move forward rather requesting Surveillance, Personal Contact Visits, or FICA/Background checks. The hardest part of the position is when we were wrong about a particular decision but the best part was watching a surveillance tape and seeing you were correct and saved the company thousands of dollars."
good,-Good work-life balance
good,This is a great Company to work for. I work with very knowledgeable co-workers. I have to say this has been one of the most intense jobs I have ever had. There is so many pieces and constant thinking. I really enjoy my job knowing that what I do truly makes a difference in peoples lives.
good,"Great place to work, Mentor support for job positions and Training available. A typical day is to pull claims from a list of clients and processing leave status. Continued correspondence and strong interpersonal skills are needed."
good,"Unum is expanding its remote team so that's good for those that want to work from home. The starting pay for customer service if $33,900 a year which is really good for customer service agent. "
good,"UNUM was a good place to work.  Good Cafe' and onsite Gym.  Worked closely with others in the group including other Paralegals, administrative folks and Attorneys."
good,"Unum is a great company to be a part of. Typically your day starts with checking your work load and planning how you will attack it. The hardest part of the day is in the beginning when you set that plan. The workplace culture is great, although highly competitive. The most enjoyable part of the day was looking at your cleared work list after. It was such a satisfying feeling."
good,Pros: Okay job with good pay and benefits along with very good paid  vacation and sick days. Cons: The drive to Chattanooga and the time difference between CST and EST.
good,"As electronics tech I worked with the MAC crew (Moves, Adds, Changes) and was kept busy. Job I held has been outsourced but was at the time a very satisfying position."
good,Good Place to work and I would like to be full time if there was a position to come open. I see that it is more networking than anything in the corporate world due to someone always has a friend that needs a job. I was passed over due to a friend needing a job.
good,I worked in a data center and the job was fast paced and we worked long 12 hour days. Management was okay no major issues. If there was a problem it was handled efficiently. The part I enjoyed most about the job was the expo ended I gained working with the mainframe. I also enjoyed having days off because of 12 hour shift work.  The hardest part was learning how to read JCL.
good,"I enjoy working for Unum. The benefits are above average and pay is well for an entry level job. "
good,This is a high paced and exciting job. I've learned to be patient and try to understand our customers position. I've also had to develop  multi-tasking skills. The hardest part of the job was multitasking in the computer environment. The most enjoyable part is helping customers.
good,"1. Great Work culture"
good,"Provide administrative support to a team of 13 case managers."
good,I have worked for Unum for the last 10 years and I currentley manage a service team along with having an insurance sales goal.
good,"Several internal opportunities for growth and advancement, competitive pay and reasonable benefits package. Management in some areas is exemplary. Recently underwent remodel to agile workplace and this contributed to a very modern feeling atmosphere."
good,"Daily:"
good,"Pros: "
good,"Claims load 80-90.  Wonderful training.  Great support from clinical and voc.  As in any large company, the culture varied by manager.  Some were wonderful, supportive and instructive, while others admitted they could not do the job the people they managed were doing."
good,Great Company. Challenging. Room fro growth. Sales reps are paid by performance and can earn a high income. You are able to entertain brokers and clients.
good,The hardest part of the job is the management and the communications. I work under 8 managers and they all seem to have a different idea of how the department should run causing a stress on me trying to explain several times the same information just in a different format to the different leaders. It seems they sometimes forget to communicate with one another to figure out what the real issue is and how to solve it as one.
good,"This was a great company to work with, and the decision to leave was not an easy one. There is room to grow, but it is very difficult due to a large amount of talent, but a shrinking workforce. The PTO was very generous, the pay was good for the region, and the benefits were outstanding."
good,"Unum has great benefits and this is what keeps employees satisfied. They really care about providing you with the best perks, including a generous paid time off plan. Leadership has become a big part of the employee culture. This is great for those who strive to broaden their career and push themselves to be the best employee they can be no matter what level you are."
good,"Very good training and a good product to service, FMLA.  But just not suitable for me to work in a very small cubicle in a call center."
good,"Im a contractor so I dont have the luxury to explore all that UNUM has to offer. I can tell its a great place to work and they are very diversed. My day starts with a FMLA meeting a 3 to 4 other meetings following that. I balance my day between Development, Meetings, QA, BA and tesing, it builds character."
good,"I have loved working for Unum. Great benefits, wonderful work/life balance."
good,"The atmosphere is light and the company has endless resources. However, advancement in field offices can be limited by the number of open positions."
good,"Productive work days and excellent coworkers, commitment to quality."
good,"Working with a variety of individuals at various levels within the organization to implement a consistent vision, create and implement project plans for business and systems initiatives, successfully manage change and facilitate diversity initiatives."
good,Unum has been a good place to work and find that it is a very competitive environment for advancement. The people at Unum are very nice for the most part and most managers are great at helping employees with work/life balance. The benefits are great but insurance is expensive.
good,My job as a consultant entails leveraging strategic partnerships with brokerage agencies to deliver client-driven solutions.
good,"Great process; however, be prepared at the end of the day to become a contractor, not permanent employee.  I felt very well treated in entire candidate vetting process.  Felt toward closure it was an exercise where from the beginning, they weren't going to hire, but fold that position.  Grateful my talents were useful enough to contribute as a contractor eventhough the cotract duration was reduced 50%.  Would work there or contract again."
good,"Working in a Call Center Environment is a bit different. the calls are based on STAT's, Basically keep the calls lower than 5- 7min, that includes documenting. Things tend to change all the time, One manager will say, tell the clients everything when they call in what is needed. Then other Manager next time will say only focus on what they calling about and move on to the next call. So the Customer Service can Vary. Sometimes you are given time to review changes for policys for clients- groups. But other times you do it during calls, or your expected to do it during your own time.

good,Every job has its pluses and minus.  What makes Unum special is the people I worked with.  The senior leadership of the company is more visible than any other place I have worked.
good,"I worked at Unum for 25 years. During that time I worked primarily in Customer Service, but that department comprised many different roles. I worked anywhere from 40 hours per week in some jobs to over 50 in others. Environments differ, employees differ as does management.  Unum. was a really great employer for a long time.  Pay and benefits were fair. I made many lasting friendships with so many people.   Thing is, it is VERY FAST PACED and quite stressful, depending on the role you are in. If you are not a person who can handle a fast pace and a fair amount of stress, dont apply there. I'm proud to say I was able to handle it and did for a number of years.  I learned so much. I am grateful to have worked at Unum."
good,answer phone calls back to back to back. I learned a lot about insurance and the different benefits for each policy. Management was okay but they did not do much to keep people.

good,Unum has been an amazing place to start my career out of college. It provided me many training opportunities that lead to leadership opportunities and advancement. The culture is transforming to a more agile and collaborative approach to servicing the customers.
good,"Unum was a fast paced and stressfull job as their quotas for the number of claims processed were very high.  The good news was that if you met your quotas for 6 straight months, you could work from home.  Which I did enjoy. Their training was only adequate."
good,"Unum is a great company to work for. What impresses me the most is the longevity of so many of the employees and how many colleagues I respect have been able to carve out a successful career from themselves. "

good,"Diverse culture. flexible hours and ability to work from home, some stress however on site gym and fitness allowing for a good workplace culture. Dress is business casual."
good,"Have worked as an intern for 1.5 years. The amount you gain from your time there depends on you willingness to seek out growth opportunities for yourself. Great culture, relatively competitive salaries for the industry, and great benefits. Of course, as an intern I was not offered benefits, but full time colleagues raved about the PTO."
good,"Worked in a busy key account team. Working off the shared worklist, I did existing business account renewals and enquiries for the Aon & WTW brokers. "
good,"The company as a whole seemed like a very pleasant place to work.  The workloads were heavy but the compensation seemed to be inline with what they demanded of you.  For myself I just found there to be something missing and I struggled to remain passionate about my career there.  For me, if I am not passionate about what I am doing then I just need to find something different to do.  However, over the few years I worked here I met dozens of folks that really seemed to enjoy what they did there.  For me this was just a big learning experience and I have no real regrets from taking a position here."
good,Briefly worked there for a project. I liked my manager and the organizational culture seemed positive. That's about it. I need to meet the character requirements...just did.

good,Unum is a very fun work environment culturally diverse the people there are awesome to work with. I enjoyed making the kits because we had a team of girls who made a project out of it and knew how to make labor fun!
good,I enjoyed disability claims very much there with a lot of opportunity for advancement and continuing education as well.  i would recommend anyone to work here if the have the opportunity.
good,"Unum is a pretty good company. Big place with professional atmosphere. Most days you can wear jeans and casual dress attire. The work area is basic cubicles(although they were transitioning to different layout soon) You will be at your computer for entirety of shift and management is able to track every second of what you do throughout the day. This leads to a heavily metrics-based, micromanaged environment which can be a drag. However, at my position I was able to listen to podcasts and music as I worked which was great. My job consisted of receiving sensitive materials like death certificates and medical records and setting up claims for customers."
good,"This company was a wonderful place to work for.  Great hours, good benefits, free in city parking, good working conditions.  It was a place that cared not only about the employees but the clients."

good,Enjoyed my time and experiences with this company.  The work environment was challenging but was geared for success.
good,"I have worked for Unum for 13 years.  Management took notice when work environment surveys for the Glendale office fell short a couple of years back.  New management was brought in with the skills needed for promoting individual contributions, individual development and building teams.   A new approach for staffing cases changed the work environment by fostering good relationships among the business operations managers, benefits specialists, and consultants (Vocational Rehabilitation and Clinical).  In the past year and a half a lot of effort went into improving training for new and long-time employees.  "

I learned how to resolve conflict, how to mentor and on boarding for new employees, medical terminology, how to give/ receive feed back. The work place culture was fun and relaxed.

good,"UNUM offers employees with a wide variety of opportunities. A typical day in the contact center requires 7 hours of commitment to answering questions concerning disability claims. This is a fast paced environment that demands integrity with attention to detail. The best part of the contact center is knowing that when you leave work, you do not have to take any additional work home with you. The toughest part about the contact center is taking call after call and attempting to trouble shoot in under 5 minutes. The company offers many wonderful volunteer opportunities for the community and management is dedicated to help you achieve the best performance possible."
good,"9-5 corporate job.. get comfy with your cubical"
good,As customer service specialist I was trained to provide support to customers placing inbound calls to our call center with inquiries about claims and medical leaves.

While working I learned how to organize customers claim files, comunicate and update any information to those files. I also learned how to work on mulitipule computer systems and multi task helping customers while updating claims. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping them as needed, based on my knowledge of the claim. The most challenging part of my job was dealing with customers who called in crying and in need of assistance with getting their claim checks and not being able to get the customer a quick fix and instead having to correct their claim so that they would eventually get everything they need. Though that was hard, the most enjoyable parts of my job was knowing that no matter what the nature of the customers call, I was always able to get the claim processed correctly and I knew that everyone I help would be taken care of. It was very rewarding to know I was able to help customers and my company everyday. "

good,Great experience working with Unum thus far.I have grown tremendously both personally and professionally while taking part in the sales training program.
good,"Typically a salaried person can expect to work 45-50 hours per week in the area of Finance.  I've learned that you need to sometimes say no to your internal customer.  Working too much has had a negative impact on my family.  Very often leadership and management will tell you to not work late but they are obligated to say that and continue to understaff with unrealistic deadlines.  The very best part of my job is the professional, friendly, supportive team."

good,"It was a real game changer for me to go from an industry that was non healthcare related to a healthcare position in a huge fortune 500 company. "
good,"Good place to work in general. With all corporations, this organization made a lot of changes to try to stay competitive in the marketplace. I learned a lot while I was at Cigna. This is where I began my career, and when I started they had a wonderful training program and I believe I had the best training possible in the industry. You were required to get at least an 87% score on all product and compliance testing. This was a 10 week program while learning to do your job. this was hard but was most rewarding. Only the best of the best made it through this program and this is how their final selection process was done at that time. A typical day at work, was managing the customer deliverables, visiting clients to retain relationships and look for opportunities to add on products. The management team at the time I was there was wonderful and they cared about your career path and helped you to get there."
good,Working at Unum I was a billing analyst. I was responsible for all premium reconciliations for all the cases I was assigned to.

They have moved to an Agile-style layout with more collaborative workspaces, including luxurious sitting areas to take your laptop to, in order to have a more relaxed environment if your job allows you to move around.  I don't know what a fresh recruit would find, but veterans of the company have ample PTO to use whenever needed plus plenty of holiday days throughout the year.  I always found their benefit package to be more than satisfactory."
good,I have worked many different jobs I have never felt like I mattered as much as I did when I work for UNUM. They completely understand work-life balance they take good care of their employees all the way around. The pay is tremendous the workload is not hard or heavy it's a nice environment they keep you unstressed so that way you actually want to come in every day! You automatically get benefits and paid time off the second you are hired. They recently just raised their minimum wages at the office that I was at. I wish my job wasn't temporary there because I would have loved to made that into a career! They give you nice enough brakes there's a nice kitchen there will affordable prices.
good,"this was a great company to wrok for. great benefits, and until they decide to downsize and outsource my department truly enjoyed working at UNUM."

good,"Great development opportunities and leadership pushes you to succeed. Ability to move up within the organization is high, great pay, great benefits."
