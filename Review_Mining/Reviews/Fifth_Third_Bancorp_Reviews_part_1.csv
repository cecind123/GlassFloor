bad,It’s who you know to get  you to the next level even you qualify for a position if someone has a Nephew a daughter  a son a cousin from their family they get the job before you even with your experience and the years you dedicate to the bank don’t matter
bad,I heard rumors of how bad this place is but now I’ve experienced it for myself. It’s constantly back to back calls with entitled mean customers. I wish I would’ve taken a different position that was offered. Nobody is happy here. The Ceos are mean too. I said hi to one in passing and he pretended I didn’t exist.
bad,My manager told all my coworkers why I was on MLOA. He violated my privacy and the regulations of mloa. I was looking for a part time job to go along with my full time school schedule. I was constantly scheduled 40 hours a week at multiple different branches. The actual work is easy and interacting with customers was nice.
bad,Racist company and very stressful. They put people i roles that they are not equipped to handle and have high expectations for numbers. You spend more time worry about your job
bad,It is no longer a good place to work.  Too much gossip and backstabbing.   And dont get me started on the religion talk in the office!!  If you dont subscribe to their religious beliefs you are treated like a leper.   Horrible environment for a long time bank employee.
bad,"Terrible training"
bad,It was never done properly! The upper management never seemed eager to help. It wasn’t fair. There were certain people allowed to do certain things and HR allowed it.
bad,"I've never worked for a worse place. Management lied about compensation, production levels, and every other relevant aspect of the job starting at my first interview all the way up to the day I finally quit. Whatever type of job you're looking for do yourself a favor and find it somewhere else."
bad,In the beginning you have lots of opportunity to move to other areas and learn new things. After you have been there a while you now become someone that they keep an eye on so they can get rid of you and hire someone in another country for a small pittance of what you make.
bad,No work-life balance.  High-pressure sales environment. salary is not enough to maintain the quality of life and to pay bills. Management is lacking..
bad,"This place may have been great at one point, but it is currently in a swan dive. They desperately bought a Chicago area bank in a bid to expand, and then laid off half of thier staff. Here on the Ohio front, Branch Managers only care when they can share gossip. Regional are so out of touch with how a branch runs that they have no clue that expectations for metrics are unreasonable. If you personally dont force loans down everyone's throat they will show you the door."
bad,"The company as a whole is amazing.  Middle management is horrible.   We are expected to reach goals that are constantly changing with no rhyme or reason, for managers who would rather be drunk than care about their jobs."
bad,"My experience at Fifth third bank was HORRIBLE due to the toxic, stressful work environment due to employees, management and the company.  I went through being the only teller for whole days at a time with no help from bankers or management. Hours and benefits were cut for part time employees- making it hard to make a living. The days were constantly micromanaged, with no positive feedback on how to improve. I met goals and had over 100 transactions daily but it was not enough to management.  Recognition and rewards for effort were not sought to hard working employees. I also never called in a day, but had stayed late Monday- Saturday due to lack of help from bankers and manager. I was talked to with disrespect daily and harassed. Be prepared if you take this job to be walked all over by employees that have been there longer. As a part time teller, you will get the worst of the worst- most days lunches are not given and you will work about 9 hours. It was an extremely negative environment- each day the huddles would start with negative comments and embarrassing employees in front of an audience. Many times as I asked for help, Management would embarrass me in front of customers and coworkers In a daunting manner. I have never had such a poor experience at a workplace. I happily left."
bad,Do not recommend. Terrible training. Terrible management. Very stressful because of goals. SELL SELL SELL MOTO. Would never tell anyone to work here...
bad,"If you want a job where you consistently try to screw people with debt they can't handle, come to 5/3! You are constantly expected to sell, sell, sell regardless of how much you help a customer. Goals and expectations are constantly raised so that you are always behind. Bonus payout system was recently changed so as to pay employees less in bonuses. Managers are promoted based on their sales not on their leadership abilities. Environment is toxic and you are encouraged to shark sales wherever you can get them, including from people who cannot afford it."
bad,"Management and upper management are horrible they only care about selling products to the customers they don’t need, Favortism, no room for advancement, doesn’t care about long term employees, makes you feel like if you don’t meet a monthly quota you will lose your job."
bad,Your job description does not explain everything they will have you doing it’s a messed up place the people and the managers it’s a very easy job to do but management and the separation of shifts it’s just so much wrong I honestly cannot find anything good to say
bad,"Oversee all areas of the bankmart.  Audit tellers, count down vault, assist customers, fill ATM machine.  It was a wonderful position, but my manager called off leaving the responsible with me.  The bankmart closed when the Grocery store closed down."
bad,"Not a place I wanted to work. Not a lot of business, very boring, days dragged.  Not praised for any accomplishments. Did not learn much I already had experience. Management not in office much. Had 4 different managers in 1 year."
bad,"I would not work here again. Atleast once a week, we had to operate offline. Our atm was always down. The customers in our area were entitled and rude. Customers were upset when they were identified by driver's license. bizarre?"
bad,"Basically, you'll get fired without a notice by your supervisor if you aren't making them money by getting them their bonus. The hours are 11-8pm and won't change for 9 months. This includes working on Saturdays 11-5pm. Also, if your scores are not the best,  then you will end up with the same stupid 2nd shift schedule, which forces you to either quite or get fired. Every 6-9 months there is a shift bid based on performance, so make sure you kiss some butt or get 100% every call."
bad,A typical day at Fifth Third bank was very stressful I worked in the mail center third shift. I learned a lot about how banks operate. I learn how to work with a diverse group of individual. Management wasn't to great very high turn over rate. Workplace culture was diverse. the hardest part about the job was going to work and being harass because it was to many chief and not enough indian's.. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting different individual and different cultures.
bad,"bad management and prejudice, I did not like working there. too stressful and too demanding.  they do not hire enough worker, so you have to multi-task."
bad,"I was not a happy person when working there and you probably won't be either Lots of pressure for the amount of compensation. For example, was told by my manager that I needed to stay over by an hour and a half which would have put me, this was acknowledged they would just have to pay it, the next week I get an e-mail giving me a warning that this overtime was not acceptable to 53 bank."
bad,Fifth Third is a very cut throat company and WAY too sales driven. They are not for what is best for the customer. Only focused on product pushing. Management needs a face lift also. Managers dont care about you as a person.
bad,"Stressful work environment. Did not have any room for advancement. Worked long hours, and was not compensated appropriately for it. Management did not pay attention to underlying issues."
bad,"The high paced environment has some great employees however, the standards for performance are not logical to provide adequate customer service. There is limited room for movement, but not much advancement."
bad,"No matter what you do there its wrong. Your told to improve one skill, so you do, but then something else is wrong with you, so you improve that skill, but wait, now there is something else wrong with you. Its an endless cycle that makes you feel like a failure no matter what."
bad,management was not honest from the get go and would rather hire from the outside versus hiring for a promotion from within. They do not accept or want feedback regarding any topic
bad,At first it was great but they start losing people that has been there for over 20 year and management became horrible they did not care about there employees at all.
bad,"No possible chance of career advancement, the culture is very diverse.  Management in suits non management in jeans.  No one speaks not a good place to work."
bad,"Fifth Third Bank is very two faced in its culture.  On one hand they want you to take care of the customer, but only if that means a loan or credit card"
bad,"I have been with Fifth Third over 5 years, management is horrible. They are selective and if you not deemed a favorite you will not be recognized. Its not worth the stress."
bad,"Let me tell you how Fifth Third really is. Fifth Third is a factory, a factory of super aggressive selling. If you can sell you’ll be fine. You have a point goal of 2400 points as a Personal Banker II. Each account has a value (points), checking account is 25, savings is 5, 100 is for loans, credit cards are 40 and etc. You get a thing called “Balance Spend” this helps you with your goals after 90 days. You have to cross sell the products in order to get these extra points (based on dollar amounts listed branch by branch). Calling is super important and you must love to be on the phones, at least 25 a Day, 5 days a week. Another thing you have to do at Fifth Third Bank is work 6 days a week at least twice a month. You get a half day during the week then your working a Saturday. The company is ruthless, they don’t care about you, they don’t care about your struggles and will low ball you when it comes to promotions."
bad,"Under new management the company has many issues with work-life balance, employee engagement and job security.  I would never recommend this company to anyone looking for a career."
bad,"Went through the 8 week training program was not taught anything by my supervisor. I just sat and watched and they expected me to know everything. At the age of 22, coming straight out of college they expected me to know everything about banking and I didnt even have a finance class in my 4 years. Great company but good luck trying to be successful there. Be ready to get yelled at by customers left and right coming in and complaining about their accounts and fees."
bad,The leadership in the company abuses the skills of those who are great at what they do and promote those who can barely function as a leader. There is more focus on the status quo and those who can't perform protecting their job security than recognizing talent and pushing for the success of others
bad,"Great people, great clients, great culture. I began my career in the financial services industry with 5/3 back in 2013. It was a great stepping stone."
bad,I would dumpster dive before I ever took a job at 5/3 again! I have heard regional mngt say (we want cheeks in the seat)All they care bout is numbers.
bad,"This company is AWFUL. they overwork employees to the point, where they all just end up walking out and quitting. they have high goal expectations, yet they never seem to have enough branch staff, causing you to have to be a banker, teller, manager etc all at once, so you can never focus on your goals. worst financial institution I have ever worked for."
bad,Horrible management unfair and unrealistic expectations. Fast pace. Biased supervisor. if you've been there for a long time you can basically do whatever you want. If you're new you're screwed.
bad,"The management was widget focused, cared more about opening accounts then selling products and services that increased revue. Old tech and slow to react to changes in the market place."
bad,"comp was good when I started.  It was cut each year.  when goals are hit, they get raised until only a small portion are able to hit them.  only the bigger branches are able to do this consistently. I did well and was moved to one of the bigger branches.  upward mobility made me leave.  I interviewed for a few different positions and learned later that I was a formality, they already had the candidate picked, each time.  they just had to fill the quota for interviewing within the company."
bad,"Fifth Third bought a bank that I worked for and in a matter of 2 years chased off all the employees, and apologetically chased off most of the long term client relationships."
bad,Worked for 5/3 as a lead teller at the avondale chicago  location. This was by far the worse company to work for. The training is horrible and all they care about are sales. They do not care about there customers. Management unprofessional and regional managers are no help. High turn over rate they do not appreciate there workers.
bad,"I spent three long MISERABLE years working here because there was no such thing as advancing. The managers are unprofessional, disrespectful, demeaning, and will have you wondering how and why they got their position in the first place. Hours were horrible I'm talking about 6:45 in the morning to 10:00 at night, FORCEFULLY!! We were also FORCED to come in on our OFF day which was Saturday and threatened with our job security if we attempted to refuse. HR ignores complaints, no incentive, no breaks, even attending school was frowned upon. I know within six months I witnessed AT LEAST ten people come in for a week and never come back, the turnover rate was extremely high! Those were the smart ones! The most stressful job I have ever had! Take my warnings if this is in the Downtown Cincinnati area steer clear of this job! It is not worth it!"
bad,"Salary listed for Fifth Third Bank for Personal Banker II of 39,000 or more is incorrect. I work in Mt Vernon, IL as a PBII started me at 30,000 as PBI and only being paid 32,156 yr. after having been with them for almost a year and a promotion to PB2. This information is misleading to those looking for a new job. I drive 2 hours round trip daily to work, am a single mother twice widowed and work so hard I come home and have to sleep 12 hrs just to get through the next day. I also had to take two vacation days, today and tomorrow, because I am so broke I do not even have gas money to get to work. Unfortunately one of the worst places I have had to work, due to the current economic circumstances in this country. Could not recommend this company based on my treatment and experiences with them."
bad,"FIfth Third doesn't care about their employees or customers for that matter. With a strict time limit on the phone, like a bank, they only care about numbers. Worst decision was to join their team"
bad,Very low pay.  Employees not appreciated. Management treats everyone like robots.  There is no employee appreciation.   I was very unhappy in this role as a teller.
bad,Learned consultative sales to identify needs for every client that comes into the bank. Yet company is very unorganized with training and management doesn't want to be bothered by employees nor wants to provide them with the right tools so that they can be successful.
bad,"Unless you like pushing bank products that customer don't need or want, keep looking."
bad,Mortgage Business bubble burst and company went out of Business due to issues within the housing market.  The company had to shut its doors ...
bad,"Ewww, what an awful place to work. After coming from a real bank Chase, 5th3rd was a joke. All the idiots were in postions of authority.  No one knew how to do their job. Sales was the worst. Worked at a tiny branch, how many times can I call the same ppl to beg for their business. What a joke this place is!!!! Glad Im gone, good riddens."
bad,This is where you work if you want to move ahead while doing exactly what is wrong for your clients. Terrible people work here and justify what they do based on their ego.
bad,"Was such a disappointment, may things told would happen with career don't believe it. HR is the worst I have every worked with - don't call for service no one speekieee english!!! Same for customers you field more calls because they cannot get help from home office."
bad,"If you want to work for a company were you are harassed and put down all the time by management this is the place for you. If they can find a way to make your life and day more un-enjoyable, this company will do it. They do not believe the half to follow laws they believe they can go around them. This is the worst company I have ever worked for in my life."
bad,I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to service then with there needs.
bad,"You get paid very little for what you have to put up with. management breathes down your neck, you get screamed and cussed at all day long. they suggest if u miss your break to just skip it, and theres no room for advancement"
bad,Fifth Third bank is a boiler room type atmosphere where they have extremely high turnover both in client base as well as employees. I would not recommend  this employer to anyone who has a conscience.
bad,Customer service call center. High volume call center. Trained other reps and enjoyed the people I worked with.
bad,"They have the worst Underwriting and processing staff in Chicago and do not care or respect the Loan Officers at all. They will deduct application fees at a whim out of your commission and do not even tell you that when they are bringing you aboard. Even if the manager says you just have to have the customer fill out a credit card Authro.. Trust me they rob your paycheck and HR does not care. First its $200... then $400 then one day $1,000. Insurance is the worst and most expensive I have ever had to deal with."
bad,Management treats employees with respect and are always willing to help and let you grow within the company.
bad,There is constant turnover with this company. Also they care more about sales and making money than they do just pleasing there customers.
bad,Horrible company to work for. There is no such thing as a team. Its very dirty operated.
bad,I have work for that company where they ask you to give 150% in a daily basis whit no training poor management and worse if you try to fix the problem is no support.
bad,"I wouldn't want anyone to be treated the way I was treated when I worked there.  Don't waste your valuable time, effort and career on this company. Let me put it this way,  I wouldn't wish it on anyone irrespective of who they are, to be subjected to what I endured."
bad,"Bad management culture"
bad,Regional Managers are always demeaning and asking for more n more regardless of an actual need for the client. My Manager is AWESOME but They are nervous for their jobs too now! They are big to say we keep customers at the center of everything but thats such a sham they only care about pushing the product of the week with cold calls and employees are expected to produce and its a highly s stressful environment
bad,Fifth third bank is not a great company to work for  your only a number to them and not an employee. Management sucks and only cares about themselves. They don’t support you to better your career or to move forward. They give you more work then what your job duties are and expects you to get that done along with your normal everyday work. If you slack on that they write you up. Worst company i have ever worked for!
bad,"Bank leadership is driven only by lining the pockets of themselves and shareholders. All the messaging about Colpany culture and Company investment in community is just PR/marketing talk - behind the scenes and upper management care less about it. "
bad,"The banking center manager role required overtime,  but you were not allowed to put overtime down on time sheet. "
bad,The agency does not have good training and pays low wages.  The staff gets locked in and dedicated and never leave.  Many of them are working 2 jobs because the pay is so low
bad,"This is a highly stressful job."
bad,The work place environment is outdated. The culture is low tech and the management is old school.  No work/life balance or alternative work solutions.
bad,They have a good ol' boy promotion system.  Top that off with terrible salaries which means they tend to get the bottom of the gene pool with hiring options and you'll quickly realize taking a job here was a really bad idea.  Their bad reputation is well deserved when it comes  to being an employer or a bank.
bad,Goal oriented but not thinking about the customer benefits/need with the only purpose of cross sell even the customer do not need it.
bad,"I worked for eight years for this company. The first five years I worked for Fifth Third were good because of the managers I had and the girls I worked with.  Then when one of the managers retired and the other manager  transferred to a different branch and all of the other tellers quit because of the new management it just got so bad.  The company doesn't care about their employees nor does the management at one of the central indiana branches you know who you are. I would never work for those uncaring managers again. You rarley get Saturdays off also. I ended up quitting because my husband is very ill and they said that my work should come before family. The sales goals are insane that they expect you to get every month. They will make you stay for call nights if you don't recieve your sales goals and they will write you up for it also.  They don't care about your family, they think that work comes before family.  The company is very two faced. I was also there when they would tell us to tell the customers if they were approved for a credit card that they were approved and that we already mailed it out to them without their consent. There is no room for advancement either in the company.  I would never refer my worst enemy to work there. "
bad,They only care about what the board thinks and not what’s best for their employees and customers horrible place to work no work life balance if you love to work all the time they are the place to go
bad,Major player in Greater Cincinnati but local Market Management is a joke - often times observed harassing the female teller staff inappropriate comments.
bad,"I thought fifth third would be my last job. That I was going to make a career out of it. Boy did I think wrong! No manager for almost a year, made all these promises to move me up through the company and never happened. Was told that the customer came first and that there policy was to always sell products to the customer that would BENEFIT THEM! They care more about selling products to customers that don’t need them to make money off them. Was very unprofessional workplace and upper management definitely didn’t know what they were doing. There is favoritism among coworkers and there was never a day where gossip about other coworkers didn’t happen. Would never recommend anyone to work here. It won’t last long."
bad,Mgmt would demand to con the customer in to getting products that was not need. inflated reports that were false and turn over was high and regularly.
bad,"the pay is low. no traffic, they want you to push product on every customer. micro manage you, manager does not back you up. . upper management is from wells Fargo so the want you to call 25 customers a day and harass them. they tell you that you are trying to help  the customer but you are really harnessing them for additional products. when you open an account someone from other branch closes your account and they open another one in order for them to get the points."
bad,"Workplace culture does not favor employee development or growth.  Job opportunities are not focused on finding candidates with a certain skill set.  This leads to candidates being offered jobs that are not ""right"" for their skill set.  This creates an unfavorable environment for employee success and growth."
bad,none I have nothing to say. I did not like the workplace culture. I like the interaction with customer and help them with their needs and issues. I did not like the fact we are just a number no personal touch or care
bad,Ther is no work like balance here they want you to sacrifice all for the sake of the company and never any reward or benefits to doing so. The management is not consistent with their instructions.
bad,"The whole management is changing.only care about new acquisition. current customers don't matter. waiting for hours to talk to customer service."
bad,"The branch staff had no one to advocate for them and the managers were unapproachable.  They had a skeleton crew, which meant long hours after the branch was closed! I won't even bank with them!"
bad,The corporate culture was not diversely respected.  If you wanted to get ahead and not willing to sleep with the regional managers you were stuck in your positon until you leave.
bad,Pay is horrible for the type of customers you have to put up with.  Management just goes to lunch all day.  Cross-selling is pushed constantly and is competitive.
bad,"If you're into trying to push anybody that calls or walks in to get an unsecured loan than this place is for you! Seriously though, the practices are borderline predatory, the sales goals are insane if you're in a slow branch, and the management is a long line of people breathing down one another's necks."
bad,High pressure sales goals are the name of the game. If you're not hitting them you better be ready to be on conference calls and looking for another job
bad,"They use your skills and capabilities and show absolutely no appreciation ( unless you hit your sales goals- then you can get away with anything, such as not following policies and procedures etc. ) Would never recommend working for this company, especially in Chicagoland area. Cincinnati affiliate is another story, it's as if there are two different companies."
bad,"they are only focused on selling..in fact you have to pass a role play that shows you can push products.  they want deposits, big commercial accounts and fees.  Don't ask for a loan unless you really don't need to borrow and even then you may not be approved.  I have seen customers with no debt, credit scores in the 800 range and thousands of dollars on deposit turndown."
bad,"Upper Management is not right. No advacements and promotions, only if you know someone, and Nepotism. Only thinks about goals, and not the employees. Pay is great, however the stress level is not worth it."
bad,"Never before have I seen such a poorly managed department.  "
bad,"All my employees did their best, "
bad,It was working as a bank teller.  Cash handling with customers as well as completing any needed tasks available in the banking center that day.
bad,While their benefits and compensation may be close to industry standard (at least in the IT side of the business) the management is terrible. They don't manage people and they expect you to donate yourself 200% to the bank. Volunteer to help run something after work hours. No compensation or floating hours - that is time/money you donated to the bank.
bad,"Even if you have background experience in banking, which they might be very impressed with, once you are in the bank it becomes apparent that the only thing that matters is sales of checking acocunts, credit cards and identity theft...all for which they get big fees."
bad,"A very difficult place to work with pressure to sell products from upper management became unbearable. At the time I was there they had a turnover ratio of 48% (which was down from previous years) and 60% of their work force was on some sort of corrective action (this was on a conference call). Upper Management locked you in to a position and did not allow you to move within the company. In 2 years, I saw 2 people move outside the retail banking network and I worked with 5 different centers before my program was cut. Luckily the head of Retail was fired and hopefully for the people still employed by the company the Regional Managers will not be far behind."
bad,Management is a joke. Not an ethical company. If you complain about co workers being unethical you are in trouble.
bad,"Though the sales culture is intense and goal s are beyond aggressive, I actually enjoyed that portion of the job. The biggest problem with the company is communication and poor senior management. Changes were never rolled down properly and soon became threats. IT WAS CHAOS."
bad,"being ready on time at the desk."
bad,"Fifth Third doesn’t care about you they just want you to make your goals. They want 700 points per person for the month and a checking or saving account is only 5 points.... its impossible. I would leave for two days and would come back with at least 100 emails!!! They want you to cold call everyday. If you want to move up in the company I hope you know someone higher up or else it will take years to move up. Oh and you want incentives for those accounts you opened or anything you would open up? Forget it because they don’t pay you incentives there. It’s a joke, run fast"
bad,Pressure on day to day activity low staffing low support from upper management when it comes to staffing your expected to work over so this effects work life balance they claim is embarrassed I do not feel this is this description of all there markets or locations but North Carolina is terrible.
bad,"The Knoxville market is a joke .. Literally a joke, The district manager is a bully! one of the worst work experiences I have ever witnessed. No training for what you need to know. I would never recommend this bank to anyone."
bad,Fifth Third just bought out the bank I worked for. Big culture shock and everyone trying to do their best but management now micromanages thie staff minute by minute. We hear from senior management that it’s a great company to work for but so far no sign of that. The stress of having to figure out the new system with little or no training while servicing crowds of customers daily is terrible. Chat support helps a little. Regional manager only cares about stats and sees both employees and customers just as numbers and possible sources of profit for the bank. You have no voice there. Management will refuse to hear you even if you’re trying to contribute to the team as a whole. Awful experience so far.
bad,Fifth Third has a policy of employment at will.  They hire and then lay off way too much.  Turnover is 23% annually.  Bad culture and can not trust management.  They say it is o.k. to speak up but actions do not show support.
bad,"Toxic leadership is protected while driving away the best employees. Frequent layoffs, and not always a bottom 10% reduction. Leaders lead by saying no, not by growing employees. Company is run by Cincinnati natives who promote and protect their classmates. Initiatives are not quality controlled to find value or actual growth to the bank."
bad,"Another job that didn't care about work/life balance.  Numbers were the only objective, Didn't care about family or other prior commitments.  They always said there is someone else looking for a job that could replace you."
bad,"I never was able to finish up my work for the day because they would not allow overtime, which led to lots of stress! Too big of a company so they don’t care at all about their employees."
bad,Being a bank teller was a good job however all the sales goals we had to meet were crazy. They cared more about sales than providing good customer service. You can only ask the same customers so many times about opening accounts or investment opportunities. The fees they have for customers are ridiculous I didn't even have an account there.
bad,Do not recommend employment. Poor and invisible executive leadership that needs more coaching than his/her direct reports. Recommend leadership be focused on leading by example rather than self-promotion. Recruited from a larger financial institution only to be disappointed when joining Fifth Third where is strives in 'bare minimum' customer-centric attitude and prides itself on fee revenue and padding the bottom line with it.
bad,"Manager would throw co-workers under the bus when he was talking to you about something saying they commented or complained when they didn't.  He was always trying to get us to ""tattle"" on each other."
bad,Fifth Third Bank has a horrible work environment. There are no advancement opportunities. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Fifth Third Bank I don't expect them to be in operating much longer with there current business practices.
bad,I was a teller and then a personal banker at Fifth Third Bank. I worked for this bank two different times thinking that things would get better. They pay great but the expectation of things are unrealistic.
bad,We were brought on to accommodate the projected influx of loan being refinance.  Our position was eliminated shortly after.
bad,The bank as a whole is not a bad employer. The Chicago affiliate is a different story. Middle Management does everything in its power to discourage the employee and minimize his/her efforts. Management does not value its employees who are treated as interchangeable parts.
bad,"High pressure in making sales for tellers and only became tougher as policy kept changing. Manager played favoritism with the bankers, and eventually felt like a struggle for power to be taken seriously. Manager very unprofessional in front of customers. I dreaded coming to work. It felt more like an ""us vs. Them"" than a team. Company did not make you feel cared for, they just cared for sales. It just wasn't worth the stress."
bad,Worst manager . He was lazy and incompetent. Was micromanaging the staff to the point of exhaustion . Is all about sales and phone calls . They don’t care about you as a person
bad,I was there for a very short time. Banking branch culture is scary. Clients angry and makes threats abt fees. Face to face access makes those situations scary
bad,"Branch Manager did not know how to do her job, played favorites, mean person all around. No handicap access and they refuse to install accommodations. Would not recommend working here unless you want to hate your Co workers. Horrible horrible branch manager, she should NOT HAVE THIS JOB."
bad,"Loan officers endure a lot in working on the customer's loans. Extended wait times to close, repetitive requests for info from borrower, and an overall difficulty to close enough loans within the needed time frame to make a living due to faulty processing. Management seemed to be apathetic to the needs and concerns of loan officers, and focused solely on how many applications could be obtained. Morale and helping the LO's succeed was secondary at best."
bad,"Calls are everything. You must make calls on a consistent basis. You must SELL SELL SELL. There is no appreciation for when you do a good job, if you do a bad job they will be sure to let you know. Recognition for upper management is very limited. You have to be in the ""circle"" in order to get where you need to be. Aside from that, it's not a terrible company to work for."
bad,This is without a doubt the worst company I've ever worked for. My boss was horrible and the customers at my branch were so mean and rude. Please find somewhere else.
bad,The front end doesn't know what the back end is doing. Poor communication. No budget for any office supplies. Management was always in and out - high turnover. Awful experience. Worked at 5/3 for 3 years in the MOC.
bad,Nothing good very stressful work environment we kept having to do more with less and still produce at the same level it was not a fun place to be at the end
bad,"Good company to work for. Great coworkers and managers. Benefits are very good."
bad,"Good pay, but senior management highly focused on charging as much fees as possible, to be able to pay for the higher salaries.  Corporate not very concerned about offices in the smaller communities."
bad,"Regional manager has no respect for his employees. People are fired as if they are just a number. Our money from referels and quarterly bonus were cut, while our points needed to meet tellers monthly goals were raised.Customer service takes a back seat while pushing products is the main goal. Personal bankers are fired if they don't meet their monthly goals. No respect, and don't really care if you have a job or not. If you get a job here,,, don't be surprised if you loose it."
bad,"Pressured to lie to customers about products that they ""need"" to up your sales. If you do not meet sales goals they fire you. I was able to exceed my goals each month however the guilt I had about it was horrible."
bad,I have been told that if I say anything about what happened that I will have to give back the severence pay that I was given when I was laid off.
bad,"Culture of this company is not well defined. Compensation is excellent, however, technology, sales support staff, and middle to upper management are all sub-par. I worked here for 2 years and made a very nice living, but become frustrated with some of the sales tactics that began to be expected of me. I would not recommend this company to anyone!!"
bad,"I worked for fifth third before the national charter and the merger. Management cared about who they hired, had rules and cared about the well being and compensation of their agents. After the merger (because it was a fiscal dent in their funding) the quality of hires changed and so did 5/3rds standard. If you are a sales agent quit. You will never be able to get out of sales and management will make sure you're locked in, being a Cash cow with back to back calls until you burn out and quit. I work with people that either disappear after their 2 year mark or people that have been there 4 plus years because they can't get out."
bad,"There is a huge gap between the different locations of fifth third. If you are looking to make a career at fifth third you will need to be placed somewhere with a higher economic traffic. If you are placed in a low income area you will not do well with career advancements since raises/bonuses are based on clients money that you bring into the bank, and not based on the number of people you help with their credit or out of debt."
bad,"The culture of this place was horrible. My manager quit after 30 days on the job. Anytime you made an error it , they vilified you and made you feel horrible."
bad,"Hey Everyone :) If you are going to read any review... please make it this one.   Here is what you should expect.. "
bad,Constantly understaffed.  We were pressured to make sales with every single customer we interacted with.  Coworkers became cutthroat with the high pressure atmosphere.  I was constantly training new people and doing jobs that were not listed in job description
bad,No job security at all overworked & underpaid.  Mo loyalty to employees.  Will fire you after they have gotten all the work they need out of you.  Day to day work at office was nothing but stressful . Never told what you did good only that you have to work harder.  Don't recommend this company at all.
bad,Co-Workers are nice. Management was inconsistent. I learned to more about the banking industry and all the new changes. The hardest part of the job was working with management.
bad,"Fifth Third Bank values its profits more than its customers. If they can get away with charging their customers extra fees, they will. Management tries to find every possible way not to reverse fees because each branch needs to hit a revenue goal every month or they lose their jobs."
bad,Company Feeds you COOL Aid when you are the top producer they love you. But will only advance their little click. If you express your opionion they will find a way to let you go.
bad,You will spend more time fixing problems then selling. They have lofty goals that most personal bankers don't hit.
bad,"Fifth Third is a very results driven company. I would make the comparison of Fifth Third to the UPS commercial for the logistics of the Hail Mary, but the problem is there is no blocking, the QB is inaccurate and/or absent, and the receivers are completely out of position. So when it comes to results, they simply hammer the point home that they want to see them, but they have no game plan to get there."
bad,"Co-Workers were great, work/life balance was good and pay was decent. Management in my location was horrible, she always showed up late and left early causing us to be short staffed"
bad,"day to day banking job as any other. leadership changes very often, some good people in management, upper management is in constant flux. great opportunity to interact with clients and entry level employees."
bad,"I cannot speak about the entire bank, but the department I was in was very stressful and cut-throat. The work was easy and I enjoyed what I did. "
bad,Unbeliveble production focus - not the clients needs. High sales pressure and expectations like I never seen before. Poor higher management didn't really fully understand bank products and services.
bad,The job is fine but the management in retail banking is awful. They promote people to management based on their numbers and not their actual ability to manage other people.
bad,Very stressful and competitive. No team work. Benefits were awesome. Their cafe was really nice. Very diversified workers. Great facility. Parking was convenient.
bad,I love the branch manager the district manager is very rude harassed me while I was on leave back-office is a constant reminder that your job can you take it anytime the work-life balance is horrible and it has nothing to do with the branch manager because she has no work-life balance either their bonuses are terrible I am a top performer and maybe receive less than $100 that's not really a thank you
bad,Great place to work. Good environment and the benefits and the people you will meet will be long lasting relationships.
bad,I had a very very tough time there because I thought the training was complete
bad,"Diversity is only for phone positions. If you try to pursue anything off the phones, they will not help you get there. All of the departments that are higher up are all white men. And I’m sure that’s not changing anytime soon."
bad,"Be the puppet.    If you don't fit in your out.   Just like high school!  If your lucky you will get  manager that cares, but the minute the bank restructure you could be left out in the cold!"
bad,My worst job out of college. Pressure sales and no room for growth. I couldn't wait to leave. I would try to avoid this bank at any cost. Nobody that I knew works there anymore.
bad,This use to be a small town bank but grew to a huge company that only cares about the bottom line. Customer service is out the window and replaced by sales
bad,Fifth Third locations tend to be VERY busy and not well staffed at all. It is not uncommon to have lines across the lobby. I learned a great deal about basic transactions. I had a few great managers but overall management was not willing to be part of the team. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of this job was not being able to even get a break at times.
bad,terrible boss. Hr was horrible. Did not do a good job resolving the issue
bad,"The absolute only thing fifth third cares about is if you can sell. You can be the hardest working person in the world but fifth third won't care about you AT ALL if you can't sell. On the flip side you can be the laziest worker but as long as you sell you're good. So if your lazy and but like to sell things to people even if they don't need them and it's only gonna cost them money, this the company for you."
bad,"I was raised that if I have nothing positive to say then don't say it at all. So in my case;  I'd rather not write any comments at all. "
bad,Great opportunity for everyone to learn about every department. They welcome you to try new things. But very hard on you about sales and bank numbers being met.
bad,"I was on approved FMLA leave to take care of my daughter and I was terminated 2 days after my leave was approved. My manager had major anger issues, that I reported to HR and nothing was done about it. Ex, he smashed a stapler on the counter until is shattered. I had overtime and it wasn't allowed so he threw his water bottle across his desk. Again reported to Hr and nothing was done. bottle across his"
bad,"Awful management!!! I loved my job as personal banker.  Customers loved me because I cared for them and didnt push sales on them but unfortunately, it was a sales position and management did not care about customer service, just the branch profit and loss.  The three rivers branch has the absolute worst manager and customer service manager.  Branch managet micromanages everything, does not help if you have questions, is never at the branch, looks down on you, talks to you like you're an idiot, treats you like a child, and does not care about you or your well being unless you are making him money.  True corporate bull.  Dont work for this branch!!"
bad,"Banking experienced to have on file, good co workers team players, hardest was not much challenging and system was complicated, not quiet enjoyable"
bad,"My clients were the best part of the job."
bad,management changed over 4 times in my career at this bank.  The regional was fired twice and they still did not hire the right choice.  I was moved to 6 different branches and never was able to get a good foundation.  The goals changed twice in the past two years and they just did not know how to measure success.  They cleaned house and fired the entire branch twice for ethics infractions except for me.  This company in this particular market needs consistency not the continuing revolving door and poor hiring and leadership make the market share what it continues to be in this market at less than 3% this is not the same banking culture as it is in the Midwest.  They value short term sales and not developing long term relationships.
bad,I would say my almost 2 years was probably the most stressful time of my life between the unprofessional management to the never stopping revolving door of managers leaving. Unrealistic goals in today’s environment where traffic isn’t as high as it used to be because of the internet. Sell sell sell is the attitude & the customer doesn’t come first. Regardless of experience you are not fairly compensated & don’t be surprised if you are asked to help train your new manager that has zero banking experience or if your branch goes without a manger for months on end.
bad,"Way to much pressure for sales with zero training. The managers would consistently put employees down and hold ""meetings"" to discuss sales at the branch where they would do nothing but slam on the table, yell and cuss because goals were not being met. As a part time employee the hours you were scheduled were a direct reflection of the sales you got the week prior; lots of sales you would be scheduled 20+ hours, minimal sales you would be lucky to receive 10 hours. Frequently went without lunches or breaks, and zero room for advancement."
bad,Horrible place to work. Worked for consumer lending. Its a waste of time.
bad,Overall good place to work for. Lots of experience to learn from
bad,Great people....poor management. Does not Promote from within. Pushes products on people who don't need them. Does not have their customers best interest in mind.
bad,"I found working here a bad experience. I had come from another larger bank to work with Fifth Third. They have fees for most anything for the consumers. At one point we were making calls to close out accounts that were not being used that much and had a $50 or less balance. This was to ""save the bank money"". Those that can't keep the higher balances should not be leftout, Who knows they could have come into some money and that would mean Fifth Third would be the last place they would put their money because of the treatment."
bad,"The management was okay, but there you can’t share your opinions. They are so outdated it’s crazy and if you say anything about it they become offended. Overall some of the peolle you work with are okay but the company had okay benifits and vacation paid other then that your better working at another bank or a CU"
bad,"The great part was a lot of great employees. Made many friends there. Diversity went out the window with the company. Only certain ones got raises and promotions.Training was partial for what you have to know.You need to be ready to take calls one right after another for 8 to 9 hrs a day. You have to work nights, weekends and holidays.  All I heard when I asked a question was "" Go look it up"".Management never around when help was needed. Supervisors did not know too much more than a new associate. No morale and nothing done to help increase it.Could not call off if big winter storm or you would get docked for it."
bad,"Working for 5/3 bank was high-pressure sales rather than banking.  The sales incentive program was constantly changing to prevent you from attaining your goals.  Employees were required to sell a certain number of ""fee free"" credit cards per month and then had to explain to the customers why we started charging an annual fee six months later.  Fees, especially overdraft fees, were not to be refunded under any circumstances.  We were expected to squeeze every dime we could out of our customers.  The people who devised the schemes and enforced the rules were so far removed from the front line that they couldn't see the effects of their decisions on their employees and customers.  Turnover was high and employee morale was low.  I meet a lot of people in the industry who ""worked"" for 5/3 bank, but almost no one who ""works"" for 5/3 bank.  Generally, a hard place to work if you have a conscience."
bad,"I really enjoyed working with the people! I taught myself their new computer system (P2P).  I was promised after a few weeks on the job, the system would go live. Once it went live, their were some problems with the system."
bad,Work expectations are unclear and no formal training or direction is provided. Expectations/performance is measured with unattainable and unrealistic outcome. Goals and objective change daily/weekly/monthly.  Technical support is almost nonexistent and vendors complain daily about poor delivery systems.  Staffing changes daily due to high absenteeism.
bad,"Worked in the collections department, so I cannot speak for other sections of the bank. The collections department was a horrible place to work. The management played favorites and would even advise collectors to practice fraudulent methods of collecting from debtors. The management would let some people do whatever they wanted while disciplining others for minor issues. As long as you got them money, you were good. No matter how you did it. The pay offered was not in tune with qualifications and/or performance. They lowball you on your hourly rate, especially if you take into account all of the headaches you will endure from working here. Side Note: the bank is known within its own walls as Fee Third Bank. This is because you were always supposed to collect a fee, even if it was unreasonable at the time. Also, the fees were way too high priced. It was ridiculous."
bad,with the right management the job with be great !! neeeds better management
bad,"Respect and inclusion is non-existent. Customary two week notice from a top performing sales person was met with immediate dismissal, without pay."
bad,No concern for overwhelmed employees. Over worked and under paid.  Procedures are constantly changing.  Employees do not have empowerment to do anything without approval from management.
bad,Depending on your manager you will different opportunities. The policies aren’t enforced evenly across the board. Pay is good but even that isn’t across the board.
bad,"Sounded so amazing in the interview. I Should have known better! From the interview to training, we were told 8:30 A - 5/5:30 P for first shift with occasional overtime as needed. Perfect. (They also have a four 10 hour days option, mid-shift option, and a ""second shift"" option) After training was completed, I can count on both hands in 8 months working there how often that actually occurred."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Fifth Third, however, the training was not good at all and when I had a personal issue instead of assisting me in moving to a different building or dept they told me it was best to end my assignment."
bad,Management did not keep promised that were told to get you to come work.  Morning meetings everyday no matter if customer needed to meet at that moment.  Hardest part was being mislead about working in a branch. Difficult to get busy work done during day because branch manager wanted to continuously bring customers into your office without an appointment.  Enjoyed the most was being able to work from home or beach.
bad,At Fifth Third Bank you were required to do alot of work but was not fully compensated. They tell you that you can earn commission and then cap the amount you can earn.
bad,Very little room for earned advancement. Management is extremely gossipy. Company seemed to by cliquey. Job requires a lot of last minute branch transfers to help at other locations. Hours are not ideal. Tons of daily calls that are too long for a simple objective delivery.
bad,"management makes it incredibly difficult to do ones job...the higher ups continually come up with policies and procedures for the common worker to perform which puts obsticales in the way of the worker doing an effective job. The CE score weighs heavily on the workers performance card, which is not fair in the least."
bad,Not an enjoyable company to work for if you do not enjoy sales. It is a very sales driven company. Majority of your job depends on making outrageous goals for sales.
bad,It says it is about customer service. In actuality it is more of forcefully demanding money. I have excelled at customer service and received numerous awards. This is not customer service. This is borderline harassment. You are expected to call people sometimes 3 or 4 times a day everyday until they pay. Also you are expected to use threats to get paid. Having studied business and business ethics in college this is terrible business practices. I would only recommend this job if you do not care about what others problems are and are willing to sell your conscious for a paycheck.
bad,There was no commitment from the company to Georgia. Upper level management was not in tune with what was going on in the field which created a bad overall culture.
bad,I work for this company for 7 years and it was a miserable experience. There is no room for advancement/growth in this company and they have a high turnover.
bad,"When I was first hired my experience at Fifth Third was great, but in the last year management and co-workers have changed as well as the goal of the bank. The culture became very uncomfortable for employees. Management was very inexperienced dealing with people's needs and concerns, wish in return makes it very difficult to do a good job. With that being said building a relationship and bond with the customers is very enjoyable allowing you to feel as you are appreciated."
bad,under staffed.....over worked...very poor management of work environment....large turn over of staff
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of working with tellers at the branch and being able to interact with all of the customers.  I really enjoyed helping the customers with issues and doing what I could to help out.  I learned however, that I was not comfortable with the company ethics or the way the management was treated.  THis was not the right role for me."
bad,Huge turnover... many great concepts but terrible structure.
bad,"My thought is that 5/3 grew, and grew fast. Too fast for its own good. Truly the fact that employees were threatened with termination if they missed sales quotas one day of the month did not make for a very happy work environment. Plus the aggressive nature of selling never really allowed for paper work to be filled out accurately or filed appropriately. Unfortunate all around."
bad,Fifth Third Bank purchased First National Bank. The working environment was not worker friendly. There was indifference to existing First National Bank employees.
bad,"Racism and when I say this part it's not that they don't like certain race it's they are afraid to let someone go because of certain races so everyone around has to suffer, deception and no work ethic just to name a few. Just to let you know I worked at another bank for many years and I would NEVER say any of these things but they had no problem firing all of their personal bankers because of ""lack of performance"" well how about the lack of products and there are no reason for clients to come in to the branch."
bad,Many downsizing and overworking employees. tellers were expected to work by themselves and they were pressured to get referrals. pay compensation is low.
bad,"Depending on the department and your manager, 53 CAN BE a great place to work. I was there 4 years before things turned sour . My manager was patronizing and condescending and did so much to prevent me from advancing. It was clear that he and other managers didn’t care about us as employees"
bad,Every year we need to do more with less resources. Staffing is constantly being cut but goals keep increasing and meetings seem to be never ending and mostly waste of time.
bad,"Several levels of management and red tape for everything.  I had 7 bosses between me and the VP of the company.  They were great for taking credit and even receiving awards for what I was doing on a daily basis.  "
bad,"The management was all over the place.  My Manager in specific was a joke, we all would just look at each other everytime we had a team ¨huddle¨"" it was ridiculous.  "
bad,"Jacksonville market is a horrible representation of Fifth Third Bank.  No management structure, no accountability for management, they do what ever they feel like, leave branch understaffed to fend for themselves.  Horrible hiring decisions, bringing people in with zero experience, offering ineffective training.  The entire management structure at this bank needs to be replaced."
bad,"Days were long, no help. Running a lot of transactions and mainly alone. Did not receive any breaks, was told to eat on the line. Never had time to eat. Management promises to promote you, however even if you do nothing wrong, they still wont."
bad,Unbalanced workplace. Customer service helps the day. Understaffed banking centers. Lack of employee appreciation. Low annually raises. Good diversity employment environment. Opportunity to network within the company.
bad,"Company claimed high marks for family friendliness but I didn't find it to be so. Enjoyed the customers but high pressure for sales. "
bad,Management are exceeding because the share holders exceed a lot from the institution. I must say they have amazing training in my opinion. They provide proper tools for you to succeed.
bad,"This is not a bank you want to work for! The pay is bad. I've worked here 1 1/2 yrs and no raise! Unacceptable in my opinion. The expectations are never good enough, the bar continually moves. They say it's a ""home town"" bank and puts the community first. But the bottom line is Sales! You are not their type of worker if you don't have their numbers they want."
bad,other employees in the office take rank and don't give new employees the chance to advance.  A LOT of turnover.  One secretary in particular is awful.  Won't help each other out with work questions.  YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!!
bad,"Logged into the phones and assisted Loan Officers with issues they were having with the software. Also, performed password resets and Client Change of Request forms."
bad,Company goals changed from customer service to focusing on product pushing.  Bad management choices.  Worked shorthanded due to staff leaving because of performance pressure and unrealistic goals.  Used to be a great job but became a dread.
bad,"This location has an extremely hostile, tense and unwelcoming work environment and it shows in it's rapid turnover of staff. There has been a recent reconstruction of management that has resulted in unethical and unfair work practices. Sad when other local banks in the area hear the name Fifth Third Bank and automatically associate it with negativity. The staff who get appreciated and promoted at this location are the ones who are ""friends"" outside of work with the management or ones who perform unethical acts to get high sales. I would NEVER recommend working at this company, especially in Freeport, IL. There are plenty of other banks locally that would be a far better places to be affiliated with. Apply at your own risk... and don't say I didn't warn you!"
bad,Sr management needs to invest in training and systems.  The lack of front sided training leaves many MLOs under skilled.  Some are top notch but newer MLOs get little direction.
bad,Not much room for advancement when the opportunity was there. Managers were not very helpful or pleasant to work with.
bad,"It started out as a good company to work for until we got a new regional manager. He was THE king of unbroken promises. They claim they are very big on ""work/family balance"", definitely not. I got fired because I stayed home with my sick son. One of the worse banks I've ever worked for. If your family is your top priority, DON'T work here."
bad,"This place is a joke.  Even the management doesn't want to be there.  Don't waste your time unless you want to continually be passed up for advancement by another persons softball buddy or relative.  I'm not even bitter, just simply decided to move on once I realized how they handle things.  Salary is mid level, benefits were excellent, the idea of their company culture is excellent but not practiced by anyone.  If you need a job then apply.  If you have a job already stay put, you'll miss it later."
bad,• Provided customer service support on general banking needs.
bad,Co-workers and management are friendly. I have learned to work with customers as well as manage others. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.
bad,I learned a lot of information while working for Fifth Third
bad,"So they talk a good game anout Customers stayin in the Center, but in Reality All they care about is CRP Production! If Goals are not met u are micromanaged big time! Regional is always product pushin and doesn’t care to help in any way at all. If u dont have a loan its just ridiculous i feel pressured to get people to do things not in theirs beat interests just to make goal"
bad,Good luck with getting paid on time consistently. Payroll sucks there. It’s a shocking gamble getting paid every two weeks on time every time there.  And no one cares. Turn over is high too.
bad,"as a teller you don't make much money, but for this period of time in my life, it was ok just to have some money coming in every 2 weeks. This is a job for recent college grads."
bad,Very stressful and toxic atmosphere with high turnover which among the Implementation Dept. Spent an average of 50-60 hours to keep up with the pace and demand of the job. Overall poor leadership which lead to significant turnover amongst individual contributors and first line management.
bad,Managment is not held accountable. The company will use you so that they will remain understaffed and save money. Not a good experience in banking. One of the worst banks to work for.
bad,Management favors Caucasian males; leads only given to favorites. Very few females last more than a couple years in this role and unfair advantages given to men over females. Assigned territories but Executive Management doesn’t enforce them so anyone can take leads in your territory if they happen to meet a manager.  Females make up less than 1% of the Wealth Management Advisors.
bad,I honestly didn't really enjoy the work. I hate being forced to sell things that is what they ended up wanting us to do. I just wanted to help customers.
bad,They claim to hire and promote from within but when asked to be shown or taught something they brush you off.  Management is rarely there but doesn't allow you to use family/sick time.
bad,I worked in the loss mitigation department in MOB. Met some interesting people that worked in different departments. Facility was clean. A lot of people enjoy working there.
bad,I was only there for 3 months so I cannot competently write a review.  During the time I was there the processing and underwriting teams worked well together.
bad,My experience was minimal and in many ways bias being that it was my first job out of undergraduate. I learned some initial skills and preferences about myself personally and professionally.
bad,The continues organization changes at the bank makes one always feels insecure. I have been with the bank less than 2 years and been through 7 organization changes so far that impacted me personally.
bad,"No comments this company is closed; this section is redundant. "
bad,Expectations very high. No back end support.  expected to accomplish goals but with no support.  No treasury product teams and no customer service support.
bad,"Ok place to work if you're in a different market than HQ. Management in HQ is very political - you must be one of the ""in crowd"". Many managers take the credit and won't put in any work."
bad,This was a hometown bank that truly cared about its employees and customers.  Then a new CEO came in and turned the bank into an ugly corporate environment where money became all that mattered
bad,They are gearing towards a more sales oriented structure there but still holding onto the past and will not allow for a full sales structure.  Management plays a big role in your success by controlling your book of business and ability to go outside the branch to bring in new business.  most of the time you'll be behind a desk making calls until a client comes in.  Find a branch in a busy area not outside Charlotte.
bad,overall a good learning experience it was a peaceful environment to work with a group of people that worked together for the most part and I was able to gain some very important skills
bad,"Most days consisted of the branch manager attempting to get the staff ""excited"" about getting as many credit card and loan applications as possible. There was constant pressure put on tellers to ""recommend"" products to EVERY customer, and refusing to take no for an anser. Upper managment claimed they wanted to help customers improve their financial well being. What they really wanted was numbers. They wanted you to push credit cards down senior citizens throats, and take as many loan applications as possible even if it was not in the customers best intrest. Worst customer service from any bank. Managers arent even required to have financial industry backgrounds, or degrees. Training was decent, but after the training program you are on your own. If you need help and your manager doesnt know the answer, you have to call a 1-800 and wait on hold for anywhere between 5-30 min, all while the customer is sitting in front of you. The culture constantly felt like ""you arent doing enough""."
bad,"unachievable goals."
bad,Originally. 5/3 was a wonderful place to work but the pressure to sell products that clients did not need had an ethical ramification for me. I could not in good faith sell a product that had no value for the Client.
bad,"Limited loyalty to employees,  Good compensation, cut throat culture.  Workforce levels ebb and flow based on short term operating performance.  Pockets of good management."
bad,"Daily job tasks including review of pipeline management, productivity towards goals and initiating steps needed to help ensure all teams were on track. Review of daily tasks for each team with managers and indirectly support teams. Primary contact for escalation issues around the mortgage lending process. Other weekly responsibilities included oversight of Consumer Vendor relationships, Invoice Approval and weekly/monthly conferences with vendors. "
bad,"There was a great deal of turn over during my time at Fifth Third Bank.  Also, ever fall the company went through a massive layoff."
bad,Lots of job churn here.  They survived the bank downturn but the place has a reputation for being hard to tolerate more than a few years.  There are plenty of lifers though and the culture doesn't really reflect the stated intention of being professional and fair.
bad,"under staffed and poorly paid. also, you practically never get out on time. Hard to take off and advancement is very slow."
bad,"I liked working with people, but there was a lot of :selling"" of different products in the position that I did not realize would be apart of the job."
bad,This company unfortunately does not have the best employee experience of many banks to choose from.  Poor upper management and a lack of strategic sales forecasting has given the bank a less then reputable image to the public.
bad,possibility of advancement was not there...16 yrs very hard to move up very clicky
bad,"A good place to work if you like sales, not a good place for someone with a family our wants to go back to school for something other than banking."
bad,During my employment there as a Financial Center Manger there was 6 turnovers at the Regional managers level...that's says it all.
bad,Morale not great and lots of turnover.  Leadership is complex and unclear who to report to when things are in dismay.  Too many young partying people working there and not doing their jobs and missing work.
bad,"Fifth Third has been a great company, personally giving me the opportunity to advance my career."
bad,A typical day was telling people what their fees were and no we can not remove them.  I learned I do not want to bank with this company. Management pushed you to answer quickly.  Did not communciate with co workers too busy answering the phone.  The hardest part of the job was telling people they have no money.  The enjoyable part is letting people know that their lost credit card is blocked and no one used it to make purchases.
bad,Bad on support and advancement and pay is low for the work
bad,"I am a personal banker which is very sales driven. I have internal struggles every day between having integrity and getting the sale. In the sales division of a bank, you need to have no conscience and be able to sell people on things they don't really need on a daily basis. I am more focused on doing what is right for the customer which makes it very hard to reach an already steep monthly sales goal. My regional manager told me ""we are not in the business of employing people"". If you go a couple of months without hitting your goal, they will be happy to replace you. I am looking every day for a job that values me and rewards me for putting the customer first, because without them, there is no business."
bad,"taking incoming calls; learned operational skills, the management was out for themselves most of the time. We were a good group that worked hard together to get things done. The hardest part was being able to understand what each caller wanted and be able to help them. Enjoyable part was being a part of a team."
bad,"I work at a VERY small branch with literally only 3 co-workers (Lead Teller, Personal Banker, FCM) in a very small mountain community--population 935. Myself and the Lead Teller literally have to know how (and we do) to run the entire bank and perform every possible position that one would typically find at a bank. I absolutely love my customers and many have become personal friends outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job is problem solving customer account issues for there is a major lack of leadership and knowledgable management. The FCM will tell you to call the internal helpline, which will tell you one thing.. it won't work.. then you call another branch for help, they don't know.. you reach out to your RAMM and they tell you to follow procedures posted online which seem to never be updated, etc. It's also very frustrating when others (higher positions) don't follow through or pay attention to details and do their jobs properly because it all comes back to myself and the Lead Teller to fix everything."
bad,"Poor direcction, leadership and values because every emp is just a number."
bad,"One of the best parts of working at Fifth Third is their commitment to the communities they serve.  We were encouraged and supported to volunteer and to join organizations like Rotary, Int'l where we could impact our community and the world.  We took part in seasonal opportunities to connect with our communities as well, such as supporting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. events and activities.  We focused on providing much-needed financial education  on everything from basic bank accounts to understanding credit to preparing for homeownership to retirement."
bad,Company's strategy was not clear or visible to employees. Maybe it was because I was working as a contractor but I got the same feeling from the full time employees.
bad,This company was ok I really wouldn't recommend it because of the compensation and the work load. I would suggest looking elsewhere. I really hat that everyone is transitioning to universal banking.
bad,"After 15+ years I was laid off, I always received great yearly reviews and earned several awards for going above and beyond, I was laid off along with many other great employees, they are now hiring temp employees to do the work. I will never work there again."
bad,Fifth Third is a good place to start early in your career to learn.  There are limited resources for advancing.  There is a lot of red tape in getting anything approved such as classes or seminars. They often hire Managers with no direct experience.  My last Manager was an inexperienced Micromanager. The culture is good and they are very focused on diversity but tend to discriminate against older workers.  There is a great wellness rewards program and an onsite Café which is convenient.
bad,I worked for Fifth Third Bank for just over 5 years and my experience was overall positive.  I started in an entry level position and advanced to a supervisor roll within 3 years.  I was laid off after my department was merged with another.  Over my time there I observed several peers and colleges experience similar fates.
bad,"My overall experience was good. They have great benefits, it's a normal 8-5 full time job. Company staffing model is not so great so leaves most branches understaffed. Pay and compensation does the out weigh the excessive work load."
bad,"Management's respect for employees situational  at best, expected to be given to organization but was inconsistently returned."
bad,"It was ok, start off at Part time even with experience because they love to hire part time people.  Really focused on sales to customers.  They want you to cross sell and your job security depends on it."
bad,"Unless your willing to product push daily for points this is not the place for you. Company has a motto of doing what's right by the customer and putting the customer at the center of what we do, however, on weekly con calls you are told how the company needs you to push harder for Credit card app and loans etc and you are hounded by your manager in daily meetings on how you need to push more products on the few customers you actually sit with in the bank. This job environment is very hostile as well. It's kill or be killed and it leaves a lot of good people fearing for their jobs and doing a lot of illegal things just to keep their heads above water."
bad,"This job is a mix of customer service and collections. Multi-tasking is a must, as is a degree of comfort using multiple computer applications seamlessly and effectively."
bad,"Management at this establishment didn't fit well morally with my life values, but I created great work relationships and learned how to work with a variety of personality types!"
bad,"I moved to 5/3 from BOA, and I thought it would be much more respected due to the culture that 5/3 promotes.  Come to find out any position on the retail side of banking is an aggressive sales position.  As a personal banker, there was not a morning without criticism both work related and personal. There weren't many lunch hours taken without interruptions, and lets not forget the days with the famous 2 hours lunches and they required that we stay by the building.     "
bad,"I spent 8 months in the call center, which is longer than most. I worked second shift which came with a great shift premium, but truly eats up your day and makes it impossible to get things done. The banking policies aren't very customer friendly, so you will unfortunately deal with a lot of unhappy customers. If you are call center experienced and don't mind it, you will make GREAT money."
bad,"lots of restrictions and guidelines to follow, high expectations for cross selling and product pushing. I enjoyed the people I worked with the most."
bad,I worked in the call center.  You have to have a really strong backbone to be able to handle it.
bad,"you will usually be short staffed at any given time causing your day to be stressful. In a year and a half I had 4 manager, 3 branch managers and 3 district manager. You'll never advance when you have that much turnover because each one wants to see what you can do then they leave or get fired...then you have to start over. I liked my co-workers with out them I would have lost my mind. The hardest part of the job was buying in to it. You lose faith in your company and upper management. The BS that you have heard over and over. No mater how hard you and your team work you are never recognized or rewarded. The only enjoyable part was getting to know customers and being able to chit chat with them to make the day go buy."
bad,"Balancing my drawer, cashing checks for customers, helping them balance their check books."
bad,Is a good company to work for deceided to try soemthing different and try and finish school.
bad,Working on the collections team was interesting and I learned a lot. If you cannot handle people hanging up on you or cussing you out this is not the job for you. Hard work to get the money in but totally worth the work when it comes in and the monthly bonuses go out.
bad,"Really pushy with sells, Lots of cold calling, tele marketing. Really old system."
bad,"Constant increase in work-load and no compensation for it."
bad,"Strong teams have been built over time so there is a lot of knowledge in all areas. It is easy to reach out to other lines of business to share practices. Certain managers also understand the need for flexible schedules so if you are exempt, working remotely may be an option, though there are not formal rules around this."
bad,"I have been with 5/3 for over a year and a half now. Advancement has pretty much been IMPOSSIBLE. I have been trying to go full time for about 6+ months now with no luck. They have been eliminating so many positions lately its frustrating for advancement. To sum it up there arent many full time teller positions open and the ones that are, are Lead Teller spots. No matter how long you have been a part time teller and understand the ins and outs of the company you literally have no chance at getting the position. Let alone an interview. I have been loyal, learned from people above, hit my sales goals each month (%150+ each month) and nothing seems to work. Loyalty to this company means nothing and advancement is extremely rare. They rather hire people straight in then giving the employees who deserve it an actual chance. Managers at branches have been fine its the regional/""the pencil pushers"" that have been the issue when it comes to advancement. They don't take care of you at all what so ever even when you want to take on more. You are just a NUMBER here. If you want to get into banking its ok for getting your foot in the door but you should expect to leave for another bank after a year or 2 if you want actual growth in your career. You have no shot to prove yourself."
bad,"The workplace culture is unprofessional.  If the current senior manager did not hire you, your days were counted.  Management over promises and under delivers.  When you voice an opinion, if it does not coincide with your immediate manager's, there will be repercussions."
bad,"Its all about production point.  Meeting your daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly production goals.  Its all about how many loans, cc, new HH, deposits you produce.  They also keep track of how many calls, and sits (appointments) you make daily.  Very micro-managed to some degree.  However, they do provide quarterly training and allows a new hire to have a 2 months ramp up period to get themselves familiarized with the process."
bad,"Banks need to STOP the sales race.  This bank will be just like Wells Fargo soon.  They say ""helping our customers"" but that means ""sell them stuff"".    The Sr leaders in the Chicago market care about NOTHING but sales goals, they couldn't motivate a rat out of a paper bag. They create a horrible work environment with their micromanaging. They micromanage regional managers, FCM's, and even bankers. The worst place I have ever worked.  They are always looking for a way to cheat you out of pay too."
bad,"Good company to work for, but job work/life balance next to impossible.  Work 13 straight days, on average 10/hrs a day, off two, then back on for another 13.  Burned out."
bad,You will be a number. They say customer at the center of all they do but employee is not at the center. Limited loyalty to employees. Good benefits offered...
bad,"Working for this company was a complete nightmare. No good training programs, management is undereducated on banking services and products, over worked, not regular banking hours."
bad,"I have worked for Fifth Third Bank for 7 years.  I love the work I do as a Personal Banker, however, Fifth Third is a goal centered bank.  The goals are not set from the are of the bank they work in and the goals are set too high to be reached.  I believe if the customer is happy with your customer service, the customer will continue to come into the bank and they will continue to use the banks services.  Fifth Third does not appreciate good customer service.  The only concern is selling a product to every customer.  When the branch you work at is a small town, you see the same customers daily.  It is not fair to pressure these customers daily.  It is a ethical issue for me."
bad,"Fifth Third is a typical major bank. You have your little people who work very hard and take a lot of the customers' complaints but make very little money, and then you have your executives who never see the inside of a branch but make the majority of the money. Upper management pushes sales, even when the products and services don't make sense for the customer. They set impossible goals that makes life really stressful."
bad,"Although Fifth Third has become very strong financially, there is much that is left desired for the retail work force.  The bank promotes a culture of diversity and engagement.  However, the changes that have been instituted speak louder in the layoffs, reduced commissions, and coercion around supposed unbiased surveys."
bad,"Fifth Third Bank, like most all of the mortgage banking world is also struggling with the new federal guidelines. 5/3 Bank also, struggled with the operation centers and retaining their employees.  They had decided to down size their retail banking department and moved the operational center to Ohio and this created a bottle neck result of the pipelines taking months after months to process and close the mortgage loans with very little management support.  with the situation of support then if there was issues with a file the processing of that particular file was at a stand still.  Nothing was done and there was not an appropriate support team to move the file forward so therefore, the file never proceeded to closing."
bad,there is no room for advancement even though I am our most productive worker I was passed over for a promotion and it was given to someone who is hardly capable of handling their basic responsibilities.
bad,No valuing of employees. Employees do not feel appreciated even when they are working at their best.
bad,"•	Receive and Process Mortgage Application Fee Worksheets"
bad,"The people are great, and all my managers have been great. The pay is lower than what I would like it to be. I've seen many co-workers laid off. Job security is questionable."
bad,I felt that management just cared about selling product and being overly persistent with talking to customers about them.  High pressure and less focus on customer needs.
bad,"Its a typical call center"
bad,after a while gets bored and very little financial motivation. I would rather have more competent managers but if their compensation is low nothing much to expect.
bad,I was a CSR (customer service representative) and they only offered part time for that positon. I did not like working until 5 o clock when I had to work and I did not like that the hours were not consistant.
bad,If you are a minority worker you will do well. However women are not really treated well especially if you are over 40 years of age. Long hours and expectation of working over 55 hours week. If the staff is short you can expect to work your job and theirs for up to six months with no support. Branch manager positions left empty up to 18 months without being filled. Staff was chosen by head of Retail and the branches in Tampa were inadequately staffed with only 2 or 3 people in branch at any given time. Very disappointing that a large corporation treated staff as they did.
bad,"I worked at many offices in my time at 5/3. High sales pressure with low salaries. Always worried about being fired for not hitting your goals monthly. Difficult industry where most people do not need to come to a bank anymore to do their banking. Upper mgmt achieved their positions in a time where there were little regulations, lending criteria was a joke,  and there was no online banking. The personal banker position was a decently paid job until they hired 3 per  branch and diluted the bonuses from $2k per qtr to $400."
bad,The best part of this job was some of the good people that I worked with.
bad,It was clear to me from the 3 months that I spent with this bank in their downtown Tampa location that my superiors did not have a clue as to establishing quality business relationships. I worked in commercial real estate lending and presented them with quality business that could have been a good long term relationship building experience. Instead they berated business on investment real estate with strong sponsorship. The single tenant is a quality publicly traded company. I looked at the deal FIVE years after they had declined it and that deal is going and blowing and not even a hitch.
bad,Required to sit and troubleshoot atm's over the phone w/various bank tellers/merchants
bad,The company's expections were unreasonable because you could not work at a comfortable pace to avoid making errors in the system. They focused more on quantity rather than quality. Because of this the working environment was very stressful and dissatisfying. Was not a good place to work in my opinion.
bad,Unfair is the only word to describe fifth third. They don't take accountability for their actions. Manager had his pick and it was so obvious. The training was a set up for failure.
bad,"People get their positions by going all out brown noser.  Calls are back to back and there is little appreciation for those on the phones.  Management walks around clapping at you for showing up to work a full month instead of some type of actual reward.  If you have done something fantastic you get an email from your boss, everyone is not made aware of it.  2 -15min. breaks and a 1/2 hr for lunch is pathetic when you have back to back calls for 3 hrs straight.  Everyone quits due to the environment.  So much room for improvement, nobody listens."
bad,Poor leadership and training. Old technology and support. Large turnover of employees. False promises and development. Lots of paperwork that was redundant.
bad,"I was employed to this job through Adecco. The job management and the job itself was...sloppy, to put it nicely. I worked the phones making outbound calls to customer and receiving inbound calls from them for the mortgage modification program HAMP. Noting the Fiserv system was pretty simple and straightforward and logging the calls made in Microsoft Excel wasn't hard either. The problems I faced with this job was the organization or lack thereof. Things constantly changed at the drop of the dime with next to no warning and the workload greatly increased to overwhelming numbers all the while management complaining about our workloads. By ""our"" I can only refer to my co-workers, whom I didn't want to be around at all. There were too many gossipers and instigators here at this place which made working here uncomfortable. There was nothing too difficult about the job except some of the irate customers and while the job sucked I did enjoy the hours, pay, and location. The job was only a minute from were I used to live."
bad,"I think that the department would have been better if the management was not so narrow minded, and old minded. Some of the people that worked in the department went along with management so that they would not get displicined for associating with me. Just a hostile environment and they (management) did everything they could to make me quit the position."
bad,"Started out great, until the CEO retired. His replacement systematically started making decisions that conflicted with my moral compass. the short version is, the new culture specifically catered to the bonuses of corporate level employees and majority shareholders, at the expense of branch level employee and customers. I moved my personal accounts out of there a year before I left the job."
bad,Having the ability to know whats expected of you and to also have a team that have the same focus. I also is a place that if you learn more the better you can grow
bad,I was the top banker in my region when I left the bank. That wasn't good enough for my manager. I was on pace 200% to reach my goal for that month. She still wanted more and more from me and made me cry almost daily. She was not suited for a management position.
bad,Nice co-workers and customers...referral policies are unrealistic for area and customer base. Need to worry more about customer service and less on selling.
bad,"I was a very hard worker and excelled from the start. I started out as a part-time teller and within 3 years I was a full-time teller supervisor. I was told when I was moving to another branch and was at 4 branches in less than 3 years even when I didn't want to move. They moved people around when it was convenient for them and they lost a lot of great employees due to this. The pay wasn't very competitive and the incentive program was minimal. When I had to work long hours, they did not allow overtime so it was common I would have to take anywhere from a 30-minute lunch to 2 hours on any given day."
bad,"It is hard to move around the company. If you are coming into the banking industry, the only way to be compensated is to jump banks. The company does good community work"
bad,I was employed PT with 5/3.  My opportunities for growth were hindered by my job location.  Every attempt I made to change positions I was denied.  It seems 5/3 is all about promoting youth but the older employees are there to even out the numbers.
bad,If you enjoy sitting all day every day this is the job for you. It's easy but not very exciting. I did how ever learn how to better manage my money through the training process
bad,"•	Developed a new claims QC position to mitigate audit corrections within the claims submissions guidelines, key in developing the check-sheet process, saving 25% of unpaid claim expenses."
bad,Fifth Third was not very honest with their employees or their customers.  The environment was very face paced and multi-tasking was a must.  it was fun to see the regular customers and create a connection with them
bad,Bank culture.  Must wear your pin.  Lots of money spent but not a lot of ROI.  No clear business plan.  Lots of overlap without real accountability.
bad,"I handle an average of 140 calls per day in the queue for preferred banking, mortgage. installment loans, demand deposit account, Auto-Bill Payer ABP for automatic ACH deduction to pay on other banking products."
bad,"night drop deposits"
bad,Very fast paced job enjoyable for outgoing organized person.
bad,No assistance or training for position. Was left ot work and learn new computer systems alone.
bad,"At first I was full of energy and pride knowing that I worked for a company that would help me promote, develop and have a sense of professionalism. After three years I have been subjected to cruel politics with a manager, being overlooked for promotional positions after asking me to go above and beyond my position (which was done with no complaints), and unfair and puzzling treatments for harassment and other HR instances. At the end of my career with Fifth Third I have learned much about the corporate world and wish to not engage in an environment such as that."
bad,Never received my last paycheck because they changed systems. HR is not helpful in any way. Customers were always pretty easy to deal with. My manager was great about helping me as much as he could.
bad,"Promised extensive training, they couldn't get organized enough to get it done. A lot of turnover."
bad,In my job I have to be proficient in MS office and have excellent communication skills. 4 employees report to me on daily basis regarding their day.
bad,"job isn't great, pay very low for expectations. Acted like our job was very important but was not treated as such"
bad,"They enamored me when I first started working at the Bank, the culture, the environment, the people. Everything was stellar. However, such is not the case once you are out of training. I do currently work as a CSR and I can say that this job is not what they present to you during interviews and training. I have little to no interaction with management, heck, I’m afraid to even go up to my manager and talk to her. Upper management likes to separate themselves as them and then us, to minuscule to be cared for. I’ve had constant issues where I do not feel comfortable going to my direct manager or upper manager. There’s only HR to go to and unfortunately you cannot find HR in this building. You’re forced to call a number, leave a voicemail, and hope you’ll get a callback. I love the job. I truly do. I love my customers but when management is poor, it makes you want to run for the hills."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here the management is never available when you need assistance... Not a very friendly environment. I wouldn't work here if you are looking.
good,I was promised certain job characteristics that were not fulfilled. Required purchase of company store marketing pieces out of already very low compensation.
good,Fifth Third is an affiliate company that operates in several different states but headquartered in Ohio. Affiliates and corporate are not on one accord and there is no consistency in the management of the bank from HR to Transactional Processes at the branch level.
good,"Being a teller  We also were put on notice we had to cross sell items honored by our bank, management was very nice and helpful.The hardest part was trying to meet the criteria month to month. Not very enjoyable at all."
good,Maybe it was my group or position but I did not feel valued as an employee.  My coworkers made it a great place to work. Not sure what else to say.
good,"The staff was friendly, but there is a lack of organization within the collections department. The customers are very rude and will say inappropriate things to you. The best part of the job was the free lunch and parties."
good,"The typical dynamic of Fifth Third is an environment that takes additional care when managing a work/life balance. A typical work day would consist of working towards meeting service goals and assisting customers in their banking need. Dedication and effective time managerial skills can be taken away from their customer service department. Managerial staff works hard to work with employees to meet their service level goals. Working with members and assisting them in their needs is a difficult task with the high standards set in place. Guidelines are strict not allowing for employee empowerment or best judgement. "
good,• Responsible for performing banking duties and overseeing the financial operational activities for personal accounts.
good,Banking is not for the faint of heart. It is cut-throat and highly stressful. The compensation rarely meets the demands of the job. Bankers hours are not what you think they are.
good,a bank is a bank when your working as a teller. constantly being reminded of goals and sales. more worried about sales than the actual customer needs.
good,"I worked as a temp. in a dept. at Fifth Third Bank, in Grand rapids, MI."
good,I did not like that I was going to be in the same position for a very long time before finding something full-time or apply for a different position. A
good,ok company long drive management needs work - this company is not for me.  It is a good company but management needs improvement.  I am looking for something closer to home
good,"I have only been here for a few months therefore I cannot give an honest assessment. However from what I can see, if you work hard your work will not go in vain. A typical day at work you must try to achieve your target goals ever day"
good,Expect to make at least 25 to 30 cold calls per day. Pushed to get clients into credit products they don't need by continually refinancing the same unsecured debt over and over. Most clients have at least credit cards. They don't need them or even use them!
good,You bust your butt to get no type of recognition or appreciation while the people who stretch the truth and lie get all of the glory they don't deserve.  Management is joke half of these people wouldn't know how to be professional if they sat through a year of training dedicated to just that.
good,Company is male dominated in Central Florida and there is little to no opportunity for advancement
good,"The company use to be an excellent place to work, however it became laced with politics and internal promotion was a thing of the past. Leadership within the organization is poor."
good,"You get paid on time, but the culture was terrible.  Little room for advancement."
good,Too many boss they send Technology  80% work to outsource .I do believe they should offer these jobs to local people .
good,"I have worked for a bank before, as well as at a different branch for Fifth Third Bank. The comparisons, in my opinion, are astounding. This company claims to be ethical and all about providing customers with benefits and solutions, when all I have seen is selling for personal gain and company growth. Aside from the unprofessional work setting I deal with every day, the service Fifth Third Bank is providing consumers is anytihng but ethical. My branch manager is known to tell customers that we offer checking account 'packages,' meaning that they need to open a savings account as well as apply for a credit card. As far as the unprofessionalism going on, I feel like I am back in high school with a bunch of 17 year old girls. All day they talk bad about eachother, and even customers. I have never worked in such an uncomfortable work environment."
good,"It was unfortunate because I always wanted to learn more, yet everything was given to the banker when small things could have been resolved if they'd teach and train us more things such as: over draft fees, opening a small savings account or just getting 2 forms of id and trying to start opening a dda so they arent waiting for a banker for a long time."
good,"All about the recent sales, no concern for people.  Good pay and benefits.  Very long work hours.  often 12 hours per day.  Modern computer system.  Good products"
good,Had very little staff so as a manager I was stuck in the branch 10 to 12 a day preforming all functions and unable to do business development. Still held accountable for all numbers and all the managers received 15-20 emails A DAY to update our regional manager about any matrix sales! Could not get rid of very poor performers and or very problematic employees!
good,I do not feel comfortable sharing this information at this time due to my ongoing job search efforts.  The overall ratings should speak for themselves.  Thank you.
good,"if you want to work for a bank know that it is all sales thats pretty much it.  i didnt like it so it wasnt a right fit for me, but lots of opportunities for advancement"
good,"Workload is easy. Training is tedious, and if you have a micromanager you are in for a stressful time. Job restructures happen often, and you are pushed into a role you may not want."
good,"Typical collection job,  learned a lot about finance and collection laws....Management for the most part are good. Human resources not good at all. In order to go to any different department. the manger has to contact HR or hr will not interview you at all. the collection part."
good,"Very unprofessional culture, lots of bad hires, and poor leadership in the georgia market. Will apply a change without proper education to employees.."
good,"constantly pushing you past your abilities and the management is awful. they make lots of promises and then set you up for failure. high turn around rate, no one sticks around."
good,"Typical day would consisted of taking deposits, making withdrawals. Answering questions about transaction history. I learned a lot about the banking industry since this was my first banking job. My supervisor was great, she had been with the company for years. The branch manager was dry and not approachable. My co-workers were great, I built long lasting relationships with them. The most difficult part of my job was the high sales goals. The most enjoyable part was working with my team, they were all a lot of fun."
good,"Would have liked to continue there, but was through temp agency, Adecco, who would not offer me a position after contract was up.  Had to go on my own to find a new job so I was left without one.  They just kept telling to work out my contract and they would find something  I could not accept that; I need to work"
good,"My typical day at Fifth Third Bank involves meeting with customers and assisting them with their entire financial needs.  I assisted clients with their lending needs via personal loans, credit cards, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit.  I assisted clients with their banking needs with checking and savings accounts.  I assisted clients with their investment needs with CD's, diversified mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, insurance solutions, and managed account programs."
good,Some CoWorkers at my Branch's were real Team Players and followed the One Bank theme.
good,"Management could use some diversity."
good,"The benefits are in line with what others offer which is a plus however there isn't anything special about FITB Chicago. The company spreads their sales staff in multiple directions which causes nothing but confusion as you are expected to contribute towards the growth of all lines of business from retail banking, consumer lending, credit card processing, payroll management, insurance/investment revenue, and new DDA/Household Acquisition as a licensed banker where as at a competitor you only focus on producing investment revenue. This is a highly micro-managed environment with limited opportunities for growth outside of retail since the company is no longer in growth mode locally."
good,"The company in general is excellent, but the Charlotte, NC uptown corporate hub is very numbers driven.They allow AE, and managers to speak to you in any manner. The processor's pipeline size is based on who is friends with the manager, and is not evenly balanced. For example some people had 150-200 loans in their pipeline, where others barely had 20. Managers come and go like the seasons. Very high turnover ratio wth employees and managers."
good,"The good thing is that I bank through Fifth Third and I have never had issues with banking"
good,"High stress, little support from management, not fairly compensated for the amount of work given. High pressure sales, little coaching, no individuality allowed as far as tactics. Sales calls are made daily, 20-30 cold calls required daily."
good,"A typical work day would involve scheduled meetings, phone calls, sometimes you'd have walk in meetings. The day to day to seem to change a lot."
good,"My tenure at FifthThird was for a number of years, prior to this facility/operation being acquired by FifthThird. It was an extremely stressful company which is probably due to the acquisition of the company."
good,"The supervisor was constantly sick and never around to answer questions. The company had terrible mortgage programs, and the processing was horrible. It would take 60 days to close a streamline mortgage loan."
good,no but no and no no no no non boo foot no hi there how are you will you not ask me this no thanks how is it going great happy to help see you later thanks
good,Management is not great. i was told i would be close to home and i am driving 45 min away just to get to work. Sometimes it takes me an hour to get home. Management also doesn't know how to speak to employees
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a stable company in the Cincinnati area to work for.  The pay, benefits, etc are typical for banking in this area.  There are so many areas within the bank, everyone can find a job."
good,"Too many changes, many quality people are lleaving, not comfortable with the direction, No CMO to guide marketing and advertising teams.  HR has created more walls."
good,"Locally, this is a great company.  The people are dedicated and professional.  However, the corporate culture is focussed so much on sales that they disregard the importance of support functions, even more with the current CEO.  They do not encourage remote work, viewing it as more of an excuse to not work hard.  This also keys in to most advancement opportunities.  If you're not in the corporate headquarters, your growth in non-sales areas is very limited."
good,"This job has pros and cons. On the upside, you have the opportunity to help people (when the bank's criteria allow) and you yourself will gain a strong understanding of financial awareness and how to better your own life with what you learn. Upper management will not appreciate your efforts but instead will just ask for more. When giving ""merit based raises"", being on the top tier will earn you an increase less than the average cost of living increase, effectively netting you less than the previous year."
good,"a typical day involved fielding customer issues and selling bank products.  When I started at Fifth Third it was more dealing with customers to find the right products that fit their needs however, as my time there progressed it became more of a sales environment, geared toward making any sale rather than the right sale for the customer.  I would not work there again for this reason."
good,"Although the company was great to work for a majority of the time,  the demands that they put on their Personal Bankers was out of this world.  I preformed a majority of the manager's duties as well as picked up the slack of another personal banker in my office.   Was never recognized for any of it.  My customers were the reason that I went in everyday not the work environment.  They have core values but when it comes right down to it,  their values are numbers and profit not work ethic."
good,"A typical day involved responding to customer concerns in regards to balance issues with checking or savings accounts, password and payee issues with online banking, and issues associated with credit cards."
good,"Processed night drop deposits, took customer transactions and made sure they were processed correctly, assisted with the weekly balancing and refilling of the ATM. Branch manager and assistant branch manager very easy to work with as were the other tellers. Really wasn't anything too hard but I truly did enjoy building relationships with the customers."
good,Ok place to work - travel agent business.  Did a lot of custmer service and enjoyed working with people..
good,"Working at a branch can be challenging at times. Goals are set to be difficult to obtain, especially when relying on referrals from workers who are not your direct reports. I gained a lot of experience dealing with people and the touchy subject of their finances. The most enjoyable part is when you can help someone manage their money in a fashion that is more beneficial to them, usually by consolidating debt or showing them more options for planning for the future."
good,It doesn't matter what kind of time you put in or the sales goals you continually exceed.  No matter how hard you work or how long you've been with the company; it's all about the pedigree or who you know.  It's a shame!!!
good,Managing underwriting pipeline.  Lots of opportunity to volunteer for projects.  Systems need upgrades
good,This was the worst job I had my entire life.  Be ready to cold call for at least 5 hrs per day.
good,A typical day would be great at work I would go in set my desk up and do my daily job duties all a while listening to music I learned that everyday you have to be your best at what you do management was great they would show concern as to how's your day how's your weekend co-worker a blast great friend to work with the hardest part of the job is you having to do your now matter if friend are not and the most enjoyable part of the job WE were a Team.
good,"My position was looked at as the blue collar workers of the company and we were basically treated like that. If we didn't like it, we could quit. It was easy to replace us"
good,Fast track to middle management. No advancement as all potential jobs that would be considered promotions are only given to external candidates
good,"I liked working for the organization and thought that they were very focused on the customer, stockholder, employee, and off-shore resources. It was a good place to work, from an IT standpoint. There were many interesting technical projects that were on going during my time there."
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a good  company to work for. Their management team  are incompetent and unfair to their employees, especially their minority employees."
good,I don’t like forcing people to get a product they don’t need or i don’t fee will benefit them . I enjoyed my work as far as being head teller and mainly a manager assistant however I wasn’t being treated fair.
good,"The job was great when we were building relationships and selling the customers products they needed or would benefit them. Then it changes to a sales only job, sell every customer even if they do not need or want the product. There were customers with 10 savings accounts with the minimum deposit and no activity  the customers didn’t even know they had them and credit card applications they were tricked into getting"
good,Competitive corporate culture internally.  Monthly scorecards made public to all officers during monthly meetings.  Very sales driven culture but provided lucrative bonus potential.
good,This was a late evening position that taught me a lot about checks and balances.The management was good. Great work environment. Hardest part of the job was working such late hours. The most enjoyable time was having fun with co workers on our breaks.
good,Was good place to work for an individual but not for a female manager. There is a lot of unconscious bias toward male management and against female management.
good,Management does not appreciate nor entertain any suggestions regarding changes or efficiency suggestions regardless of the fact that productivity could improve.
good,"Loved the type of work,the hours,the customers, management at my branch was awful"
good,Leadership had not had an opportunity to bring stability and direction to division due to number of continued reorganizations over the last 3 -4 years.
good,"Individuals interested in Financial Services within Retail Banking, Commercial Wealth, and other Financial Service expertise have opportunities available."
good,Fast Paced Environment that requires multitasking multiple projects and other tasks. Management is the luck of the draw. You could get a laid back manager that doesn't pay attention to your work as long as it doesn't affect them or you could get a micro manager that doesn't trust you to do the job. Yearly reviews are not based on the projects you have accomplished. You are ranked amongst your peers and where you rank reflects your review. Perception is reality. The hardest part working for this company is the politics within the groups. The most enjoyable part was solving problems and the satisfaction of completing projects that bring value.
good,"When I first started there I had to go to training for about a month before I was placed at my permanent branch. I really liked the people I first started working with. However as time goes on, people get promoted and move on. In banking, I did not realize how competitive it was in regards to sales. In the less than 3 years I was employed there I had 5 managers. This may have been due to my branch location. However, it was difficult to have that many managers in such a short time. Each one was different in their own ways, some good and some bad. Customers repeatedly said I was the only constant and liked I was still there. I do miss a lot of my customers I would see on a day to day basis. "
good,Was an nice environment  would return back if possible. Would recommend to other people. Was very close to home was very convenient having to get there
good,The company is a good company if they get the right management. The problem is it doesn't seem like they do. They are very involved in the community which is nice.
good,Did not enjoy the job at all. I informed them when they called me that I did not apply for that job and was not interested but they still wanted to interview me. My co-workers and management team were very nice and helpful along the way.
good,"It is a good place to work and a nice location downtown."
good,Few IT people are promoted.  Most IT management comes from outside the company.  This sends a message of little to no opportunity as few internal candidates are considered.
good,"Decreasing number of employees and increasing levels of responsibility. Management isn't great depending what branch your located in. As long as you are willing to work you'll get the job. Advancement is available, but increase in pay isn't. Everything is going virtual and there will pretty soon be people just thrown in to their position."
good,"Unable to take vacation, attend to family events do to lack and reduced staffing and increased responsibilities in the financial center. Unable to retain employees due to increased responsibilities, ie. processing own proofwork vs sending with a courier and monthly audit responsibilities with reduced staffing levels."
good,"The company seemed to be very dedicated to educating employees on banking, and operations. My branch experience was horrible. The Manager wasn't strong relating to employees or customers and did not take up for employees at all."
good,The management was very incompetent. There was a high turnover of employees. Sales goals were unrealistic considering the products that were offered to customers.
good,"Bank is very internally focused and not clear on it's direction.  States one direction but ends up on a different path.  The company has ""downsized"" several times in the last 3 years and other than expense reduction has had no real other clear motives."
good,utilized existing tenured managers to oversee massive culture and process change Bancorp wide.  Not good change agents. Good location downtown cincinnati.
good,"In some departments Fifth Third doesn't do a great job of financially rewarding their top performers. Lots of unkept verbal promises, specifically in the operations fields."
good,Fifth Third Bank has a bad reputation of being a very nepotism style of a work place. You learn alot about the finance business but leaves bad taste in your mouth. Management is sub par upper and your area manager.
good,"The main problem with my job was not the pay, nor the actual duties. My issue was that upper management dismissed two positions within an already small crew, and when the management quit, a replacement was not selected for months."
good,"In my experience at 5/3, I felt that the I.T. department was a necessary means to an end, and we were treated as such.  The long, long, long hours were not recognized outside of I.T. and the corporate bankers culture made it difficult to feel valued.  There was plenty of opportunity to move around within the company, which for some was a prime motivator, but for techies, it felt like there were limited opportunities to try new things and experience new technologies."
good,I learned a lot about the financial industry and banking. I thought management could do a better job in assisting employees on there career tracks. I also feel that the pay could be better.
good,The teamwork efforts in individual groups is awesome. The hardest part of job is leaving the company.The company is not for the faint of heart. You must be a independent thinker in order to be successful.
good,"This was by far the most difficult role I have ever had; however, I learned a lot in a short amount of time. There were long hours and very dedicated workers who believed in the culture and brand of 5/3rd. The conservative practice of this bank has allowed it to be successful and fiscally responsible. This was my first management position and i would not have changed anything about it. The training and mentorship opportunities offered are very rare. Working in Cincinnati was a better experience because of the corporate influence via headquarters."
good,"Fifth Third does not value it's loyal, long term employees."
good,I love working at Fifth Third Bank. It's an fun and fast paced environment. Ample opportunity for growth.
good,This employer needs a lot more help with their people skills and their training of new employees.Management is a joke there.
good,"Fifth Third Bank is your average large corporation. In my particular area, I was expected to put in extra hours without being paid, which led to my resignation from my position."
good,5/3 Bank I felt cared more about getting people to buy a product than providing top notch customer service and doing what is best for the customer. Fellow employees were quite enjoyable to work with.
good,"A typical day at work was filled with responsibilities and tasks that were seemingly never-ending, as one person is fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of at least 3 different positions."
good,Nice place to work if you can deal with management promising one thing and but then doing something else. Loved my manager. Other managers before she came along seem to not care about the individuals. Certain individuals seem to have or receive special treatment.
good,"Good job. Okay environment. hard to advance in some company areas.  "
good,"I enjoyed working with customers. The work environment was difficult. Highly competitive and management was critical and demeaning."
good,I was at 53 for 23 years. There were a lot of good times with coworkers. I had several exemplary managers. These probably outweighed the bad ones. But the bad ones were really bad. I was able to outlast most of them because my skills were recognized and valued. Then we had a major reorganization in our area and I was effectively demoted while being told I was making a lateral move. I wasn't consulted and the overall performance of the software I developed suffered because of it. Not because I am a top 5 developer but because there were only 2 developer on a system that would normally have 6 or 7 for its size. They moved me and then there was a single developer who became responsible for 3 different systems.
good,I enjoyed the job itself and had no issues with the company itself but from day 1 I felt that management was not concerned with my development or performance. there was also a major lack or team work.
good,While they say that they are a company who likes to promote from within it was hardly the case. more than twice I was overlooked for a position I qualified as they chose an outside hire.
good,"Good co workers but management won’t let you get a word in, treat you very low. The pay was not competitive, they under paid for the positions. Also technology isn’t up to date or facilities based on their size. Overall they have a very high turn over rate. Save yourself and find a better place to work."
good,"The continued buy-out mode created an unsteady work environment.  Employees were unsure who would stay or be replaced with each acquisition."
good,"What you think happens in a bank, happens in a bank."
good,Fifth Third expected you to always be on the job. Always be selling. Handing out business cards on personal time. Opening accounts in family members and friends names.
good,"My biggest issue with Fifth Third is that I had all of the tools needed to work remotely, but being able to work remotely is solely up to the manager.  My managers were not willing to work with me to allow me to take care of my family and to do my job.  I'm a single mom of two that benefits greatly by working remotely.  I'm able to take care of my family and get my job done."
good,The current management has taken the BRANCH in a downward spiral. The turn around of employees that has quit due to it is very sad and the customers are not happy about it either.
good,"This is a great consumer bank. They have morals set on making the customer experience the best. Although, I do not feel as an employee that I was valued or needed. If you are not a bank manager or higher, you are treated like a temporary employee. Especially the CSR's. There is not much room for growth in this company."
good,"Fifth Third is a great place for an entry level job, but the career advancement opportunities are limited. If you are not in training programs, it is very difficult to learn about other opportunities within the bank."
good,"When I was at the bank, they were experiencing tremendous growth, mainly through acquisitions.  As they quickly grew into one of the largest banks in the country. There were a lot of growing pains.  The older management style could not keep pace being a larger player in the banking industry.  They had grown too big, too fast.  A lot of issues began catching up with them around the time I left."
good,Fun at times but the machines would not run half the time so it can be frustrating. Oh no windows to the outside world so that was a major down fall for me. but its a nice place to work for the most part. I just couldn't handle the racist black people their. It was the weirdest thing I've encountered in may life time. So I left.
good,"Great company to work for. Unfortunately, the pay is not great even after being an employee for almost a decade it was still hard to get ends to meet."
good,"This Job taught me integrity, and how to often keep my mouth shut. There were a lot of racist/turnover comments that were said at the branch I worked at."
good,I worked a collections position for this company. The base pay was low and the hours are not flexible for those who have children and families. This was not a good fit for me.
good,"Fellow employees were praised on how well they did, but would do anything to get it. This included ""taking"" other's customers. I felt like, perhaps it was just the branch I was at, was very clicky."
good,"Generally employees don't enjoy their work environment, there seems to be a lot of tension in the air with somewhat of a ""gotcha"" mentality as an under current."
good,There is not enough people working for the volume of traffic our branch has and to do everything they expect you to do. They will not hire anyone to accommodate the needs we have. It’s bull
good,The people are nice for the most part.  There is a difference working downtown and working in Madisonville.  I feel they look down on you if you work in Madisonville.  It is a nice area to work in.
good,"Midwest bank looking to grow other aspects of its business, very focused on growth. The bank has brought on new leadership which has completely changed the culture. The biggest issue is the constant change that continues to take place every year."
good,while working there I got a great insight into the banking business and it was a real eye opener. manager was located in another city and had review in restaurant. :(
good,I hardly ever enjoyed my experience with Fifth Third. Advancement was low within the company. The product change was too frequent and left pressure on more entry level employees without enough coaching.
good,"From a retail perspective, what you see is what you get.  If you are at all an independent thinker, or have any desire to innovate the world around you (or maximize your own personal sales commission) do yourself a favor and work in another industry entirely.  The turnover for retail banking is 6 months on average and for good reason.  If you are a student fresh out of school, please consider waiting for another opportunity.  This place has almost sucked the life out of me and it's not their fault, it's mine.  This industry is for people who cannot create for themselves, enjoy following corporate structure and likely will always be somebody's workhorse without fair compensation."
good,"Branch manager responsible for the office profitability."
good,Overworked and underpaid for the size of the company. Bonuses are near impossible to hit. 8-5pm Monday thru Friday is a normal day.
good,Nice environment to work in but stressful handling large amounts of cash daily. At one point I was held at gunpoint and robbed. I was part time but was offered more hours if I was willing to travel to other branches and help out.
good,Good place to work.  Very formal business environment.  Good pay and work/life balance.  Lines of business sometime don't work well together.  Management team could use some improvement
good,good money good people. Fun place to work and grow but unless you play corporate games and make a personal friend in management there is really no opportunity for advancement.
good,"A very professional and slow paced atmosphere Although, some flexibility is allowed, the schedule is centered around baking hours. Which, has it's ups and down when working with the public. You must be self sufficient and independent. Management does not provide a lot of direction or support."
good,"Most days were easy, cash handling and interacting with customers was wonderful."
good,ok place to work den.pending on the dept you're in. Lots of paid holidays.
good,This Fifth Third experience gave me tools that I did not have before and increase my exposure to the Dayton Market.
good,"After working for Fifth Third Bank for over 6 years I am completely confident expressing my dissatisfaction in the way upper management is running the Customer Service Aspects of the company. 11 of my colleagues were demoted simply because there was not enough basic customer service employee coverage for the 1-800 phone number. The truth is that in late 2013 and early 2014 everything changed. We are constantly told it is because of business decisions but the truth is that our upper management/VP's have made bad decisions based on one man's great ideas, and let go of valued and successful customer service employees based on an unrealistic handle time goals. Also, we cannot be honest internally about how we feel about the company we work for. For every negative answer or comment I make, my direct manager is docked resulting in less of a bonus/pay increase for her. This is unfair because she is an incredible Manager and this policy promotes dishonesty."
good,"Ok to work for, for a future of uncertainty. Worked for this company for 10yrs.  Only for the company to outsource to a foreign company.  No position is secure with this company ev"
good,"When I started in 2010, Foreclosures where at the highest rate at the bank ever. It was very demanding, which I enjoyed, working upwards to 60 hours a week most weeks to get the work done"
good,"Very structured and organized workday"
good,I learned about different Mutual Funds and how to purchase them as well as redeeming them. I also learned the different types of Mutual Funds. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"I learned that it didn't matter how hard you worked or what you sacrificed to do the best job that you could do it still was not good enough and was not appreciated.  Their only concern was the bottom line.  It use to be a great place to work until it got too big and then as an employee, you just became a number."
good,"I believe that Fifth Third Bank is a great place to work, however there are many issues at our local branch that make the every day difficult to handle. While working at FTB I have learned a lot about how to assist customers in managing their financials and credit in order to make their dreams turn into realities. The management at FTB has been the most difficult to deal with. The management has changed several times in the 3 short years that I have been there. I would say the hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes that come into place, in some cases the changes are not sent down the proper channels. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers on a daily/weekly basis. As someone who has been in customer service for over 10 years I find it most enjoyable to get to know my customers on a more personal level and assist them in any way I possibly can."
good,We would daily work on discrepancies in customer accounts.
good,"The company itself is wonderful, however within my particular team there were poor managers, inconsistent feedback, unrealistic deadlines and expectations and discontent among an entire department."
good,Large organization with work experience indivdual to each department.
good,Work environment was good. Management and coworkers helpful. The pay was not enough to make a living without a 2nd job. They have good training classes
good,"this was my first corporate job. served it purpose in providing experience. i made the decision to have the company work for me. meaning, i took advantage of there education assistance, credit card, and stock purchase plan. These benefits helped set me up for continued growth."
good,Working in the financial world can be extremely challenging but 5th 3rd was a awsome experience but  the salary was too low to  maintain employment with them
good,This is a great company to work for. But like with most jobs it’s the management that can make it or break it. Forward advancement is lacking as well.
good,"Very conservative, uptight culture. Poor management - seems like it's always a power fight. A lot of mean people up on top, tough to work with other departments because of it - there is no collaboration, etc."
good,Very competitive and can be hard to acheieve goals. Goal compensation changes meant less pay if not a very senior employee. Strict hours means it’s hard to get all work done in a day
good,"A good place to work. Great schedule with holidays off and not required to work weekends. Teamwork environment, and competitive. Can be stressful but you just need a sales mind set"
good,Great company to work for and great career structure. Although I wasn't completely happy with pay. I was happy with my work family. Some of those people are in my life still to this day. I am proud to say that I worked for this company.
good,Stressful and very political environment.  I advanced quickly and feel the pay was fair.  When I left the company the leadership was poor.  The new VP of mortgage was unprofessional and lacked people skills.
good,A fast paced environment where employee engagement is encouraged. Management does care about their team but the Bank is always trying to reduce costs so efficiency staff reductions are a reality here.
good,"Between keeping up with banking regulations, Fifth Third regulations, hitting your call/sit goals and production goals all while keeping up with customer demand. It is a stressful role. If you are up for a challenge and like working in a fast pace environment, being a personal banker would be a great job for you."
good,During the years I worked at Fifth Third Bank I witnessed many employees advancing due to favoritism.  They were not usually very good employees to work with but they were particularly adept at butt kissing.  Unfortunately the regional manager was unable to identify these behaviors.
good,The banker role at this company is high paced selling with a great deal of management oversight. Meeting sales goals is required. Over-time is not allowed.
good,"Have a great manager and district manager, kind, caring, and wonderful people to work for.  Earlier when in other departments and different managers ran into the problem of people in management positions not working well with their employees, lack of training on that front I believe."
good,"It was a fun place when the local market got to make more decisions for customers.  When everything moved to HQ in Cincy, it became less fun.  I didn't enjoy being a credit analyst at all.  I thought it would be more #s driven, not BS driven."
good,Processed Loans and helped customers with the process. It was wonderful hearing the excitement in a clients voice when you call them to say they are approved. The hardest part was the sadness when a client find out they weren't approved for a loan. I enjoyed coming into contact with successful and non successful working people fulfilling their dreams.
good,"A typical day began at 7am and went until 7pm with weekend work expected. My hiring managers were amazing, their replacements not so much. I loved working with the students and colleges!!! The hardest part was the unforgiving culture."
good,"I started the job in 2012. The demands of Fifth Third on their employees was set too high. The goals and sales points were too high and the weight put on those goals creates too much pressure on an employee. To me, the needs of the customer was more important than meeting a quota."
good,"The workload is unreasonable and unmanageable.  The ability to work remote is terrific, but the system issues and lack of management support in resolving the workload issues make it impossible to ever get caught up."
good,Most learning years with productive and fun environment.  This is a challenging environment as in implementing some of the cutting edge technologies into the complex financial domain.
good,Difficult position.  Hard to please retail and investment bank.  Pulled in to many directions.  Required to also run a teller drawer.  Poorly staffed.
good,I learned a lot at Fifth Third Bank. My main disappointment is their sorry compensation packages and lack of diversity in senior and executive level positions.
good,"Management very good at telling you they appreciate you. But raises don't even keep up with cost of living."
good,"I hated it every day I was there. There was so much pressure on numbers. Not on what the customer actually needed. Who cares if the customer is already overwhelmed and drowning in debt, continue to push new bank products on them."
good,"Limited commitment to supporting high performers"
good,This is a great company to work for if you are choosing the to advance in the business field. Fifth Third bank has great benefits and there is alot of room for growth. The turnover rate for the company is higher then others.
good,It was ok..  Not much room for advancement - too may opinions of those who worked.  Management is laxed.......................................................
good,"Your experience is heavily dependent on what manager you have. The location also has a lot to do with it as well.  "
good,You're not compensated as well if you're an internally promoted.  I think they need keep the employees they currently have happy.  The turnover rate is too high.
good,"a typical day at work was good 8 hours"
good,Financial Service Rep is like a personal banker only with a bit less of pay.  You deal with all sales aspects of banking.  Great learning stepping stone if you were never in banking.  Goals at 5/3 are not the easiest so you need to want to succeed in order to get a shot at advancing forward.
good,I worked at 5/3 for 28 years and met a lot of very awesome people. I like working with people and helping them.  The best part of my day would be that I helped everyone the best I could. Every day was a learning experience.  Always new things to learn and very challenging.  The people I worked with were like family and a great bunch of workers.
good,"It was obvious to those who were paying attention that upon the merger of Old Kent Bank with Fifth Third Bank that eventually all the jobs would be transferred to Cincinnati Ohio which made the working environment extremely stressful."
good,"As a manager, great opportunities to affect others' development and engage yourself for future growth; benefits were top of the line"
good,Great company loved working there. There are a couple terrible managers and a horrible regional manager. With a great manager the sky is the limit.
good,Great people.  As expected the inner workings of a large bank are full of redundancies and dead ends.  People know they have jobs they just don't know how to do them correctly which unfortunately directly affects my job performance.
good,"If you don't reach your point goal (opening accounts) you could be weeded out!"
good,Very sales driven company with little benefit in return. Not a large footprint or much foot traffic coming thru the doors. Have to do a lot of cold calling.
good,Being employed at Fifth Third was some of the best years of my life. I had dynamic co - workers who were always motivated and willing to assist when needed.  The compensation program was outstanding.  Employees were rewarded for their job performances regularly.  I loved being busy and assisting with the training of new employees.  The hardest part of the job was having a lot of management turnover and trying to survive through the ups and downs of the market in the mortgage industry.  When it's busy it's busy 24/7 but when it slows down it stops.  There's no in between it seemed.  However even though it didn't last I will always be grateful for my time at Fifth Third and all of the knowledge I acquired there.
good,"Started off pretty well but I started to see co-workers drop off, didn't eel the job security and the favoritism was getting a little out of hand. I enjoyed the experience I gained"
good,Each work day consisted of performing multiple opening procedures as well as closing procedures. Fifth Third is very sales oriented and with operational focus. Effective with finding fraud and great risk assessment.
good,"I enjoy my job. But the management could be a lot better. Great bankers, not so committed branch managers."
good,Overall a good place to work however at the location i worked at the management team was less than exemplary. If management would have worked at communication with the employees it would have been a much happier place to work.
good,"The call center I worked in for over 6 years was busy. The more skills you have the more calls you take. Food days and fun events such as the United Way campaign and Fifth Third Day on 5/3 every year were fun. The mostly unrealistic expectations in call quality and scripting got harder every year. Also, do not get laryngitis because you talk on the phone all day constantly. If you max out your sick time you could end up with problems. Burnout does happen and the majority of people are there because they need a check. Most people are unhappy though. These were among the best group of people I ever worked with. Management has unrealistic expectations and should spend a day taking calls on the front lines. Customers hated the scripting and would think you were a recording. I liked helping people and always had excellent customer compliments. What the customer says about your service gets you a pat on the back and does not count towards quality and scripting which sounds so fake."
good,"Daily morning meetings"
good,This company provided a good starting point into the finance industry.
good,"Good training and on boarding for new employees."
good,"Arrive at work and depending on the day I'd open the bank, vaults, and log in to my computer the daily banking activity."
good,I started working here when it was Old Kent Bank.  A year after I started they announced that they were being bought by Fifth Third Bank.  I was only there for 18 months.
good,"Arrived every morning to help open the bank. Those duties included verifying cash levels in ATM and recording them using codes in a computer system, opening the vault with the teller's part of the dual control combination, got my drawer out of the vault, opened my coin vault, opened the night deposit drop box with the teller's part of the dual control combination. Logged all night deposits into the computer under dual control with another employee's username and password. Once bank was opened I processed routine transactions such as deposits, withdraws, check cashing and loan payments while cross-selling products to customers based upon their needs. Single-handedly achieved sales goals and made courtesy calls regarding over drafts and mandatory account changes, and made those changes as well as sold products based on customers needs. At the end of a day when I was a closer, I balanced my drawer, locked my drawer and all other teller assigned supplies in the vault as well as locked my coin vault. Gathered all paperwork to be sent down to processing in a locked bag, placed those keys in the vault and once everyone's drawers were away, locked the vault. The hardest part about my job was motivating my co-workers to aid me in sales to reach our goals and to aid me in the mandatory courtesy calls we were to make; to collaborate everyone in joining in a team effort. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with and helping customers."
good,"I liked working with this company because it was fast paced, always changing and the training was great. I am very knowledgeable about banking terms and how to better use credit cards because I worked here!"
good,a typical day at work was something that you could look forward too and you would not come home stressed out
good,The Bank demands a lot from their workers and often do not deliver on commitments.
good,"A normal day of work consisted of sitting with customers helping them with questions or concerns. The workplace culture is stressful a lot of the time, it is competitive but not in a good way. The most enjoyable part of the job was how I’m able to relate to customers and share in their good times and bad. The hardest part of the job was selling products to customers without being too pushy."
good,This is a good company to work for overall. Good people and lots of opportunity. Annual employee survey and positive environment. Great mentors available.
good,Fifth Third is pretty much in line with any other banking job from my perspective. But I haven’t worked for any other bank so I’m not sure. Regional Bank
good,Fifth Third Bank prides itself on being a lean bank.  I worked there for 10 years before I fell victim to their annual payroll reduction.  While there I made many life-long friendships.
good,I prefer the community banks. Start the day by calling customers. Concentration on selling loans and credit cards. Strong goals and results oriented. Bankers also run a teller drawer.
good,"My years working at Fifth Third Bank were eventful, learning and growing and taking on additional responsibilities. We were trained on new technology as it became available."
good,"decent paying job but they want you to work crazy hours at the beginning and it takes about 7 months to get a decent bid on hours"
good,"Great place to work I just didn't enjoy the politics. Also every branch is run by woman in my area and every time something happened it was just so emotional, everything was drama.I was even set up to fail a few times and the last time if a friend had not told me all of what was going on I would have been blind side and fired but because of her testimony my name was cleared."
good,I've had the opportunity to work with some extremely talented professionals.  Great experience developing skills through various growth and development programs.
good,Great benefits and some managers are really flexible. I’ve been here almost 4 years now and I haven’t left yet so they are doing something right by me.
good,53 bank has a very conservative culture. leaders are reluctant to implement new technologies.the company is lack of analytical culture.working hours are fine.
good,"Pressure just feeds down the pipe from the top. Unrealistic goals for low traffic branches. Good pay and benefits against competition, but just luck of the draw can create a completely different experience. I won't pressure customers into doing something that will potentially put them in a worse spot."
good,Fast paced competitive workplace with sales at the center of everything. Nice working hours with paid holidays. Has great benefits. People are very friendly
good,"Like any other corporate environment, it is easy to become lost in a big company. However, the benefits were great and lots of other perks, including great insurance."
good,Typical work day is on calls with clients and documenting project methodology.  A lot of duplication of efforts.  Technology is very poor for project management purposes and recording.
good,There was a lot of turnover in the branch. The pay is good but the part time hours aren't great. They don't really care about the weather and made us come in no matter what.
good,working at fifth third was a good place to start if youre looking to advace your career in the banking/finances industry. I liked the working enviorment and I was a good place to start but I felt like I wasn't going anywhere and I wanted to move on to other things.
good,"A typical day would involve reviewing atm/mobile deposits for negotiability and fraud. I've learned that it takes a lot of focus for this type of repetitive work. Management was poor due to the turnover rate being so high. At some points we didn't even have a manager, we would just seek out any dept manager that was free. The workplace culture was great. Everyone got along well and participated in departmental events. The hardest part of the job was leaving abruptly. The department was outsourced and jobs were depleted rapidly. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the new people that came and went. It was truly a diverse place to work."
good,I worked within the bank's mortgage department starting May 2013.  My job was eliminated November 2013 due to the mortgage rates increasing.  Great work environment along with managers and co-workers.  Would have stayed at the bank if my job was not eliminated.
good,"Fifth Third is a good place to work.  Benefits are great.  But the company is constantly changing their managers/employees into different configurations in order to save money.  This, unfortunately, doesn't always work.  It's also very difficult to get promoted based on job merit alone.  If you do your job well, they KEEP you there so your boss looks good.  You become a workhorse."
good,"Was a good place to work however lasted only 4 months. Some of the people you worked with you couldn't trust, but overall had a good time working and meeting new people."
good,"We had a manager that broke all the rules, will make you work over time and not get paid for it. Terrible turn over. Higher level management was not consistent as well. That bank is a hot mess!"
good,You had manager who showed favoritism and listened to rumors instead of coming to the person. It was a very stressful job and at times it was too stressful.
good,"Provides account services to customers by receiving deposits and loan payments; cashing checks; issuing savings withdrawals; recording night and mail deposits; selling cashier's checks, money orders, and answering questions in person or on telephone; referring to other bank services."
good,Most managers are young and growing into their positions. Most bankers with seasoned experience will have more knowledge and enhanced skill set compared to their managers.
good,not enough work terminated my contract without warning in the middle of a week. It was a good job that was supporting my family very well and i wish i could have stayed longer
good,"The training was rough when I went through it, although I think they have changed it since then. You have to go through a certification process and it was not fun. You do get to meet a lot of people throughout the company, like even people in corporate, like the big leagues, and make a lot of connections with a variety of people. It's a good starting job, but I didn't like the way management seemed to manipulate. They seem to care more about hitting their point goals rather than the customer sometimes. You can move up quickly in branches, but don't get too comfortable. Things are always changing. Hours were great."
good,This was a fun place to work learned many new skills and met many new fun people. Everyday was a new learning experience with differerent daily challenges.
good,"Fifth Third was a good company overall to work with, but nothing special. At times it felt many clients were being pushed to the side for more immediate matters. Work culture itself was good, no complaints. Management as a whole was okay, but some individuals displayed great leadership and management skills. Stability felt like a constant concern with many people switching departments or leaving on short notice. In short: your typical desk job."
good,A little more direction in the company as a whole could be useful and make it simpler to correct processes that may hinder workflow. Communication could also use a little more practice.  But overall a happy place to work.
good,"Great leadership, good benefits, culture was bad with to many employees looking to move divisions and or companies."
good,Nothing special about this job however the supervisor was very nice and accommodating with my school schedule. The pay was ok and raises were horrible.
good,"My work day is to mail out all exception item for about 50 client, this could be from 1000 to 2000 items. To make sure everything goes to the right place. I have a nice relationship with my manager and the workplace is okay mainly i work by myself. The hardest part of my job is making sure everything goes to the right place. The enjoyable park is that i work by myself."
good,Everyday was a new experience.  I have learned many great and critical skills over the years.  My days were filled with various jobs as listed in my resume.
good,"There is a good culture, the software and tech is always a decade behind. The recent customer focused push to ""keep the customer in the center"" is more of a company goal, than a result."
good,"Overall, the company was a big party of my professional development and very flexibly with school. Their salary is not competitive however their benefits are."
good,Overall a good place to work. Had i been offered full time employment I would likely still be working there. Pay is a little low but opportunity for advancement seems plausible over time.
good,"If you can handle people being rude to you on the phone all day, this job may be for you. The company itself was not bad to work for, however the job itself I would not recommend to anyone."
good,"The rules and regulations after being in banking for 9 years became very stringent at Fifth Third, after working at a top tier bank this was too much to work with."
good,Very competitive environment undergoing a lot of cultural and organizational change to react to increased regulatory and competitive pressures in the marketplace.
good,A changing environment with technology decrease in positions.Some days are busy but technology has changed the need to come to bank because now just about everything can be done on line.
good,"taking incoming calls, addressing account holders issues and request for assistance ranging from money transfer between accounts, credit and or debit card issues and or replacements. acting as an intake specialist when an account holder has either been a victim of a scam, billing errors, account take over, product disputes, lost or stole credit and or debit cards. "
good,I started off at part time but was told that once a full time position came available then i would be able to apply. The position came available i work the position for one whole month then was advise that someone else will get position so I has to apply outside the bank.
good,"Enjoyed surprise audits of the CSRs, and end of day balancing the CSRs, cash vault, and ATM.  However, I hated call nights that were mandatory on a weekly basis if our monthly numbers were slipping for the month."
good,The bank got in the way of itself with mis-management at the time.  Became a revolving door.  Things may be different now.  Good product line.  It was not hard to bring in new clients.
good,Fifth Third bank was a good place to work and learn about the security of banking policies. It was a very high paced environment. Was not computer friendly and had to learn a lot on your own.
good,"The position I agreed to was a banker. my understanding was 90% banker 10% teller.  The branch I'm in is more 40-60% banker the rest teller, not what was portrayed to me upon excepting."
good,"Activate and Deactivate Accounts"
good,"Fifth third bank is a great company to work for, management keeps the employees informed as to what changes are coming. The mail is very light so you can pace yourself."
good,Good company to work and understand the banking industry. Not really encouraging in promoting your career. Too many positions filled from the outside rather than promotion from within.
good,"I start off imputing client information in the system and make corrections when needed. I continue to work on my first deadline of 12 o'clock by data entry then work on my 2 o'clock deadline. By this time the mail for the next day has arrived, then i sort and prepare work for 3rd shift."
good,"This was my first time working for a bank I did enjoy it. Love working for the clients and with the employees. Unfortunately we had a look of turnover, but I was able to hire two great tellers , that are still working for the bank"
good,The job was located in Waukegan Il. which was about an hour drive from my home. I enjoyed the co-workers and my boss. I am sorry it had to close. It was too far to go back and forth too daily. I wished there could have been one in Milwaukee Wi.
good,I loved the people and clients I worked with but staffing was an issue. Lots of turnover and a very long process to hire new staff. The existing staff had to work harder and longer for due to retention.
good,Working as a bankteller had to constantly upsale promotions and banking accounts. Cash handling. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers.
good,Really enjoy the people I work directly with every day.  Management direction and the ever disappearing list of benefits is driving a possible change.
good,I worked in the call center. Wasn't a bad job it's just that dealing with people's money directly can be stressful. You never realize how many people have money problems until you work at a call center and they are calling you.
good,The staff was great and were always willing to help out any way possible.  Very stringent schedules and processes.  Also a great place with many career opportunities.
good,Fifth third is not a bad place to work however the standards at this workplace in opinion are too high and you cannot show your true personality. You have to change yourself in order to even fit in with their idea of professionalism.
good,"Overall good work environment and helpful colleagues. Workplace culture was good for the most part. However, short staffed and added pressure due to that. Management wasn't that great."
good,I enjoy every moment working for this company. You are able to be yourself while helping and learning every customer everyday. I was able to advance pretty quickly with the people I worked with daily.
good,Will have to experience on your own. Its a great company but have its pros and cons.. I mean there 3 years and havent had any major issues. They are fair at times
good,"I process and handle customer transactions daily, prove drawer daily. Process bank checks, money orders, cash advances. Process night drops and days drops. Refer customers to platform for referrals. I enjoy helping clients with their accounts and answer any questions they may have. I have been bank teller for 16 years. I learn new things daily and enjoy my position as a bank teller and interacting with customers on a daily basis. I have learned many tasks doing my job as a bank teller."
good,"There is no work/life balance at Fifth Third Bank in their Retail Banking Centers. When employees leave, they are not replaced. Some banking centers aren't open on Saturdays. The ones that are open, however, are staffed with employees that have already worked 5 days in a row. Those branches are also too short-staffed, so most employees work every Saturday. This means they are working 6 days a week. If you have a family, it is impossible to have any kind of balance."
good,Consistent coaching to move forward in your career.  Meet and work with different customers everyday.  Opportunity to work with peers from other branches.
good,I started at 5/3 as a teller in 2011. During my time with the company I was able to develop and change roles within two different branches 5 times. The amount of support for development and learning is what kept me with the comany.
good,"A typical day at work involved running transactions for customers, cashing a check, deposits, ect. Finding out the customers needs and recommending products and services. Hardest part was leaving my customers.  overall an okay job."
good,I enjoy working with the individuals here but the advancement is limited.  There is a lot of learning opportunity and there is enough work to keep you busy every day.
good,"Can be a nice to work. The sales portion can be the most difficult to learn. Everyone in my starting class was very close. We all help and supported each other as much as we could, and we enjoyed doing so."
good,"in my experience they are a very detailed company, in order to be successful you have to have some type of Mathematics or statistic background."
good,"management, very repetitive, tiring, boring, no time for comaradie allowed. no enjoyment, cannot take 15 minute break to eat and then to bathroom, called stacking breaks"
good,morning clock in check emails start making morning camp calls 222 calls and review files and accounts open from the day before.
good,My co workers were great. much older than I was but I enjoyed team meetings and events. I enjoyed the banking hours and was able to spend with family
good,"compensating their employees in a better way. "
good,"Typically I answer call after call after call and service their request then sell a product or service. Its okay, I prefer face to face interaction over phone conversations because I excel at customer service (which my customer service scores showed even on the phone). I"
good,"5/3 had a great training program for any new employee coming into banking. The hours are great and the people are nice. The only downside is that compared to other banking positions, they tend to not pay as much. They need to focus more on their employees and they would be an awesome place to work."
good,"The department I worked in was great, we worked well together. I really loved my job for the first few years and then I felt like we were given a bigger work load while dealing with staffing issues. I feel like upper management (over my manager) was not taking into consideration the problems we were having."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside with my colleagues and learning form them.  The co- workers were very nice and supportive as well as management.
good,While working at the bank I learned that people have a routine and don't like for anyone to mess with it. They sure don't care to be asked for an ID if they have been banking there forever.
good,"Managed a team of 6 individuals with customer range over 2000."
good,"Lead all aspects of treasury management product implementation and on-boarding process including client kickoff, status and closing calls. Product testing. Client training and complete customer satisfaction of implementation experience."
good,Hard driving top line revenue emphasis with focus on bottom line. Very organized with very strong talent pool. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  Extremely committed group.
good,"A good place to start working, they offer a good benefit package for their employees and offer training for the employees."
good,"5/3 bank provided many swag items for us to distribute to people. While I was working with them, they were very friendly and helped out a lot."
good,"This place has very harsh lighting, even if you've never suffered from migraines. You will once you work here! The lights are everywhere, even in the branches."
good,Fifth Third Bank is a good company to work for. The have a lot of perks and they the management treats you well. Expect to work long hours in mortgage sector.
good,Fifth Third Bank has a strong focus on supporting local communities and keeping their employees engaged while doing so. It is a very positive and rewarding work enviornment. Management is just as engaged and is always willing to spread their knowledge for continued learning. The most challenging part can be the high demands during the most crucial time frames of the market. Keeping the strong raport is always important. This position has definitely allowed me to push my limits to see what can be learned and accomplished in just a single day.
good,Every day was a new learning process. Changes constantly which is great for improving your skills.
good,"Calls and meet clients, realtors & staff to create possible mortgage loans.  Always new guidelines and products. Management was just ok.  Co-workers were great to work with.  Qualifying potential borrowers and getting loans through the underwriters.  Meeting new people."
good,Managed client base of 100 to assist defaulted homeowners mortgage loans.
good,Decent super regional bank just make sure you negotiate the highest amount possible coming in since annual raises are 1-3% at best.
good,"In order to advance your career you must network, gain as much knowledge within your current position, and drive your own career endeavors. This company has taught me to take ownership of my personal goals and continuously build on my current skill sets."
good,I was looking for a new opportunity back in 2013. I was promised a lot with Fifth Third. A year later promises that sold me to leave T. Rowe Price are still not fulfilled.
good,Customer service driven. Often under staffed and under trained. Must move quickly and accurately.
good,"Regarding my summary statement, I can only speak to the retail side of things.  I haven't been impressed with retail compensation or management and, for me, it seems that once you're in Retail, it's difficult to transfer internally to non-Retail positions.  I'm generally dissatisfied with working in retail altogether, so someone who enjoys that kind of environment may be better suited for a retail personal banker position."
good,"Working at Fifth Third Bank was exciting yet stressful. There was several opportunities to make money as long as one put forth the correct amount of effort. It was recognized that as soon as one mastered the way of meeting goals, deadlines, which allowed to ""meet"" for incentives, the management would them go back and reformat the requirements making it nearly impossible for the department to ""meet"" to their standards. This is an unethical practice therfore being my choice to move on."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but too much turn over. Co workers work well together, it's a nice team dynamic. I enjoy getting to know all my customers and building those relationships."
good,Great bank to start your career but compensation is not competitive to the market.
good,Fifth Third Bank is a good place to work and with all the updating it will soon increase it's market share in the Chicago Metro market.
good,"nice starter job, but was not happy with the management.  felt as though they favored the brown nosers.  it was too much politics. I feel a person should be judged based upon their performance, not their willingness to suck up.  Management was horrible, made it depressing to come to work.  I did enjoy the people I worked with though.  probably what kept me there as long as I did stay.  I learned banking and understanding how accounts work, by working hands on at a bank."
good,"As a Client Relations Representative I serve as a main communication point to Wholesale Brokers and Account Representatives.  I work on loans in my pipeline making sure all conditions received and submitted to underwriting.  Once all cleared, I finalize the loan and send it to closing. "
good,"Typical fast paced work, designed around meeting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly goals."
good,"Acceptable working conditions as a daily administrator of multiple phone and voicemail service software applications, including Avaya and Cisco, Rivermine TEM database, Remedy ticket tracking system and fluent user of Microsoft Office applications"
good,While working at Fifth Third a typical day for me is working on change orders making sure they are filled for customers as they come into the systems. Making sure everything balance at the end of day ready for pickup. I get along well with my co-workers but mostly keep to myself.
good,I liked working here. My manager was great and I learned a lot about the call center and sales environment.
good,"Learn fast-paced environment skills, being multitasking, people interactions."
good,"Since working for Fifth Third Bank I have acquired multiple skills for assisting both customers and noncustomers with their banking needs. When helping these customers I have created my own system for keeping track of the customers I come in contact with. This ensures that I can keep up to date. In my system I created a CAMP list to utilize my slow periods throughout the day. While customers are in my window I take advantage of my time with them & search for opportunities. If the customer does not have the time I encourage them to set an appointment so they have the best opportunity for information. Setting an appointment, I get their contact information & give them a courtesy reminder call prior to their appointment. This helps keep that appointment & give the banker the reassurance that appointment is kept. To better help both the customers and bankers I have made a 'Mortgage Day"
good,"Boring work environment. Benefits are great, There are opportunities available for advancement."
good,Hardest part of the job was lots of multitasking between processing ATM transactions and customer transactions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I found a great hairstylist and developed bonding relationships with the regular customers.
good,"The people at Fifth Third Bank are kind and care about you, however in the retail division they are poorly organized and the turn over rate is very high, so people are coming and going very quickly, it is hard to have confidence in the company who does not seem to know what direction they are going."
good,"The job required great customer service, in turn required hiring great employees. We had to deal with a lot of different personalities and angry customers but we came together when needed"
good,Loan closer. I learned time management for the Fifth Third closing process. My co workers were very quiet. No teamwork. Required to work every Saturday. I loved the flexable start times.
good,"Taking deposits "
good,Taking daily transactions from customers. Figuring out solutions to meet customers needs. Managing the team and making sure everyone is doing their best. Delegate tasks to help the team reach and goals. Multitasking different assignments while also taking customers in person and over the phone. The most enjoyable part is working with people that love working together and helping each other.
good,Learn here then move on.  There are a lot of politics and insecure managers.
good,"Good hours like my co-works it's a bank, Just don't like the sales goals but the benefits are good. Managent is a joke and the high up you get the worst it gets."
good,"Good Place to work, its been over 20 years - I was layed off due to company cut backs."
good,"I worked in several area's with Fifth Third. Operations included:"
good,"ok company to work for but some of the work is outsourced. "
good,"good place to work.  underwrite FHA , VA , CONVENTIONAL"
good,"Busy work environment, great co-workers. E-learning classes for additional learning & training. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customer experience."
good,"I keep very busy all day, and strive hard to reach monthly sales goals. My co-workers are great, and I enjoy meeting all different types of people on a daily basis."
good,Not a very encouraging staff.  Not much room for furthering career.
good,"Daily reconciliations"
good,"A typical day at work would include processing payments by credit cards, checks and cash. Making sure that payments balance and correspondences are read and completed. I learned how to work fast with quality work and how to meet the needs of the companies vested. I am cordial to all co-workers, and managers I come across including customers. There isn't a hard part of the job. I don't feel that I am challenged enough, but the most enjoyable part of the job is that I am processing over 50% of my standard."
good,"Good company to work for, assisted customers with account types resolving customer issues, setting up new accounts, explained benefits to customers and much more! "
good,Good work environment one of the best that I had in a long time.  The hardest part of the job was working with some of the older people always claiming the bank was stealing from them.  One of the joys was having a rapport with some of the regular customers and learning quirks about them.  
good,"good work/life balance on a normal basis.  good people to work with, tough days sometimes with lots of cold calling to customers.  technology and computer software pretty out of date, slow, and systems that don't link up together."
good,"Hardest part of my job was the constant changing processes, expectation and requirements"
good,Wonderful customers. Gained alot of financial experience.
good,"It could be a very stressful day at times, thru out the years of working for this company."
good,This was my first office job. I learned a lot and enjoyed it. I was able to utilize my customer service skills.
good,"Went to work with a small community bank that got bought by a big corporate bank and things changed dramatically. Day was spent waiting on customers as a teller, loading ATM, scanning checks, counting money and making phone calls to sell products. My Supervisor didn't seem to like her job which made it hard to please her. When the bank got bought out and the focus changed, managers were hard to retain and it was more difficult to accommodate the customers. The hardest part was trying to constantly sell products which seemed to annoy the customers. On the other hand, it was enjoyable to assist and talk with the customers."
good,"The company is successful and there is definitely room to grow there. However, the pay for Customer Service Representatives is not enough for all of the responsibilities and sales expectations."
good,"Great Co-workers, management had inconsistencies, RRAM was AWESOME!!!"
good,"A fast paced, financial service industry that offered room to grow."
good,"I start my day with a morning huddle. I then review my schedule to identify any meetings, conference calls etc. I meet one on one with my platform to discuss what went well the day before and strategize on how to achieve success as a group for that current day. I check in with my district via email going over campaigns, current stack ranking and customer service goals. I review the loan and credit card pipeline of 5 offices. I contact busines partners to receive updates on outstanding deals and calling efforts. Business partners would include mortgage, investment, paycor, merchant services, treasury management and membership advantage. Depending on the day, there may be scheduled meetings, community activities or projects. I correspond with my regional manager to discuss regional stack ranking, regional customer service scores and contests/initiatives to engage staff."
good,I started out as a csr and moved my way up to personal banker and then financial center manager. It is a very sales focused environment. There is a lot to learn but it is very rewarding to help people financially.
good,"Enjoyed waiting on my customers! Knew that job inside and out! My coworkers and I always worked hard and together ,and always received great comments from our customers. I worked in a fast pace faciity."
good,"Ok pay and benefits. The bank does work with people who wants to get involved in the community.Very hard to switch positions in the company.In order to make money, you have to switch departments because the raises are not even worth it."
good,"was working on the teller line each day, enjoyed working with the public and other coworkers."
good,good place to work. wasn't there long enough to know what the culture was about..
good,Overall satisfied. Salary fits job. Work is easy. Management is easy to work with and fair. Job requirements are easy to understand. Nice place to work with decent work/life balance.
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a first-rate company with extensive benefits and good opportunities for advancement. Technology platforms and products are also good, but could be modernized more."
good,They charge everyone overdraft fees even if you cover your charges same day.  They don't give you 24 hour grace periods.  They are stealing peoples money.
good,Enjoyed time at Fifth Third. Always busy and the company provided opportunities for training and development of associates. Smaller than the other big banks but still had a large client base.
good,Fifth Third is a good place to work but a very large bank. Prefer working at a smaller bank. Fifth Third has a wide variety of products and a wide range of loan product. They have good promotions and the customers seem to like the bank.
good,Good training you can ask questions and network. Peers are informative and awesome to work with. Many locations so finding a branch is open. Love my coworkers
good,I was the banking center manager and my duties changed regularly.   The focus from upper management was  forever changing.  Banking center staff was great.  Customers were very nice and interactive with staff.  I didn't care for the outside sales or mortgage or investment part that changed all the time.  Focus needs to be more consistent to provide staff encouragement to learn and keep getting better.
good,"Typical work day: 8 hours"
good,"I did not have much issue with working for Fifth Third. My Main issue was a divorce situation that got in the way of work. I had reached out to my manager and HR who felt bank security needed to be involved. Long story short, they terminated me and said I was not eligible for rehire due to my domestic situation. This was June 2017. Looking back, I should have pursed said more because they basically discriminated against me."
good,"I enjoy the benefits of being able to purchase vacation time above the vacation time given by the company."
good,Fast-paced. Advancement opportunities. Lots of locations. Good compensation. Regular training and development sessions. Somewhat unorganized..........
good,"The benefits and pay were decent. However, the company politics was horrible. Call times mattered more than giving great customer service to customers."
good,I worked for 6 mos as contractor and was shielded from company as a whole. I used this bank for own private company in the past and didn't trust them then. Couldn't get a feel for company as employee given my limited contact.
good,My time at Fifth Third was a good learning tool for me. I learned that I needed to be stronger in my voice. The management I was under were not the easiest people to work for. I decided to move on and find a position and company that would work with my strengths and build me up instead of making each day difficult to complete my job.
good,"Management seemed to not really know how to help the interns. There were many times where I had absolutely nothing to do and even when I asked for more work, none was given. It was a great experience and I met a lot of great people, however, I think that the program needs revamped."
good,"Fast Moving job, Managers are very nice, but the computer programs are not friendly and cause a lot of problems.  Selling is a large part of Fifth Third, so you need to be constantly looking for opportunities to offer customers every day."
good,in the call center everyone has to work 2nd shift unless they have been there long enough to do things like schedule bids or have someone else replace them in their current schedule so that they can work a better one.
good,its a good company but hard to advance I am ready to broaden my horizon as I look into going back to school to further my education I am looking for a less stressful environment
good,"The overall work atmosphere is not bad.  The lower level managers tend to care about their people but upper management is not as in touch with the lower levels as they could be.  Raises are minimal and there are no promotions for hard workers, only great game players and talkers.  Yes-men are rewarded but honest feedback is not.  The benefit package is decent but the health insurance is expensive.  For a company that brags about billions of dollars of profit you would expect them to share more of the wealth with the people actually doing the work to earn it.  This is the only company I have ever worked for that does absolutely nothing for its employees during the Christmas season.  Even Arby's gave out Christmas bonuses when I worked there as a teenager."
good,"I have further developed management and people skills."
good,"Working there was alright, the branch that I've trained at in Covington, KY was great. Personally I just don't think it was the right fit for me, and that is why I left."
good,"Pay wise the company is good, you will be surprised to get some additional bonuses apart from your CTC."
good,"Great Company to work for, with much focus on inclusion and interactiveness. They ae open to changes and positively receiving feedback from all levels of employees from upper managment to lower managment."
good,The personal banker position takes about 3-6 months to fully learn and understand if you aren't coming from a background in banking or finance. The job doesn't offer a whole lot of compensation. If you hit 200% to your goal you will only make an extra $700 that month. typically hitting 150% is doing very well which is only about a $450-$500 monthly payout. Decent workplace. The policy is above everyone and everything. I never felt safe with my job.
good,I run a teller drawer and the vault all day. I have to balance both of those every day plus an ATM. I help keep the branch organized. I help keep the branch in stock everything we need from pens to cash. I love helping with the audits we have to do every month. I was told my branch was one of the most organized branches.
good,"Good pay"
good,"The individuals who are promoted were not nearly the best qualified candidates. The culture is intensely favorable to an inner circle of friends and family - yes, family (nepotism) is very alive and well."
good,"Short staffed at all times, 1 Teller(also running drive up) for High Volume Branch is acceptable to all levels of management. No training to speak of and love to hammer with audits without teaching or training on proper ways. Teller Systems ancient and inefficient. Went without lunch many a day due to staffing. Terrible benefits"
good,"a great place to work that offers a lot of food knowledge. I dealth with a lot of people, great customer service training."
good,"Underwrite and did decision mortgage files. Assist loan officers with policy and procedure. Learned better communication skills and built relationships with co workers and loan officers. Management been supportive and streamline the work process to better provide good customer service."
good,9am meeting every morning. Review mortgage loan pipeline and documents received and stilled needed. Open email and respond accordingly. Make customer calls on new loans coming in and give status of loans to customers that are already in process and request needed documentation. Order vendor work as needed. Schedule and submit loans for closing. Open door policy if you needed a manager.  Great co-workers. We worked as a team. I enjoyed my job... of course it was stressful but worth the challange
good,"At Fifth Third I learned a lot about checking and savings, and mortgage accounts. I also learned how great I am with customers, and know how to talk to customer especially if they are upset, I can calm them down or explain things to them better."
good,"A typical work day included answering inbound calls from business clients regarding their account, data entry. Learned more about the different banking products 5/3 has to offer. Really wasn't a hard job, enjoyed the working with my co-workers."
good,Unless you're willing to move to Cincinnati or a new market there is no room to grow.
good,I enjoyed my career at Fifth Third Bank and had no intention of ever leaving employment with them. My position was eliminated in December 2013 due to a workforce reduction. I enjoyed the compliance and daily branch operations the most.. Mentoring staff was a big part of my day. Each day brought new challenges and opportunities. Our goal was to meet and exceed the customer's expectations with each and every visit to the banking center..
good,I experienced lots of success and would recommend this company to anyone looking to grow a career in retail banking.
good,The one thing I did get from Fifth Third was continued education.  I attended 30-35 classes they offered at their Evansville IN location while employed.  I feel this training has given me a strong banking background.
good,Good starting pay. If you want to leave retail you will not be able to.
good,"Providing one on one customer service in the North Shore region with the highest number of daily transactions. Our commitment is to expand client relationships depending on the needs of the individual while maintaining  ""A"" quality experience. Each client interaction adds to the hands-on experience in rapport building needed in such competitive environment. Reviewing morning & nightly procedures, banking center reports that include "" Profit & Loss"", target monthly goals tracker & maintaining monthly & quarterly audits. Maintain cash vault balance- Brinks cash ordering (Debits & Credits). Daily morning huddles with the team to review daily goals and plan. Last but not least is the rewarding feeling I have at the end of each day knowing that I've helped someone, whether it's essential financial planning to buy a home or simple banking needs."
good,"everyday brings a new challenge, learned how to multitask, learned new skills everyday"
good,Fifth Third is a great place to work if you enjoy a structured environment.
good,Its been my least favorite out of the other banks I have worked for.. Still not the worst place on earth
good,Overall i would give this company a three. I was employed in the mortgage division and what a mess that was not emough back end personnell to deal with the volume. loans got lost in the shuffle. They were not a procative company they new this type of volume was coming instead sacrificed customer service to save money. When you have loan processors and back end people making more than the sales staff i find it to be a problem.
good,I love being at Fifth Third Bank because it has helped me a lot in terms of jump starting my career and there is always room for advancement and you learn a lot from great people.
good,"Since the branch was not that busy, we did a lot of organizing the office and making telemarketing calls. My co-workers previously worked at other financial institutions so they brought a lot of experience to the office."
good,"As a personal banker for 5/3rd bank, I sale a variety of financial products to customers. Loans, checking and savings, mortgage, referrals to lines of business partners but mainly sales. I have learned a tremendous amount about the banking industry but I am not seeing room for advancement within the industry. I do not currently like what I do because it is not challenging."
good,"Fifth Third Bank is currently undergoing an Agile transformation and they are making a lot of adjustments to do so. One thing that I dislike is that they are making it ""Fifth Third Agile"", so not by industry standards, and I am interested in more of a typical Agile team."
good,"Its your typical retail banking job. Daily sales goals, cold calling, customer services. Nowadays it is more service than sales, but very high expectations to sell for a banker."
good,"Professional place to work, and opportunities are there if there is a strong desire to grow. Skills and talents are definitely recognized. Amazing benefits are provided."
good,"Some flexibility in schedule for exempt employees. Typical office politics. Management varies widely, as well as their stance on time off, accountablitiy, etc."
good,Company encourages management to enhance products and ideas to better serve customers.  Reward based incentives for idea generation and sales goals.  Opportunity to meet with clients outside the office.
good,"Fifth Third is a great place to work. Management is pretty good and the training provided to you is long and tedious, but it is thorough. Fifth Third tries to do a good job at its work life balance but that can get muddled sometimes depending on where you are located. The compensation is low for the amount of work that is required of you and if you have an understanding DM then you will be fine, if not, then it will not bode well for you."
good,Nice place to work and plenty of room to grow within the company. The only reason I left was because I found a job that paid more and had better hours.
good,"Fifth Third does give ample time off. As well, the benefits provided by the bank is very strong. There are office politics and excessive meetings just like every other large company. However, all-in-all, Fifth Third is a decent place to work."
good,Fifth Third was a good place to start my banking career. I learned a lot when I was there and they offered multiple training and career advancement classes. My only complaint was the pushy sales that weren't customer focused.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Very good benefits compared to other companies.  My area is flexible with schedules allowed for better work life balance.  The area I work in the management team will reach out, listen to and implement ideas from the hourly staff."
good,Work culture is the best part of working for 5/3 hands down. The training is not readily available as it should be and they are slow to hire and slow to interview when applying internally.
good,"Was a nice place to work with . Have great co-workers and the support was constant. I have a great time and learned a lot working here. "
good,"Secure career with good pay, benefits but very stressful. "
good,"Fifth Third Bank was a good and bad experience.. Do not expect to be fully staffed there, they will give you the bare minimum of employees and tell you that they are certain that is all you will need. It is a fast paced, stressful environment made even more so by the lack of workers. The initial pay is good but raises, though given annually, are not much at all. On the brighter side, the employees I've encountered are extremely friendly and helpful and help to ease the stressful times. Management from the individual banking centers are very customer oriented while also doing the most to ensure the employees are doing well. The benefits offered are generous, as are the paid vacation days and paid Holidays off."
good,"Great pay and even better coworkers. I loved it all. Except the schedule you're mandatorily set on is 11am-8pm in Grand Rapids. You MUST have this schedule. It can only be changed IF you have the top percentage highest score out of everyone else. They give you only 2 hours of appointment time every 3 months. It's a huge hassle to take time off for remotely anything. They just won't work with you. I'm pregnant and they refused to help me get to appointments. They care very much about time. You have to be fast. Quantity of quality. You have lots of options and also give great advancements when working hard. I had the top percentage in my department, and they still didn't care when I expressed my struggles."
good,"They keep upping expectations, but also expect me to pick up the slack of others who are in the ""in crowd"" and get away with whatever they want. Management/upper management very clique-y. Lots of favoritism & double standards. Feels like high school at times due to drama."
good,"This company does offer good benefits such as insurance,  401K, Stock purchases, discounts, vacation, maternity, & holiday pay.  The only bad thing is the annual raises.  It may only be 1%.  The bank does pay incentives for products and services provided to customers.  I guess the way it is viewed that an employee can make it up thru incentives.  It does take time to learn it however additional income is available.  No overtime.  Management is good overall."
good,"Aiding customers in transactions"
good,Fifth third is a great place to give you a good home/work balance. They are the lowest paying Bank as far as salaries are concerned. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a more relaxed banking enviroment
good,"Working at Fifth Third was a pleasant experience, due to the fact that the work/life balance is great there. Everyone was friendly and hard-working. The culture is very laid back and promotes living a healthly lifestyle."
good,"I have gained cash handling experience, dealing with customers more and giving back to the community. It is a great job with benefits."
good,When you finish a previous month as the top performer among over 60 associates and you are still one of the approximately 50 to be part of a mass layoff there is little sense of job security or urge to apply to Fifth Third for any other future positions.
good,Conservative lending practices.  Operations need some updating.  Decent work environment.  Enjoyed working there.  Housing crash ended opportunities for me.
good,Really liked working there. The job was fast paced which made my day go by fast. Offered many opportunities for overtime without being mandatory. Also had nice work incentives.
good,Very competitive on sales between other Financial Centers. Which can make it exciting. Very goal driven with KPI and branch ranking.
good,"It was a nice opportunity for personal growth. I appreciate the time the company allowed, in order for us to truly observe our own development. I really enjoyed the training I received in the beginning, by sending us away to do so. This made the transition to live working a bit easier."
good,If you do your job efficiently and in the way you are supposed to you will have no problems and will receive commendation for good work done. The constant pressure to put your job first adds stress to the every day work and can lower morale
good,"The customers in the Brookville community love 5th 3rd Bank. My job was working to open up and make sure we were prepared to do business each day.  I learned how important It is to be organized. I learned to do the best you can and to take pride in a job well done.  I worked with a great customer service manager and some terrific tellers. I  hated to see them leave as they found other jobs.   The hardest part of my job was watching the  branch manager's goals and policies cause the customers to close their accounts and leave.  The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the customer's needs and knowing, they knew, they could count on me to do the right thing and take care of them."
good,"Manage risk assessment through internet research, financial statement analysis, statistical modeling and industry analysis."
good,"Being a vault teller is a very demanding job, You must maintain speed and accuracy."
good,Amazing staff members. Tremendous leadership from management.
good,A typical work day would consist of customer being welcomed by name. Creating an delighting experience. I learned it is vital to pay attention to the customers wants and needs. Help support teammates on difficult transactions. The most enjoyable part of the job is offering help and different avenues of fun to all customers.
good,"good work/life balance"
good,"Family orientated company. Good company to work for. "
good,Lots of room for growth. Management will help you get to where you want to be. The hardest thing to manage is all the change that is constant.
good,"Never-ending hours, cold calls, constant pressure from above, no help from my bankers, a new teller staff, all responsibilities were on me. I worked countless hours and always gave 100% of my effort. Witnessed a whole new culture developing within the company over the past two years. They claim to value and appreciate their employees...really? Then why was my position eliminated and I was given no other options and made to leave the company? I worked my butt off for Fifth Third Bank and I got dirt kicked in my face in return- VERY UPSETTING"
good,Very nice place to work. Room for growth. Would have stayed but relocated.
good,"Aggressive sales goals, some micro-managing, depending on the manager. In my experience, the new managers have been the worst - super uptight!!! They micro-manage the most! Most of the time at work you are going through leads lists and making calls trying to cross-sell. If you get promoted from within, it takes longer and you end up getting paid significantly less than if you apply from outside Fifth Third. If you want to get promoted to Financial Service Manager it will take a long time 2 years minimum regardless of how awesome you are at sales. Top management will promise you advancement if you keep up the sales, over-promises and under-delivers! Disappointing!"
good,"It is easy to stay busy and productive because there are always customers waiting to be assisted in the lobby, drive thru customers ringing for you, phones, personal bankers asking for transactions to be done, emails, and office projects. It is fun to have sales contests considering everyone has required sales goals. Sometimes you will win a lunch, lottery tickets, etc. You need eight closed sales (open a checking or savings account, Identity Alert, Credit card only if it is activated and used) that you initiated in order to get paid out for any of them. At this time, all of the accounts are changing and we are expected to get customers to change their accounts, but we do not have all of the information to answer customers questions. Upper management expects you to charge on all accounts and tell customers that is all we can do."
good,"I have truly enjoyed my 18 years with Old Kent Bank / Fifth Third Bank. Although my position is being eliminated, effective December 31, 2012, I am really looking forward to new and exciting opportunities."
good,a person couldnt make a career working as a CSR. this is a good part time job for a college student and when i was there the commission wasnt bad
good,The bank taught me a lot about banking compliance and standards.
good,Fifth third bank was an okay place to work i got sick with migranes and they wouldent change my vacation or let me take a leave.
good,Each day is a new challenge. I mainly deal with insurance companies and total loss claims. I also deal with repair issues on vehicles ensuring that policies of Fifth Third are followed.
good,I enjoyed the people at the 2 branches I worked at and I keep in contact with multiple people. We tried to have fun every day. Even when it was a rough month managers will try to create positive energy.
good,"Enjoyed working there a little over a year that I was there.  Learned a lot, and experienced a lot.  Learned how to sell credit cards to some customers"
good,A lot of this job depends on where you are working and your attitude. If you are just trying to sell financial/banking products you are going to have a bad time. Focus on helping customers achieve their goals and you will achieve yours.
good,Systems seem like they could be better considering what year it is. They make things harder for us than it needs to be to service the customers. Stressful.
good,"Began my career as Security First Bank and then Bought our by Pacesetter Bank, then bought out by Old Kent Bank.  My experience with these companies was fulfilling."
good,Good benefits. Fast past environment with a customer focus to deepen and grow relationships.  The organization is very supportive of the surrounding communities.
good,A typical day at work consisted of managing the teller line.  I learned a lot about branch auditing and compliance.  I enjoyed my position as a customer service manager even though it was stressful at times.  The workplace culture was enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was merging from First Charter to Fifth Third Bank.  The most enjoyable part was working with my customers.
good,"Laid back company to work for, great work life balance, however not a ton of Diversity. The company has recently promoted a new CEO and changed it's marketing campaign to focus more on Millennials."
good,"My typical day at work is closing and funding loans. I have moved quickly within the company. I started with no experience as a Closer I. Because of my willingness to take on challenges, as a Closer I, I began learning and taking on loans reserved for a Closer III. I was given a Closer/Funder II position for my hard work. The culture here is wonderful. I enjoy working with my team of Closers. The hardest part of my day is not having the proper training while given more and more responsibility."
good,"Working at Fifth Third Bank was a great experience for me. I developed a love for people and providing the best customer experience for them. I learned to listen with empathy, be a problem solver and meet the needs of customers. Of course, there were challenges I was able to learn resilience, strength and  perseverance from the adversities of the job."
good,Like all banks you can no longer put the customer first its all about goals that is not realistic in this day and age. It's about manipulating people and numbers.
good,"You have to be extremely punctual to this job. Even a minute late is scrutinized. You have to be very careful with counting your money and there are a lot of different policies and procedures that you need to do properly or it will cause trouble for yourself and others around you. "
good,"An excellent starting position that gave me a lot of experience with a wide variety of responsibilities. I was also part of a team of twelve other employees who taught and helped each other for the good of the team, a very collaborative environment. My typical responsibilities included assigning fraud cases to investigators, reviewing merchant and customer documentation and evidence, and corresponding with other companies regarding potential suspects and financial accountability. I would also have to monitor internal bank transaction with regards to the money involved with fraud transactions and either approve or deny them. Assigning cases was my main role within the team and I had to make sure to meet the daily quota or the case assignment queue would get too large for the team to meet regulations on case age and chargeback rights."
good,"Job could be very stressful at times but could always count on support from fellow employees. At CSR level, help and support was available branch-to-branch as well, sharing information and offering solutions."
good,"•	Interact with various insurance companies and customers in an effort to negotiate payments and limit liabilities"
good,"Served over 80 customers phone calls on a daily basis, by answering questions accurately, consistently, and professionally"
good,"I help with customer needs, I count down the vault, refer customer to personal bankers that can help with their accounts "
good,Fifth Third Bank was a fun place to work.  The team worked well together and collaborated with all the different departments.  I didn't like how they outsourced jobs and let people go with no warning whatsoever.
good,Helping customers is easy. Need to be part salesman to do the job well. Fits well with people who like to talk. Advancement is possible if you hit your sales goals every month.
good,"Highly sales driven culture. Good local management. Always looking to adjust to changing market conditions. company initiatives  and directiion change constantly,"
good,"I believe Fifth Third Bank is one of the better banks to work for, however, the banking industry is changing due to recent legislation, and as those changes take place, the role of a Financial Center Manager is evolving.  I no longer do what I do best every day, because my role has changed from being primarily sales to primarily operations."
good,Enjoyed new challenges everyday; worked remote so not a lot of personal interaction.
good,They had great benefits and good training. The branch I worked at was so far from home that I decided to quit and take early retirement. I enjoyed working with the staff members and we all supported each other.
good,"Fifth Third is a great bank to work for. The environment is very positive, which is fostered from the area executives. The hardest part of the job is the limited market share in the Atlanta Metro Area specifically due to being headquartered Ohio. With the bank being a new entrant into the market promotion potential is limited. Most of the retail banking positions are within the instore model concept."
good,"As far as the salary and 401K, Fifth Third Bank is a great place to work.  Whether you are a CSR or a Personal Banker, you are stressed to produce daily, and if you do not meet your monthly goals, be prepared to lose your job.  They take it serious, and push everyday to exceed goals.  It is ridiculous. There are kinks in the computer system that need to be addressed.  After they have opened multiple accounts for a client, they still want you to do more. A word to the wise, beware of the daily stress."
good,The company wants to embrace a culture where bankers uncover clients needs by listening and doing financial reviews on new and existing clients. The idea to uncover your clients needs by listening and recommending products and services that will benefit the client is best practice in my opinion.
good,"Worked here 2x, first time Fifth Third took over First Charter Bank, which was a perfect place to work.  When Fifth Third took control, they were not very well prepared, and ended up closing the funding department."
good,Financial Service Representative. Good hours....not many bonuses.
good,this workplace is very people oriented because we have to deal with all kinds of banking customers and they can have all types of disputes.
good,"I like working for Fifth Third. I am a teller that makes only 12 dollars an hour with a college degree. I feel that, to be a teller, it does not take a year to fully understand the job role and that can make the job a little daunting at times. There are staffing issues and my boss is a little nonchalant. I feel that if they bump up their policy of how long you have to be in your position then it would be a better place to work. Honestly, I'm a little bored with the job and there needs to be more programs to assist with advancement."
good,"depending which branch you worked at the managers were great. I worked at eastland mall for awhile and loved my manager. good pay, and incentive as well"
good,Good environment for a learner to learn. Helpful co-workers and management. As a intern I worked and enjoyed. I learnt several management tools and IT tools to use on project. Helped me this hands-on training being a intern.
good,"Encourages diversity from age, color, sex, and sexual orientation."
good,A typical workday at a banking center is pretty busy. There is always something to do so downtime is not a problem. Management watches very closely so you are always being supervised.
good,"I worked there for over 10 years.  There is a  lot of focus on following policies, team building and volunteering.  I enjoyed helping the customers and my coworkers."
good,The people there are very great however in the mortgage department the management is very poor. There Mortgage process needs vast improvement. It was very in sufficient for my client's needs
good,"Processing customer deposits and transactions, answering multi-line phone system, filing, faxing, balancing cash items account, balancing bank vault as well as teller drawer, sales, resolving customer problems and complaints, ordering supplies, telemarketing, train new employees, open accounts and other daily functions of banking."
good,"Deposits and Withdrawals for their Checking or Savings"
good,helping people set themselves up with their financial needs
good,"I Enjoy what i do and i'm a hard worker. I get alonng well with my co-workers. I learn new things everyday and the laws. The hardest thing about my job, is taking people money and having to listen to to there storys."
good,"Well organized team ,provide a lot of work life balance. Provide a lot of work life balance. Great people at all levels of the company - It provides employees with free and paid resources to help them learn new skills and apply those in their jobs/life. It promotes diversity and inclusion in work place."
good,"Long hours, short staffed, unreasonable Goals.  Been a while so things may have changed under new local leadership. Old guard was terrible."
good,"I enjoyed working everyday in my office setting with my recent and past customers. That was one of the most enjoyments at Fifth Third."
good,Had a great experience working for Clinique and how to get comfortable talking to strangers. It taught me a lot about sales and how to ask really important questions that will give me an idea of what they are looking for.
good,"Retail Mortgage Sales. If you didn't have established customers, you will starve. Commission base job."
good,"the manager at the time did not know what he was doing, had to learn from the tellers. he micromanaged and constantly watched us on camera. he did not know what personal space was."
good,"you get relocated to different branches and jobs dissolve. The management isn't too terrible. Your co-workers can make or break the job, but its not too difficult. I would not recommend a BankMart (inside Kroger) Location unless you are either a collage kid with a weird schedule or you want to work until 7 every night. NOT regular bank hours."
good,I enjoyed working with money and the customers but the manager was horrible and stressed up-selling far too much. He was immature and spent more time trying to get us to do his work for him.
good,"A typical day at work, work, work, work.  No help from management, and management is only concerned about themselves.  There is also many bigotry between races, nationalities and religion."
good,Started working here for my prom dress and this became a career  instead of a deadend job. Found better job after they rrained me
good,I liked working at fifth third it just wasn't enough changelles for me and also they weren't giving me enough hours .
good,I was unfortunately chosen to be laid off due to the mortgage refinance / purchase slowing down. I did enjoy my position and time with Fifth Third
good,"At both locations that I worked for, the employees were great.  They worked hard and got the job done but we made it a good time too.  We liked coming to work everyday and almost in a sense became a family. "
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Very judgmental though, rude branch manager on 135. One of these worst branches I've ever seen!"
good,Great company to work for but difficult to move up when you do not get your reviews like you are suppose too.
good,Potential to earn a nice commission if your good at referring products and services. Sales are pushed a little too hard and the customers noticed as well
good,Every day I show up to work with a positive attitude.  I love working in a team environment! Working for this company is great!  I get great compensation for my goals and am treated as a valued employee.  I have great management and I love to help our customers.
good,The bank was very busy in selling bank products.
good,"I liked the people I worked with, but I was in a position of balancing two roles (teller and banker) that conflicted with one another. The branch I worked at was very busy, so it was hard to ever figure out a good workflow. We often stayed late, and frequently worked Saturdays too."
good,I loved the people I directly worked with. It was a great learning experience. I loved the hours as it was easy to tend to my family in the evenings .
good,"Typical day at work was working through assigned workload while shooting for perfection in underwriting quality.  If perfection was not met, then additional coaching and further training would be required."
good,Management can be inconsistent and promotions are not always based on the best person for the job.  Hardest part of the job is the high sales goals and constantly changing targets.
good,I enjoyed my time with Fifth Third. The upper management has the company going in the correct direction.  There is opportunity to improve middle management to be on the same sheet of music as senior leadership.
good,"Sales driven "
good,Working at Fifth Third Bank was very stressful regardless of how well you performed. Even when over achieving your monthly sales goals it always seemed management had something to point out to you that you were not doing well versus coaching you on areas you think you can approve. Employee turnover was high and the branches were short staffed which put more pressure on the banker to do even more and would sometimes pull them away from their actual job.
good,"I was hired on about mid-October 2010 and had to leave in February 2011. The employment was only seasonal but the hours were full-time. They said that there were no positions available for regular employment at that location, but a position was available about 40 miles away. Since I wanted to look for employment that was close to where I was living, I did not take the position."
good,"I was able to move up in the position quickly but that was based only on my eagerness to learn and take on new responsibility.  I was promoted from the mail room to the helpline in one year.  Going forward, there was more fear of being laid off so the environment became extremely stressful."
good,"Maintained a high level of customer service by being proactive in communicating with customers, banking center associates, brokers and account executives regarding documentations required for loan approval."
good,A typical day at work would consist of taking calls in a very busy call center. I answer questions for customers about their accounts and make changes if necessary and to educate customers on products new and old. I've learned a lot about the banking industry and the rules and regulations. I work with a group of amazing people. We all help each other out every day with work related issues. The hardest part of my job is when you are unable to help a customer who have exhausted all options that were available to them and the most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the amazing customers who appreciate everything that you do for them.
good,A typical day of work as a Licensed Personal Banker consists of servicing existing clients throughout the day.  With every interaction you are expected to sell a product or uncover a need.  A big focus is the Investment piece. Investment sales and quotas are ultimately the biggest objective and can compensate if you are lacking in retail sales.
good,"Fifth Third Bank was a fun and enjoyable please to work, I loved my job and felt like at the end of the day I always had a very busy and productive days."
good,"Check email, answer customer questions, Initiate contact and provide assistance to consumer and mortgage loan customers who are in default ,Counsel and guide the customer in order to achieve workout alternatives based upon their circumstances while complying with all investor, company, federal and insurer guidelines. Great co-workers. Enjoy helping people save their homes. Hardest part of the job is making contact with the customers and getting them to call you back."
good,One of the most organized workplace you can find.
good,My responsibility was for a s-ecific contract job that was completed in a six month time frame. Minimal interaction with internal employees; but what intercation there was created a positive atmosphere. People were kind and very enjoyable to work with. Management was very good and professional.
good,Good solid financially stable company. Tough on wholesale Great for retail. Technology so/so
good,"Through the years the processes have become extremely challenging to complete real work. The burden falls on the individual contributor to complete most of the processes when new products are needed. It is difficult to manage the day to day tasks on running the infrastructure gear, upgrading to new and managing the overly burdensome processes while keeping a work/life balance."
good,Sales Sales Sales that's all they care about and if you don't perform your out the door!! The people are great and I made some really close friends. Getting too big as in a corporation really don't care about the employees anymore.
good,"Worked at co for 9 years, been promoted 4 times. Now in management for past 3 years, would like to continue moving into senior management or move from retail to commercial. Overall good company to work for, but seems like always short staffed, and behind larger banks in tech and employee relations."
good,"Fifth Third Bank is an organization that has a strong  Core Value of working as one bank, keeping the customer at the center and giving incentives to those who implement these values."
good,Working remote 2 to 3 days a week from home. You tend to accomplish more with less interruptions. Also they were a huges contributor to United Way and held an employee engagement event. The 5/3rd day celebration was also a great employee engagement event.
good,Very interactive and systems driven culture.  Very sophisticated HR systems.  Interaction with multiple Lines of Business was enjoyable and challenging all at the same time.
good,Worked for Fifth Third Bank for 7 years.  I really enjoyed the fast paced job working with customers and the problems they had.  Loved to see the look of happiness once problems were solved on their faces.  The workplace was professional and dealt with security and everything needing to balance as the end of the day.  Overall a great job.

good,The environment is very competitive and goal oriented but upper management works hard to train properly. Learned how to sell through their consultative selling process.
good,"At the time, it was dress for the day and you could wear jeans. Everybody was really laid back, but also helpful and friendly whenever you have questions."
good,"Really nice place to work, fast paced enviroment with room to grow within the company. But the mandatory hrs to new works is pretty much 11-8pm an thats just so inconvient to people with other obligations."
good,Managed tellers. Made the schedule. Performed monthly audit on the branch. Managed money. Monthly sales and coaching meeting with tellers. Open accounts. Manage all customer services and operations of the branch.

good,Fifth Third Bank is a great place to work. They sponsor licensing programs and classes if you want to pursue additional educational knowledge to help clients.
good,I suppose it is like many other places.  There are good people and there are not so good people.  The bottom line is king. Out sourcing as much as possible.
good,I have received many opportunities within fifth third that have helped me grow personally and professionally. I have worked my way from a part time teller to a lead csr.
good,"Stressful "
good,It is good place to be in as currently organization is going through major transformation on data side. Lot of opportunities and areas to explore. It is a great place to work.
good,Good overall. Technologically behind but great efforts to make employees feel as they are a part of a team. Great benefits. Seems as if they try to hire go getters.
good,I enjoyed my time at Fifth Third Bank. I really liked my team as well as my direct supervisor. It gets very challenging to enjoy all the customers but the staff helps keep the environment a good one!
good,I take pride in the company. the company changes with the environment. always moving forward.  I stay busy. always there to help coworkers and customers alike.

It was an honor to represent my company and background."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fifth Third Bank. It was a slow paced financial institution which was a good and a bad thing at times,  I learned a lot working at Fifth Third bank."
good,Work life balance is important with this company. Opportunities for growth are limited. Some managers are rigid and have been there for a long time and dont deal well with change.
good,"Good work environment, nice staff to work with, flexible hours that adjust with home/work life.  Poor management, not always appropriately staffed for peak times"
good,Work independently on a daily basis. Worked with V.P. Managers in the Mortgage department.  I learned how to process a loan application. There wasn't anything hard about the job and I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Fifth Third is a great place to work, but I am finding a lot of the mangers are not very proficient at their own jobs. They are not easy to go to for help, and pretty much have to figure things out on your own. Also, hourly employees are expected to work the same, but be treated different than salaried employees. Definitely some things that need to be fixed to make the culture better."
good,Fifth Third is an excellent place to work. My typical day begins with customer calls and setting appointments. The workplace culture can be misleading depending on where your location is. Management wasn't great on my end but that's corporate America for you.
good,Fifth Third Bank is a great company to work for. The employees are friendly and there is a strong sense of teamwork. Performance is recognized and rewarded.
good,"They are very encouraging, and your teammates are actual teammates that will be there and look out for you. Resources are plentiful. Technology is top notch. Help desk is always available. I didn't realize how valuable this position was until I started working for them. It's pretty coveted and when you're in it you can see why. If you want a career, apply now and never look back."
good,Made the mistake of accepting a temporary position at a great company. Once our project was complete we were blindsided by our release from the company
good,I enjoyed my career at Fifth Third. I learned a lot. Their commitment to customer service is commendable. The corporate culture could use a little improvement. They are working hard on employee engagement but can fall a little short on what employees truly value from an employer. I do however give the company credit for trying and they are actively trying to move in the right direction.

Collaborated with the business and technical stakeholders to accurately documents report, functional, non-functional and data requirements while ensuring compliance with corporate standards. Reviewed applications and made key lending decisions based on underwriting material. Supportively directed a team of 8 Relationship Managers."
good,TCF Bank was all about convenience and the hours. It was open 7 days a week for long hours. The company focused on cross-sell as well as in-aisle activities.
good,"I have learned to set goals and to make sure I meet each of it. I make sure obstacles do not hinder me from reaching my goals, but instead should inspire me to exert more. I believe the new position I am applying for will enable me to reach up higher and be more successful."

good,"As an employee, I was able to learn all aspects of the bank, from management , operations and customer service. I enjoyed helping clients with their financial needs."
good,SLK has built very good reputation with Fifth Third and has always been excelling in completing deadlines. Of course we couldn't have met the deadlines without the help of Fifth Third Management.
good,Coming from a much larger institution it was nice to work at a regional bank that allows for local decision making. Overall it has been a good working environment.

good,Stable work environment with opportunities for growth and movement within the corporate headquarters in Cincinnati as well as with ancillary service providers and affiliates.
good,"Then again what job in corporate America isn't? "
good,"I worked in a few different areas at the bank including customer service and investments.  As an administrative assistant my day was spent making appointments, spreadsheets, filing and some data entry.  In customer service I answered caller questions on accounts and loans as well as cash handling, balancing and various reports."
good,Worked in an in-store branch. This gave a different approach to banking. Required creative approaches to banking. Small staff.
good,"The company is very good to their employees, there is a lot of opporunity for growth if you take it in your own hands. A lot of hard work will get you a long way."
good,"The culture of the company may vary. The pay is not good. But that's banking for you. They hire people from anywhere. High school graduates, drop outs. Your going to have to work with people who aren't on the same university level you may have. Only position that's good enough is a regional manager and up. anything below that is pretty much a headache and they always set point goals and targets that get met most of the time. Everyone chews each other out. ONE DAY THEY CHERISH YOU. THE NEXT DAY THEY DESPISE YOU. ONE DAY YOUR THE TOP PERFORMER, THE NEXT DAY YOU CAN BE LACKING FOR NO REASON. When you ask for a raise they make up excuses on your job performance making you feel like bad like your not ever good enough. But crazy thing is that the day before your managers told you how great you were and how well your numbers are. That your performing so excellent. they dont wanna pay you more. your just a slave promised the land you work on."
good,I learned a lot about the financial industry. Coworkers were great along with a very extensive training program which taught everything you needed for basic transactions

good,"Work in the incoming customer call center where I received calls from clients regarding personal and business accounts.  I handled questions and concerns with checking, savings, credit card, installment loan and mortgage loan accounts.  Escalated and/or directed clients to different departments as necessary.  When needed, I also served as a mentor to new agents placed on the floor for training and was part of several focus groups for the bank."
good,Fifth Third Bank gave me the tools to do my job.  My co workers were all well trained.
good,A typical day at work usually assisting customers in their transactions. I like my co workers and once a month we like to hang out together as a stress reliever from work. The hardest part of my job is the hours are not to flexible. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers.
good,"Keep in mind, I worked for Fifth Third Bank from January 1992-August 1995. My typical workday would consist of gathering the reports needed for the day's work, completing daily tasks such as balancing accounts, answering phones and handling any customer questions or department requests, and finally anything my supervisor would require."
good,Amazing client to work with.Gained a lot of knowledge in Banking and finance domain relate to mortgage concepts
good,I did enjoyed working for 5/3 bank but the timing wasn't the right one.
good,"Fifth is a very relaxing, productive and fun workplace. It is a good start if you want a career in the banking or sales industry. Depends on who your co-workers are, can be fun or can be your worst nightmare. Hardest part of the job is when coworkers are not doing their part then that put a workload on your shoulder, make you don't want to be there. Most enjoyable part is customers, get to know them and knowing that you are here at their disposal."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in at 845 am and having a daily morning huddle with our team members. We go over previous sales and points and what we need to make goal. Throughout the day, I process transactions for customers and try to get customers transitioned to personal bankers for products that can help them financially. My co-workers were always fun to work with. Management depends on what store you work at. Some really want to help you and others wont help you advance at all. The most enjoyable part would be getting to know the customers and knowing them by name. People really like that in customer service. They used to have a better compensation program but they are changing it. You get 5.00 for every customer you get over to a personal banker. Before, if you got someone to open a credit card they would pay you 10.00. A few years before that it was 25.00. Now, no matter what you sell you get 5.00 total. Even if the customer gets a loan and a credit card in one sitting."
good,love working there and the company is a great place to work for

good,Regional bank which had success in capturing a good market share in the Louisville area.
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job is the people that i work with, they make it easy to get up and come in everyday. "
good,"•	Responsible for performing banking duties and overseeing the financial operational activities for personal accounts."
good,"A typical day at work would be handling accounts and cash. When you're not busy with the customers then filing account cards, and CAMP calls, which would be to let the customer know about products and services they were not taking on with the bank. Sales is a big and expected priority with the bank. There was always something to keep you busy. I really enjoyed my team at the office. Everyone I have met through 5/3rd bank really were genuine good people."
good,5/3 Bank is a good company to work for.  They always strived to have great customer service and to give me the tools to acheive this.  Co workers were great.  Taking phone calls all day can be tough but when you have good co workers they make it more tolerable.
good,What I had learned from this company is how to find and obtain  documents that I had never learned about along with working with the best friendly people that were willing to teach me everything that they could to benefit me down the road that did not have to & did it in a professional manner. My hardest thing about this company was to manage my tasks in a manageable way to where I would be able to maintain along with keeping track of the length of time that it was to do them with following up with a schedule.
good,work in 5/3 was hard with my life co-workers never I haved any problem none one at work or the company I like the job I love my career I enjoy what I do.
good,"good work/life balance"
good,"You will learn how to manage money, and accounts- co workers are great and professional."
good,In a typical work day at Fifth Third I processed customer transactions while referring them products that would be mutually beneficial to the customer and the bank.  I learned how to better deal with difficult customers and reasons for needing to adhere to audit compliance.  My co-workers at Fifth Third were amazing. We worked together well and had each others back. There was a diverse background of people at our branch which fostered an inclusive personal culture.  The hardest part of my job was feeling like the lowest man on the totem pole and feeling like you were invisible to higher ups because we were just tellers.  The thing I liked most about my job is the relationships that I developed with my customers and the bonds I formed with my co-workers.
good,"FTB- Management is too good."
good,In this all are comunicate with each others like managers also.
good,"Definitely a sales based company with incentive based goals.  Company focuses on team environment.  Overall, a nice place to work."
good,"The most enjoyable part is my coworkers, great atmosphere between employees from different branches. Couching from management, good communication between the departments."
good,Base salary but responsible for production. Cold calling on small to medium sized business to provide them bank solutions to enhance their business operations. Got along great with my coworkers. Most enjoyable part of my job was helping business improve there operations and help them grow. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the down turn in the commercial real estate industry and commercial appraisals coming in under what they originally paid.
good,"To come in for a shift ready to give the best customer service to customers no matter the need. Working in this environment, I have learned that no matter how furious that the customer is, there is always a way to meet there needs and soothe them so that their loyalty is kept. The management keeps everyone in positive setting so that a productive pipeline will be created. Co-workers assist one another in reaching goals, meeting referrals, seeing different opportunities, and giving answers to inquiring customers. From November to January are slower months for us. It makes it harder to reach our referral goals which is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is the fact that by just one conversation, I can potentially help someone prepare for their future or save them hundreds of dollars."
good,"i enjoyed working aty fifth third bank. i gave it my best, was always prompt."
good,Fifth Third was a great place for me to improve on my ability to interact with customers and coworkers. The job just became repetitive over time and wasn't the long term career I was searching for.
good,Fifth Third is a great place to start a career. I was promoted from part time teller to manager within 19 months. Holidays off (10/year) and fun work environment. Very big focus on customer service.
good,Very good atmosphere to work together and learn. We together exceeded client expectations.
good,"Great company. Would have loved to stay there, but advancement is based on the ""good old boy"" system...."

good,Incredible company that has a lot of incentives for employees from bonuses to vacation buy options to employee engagement functions. Overall fun and enthusiastic place to work.
good,Audit Consumer Lending loans
good,Growing Regional Bank that needs serious growth in Georgia.  Small presence in Ga is a drawback in hiring.  Good loan products and opportunity to do well
good,Typical work environment for large bank. I loved having the ability to work from home and had a wonderful manager. I ended up leaving for an opportunity to work closer to home.
good,The computers systems will go down about 3 to 4 times a month leaving you unable to do anything. YOu will be pulled in 20 different directions daily but still expected to make monthly goals.
good,"If, you enjoy sale this is place to be it is highly sales driven good benefits and bonus for targeting sales goals host weekly sales meetings with team leads."
good,Pay was good. I learned alot. Many advancement opportunities. I enjoyed the customers. Benefits were excellent. I would recommend. Lots of room for advancement.
good,"I, for the most part, enjoyed working there. Competitive, but attainable. Management showed favoritism; because of interest in a fellow co-worker. Smh"
good,The Bank consistently focuses on giving employees the ability to take trainings for career development. Monthly and / or Weekly online trainings are provided.
good,"Despite management at the first branch I was at being an overgrown spoiled child who never should have been a manager, the staff was amazing, and I loved the job. However, when I moved and transferred to a new branch, the managers there were from small towns and thus the small town stereotype applied. They didn't follow procedures or laws and cut my hours down to almost nothing because I was the only one there who knew how banks actually worked after having been trained by a real auditor. The whole place was a joke, so I quit. But the job was good and the company was good."
good,"Large and diverse territory to manage in multiple states. Performed detailed ADA inspections in addition to annual properties inspections, identified deficiencies, and made necessary improvements in order to maintain the assets."
good,"Fifth Third Bank was a driven, competitive place to work. If you were willing to put in the long hours and show measurable results, you are well rewarded."
good,"My day began with executing opening procedures, ensuring daily operations run  smoothly, obtain and maintaining clients both business and personally through consultative selling skills, teaching financial literacy, assisting clients in obtaining loans,credit cards, build or rebuild credit, and build or rebuild financial portfolio."
good,Good place to work.  Fast paced but good environment to work in.  They cared about their employees and very appreciative of hard workers.  Plenty of room for advancement.
good,"Great co-workers. Compensation not competitive. Management unable to separate business relationships from friendships. No growth potential, unless you were friends with the manager or VP."
good,"I was lucky to have fantastic management at my branch that was very involved, understanding, and promoted a positive and fun work place. However, pressure from the upper management was intense in terms of making sales and revenue goals and often at odds with the culture and possibilities in a given area a branch might serve."
good,"I wish they didn't get bought out. Here in saint louis there was just too much competition with other bigger banks."
good,Great first job with ability to advance if at the right location. If you are stuck in a bad branch it is impossible to advance because upper management doesn’t look at you or your branch.
good,"I worked at Fifth Third for nearly 8 years.  I found that if I worked hard, didn't spread negativity, and meet or exceeded my goals, I was treated VERY fairly.  You have to embrace change in the banking industry.  A lot of employees fought change and found themselves struggling to keep up. "
good,"During my time at Fifth Third I was excited to be in my position. My things made me proud to work there. However, as I got to know the team the gossip started to make the culture in the office go down hill quick. There was a few other things that happened that I don`t wish to share. But it forced me to give my two week notice."
good,I was just working in a project here in FTB. So I cannot comment on the company. My stay in the project was also very short. So ideally I cannot be commenting anything here
good,Every branch does things different but it wasn't a very welcoming staff to come to. 5/3 has been around for a while and so hve the employees. The rules are always changing and very very competitive.
good,Enjoyed over 6 years tgere til recession caused lay offs. Had great departments. Very business drivin but no advancement opportunities.had there been no recession I would still be there.
good,I loved working here the only downfall for me is the long hours because I worked in a bank mart! The commission sucks because the area I worked was lower income area so not to many people have money to open new accounts.
good,The IT department is a good place to work.  The pay is great and there seems to be room to grow.  There is a lot of off shore position and workers.  Be ready for that
good,I have had a good experience over the past 6.5 years and feel it is a great place in the tri-state area to work. They truly are trying to be the best in technology and customer service for customer in our foot print.
good,Great job with growth opportunists and valuable work experience. Pay is low for most of the retail locations for the responsibility and skill level that is required.
good,"Consultant for special Enterprise project. Management team was very welcoming and treated consultants fairly and with respect, which sometimes doesn't happen in the consulting world. Management valued my contributions to the project and put a lot of responsibility and accountability on me. Had ability to work remotely as-needed, which was a plus."
good,Can be fun just don't like when you learn a skill your pay don't increase the hr are good but I don't like we're you have to work a Saturday they manage is pretty good great that they have a ATM
good,Pretty stable company to work for. Raises not that great. Can make incentive in lockbox when there is enough work. It's a pretty layed back atmosphere can listen to your audio device while working.
good,"Good company, professional atmosphere, flexible schedule, able to work from home, but hard to move up in the company. Working with a lot of third party vendors is a challenge at times."
good,Company had a good culture and is very big on community involvement. Very sales driven and focuses on growth of offices.
good,"Excellent older, slower to adapt bank with minimal technology investment, very conservative appetites but amazing rates. Great overall place to learn banking from the inside out."
good,On a daily basis i will motivate customers to join the bank services and then keep them satisfied with our services and products.I learned how pursuit the escellence in services and goals oriented to the institution goals. The management side work properly offering support constantly. The co-workers workj independently in their own goals. The hardest part of a day was when you didnt bring a customer to the institution. The most enjoyable part was when we close a good deal that produce benefit to the Institution and money to my pocket.
good,"just ok not great management, not client driven, long hours, very sales driven and always changing companies vision, not a lot of room for advancement tend to hire outside company, salaries and benefits are excellent tough, the people are excellent"
good,"It's Starbucks. Not much more to say. They take care of their employees and the perks are fantastic. Fast and fun work environment, and plenty of room to grow if the time is put in. Management is strange and often promoted haphazardly. Make a mental note to work with and above the store manager to progress."
good,I worked as a teller under lealia evans at the douglass loop branch. The environment was great. but upper management did little to advance current employees. that was the downfall
good,"Fifth Third Bank was a rewarding and challenging workplace. Opportunities for development were available as positions opened, no formal development plan existed during my tenure. Company politics impacted many decisions made daily."
good,"I enjoyed the goals that were set and being able to meet them in a timely fashion, this opportunity really tested character"
good,"I spend most of the day collaborating with attorneys and their staff members; ensuring that the foreclosure process proceeds in a timely manner.  I have learned that communication is key, within the workplace, with my fellow co-workers, and with our venders. The best part of my job is being able to turn on my music, zone in and for the most part work independently with minimal distractions.  The worst would be the monotony at times.  I like to stay busy, and enjoy challenges."
good,"Very enjoyable, safe enviroment."
good,"I enjoyed my job the financial world. I learned a lot being in this business. Customer Service is a very rewarding job. I loved my job and  my customers. Met a lot of people and connections."
good,"good management if you find the right branch. nice place, very involved with the community"
good,"Worked on sales proposals from start to finish"
good,"I love my coworkers, we are all able to get along in our close work space and hold each other accountable for responsibilities. I've learned that it is important to be very clear to ensure that you are doing exactly what the customer needs/asked."
good,Worked here for 7.5 years and then my position was eliminated. I was sad to go
good,"I started my Job at 7 am, Monday through Friday. I took a half hour lunch and my day ended at 3:30pm. "
good,A lot of perks if your a top producer.  Work hard and there is room for advancement if you want to move up or lateral.
good,Fifth Third offered strong growth potential in the sales area but operations was being moved to Cincinnati.
good,I love my co-workers. I have very sporadic interaction with upper level management in the department because of the hours I work. The hardest part about my job is working third shift so long. It is hard to balance life and work because of working third shift.
good,"High energy; production required; need excellent management skills to maintain goals, due dates, etc."
good,"delivered the mail within the company to 31 floors of the downtown mail operations branch . then worked on a machine that moved 100,000 pieces of mail per hour"
good,Was an engaging fun environment. Now it's cutthroat and backstabbing.
good,I have been with Fifth Third Bank for years. It provides great work/life balance.
good,This was a great place to work when I was starting out in banking. The training was wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the sales part because I felt like I was in fear of my job every month if I did not meet my sales goals.
good,"The benefits are great but management was terrible. Although, they listen to the employees and fired some of them. If you like customer service and working from a cubicle with no window around; this is perfect. The good thing is that there is opportunity to grow with in the company and there is compensation for your hard work.  You can easily earn a few hundreds for doing a good job.  However, people do no stay very long."
good,"Fifth Third has been a stable, if slow-moving (career-wise) place to work.  I enjoy my direct management, and have no issues with upper management.  Pay/benefits are below average."
good,"Pay: appropriate "
good,"Run of the mill bank with plenty of advancement opportunities IF you know the correct people.  Excellent benefits, including health insurance (Go365), discounts, and concierge services."
good,Good Bank to work for.  Partners are all professional.  Most difficult obstacle is the sheer fact that it is bankingm which is highly regulated..  Good benefits and culture.
good,"Worked a standard 9-5 M-F, held Commercial Client Specialist position as well as the administrator for CRM. Supported over seventy five individuals from local Western Michigan to the National Equip finance group."
good,Fifth Third is constantly improving in the developer realm. Both the workers and project are continuously innovative and fun to work on. I had a great time working there and developing my skills as well as produce quality products.
good,5/3 is a good place to start your career in banking- decent training but the ability to move up from lower level jobs such as teller is poor. Start with a degree as a banker and move up from there.
good,It was hard to advance to a level I was qualified for because I was in a position that I was overqualified for.  They couldn’t justify my leap from a level 8 employee to a level 14 employee even though I had the qualifications for it so basically I was encouraged to quit and come back.
good,"Working at Fifth Third was a great experience I loved the management, and the people I worked with. They offered great benefits but I thought the pay could have been better."
good,"Unbelievable compensation and benefits package"
good,"The pay is decent and the benefits are pretty good, The work life balance however is terrible depending on if you work at a traditional branch or a bank mart."
good,"Working at fifth third, they offer a good salary but don’t allow over time. It can be stressful since they are a goal oriented bank and do not pay commission. The manager at the location I worked at work there own hours and don’t follow the leadership that they preach about. Some managers do not look into providing good service to the customer but just are goal oriented."
good,I enjoyed working at Fifth Third. I worked in two different locations in two different cities. My manager was kind and senior management seemed to care about the culture in the office. Employee relations actually listened when an issue was brought to them and took action. You felt valued.
good,"Good career advancement opportunities, with managers and HR being very willing to help grow and move people into roles that will help their career and keep them interested."
good,"I have no real complaints regarding Fifth Third.  My position was eliminated, there was no reason for any bitterness and nothing I could have done to prevent the loss.  Management was always helpful, there was room for advancement, work/life balance was good, benefits and salary were good, no real negatives."
good,"Fifth Third is a solid company. They provide great benefits and have reasonable hours for everyone except the managers. The managers tend to work 50 plus hours a week because of sales meetings, staffing, reviews, client calls, etc."
good,Fast paced work environment. Good company. Management empowers staff to make decisions to help achieve corporate profit goals and to maintain and gain market share.
good,"Fifth Third Bank has a good overall culture and tries to encourage employees to have a sustainable work/life balance.  The Bank, like most other large financial institutions, is facing challenges from a slow moving economy and significant regulatory burden."
good,"I have medical problems, but they hired me anyway.  Over the past 10 years, they pretty much accepted my medical problems and limitations, but still insisted i follow company policy.  Eventually got to the place where my problems interfered too much with my work and they let me go."
good,"It was a very hard job but the pros out weigh the cons. I would work there again.The coworkers there was very friendly and easy to get along with. Also, they were willing to help out if you didn't know something."
good,"With the decline in need for brick-and-mortar retail bank branches, bankers are crossing over to the investment world by becoming ""investment representatives"" - i.e. licensed personal bankers. These ""investment representatives"" now have two roles, each role with their own set of goals. Let's add in the short staffing that's so prevalent in retail banking. This gives us the investment rep that runs a teller window, performs cash audits, all the while being expected to meet performance goals. In theory, this role would provide experience allowing one to gradually transition to investment banking; in practice, one is oftentimes left feeling mentally and physically exhausted. On the bright side? Your workdays go by super quick!"
good,"I learned a great deal from Fifth Third, there were many seminars and work shops to attend. "
good,"5/3 bank is a nice work place to work at..People are compassionate and understanding."
good,"Hard for women to move ahead. It's all about who you know, not what talent you bring. I learned a lot in the roles that I had, but some of the managers can be very gossipy."
good,"Fun place to work. Great customers good coworkers. It is hard to take off for doc appts etc. I didn't like the push for us to get customers to apply for credit cards though,"
good,"The great thing about this company is that it focuses on work/life balance. They make sure that you don't get overworked and they help you stay on track. Unfortunately, overtime is frowned upon and going over by five minutes will have you speaking with management about your time. Also, it is a sales environment but they push mobile banking which eliminates customers from visiting the branch. They want to make banking as convenient as possible for the customers but they also want as many customers to come in as well. This reason as well as the inability to move up due to limited options caused me to explore other options outside the company."
good,Be at your desk on time and ready to take calls. Make sure you have all your tools up and running. Every 2-3 hours you get a break. Calls are back to back. One of the hardest part is every call is a new call. If someone was rude to you on a call you have to let that go before you take a new call. Most days are enjoyable.
good,"The Banking Center I worked at was fine. The employees are what made it a desirable place to work, unfortunately there are not enough branches that operate like ours did."
good,"Very good people, but challenged by large company issues.  Slow to change and adopt technology.  Seemed like there was always some type of restructuring going on."
good,The hardest part of the job was adjusting to any management changes.  Solid workplace culture with plenty o encouragement.  Typical workday involved a few hours of skip tracing in the morning with manual calls the remaining hours.
good,"Call Center environment where volume matters. While there may be pay increases, the opportunity for true advancement is slim to none. However the benefits are good."
good,"A bit 'cliquey' but overall a good place to work.  Good opportunity to move to different jobs.  Good salary, good work/life balance, very diverse employees."
good,Working in the financial/banking industry is a great way to develop as a professional.  There's a lot of rigor in our processes that forces you to be agile and creative.
good,"Good place to work. Coworkers were the best. Loved flexibility in job and ability to work in cross disciplines over my career. Experienced, hard working and best in class employees."
good,This job was very detailed oriented and involved thinking on your feet  and making sure you worked as a team to resolve technical issues with devices that the bank owned that different businesses used within their establishment.
good,the company gets their money worth when they work you don't have a staff arrangement since they increased a teller description not much of a raise but they expect a lot of you
good,"What started off as a summer job became so much more. I started as a teller and learned as quickly as possible all of the duties and responsibilities that came with my job. As we were a high volume, high cash branch I would handle anywhere between $10,000 and $100,000 on a daily basis. I was extremely time efficient and when things were running slowly I would help the manager with tasks that were above my pay grade, which eventually led to a promotion. Being the youngest and employed the least amount of time this was a great accomplishment. I enjoyed having a steady 30-35 hour work week while at school and 35-38 hours while on breaks from school."
good,"supervise financial center and drive P&L for income growth."
good,"5/3 was awesome. I learned so much about people and finance. I was a victim of a "" Morning "
good,"Working for the bank was quite wonderful. With my position, I ""floated"" around to different branches where they needed an extra set of hands and assisted where applicable."
good,"The company overall has great leadership focus, but needs help at the local level. The local affiliate has 40% turnover and there's a reason for that - engagement."
good,"Worked in back office, decent work environment and people. Pay and benefits were good, but culture could be a bit toxic at times."
good,I really enjoyed the sales portion of banking just did not enjoy the micro managing and the customer complaints portion.
good,"I have seen a lot of people grow and thrive there, but with my degree I have outgrown what Fifth Third has to offer in the Grand Rapids area.  You learn a lot about the banking industry and how to handle objections and deescalate customers.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the people there."
good,Good employees to work with overall. Very good compensation plan. Long hours. Training program could be enhanced.
good,"Responsible for complex teller transactions, policies and procedures while also creating a great customer experience. Took the lead in many in-store sales competitions. Expected to uncover a need for new products for customers such as credit cards, investment services, and other basic banking products."
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a large bancorp headquartered in Cincinnati, OH."
good,The work environment was productive to where all members in the office worked together for for a common cause - keeping the company vision in mind.
good,Large company that has not forgotten the importance of local presence and flavor. Fifth Third is staffed by friendly hardworking and competitive people who truly want to deliver for their customers.
good,Working with the top Mortgage Loan Officer is a very busy day from start to finish.  She has taught me a lot about the Mortage Business and how to get loans processed through the system quickly and cleanly with as little effort from the client as necessary.  The people I have worked with here are top notch and I have made several life time friends.  To stay on top of the details of the volume of business we do requires focus every minute of the day but at the end of the day we are making peoples dream come true of owning a home and it is all worth it.
good,I have been exposed to so many fronts in the world of banking. I am prepared to join the big boys without studying in this field in college. BTW they do have tuition reimbursement.
good,"- I was the Administrative Assistant for multiple Attorneys."
good,"First bank I ever worked for, If you are good at sales and you do well everyone is your fan. If you are not good at sales you better be good at operational stuff, otherwise you will not last. Sales are everything, they dont really care about the customer, or you for that matter, just sales. Its a good place to start though because 5/3 does train you well and other banks know it, so its a good stepping stone into other banks."
good,"Worked with internal clients, stakeholders, data architects, and database teams to develop and enhance an enterprise infrastructure solution that provides key end clients throughout the company with robust analytics and reporting. Responsible for gathering requirements, designing, rolling out analytics and reporting solutions, and end user training of OBIEE functionality."
good,"The day began at 7am with conference calls regarding goal production and ended at 7:30pm with calls regarding results. If every member participated then the day ended successfully. Upper management was supportive but demanding and every day was a new start. Yesterdays achievements were applauded but today we had to provide service and reach our goals. The hardest part of the job was to keep the staff motivated daily and not allow anyone to get burned out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendship among staff that was formed. The members of the branch actually became a family, where everyone helped and supported each other. I no longer work at the bank, but still have contact with my previous coworker."
good,Strong values in customer service and employee retention.
good," Conduct customer banking transactions in a friendly, accurate, and timely manner to ensure operational efficiency."
good,I enjoyed my job and got along well with my co-workers. I would go in the morning and help open the bank and close at least 2 nights a week.
good,"A typical day at work, was to stay busy and keep the customers satisified."
good,This is a good and stable company. The only downfall is that they hire out of country people to do their collections.
good,"Great place to start banking career, really helpful in encouraging you to move up the ladder. Compensation could be better but for the most part great environment"
good,Days can be long. The Bank offers online learning class free to all employees. Management is playing catch up to current trends but seem to be closing the gap. Good boy culture.
good,"I've worked here for nearly 11 years, Fifth Third is a really inclusive company that takes care of its employees.   I initially started as a contractor and was later offered a full time position.  The company also is very big on hiring/ promoting from within."
good,"Limited stress with an overall focus on career development. The company has lots of growth opportunities in specific markets.  Minimum wage has increased for Tellers  from $15,00/hr to $18.00//hr"
good,I’ve been with the bank for almost 5 years now and I can say that overall I’ve enjoyed my time here. I would recommend this as a place to work to friends.
good,Flexibility of work location and remote is very rewarding. Their compensation package and re-location package is competitive as well as their 401(k) match.
good,"They hire as little staff as possible and expect the most production as possible. Customers are sometimes not very understanding and rude. The culture is ideal on paper, but not some managers coach to unrealistic expectations that drive away good employees."
good,"I loved working for Fifth Third Bank. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and each day was different. If you do not enjoy working with people or helping others with their financial issues, this job is not for you. I left the job because of poor management. This job is very competitive and puts you down if you do not meet monthly goals, that you have no control over."
good,"I enjoyed being a teller, but I was terrible at selling customers on new accounts or credit cards. I started making too many mistakes because I was nervous about selling things."
good,It's a fun place to work. But depending on the branch you go to. It's too much favoritism. Management do too many stuff that shouldn't be done. But comes down on you when you've done something by mistake.
good,Company has many openings for personnel to start careers our of college.  They offer great opportunities to advance your way thru their company if you have the desire to work their the remainder of your life.
good,I had come from a mortgage company so the atmosphere was much more relaxed. For me this position was more of a waiting room because they stressed things with so much importance that did not seem to match with what they were asking of you. The job was not for me but if you enjoy the financial industry and customer service this job might be exactly what you're looking for.
good,"The bank relies on it's core values: Respect and Inclusion, integrity, teamwork and collaboration, and accountability. They see themselves as one bank."
good,"Fifth Third Bank feels more like family at least in the Central Florida Market.  Great benefits including 401K matching up to 7%. Vacation, medical, sick days pretty similar to the other banks out there."
good,I LOVED my job at Fifth Third.  I had a great team to work with.  We were a respected group within the bank.  Our recommendations were received and considered.
good,The checks were brought in from each branch were coded with the amount as well as account information.  This was done through a specialized coding machine
good,"I love what I do at 5/3,but the career advancement opportunity is not there. I have been given SEVERAL empty promises and no pay raises. The higher management above FCM is unfair, judgemental and I don't believe they have strong moral support for all races."
good,"Can be a great place to work, benefits are great. Pay is on the lower side of the industry. Definitely room for advancement, but like most jobs it is a constant rat race. There can be some pettiness you might have to deal with depending on your manager, but overall it can be a great place to work."
good,Fifth Third Bank offers great opportunities for their employees to contribute their ideas for improvements. It was a positive experience working for them.
good,"Being a Customer Service Rep is incredibly difficult and they should be paid more with better incentives (or no incentives and just a better hourly rate). I had a great experiences with management and coworkers, but the other branches of the company have no idea how hard it is to work in the Retail division!"
good,"Good company to start with but due to bad management, most are ready to move on. Very aggressive micromanagement in certain departments with no reason behind it"
good,"high speed volume,management interaction a plus fun place to work ,lack of work certain times of year,will train you in other areas of job,never boring"
good,Great company to work for.  Very close and small environment to work in. Offers flexible work schedule.   Hiring process is too long  generally takes 3monrhs to replace .  poor management .
good,"Fifth Third was a good place to work. Management was good. They encouraged you to grow and offered opportunities for advancement."
good,"great company to work for but pay was fairly low and not much room for advancement"
good,"This was a really great job, the manager was the least to be desired, he cared more about lining his back pocket then he did about his employees, he would hover over you while you worked, just very uncomfortable, everything else about this job was great."
good,"Normal day at work "
good,"i work were the brinks trucks came in doing the night and day. It was a fast pace job because we were dealing with "
good,There are many roles in the operation departments.  Chances for advancement as well as lateral moves are available.
good,"Fifth Third Bank is overall a good company to work for. Benefits were good, and the employee work-life balance was great.  On the one-hand it values its employees, but on the other; there are reductions in workforce to bring in younger, less expensive talent.  I appreciated the relationships I made over the years."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of opening the branch, auditing teller drawers, taking care of customers at teller line, ordering cash for bank, etc."
good,As a high school graduate I feel like my compensation for my age is acceptable. The main issue I have with Fifth Third Bank is as a Personal Banker you're really a Bank salesman. My opinion the job should be more customer centric with incentive for sales instead of sales being the primary focus of the job.
good,"This was a great experience and had I not been recruited away, I would have stayed.  I did think the salary was very low vs the amount of hours and complexity of workload, but I think that is the banking industry in general."
good,I worked at Fifth Third Bank through a temp agency. Overall Fifth Third Bank is a great place to advance. The management is great with being patient and helping you with your needs
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, how close you become and more like family. Take elearnings your refresh your self on new products."
good,"Fifth Third has a great team of people. They are what make this organization great.There is however a disconnect in the CAO initiatives to develop and retain employees and the actual practice.To advance, people often leave for other companies, then return a couple of years later. Employee self-development is not really achievable with current work capacity loads."
good,Handling customers transactions and answering questions and service calls  . If a customer needs assistance with Spanish I will sit in with bankers to interpret.
good,"Working 4-5 hours a night shift after bank closes.  I learned its fast paced environment with data entry.  Quiet and everyone focuses their performance and speed skills and making sure there is no errors."
good,"Overall very good company.  Mostly managed from corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Large regional bank.  Good retail footprint in Florida.  Good salary, good benefits, good technology, and good people.  The State of Florida has noticed frequent management changes and strategic business plan directions through the past few years."
good,"Good sales job, management was consistently more concerned with sales numbers than they were with creating a positive team environment or taking care of the customers, however if you can live with the business side of that then there are plenty of advancement opportunities."
good,This was a very enjoyable place to work. We had various events throughout the time I worked there to keep people connected and not too stressed out. I had great experiences with most of the staff members I spoke with.
good,"Great place to work, you get to build relationships with customers. Days are pretty predictable but sometimes you have issues that arise, company wants you to try to sale products."
good,"Everyone i have really come in contact with at fifth third is very nice and respectful. I like the culture there and the advancement in career. Rachaad El'Horr was THE BEST boss ever, loved him!"
good,The retail banking space changed significantly over the last 5 years. There were less employees but more work was required. Opportunities to grow was limited based on location.
good,It is a good place to work. Great benefits including 401k plans and healthcare plans. Great working culture. Would recommand to people who are trying to move up in the retail.
good,mainframe computer analysts. development and testing of computer software for merchant banking system. team oriented and individual project. ability to problem solve with efficiency and accuracy.
good,Great work environment with supportive management. Good advancement opportunities with goal driven support. Room for growth with knowledge and experience in various Loss Mitigation roles with effective crosstraining oppurtunies.
good,"I was given all the tools I needed to be successful. Management was supportive of my innovative ideas which I liked the most. It helped with the most challenging environments, making all my days great."
good,"In the morning we would arrive. After arriving securing the building was the most important thing to do in the morning. I would open the vault to get the cash drawers out and necessary keys to work that day. We would have a 20 minute meeting on our plan for the day to meet our branch goal and things we need to improve on. We would also do conference calls with other branches and with our investment executive. At 9:00 a.m. we would open the branch by unlocking all the doors, opening the drive-thru window and turning on the open lights. Plus, logging into our computer system and making sure transactions were going to run smooth for the day. I would wait on the early customers and when I got a break I would check my emails and how many referrals I had for the month. Our goal for referrals was 13 per month but I always exceeded that by 150% with one month exceeding by 350% of my 13 referral goal. My daily tasks included customer service, answering phones, helping customers with problems and using my multi-tasking skills. When I was the vault teller I would give the other teller money when needed. I would balance the vault at the end of every day and also balance my teller drawer. On vault shipment days I would get the shipment ready for Brinks. I was in control of over $100,000 ever single day."
good,very good atmosphere supportive at work and had fun working at place with all needs learned very well in each development in project..
good,You got to meet new people all the time. learned its a must to get along with co workers make job more easier.  Customer service reps were always willing to help you if you had a problem you couldn't fix.
good,I acquired alot of good skills working for Fifth Third Bank. I got good exposure to managment when it came to managing the branch as I would be acting branch manager when the GM was out or making business calls
good,I enjoy working for Fifth Third because I feel that there is a great customer first culture and an environment that supports employee growth and empowerment.
good,"Fifth Third Bank was by far, the best Financial Institute to work."
good,"-Culture can burn you out over time since many of the long timers believed in arriving at 7:00AM and leaving at 6:00PM."
good,"High-stress call center work. People calling about why their account is over drawn, why they haven't gotten their credit card in the mail, and dozens of other questions. If you are easily upset by rude customers, pass or your ulcers will have ulcers. You need to be self-motivated to teach yourself, management is inconsistent and will punish you for lack of knowledge. The redeeming point at this job was you could easily make lots of overtime money, they're always busy. And you will come to love the people you work with, and if you're good at your job, you will learn LOTS. And not just about banking, but business as a whole. I hated working here, but I would not trade the experience I gained after 5 years."
good,"A typical day at work was meeting new people, establishing professional relationships and dealing with a lot of money. I learned the best and worst of my personality while dealing with people from different walks of life. Management improved with time and were very supportive. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a secured environment for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was sales, coaching, and training the public as well as co-workers how to build relationships."
good,Competitive environment with plenty of opportunity to move upwards. On the retail side there branches are tightly staffed making it very difficult to meet individual goals.
good,"While at Fifth Third, I worked for 4 of the best managers that I have worked for in my career, as I progress throughout my career."
good,"Sitting at a computer answering calls 8hrs/day. Listening skills, anticipating customer needs, and knowledge make for a better work experience. The benefits were great."
good,Fifth Third Bank is an overall well-rounded company.  They provide competitive benefits and opportunities for growth and advancement to their internal employees.
good,"A typical day consists of running transactions for customers, developing the trust necessary to start to recommend products, then finding needs for those customers."
good,"Busy typical work day made the time go fast,  a lot of walking was the hardest part of the work day, coworkers helping each other a plus, Management too easy"
good,Assist customers in day-to-day transactions.  Refer products and services to business partners.  Open new accounts for customers.  Make phone calls to attract new business.
good,A typical day is spent either in a rush or completing E-Learnings  to better my knowledge about the company and our products.  I've learned a lot about asking open-ended questions to deepen client relationships.
good,I have been with this company over six years now and still love being here! The culture is geared toward employee engagement which helps keep everyone motivated to achieve success.
good,I have worked at Fifth Third for almost two years and have enjoyed my time there. It is a busy and productive workplace with each day presenting new challenges. I've had many opportunities for advancement and have benefited from the training of those with more experience and also had the opportunity to train new team members. My typical day involved working with customers and helped me refine my communication and customer service skills.
good,great place to work at the corporate level just expect the unexpected and become an agent of change
good,"Successful company out of Cincinnati, OH geared towards great pay, benefits, and advancement"
good,good work life balance and room for advancement. Build great relationships.
good,This company offers a window of opportunity for numerous of people. They also will give you a starting block to start your career in the banking field.
good,"Great company, not enough staff. Great benefits such as 401K, paid sick time, vacay time. Selling and referring is part of the job but not extremely pushy about goals."
good,"A typical day at work was helping people any way that i could. i learned that the customer always came first. i enjoyed working with all my supervisors and my co workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a customer when their account was overdrawn. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that i got to meet, my co workers and my supervisors"
good,"A typical day at work was very  productive, motivated and positive."
good,"computer, customer service, money handling"
good,Great place to work. i would recommend this company to anyone looking for a long term career
good,Good place to work but I am not located in bank area so the visibility is poor.
good,"A typical day consisted of balancing money for ATM and operation of daily operation for the branch, opening checking/saving accounts, loans and resolving errors. My co-workers were excellent and fun to be around. Management was available when needed,"
good,I learned a lot about their products and they kept us up to date on compliance.  A typical workday was busy with processing loans and contact with customers.  My co-workers were great.  We were always helping each other with issues that came up.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  We felt like family.    The hardest part was when everyone got laid off.  Management was good right up to the end.   They made sure we were taken care of.
good,"Proposed and initiated consultative solutions to C-Level management and staff within middle market businesses."
good,"I was a teller many, many years ago and always loved working with people and handling money.  After raising my children and taking on part-time jobs, I really missed the banking environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is providing customer service and problem solution each day. The hardest part of the job is balancing work and personal life and that the job can become monotonous. The leaders of Fifth Third look for new ways to complete tasks and provide customer assistance. This has its benefits but also drawbacks because positions are increasingly being eliminated.
good,"I started with 5/3 bank while living in Dayton, Ohio and absolutely loved working with my co-workers and customers. I was a lead teller and respected by my management team. I could always count on them to have my back. When I divorced my husband, I moved to Fremont, Oh to be with my parents. I transferred to the Bowling Green Downtown branch until an open became available to me in Fremont. I always enjoyed getting to know my customers and knowing what their needs were and going the extra mile to help them out. The hardest part of the job for me was pushing products onto customers that I knew that they did not want or would benefit from. I am not a salesman and felt I was pushed into this role. I wanted to start putting my Administrative skills to work so started looking for other employment opportunities. This is what I was going to Terra Community College for."
good,"Every day is different and priorities shift constantly.  I've been in banking most of my working career and have learned a lot about the variety of services offered by the 5 core business lines and how they are integrated.  The last few years I've become more involved in the Diversity/Inclusion Council and learned how important diversity is to business."
good,"love my co-workers, very involved in the community, Learned a lot about commerical loan underwriting and high net work client focus."
good,"A well balanced employer, with specialty in production and customer service."
good,"I worked at the CSC in Grand Rapids, MI and the MOC in Cincinnati, OH on the phone for two years now. I love the people, the asisstance, and the opportunities. After two years it does get repetitive and burned out. "
good,Enjoyed working for company with great pay and benefits...not a lot of advancement opportunity.
good,"I've been working with Fifth Third Bank for over 7years I love working with the relationships that I had formed with the bank, A typical day at work is fun,interesting and no day is quite the same, The hardest part of this job is having a quota to collect on cars that have already been repossessed, I've learned that everybody has struggles and I have to not always put my heart in each case I deal with."
good,"There is a lot of micromanaging in my department. No cell phones allowed out, minimal break times, scheduled lunches."

good,I earned a lot of experience and learned a lot from this job. I enjoyed working here very much and they always gave you opportunity for advancement.
good,"Fifth Third has an incredible culture in its workforce. There are ample opportunities to learn and tools to help oneself succeed. Compensation is fair compared to other banking jobs. There is some problem with under-staffing. Workers can be expected to wear many different ""hats."""
good,"Co-workers are very friendly and strive for team work and stability. Open to employee values and opinions,"
good,"I am a hard worker. I am usually the first to arrive at work and the last to leave. I am easy to teach and I like to learn new things. I have been managing staff for a very long time. I get along with all my co workers and are always willing to help. The hardest part of my job is customer screaming at me, but the most enjoyable is most of the time the customer leaves as a satisfied customer. I have learned that as long as you can justify the reasoning for a situation with a customer, they will be satified with the outcome most of the time. Customer service is the most imprtant part of any job."
good,"working for fifth third bank was a great experience. i loved the people there very friendly, management always tried to work with you if you were having a problem, hardest part was getting out at a decent time, most enjoyable part was trying to work as fast as you can without making mistakes to earn that incentive pay."
good,Overall Fifth Third Bank is a conservative institution. Its lending requirement are cautiously moderate and purposeful.
good,"Fifth Third does a great job with onboarding new employees and setting them up for success.  "
good,Pleasant job experience. Coworkers were fine. Training opportunities were good. The hardest part of the job was the sales quotas for obtaining new loans.
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a great place to work is the typical 9 to 5 work life appeals to you. They offer fairly good benefits, and frequently offer new positions. Position change within the company is not discouraged."
good,I was fortunate to have a good leader most of the time. He left and we got a terrible one. But the management network we had was so good and so well trained and experienced that we managed to keep our business running well with low turnover. I had great promotions and fantastic learning opportunities.
good,"I worked at Fifth Third Bank as a MGIC Contract Underwriter and then later as a staff underwriter.  I worked on the FHA team but as volume would increase, we assisted other teams on all products..  We were cross trained for all divisions and underwrote various products  for wholesale, retail and non del egated correspondent..  They did away with wholesale division.  I left Fifth Third for a better opportunity at FGMC in their wholesale division..  A  previous coworker highly recommended FGMC.  I interviewed by phone and they made an offer the very next business day."
good,"No real complaints. Always treated fairly and the company as a whole is trending in the right direction. Some corporate decisions may not always have the best optics, but at the end of the day, it's a business."
good,"This is a very well managed bank, your goals are clearly stated, there is a plan in place to achieve your goals and the support you need to achieve those goals. If you are driven you can quickly stand out and achieve great success with this company."
good,"I had great managers at every Fifth Third Bank branch I worked out. However, I had to leave because the hours were horrendous. Having to relocate to a branch inside a grocery store, I would routinely have to work from open at 10 am to close at 7 pm due to short staffing."
good,"Was able to  utilize some creative thinking to try and debug issues.  Certain management was great others had a lot to be desired. The hardest part of the job was getting the proper training and expected to support different parts of the business. "
good,I answer inbound customer calls. Perform maintenance on accounts and provide accurate information. I learned banking information and policies. The environment is stressful but friendly. The hardest part of the job is talking for more than 8 hours daily. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people.

good,"The managers are amazing and flexible to all of life outside of work especially family. They keep a nice smooth and easy work environment going. "
good,I have enjoyed my time here the people I work with are great and management is very nice and willing to work with you to achieve your personal goals whether it be to advance in retail or transfer internally.
good,"I loved the job because I was looking for full time and PTO. The benefits are great, you get 10 paid days off annually just starting out. Working second shift for the cash vault doesn't work well if you have children or pets. You are likely to spend up to ten hours there daily. Per check I receive 8-10 hours OT. Management is somewhat petty. Not accommodating to workers with Mental Health issues or disabilities. They get angry when you use sick time. They do try to show employee support by hosting employee engagement (pot luck)."
good,"If on a slow day I would have time to do the audit report's, I also had the vault and atm's. I would ship and place money orders. .The work place was easy and laid back everyone got along. Management was willing to help at all times. The hardest part was at the end before selling, we had no manager or assistant manager because everyone was leaving for outside positions. I enjoyed the customer's The different transactions, helping customers with bank products that I knew would benefit them."
good,I enjoyed my experience at Fifth Third.  Attorneys were great.  I learned a lot and would work there again.  Benefits were great.  Co-workers were great and are still my friends.
good,"A good place to work with well balanced life. "

good,"Served as an Information Technology Administrator responsibilities included support of the Novell Netware and Microsoft Windows server environment."
good,"My location was the busiest bank I've ever worked at and I've been in banking for 10 years. Great culture and very good bank to work for."
good,Fifth third is a good company with good benefits but the incentives were not that good and they ask for too much from their employees without supplementing them with pay.
good,"Overall, the opportunity for advancement is there with some decent competition though you won't see cut-throat environments. The technology has improved over time and I see some good things on the horizon with5/3"
good,Fifth Third Bank is a great company to work for. Customers make working for the company enjoyable. Fifth Third provides their employees with great insurance options and lots of discounts.
good,"As a float CSR/Teller, I normally worked at branches that were low on staffing. Every branch worked about the same yet were managed in different styles. I enjoyed meeting the different customers as well as the other tellers, bankers, and managers."
good,I have really enjoyed working at Fifth Third.  They make a clear attempt to make their employees lives better. They offer us a lot of benefits that most employers wouldn't spend their money on to improve our quality of life. I get a raise or two every year. It is not hard to advance in the company. They are always willing to listen to any grievances and try to make any situation better. Best company I think I've worked for.
good,"Fifth Third Bank is an excellent company to work for. I have learned so much about the baning industry, and how it continues to grow as a bank. Fifth Third is a company to learn am grow for a exemplary career in the financial industry."
good,"I applied for the job initially because they do start you a few dollars above minimum wage and provide good benefits. I currently do like my job but that is mostly because of my co-workers. I work with some great people. Unfortunately, I am only able to work 20 hours a week here. I was promoted after a year and a half and they are considering promoting me again. If you show up and work hard the company will want to keep you and promote you."
good,They pay pretty well but didn't have much growth would definitely go back to work there in the near future if a better paying position presents itself.
good,Fifth Third was my entrance into the Banking world. It was a part time position that mostly worked with the schedule I needed at the time. Management was great and there seemed to be plenty of room for growth within the company.

Working hand in hand with the state allowed us to save the bank close to $300 Million and keep countless families in their homes.
good,I love the atmosphere and the training they are willing to give you. I've been here a year and I only need 1 more thing to be a fully skilled agent. I've learned a lot in this short time.
good,Fifth Third is a large company with a small company feeling at the production level. Company programs take employee engagement and diversity seriously. The technology and equiptment are somewhat behind the curve.
good,I think it was a great company to work for.  I wish they were able to retain my  role in this city.  I would work for them again if an opportunity arose.
good,"I have been blessed with awesome managers, but Fifth Third has been the best job I've held.  Typical day varies by location.  You will have busy times (beginning of the month, paydays) and slow times (in which you can do elearnings).  As a teller you are doing deposits, withdrawals, transfers, troubleshooting customer accounts etc.  Sales are a big part of your position.  You are to identify customer needs and provide checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards etc.  Meet monthly sales goals.  In my opinion, these sales goals are rather high."
good,Was a great place to work for when it was Old Kent.  Changed things daily as how they wanted things handled.  More about volume than customer service.
good,I have enjoyed working for 5/3 bank. They offer competitive benefits and some opportunities to advance. I really enjoyed being able to volunteer within the organization
good,"Fifth Third really was a good fun place to work, But anyone investing time as their employee needs to have GREAT selling skills and good customer service. I did however love when it came to sales they didn't practice pushing product unless it truly made sense for the customer. It's to bad the pay is low for how much that is expected. Could have made a great long lasting career."

Management is hit or miss, for the most part everyone is great...once in a while there is a someone who cares only about your productivity.

If you are great at balancing your great customer service with being highly efficient on a call, it is well worth the money and benefits."
good,"High volume call center. Fast pace. Need to adapt quickly and be able to intake a lot of changes in information daily. Took over 100 calls per day related to educating and correcting  issues on customer accounts.  Coworkers and management very friendly and helpful.

good,"They reward you for your hard work, care about their employees, and know what it means to balance work/home life."
good,"My employment at Fifth Third bank was shortened too soon as a result of the volatility in the mortgage lending environment. A recent spike in interest rates resulted in reduced refinance volume and staffing had to be adjusted accordingly, including my job.  I would consider working for Fifth Third bank again given the opportunity.  "

good,"A typical day at work for me involves observation and stratergy,being in a production environments it is neccesary to have a plan and a strong desire to execute whatever you set forth to do.

good,Fifth Third is a great company to work for. Compensation and Benefits were great.
good,"•Extensive cash handling"
good,"The different positions I have held at Fifth Third gave me the opportunity to experience many different aspects in the banking world.  I have formed many lasting relationships with staff, management, HR and many individuals in the departments as well.  I enjoyed my job most when I could help a customer or co worker with a problem.  The hardest part of my job was giving the customer bad news on a loan application, credit card application or fees."
good,"Good Company to work for however, not much room for advancement. Great as far as assisting with balancing work and family life.

good,"quick paced work environment, enjoyable and supportive co-workers, given multiple responsibilities"
good,Great place to work while attending college. Co-works were very energetic and did a lot together. The branch worked together to benefit everyone. 
good,"Again, I dealt with lots of amounts of money. Dealing with customers accounts and complaints. I had to be fast especially at the drive through on paydays. I learned to be proficient in numbers and typing them in correctly and balancing out even everyday. Management was okay.  I did not have much dealings with them. Most co-workers were easy to work with.  Their were a few that I just dealt with them on as pleasant as I could.  Some, to me were just a little lazy and complained and gossiped a lot. The hardest part of my job was just having to stay focused and accurate and pleasant no matter what was going on around me. The most enjoyable part was being around people.  Especially, my usual weekly customers.  I felt connected with a lot of them.  They were glad to see me and I was glad to see them too."

good,Working at Fifth Third Bank has overall been a very good experience. I work inside of a Kroger at a Bank Mart location and love the customer service we provide for those who come in. The management is good and we are always learning more about the job and finances. I have gained more knowledge about finances and enjoy connecting and building relationships with my customers that frequently come in. I always strive to help them as well as give a pleasant experience for their banking.
good,This was a very new and exciting position for me to have. I had never been in sales before but this job was so different and interesting and taught me a lot of different communication skills. The management helps their staff through the whole training process and is very open to answering questions and advancing your career.
good,The workplace culture is a bit subdued and the management is not very hands on. The lack of a strong foundation and the fact that there is little to no guidance makes it difficult to work at 100% efficiency.

I wish that I could have stayed with the company longer. I had home life circumstances that forced to me leave. I may look into returning in the future. The most challenging part of the job was keeping up with policies and procedures as technology advancements rolled out, sometimes documentation was obsolete. The best part was the creativity in incentive planning to motivate employees. There were multiple ways to excel and increase monthly bonus potential."
good,Worked for this bank for a long time.  They treated me right and were a great company to work for.  They generally take care of their people and they offer very good benefits.

My manager was remarkable and was very accommodating when it came to family matters and/or previously committed engagements.
good,"Out of college this was a good stepping stone toward bigger business opportunities. However, the position was as a mortgage loan officer and that was never my goal with a business degree."

good,"The management that I have worked for has been great. They have helped build my career and coach me to be the best banker I can be. If you are willing to work hard every day, they will do everything they can to get you where you want to go. The hardest part about the job is the inconsistent schedule.

A typical day at work consists of working customers to find the best types of products and services to hep them achieve their financial goals."

good,Was a great place to take my skills for customer service to the next level. Helped me grow in my professional skills allowing me to figure out where I wanted my career to go.
good,"It is a nice job out of college but it is not what I want to do for my entire life. Getting to talk to new people is nice, but it is not fun when those people are angry. Most of the people I deal with have complaints or problems. I also do not like how the sales tactics they teach are essentially used car salesman techniques that intelligent people see through immediately."
good,"Though the mortgage can be stressful, there is nothing greater than helping a customer purchase their home or refinance to better their financial situation."
good,Was generally a nice place to work at. For the most part everyone generally seemed to know what they were doing despite lapses in communication every once in awhile. Superiors tried to make sure everyone was on the same page. Coworkers seemed generally alright. Appeared to be a standard banking workplace at the corporate level.

good,"Gained extensive knowledge in loss mitigation, bankruptcy, property preservation, SAI timelines, quality assurance, CDIA guidelines and loan servicing."
good,"A typical day at work at this company is nothing exciting. Usually we push for sales to go up like usual, or to keep on pace if we're hitting goal. The most important lesson I've learned from working here is that hard work is always rewarded. The workplace culture is a bit dry and unexciting, as I do not interact much with the other departments unless there is a sales opportunity. The hardest part of the job, like any other job, is dealing with angry customers. At the bank you're dealing with people's money, and people become furious when something goes wrong with their finances, regardless of who is to blame. I do not let upset customers phase me, however, as it is a typical part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is making my customers happy. There is nothing more rewarding than a smile on someone's face when I help them resolve a problem. Some of my well known customers will brag to lesser known customers about how much they appreciate our customer service, which always puts me in a good mood."
good,Always busy with customer and sale calls.  Went from being a teller to new accounts quickly.  Loved my co workers we always seem to be able to laugh and make it enjoyable to be there.  The hardest part was staying late and making sale calls and have to meet a goal with sales monthly. The most enjoyable part of the job was customers that came in daily.

Other than that its a [pretty decent job we didn't have a sup visor for like 4 months
good,"The bank has an inclusive atmosphere that emphasizes growth and work/life balance. I have always felt valued but not always heard. I think the issue is partially the size of the company. Management turnover is high, which is concerning. Overall this is a great place to work."
good,"Great benefits, great co-worker and management. if you work at a bank-mart the hours are not that great. You will learn a lot about loans and baking practices. They teach you well.  you get know the customers really well."

good,"Fifth Third has provided a fantastic environment to learn and grow in the banking industry. I have had the privilege to work in several different roles within the bank, and to learn about many facets of the banking industry. It has added a lot to my personal financial knowledge, and has allowed me to share those insights with my customers. The scenarios and world impact I see correlated with what I do for work, and what I see on the news, is also very interesting. It connects my day to day to the world at large, which is a very interesting perspective."

good,"Outbound calls, set up payment arrangements, made reminder calls"
good,"Good Place to learn and implement new skills.Fifth Third Bancorp, one of the world’s strongest banks, provides personal, business, and commercial banking products and services in the United States"
good,While working at Fifth Third I learned a great deal about the process of managing an office and completion of sales goals.  Everyone I worked with was enjoyable and wanted to succeed.  The most difficult part was the sales goals as the community was small and there was not enough foot traffic and calls were not regarded well by the customers.
good,Loved the job overall. Great place to work. They care about you and have wonderful benefits for the employees
good,"I learned an extreme amount working at the banking starting with me being challenged learning banking products and how to sell them.  Once I got it, I loved being able to help customers that can have no knowledge in the area to help with something that is challenging to them, finances.  It was amazing to me how I was able to develop my employees to promote them and strive for them to get extra education.  It could be difficult at times working with unhappy customers, but developed my skills on how to develop conflict resolution.  It was a good work environment."
good,Working for 5/3 Insurance as my first full time job.  I started as a bookkeeper and ended as a licensed insurance agent.  I knew the full circle of how the agency worked.  I really enjoyed being able to jump in and fill anyone's shoes if I needed to.  There were only a few of us who worked in the office and we worked really well as a team.  If someone had to be off work any one of the other employees could jump in where they left off if needed.  I enjoyed learning how the insurance field works to help secure individuals.
good,This is a great place to work. The company culture is employee based.
good,good company to work for. the support you get is very good.ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
good,I was part of a Bank wide RIF on 10/8/2013 my last day of employment after 7.5 years as a Sr. Recruiter will be 11/8/2013
good,"A typical day at work for me is arriving at work on time at 8:30 am and begin to prep my work for the day. If I am doing payments for the day, then I will get the basket of payments that I received authorization for throughout the week. If I am presenting documents to customers, then I will get the basket of documents that came in the previous day. With presenting document, I have to OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control), in which I will input all parties from the documents received into a database and it will let me know if there are any trade sanctions that I would need to know about that could prevent me from processing documents. If there are no sanctions then I would enter all information need into a system we use called BankTrade. That will then generate what we would call a cover letter to present to our customer. Once presented, if they accepts the documents( no errors with the documents), then I will mail the documents to the customer. We have a three day SLA."
good,Great Community Bank that does alot of work in the community.
good,"I loved working at the bank in the beginning. There are always opportunity for advancement. They would give you bonuses if our branch did well in customer service. Management was really good about training in things that you were interested learning more about. The things that I didn't like was that cut off our bonuses when they were sued for overdraft to customers which was a problem. We didn't make a lot per hour but when you have a good team to work with, we knew we would get those bonuses. That left us with not much to look forward to  but they was expecting more and more from everyone."
good,Local company with lots of growth oppertunity. Average pay. Very competative work enviorment. Lots of location in the cinncinnati area. Conpetative benifits package.
good,"My day consists of reviewing messages and emails from the previous night. I then begin to work on developing on new business by make new outbound calls. Afterwards, my attention is turned to following up with existing customers and dealing with issues that might have occurred based on the messages and emails from earlier. Beginning in the early evening I begin to work on developing new business again."
good,"As a CSR/teller, this job is ideal for starting out in the company. It is definitely a sales-focused job, with an expectation to refer customers over to the desk staff. The other team members are outstanding to work with, including management."
good,Revieweing account and speaking with cusomers in regards to their accounts. Creating solutions to solve customer problem and complaints. 
good,"A typical day at Fifth Third begins at 6pm. Learning how to receive all of the work from couriers, put in all the information into the company site of IHub. Placing the correct headers of the branches to be processed. Going through all of the checks to remove any staples, tapes and paper clips. The management is good. The co-workers all get along, it is like a small family. We all take responsibility for our own mistakes. The hardest part about the job, is making sure all the documents are clean and free of anything that could cause a sorter jam. The most enjoyable part of the job is having wonderful co-workers and friends."
good,"Encoded confidential bank information like bank deposits, cd's, savings bonds, deposits and withdrawls at a fast pace."
good,"Good people at the top and lower ranks, most people driving for the same goals. Sometimes the mission is lost in the middle ranks, where politics and self-interest come into play. Lots of opportunities, but be mindful of managing your own career."
good,"I started this position my Junior year in High School, but that didn't hold me back from management noticing my talents and promoting me as they saw fit. The company treated their employees fairly and I enjoyed my years there."
good,"I handled different accounts. Made sure they were balanced, added customers payments to their books. I learned how to be very productive and still satify the customer. Management was excellent, always willing to help rather personal or business. I loved my co-workers, they were friends outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job would have been the many changes because of regulations. I loved my job was easy to get up for work,"
good,Fifth Third Bank is an extremely growing company and there is millions of opportunities. I felt a little micromanaged and the work environment could be a little more positive.
good,I enjoyed working for Fifth Third Bank because i got to be apart of the conversion. So i knew the system from the start.
good,A diverse and great company to work for. Fifth Third provided me with customer service education.
good,Fifth Third was a great place to work. I spent more than a decade of my career working for this company and met many great people along the way. I am still very close with many of my former coworkers and managers.
good,"I like my job and what I do, a great place for advancement, and great pay.  Would not be seeking other employment  if it wasn't for the fact, I just prefer to be closer to my family"
good,"My hours were flexible and the manager I had worked on your schedule to accommodate work/life balance."
good,"I was hired to support someone in upper management but he decided to retire and there was not a position for me to move into.  Overall, the culture is good and the employees are wonderful, hardworking people.  The benefits are very good.  The technology desperately needed upgrading, but they were working on that."
good,I was a remote Automotive Finance professional out of footprint for the bank.  The banks people and culture were first class.  Would recommend a career with the bank to anyone.
good,I work at a local branch and the atmosphere is wonderful. We are typically a busy branch but managers and bankers come to help out. We are all friendly and there are rarely instances where a manager has to discipline employees.
good,"I enjoy working here and have been with the company for more than 4 years.  I would only leave if a good opportunity came along externally.  I hope a good opportunity comes along internally."
good,"Great workplace with strong leaders and good work/life balance."
good,"Fifth Third Bank is a regional bank where you can grow. Its a career not a job. You can advance as much as you like. There are careers tha fit the needs of everyone, young and old."
good,Very fast paced work with lots of room to advance. Long hours in an office setting can become very repetitive quickly. Good management hard selling is required.
good,"busy and interesting place to work; good thing, good management and co-workers, good PTO, good benefits, would still be there but my department branched off"
good,Nice place to get your foot in the door if you plan on having a career in a financial institution. The training is not long enough for all you have to do when you actually get on the floor.
good,"If you do your best, they will recognize and appreciate you. They care about employee engagement. They are always striving to improve in all areas. Great coworkers, decent pay, great company. Cares about its employees and customers. If you work hard, they will train you up. Prefer to promote internally first. Inclusive environment."
good,Genuinely relaxed atmosphere which allowed for maximum production.  Friendly and supportive co-workers.  Management availability is unequalled.  Would definitely work here again.
good,"I can't speak for every branch, but my manager set a wonderful example for our team and worked to encourage and collaborate with us! Working at Fifth Third was a great experience for me and set a precedent for how I should be treated by management in the workplace."
good,Very good bank with excellent management.  they are very dedicated to customer service but are lacking a little in the technology area    They are more of a regional bank
good,"I spent the first 13 years at Fifth Third in a Finance role supporting the IT Line of Business.  I quickly moved my way through the ranks and was able to develop a reputation of being reliable and knowledgeable in my field of expertise.  They next 2 years I spent using that knowledge in a new role where I was afforded training and room to grow my skills further.  I have seen the stock prices both split and bottom out, mass layoffs and mass hires.  The hardest part about working at Fifth Third would be how you are seen as a capable employee.  There are times when employees are disregarded when applying for a position because the position requires a degree even though that person may have twice the work experience as another hire with a Bachelor's Degree.  I worked downtown the entire 15 years I was there and even though parking was a bit of a nuisance everything else downtown was conveniently located."
good,"Fifth Third is a great place to work.  They value experience and are also progressing in work place environment, social media etc.. The bank is a true asset to the Cincinnati community. They encourage workers to get involved and give back. I really enjoyed working there."
good,Workplace culture in this company is so adorable. I am thankful to the employees over there because I have learnt perfect work life balance during that period.
good,A typical day at 5/#rd bank is very agressive and stressful. One have to be contantly alert with day to day duties and extremely resposible with the cash flow. Managing around fifteen employees and teaching them skills was a great part of the job.
good,"The job is easy each day, although some days can be very challenging. The only downside of being a temp is not being able to receive holiday pay or PTO/vacation days. Benefits are not that great for a temp."
good,Great company to work for. Management going up the chain was very helpful and personable. Strong relations are made within the company and also with the customer base.
good,The staff are great people. I have learned how to handle cash appropriately. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and forming lasting relationships.
good,"Good Bank to work for, I was given the opportunity to grow my career with Fifth Third Bank.  Worked with amazing Managers who encouraged and motivated the entire team to exceed goals."
good,I had a great Team .we were all together 8 members in the team.Our Lead was very friendly & active because of that we have great fun in the office while even doing the work  .We were exciting to work every sprint with new zeal.
good,"Enjoyable team environment,every team member is very engaged in doing the right things for the customers needs and wants. Work with customers to set up appointments and review customers accounts to ensure the best services that fit there needs."
good,"Great Managers, coworkers were great, overall a wonderful place to work, work life balance was amazing.  Benefits were good as well."
good,Great position and work environment.  Limited room for advancement outside of the Cincinnati area.  Solid benefit plan.
good,"The only thing I would fault them on is that while there are plenty of emails to communicate different things, the clarity is lacking at times."
good,Fifth Third is an excellent company to work for with a great culture. They have an excellent training program that will prepare you to handle complex situations. They have the best sales training program I have experienced. They also allow for an amazing work life balance and they are willing to accommodate your needs. Things to be aware of entering a personal banker role is to expect a heavy sales focus graded on a KPI system. The goals are hard to meet but you can meet them ethically and if you do you will be rewarded. The opportunity for upward mobility is present but hard to attain as position do not come open too frequently. I've worked there for nearly 2 years now and I have had some of the best coaching and support I could ask for.
good,"A typical day at Fifth Third is coming into work preparing for the day by following the opening procedures. Throughout the day I run customer transactions and handle matters customer service related. At close everyone is balancing a cash drawer and following closing procedures from a checklist. Since 2012 I have learned a lot about banking. I have had experience with the Vault, ATM, and Audits. I've always had great managers at Fifth Third, each one has been knowledgable, motivational, and fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers when they overdraw their account. I say this because I know they are frustrated and policy only allows 1 every 12 months to be reversed so sometimes I have to tell the customers ""No"". The most enjoyable part is the contests that motivate the team to reach a common goal."
good,"- 9 to 5 "
good,Management and co-workers are always enjoyable and willing to help in anyway they can.
good,Great place to work in Grand Rapids.  Grand Rapids is a great place to live and work offering work/life balance in a growing city.
good,Overall good company. Great support from management . Regular hours.
good,"First thing I do in the morning in review all overdrawn accounts and make calls to let customers know about their accounts. "
good,Great position to learn the in's and out's of sales and customer service on a wide playing field. Had customers of all types to practice sales on either over the phone or teller line. Learned how to handle all customer situations.
good,"Working at Fifth Third Bank has led me to work with great people overall. Working with a large customer base environment is great when being able to use multi-task skills and interpersonal skills when communicating with the public. The hardest part of the job would have to be the selling piece, although hard dedication does pay off. Not everyone is going to want to be cross-sold a product, but the more people you cross-sell to the more comfortable you get with the products. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the awesome team that I work with. With happy people around you all the time comes a happy day in the workplace. Being able to help people out with thier finances is also very enjoyable. There is nothing better then knowing you are someones trusted advisor."
good,"5th 3rd believed in having engaged employees. They would strive to find new ideas for employee engagement. The benefits were good and I received good training to better my career."
good,"A day of fun and hard work, learned this is a smart company very much good to work for. Management very good and smart and cares about its employees. Letting your self down when your day ended and you could not do more for a great company. Working with management."
good,"Good Enviornment, Great Management, And Great Work And Life Balance."
good,I loved going to work everyday a nice friendly professional enviroment.
good,"In a typical day, I helped employees develop their skills for success. I introduced them to the company, culture and values, and partnered with other members of HR to ensure a strong and effective on boarding process."
good,"Loved working there, just wasn't for me anymore. After 3 years I allowed my self to get burned out."
good,"I love the flex time and casual work environment. My supervisors are the best by far that I've ever had. As with all places, there are a few bad apples in the bunch that can spoil a good thing if you allow it. Nothing to leave your job over though."
good,"Great company to work for and start your career, i always recommend this company to others. Busy days and never a dual moment, you always have something to day."
good,Great atmosphere. Friendly people. I have learned a lot in the 11 years i have been employed with them.
good,"would assists customers with their banking needs, and expand the customer knowaledge with banking info"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Great place to work, the environment is very friendly and the management cares about its employees. The work there can be rather difficult but it is always rewarding."
good,I enjoyed working at 5/3. They are very focused on employee growth and offer lots of benefits. The only reason I left was because I was giving an opportunity closer to home.
good,Great place to advance. There are so many ways that you can move up in the company. If you come to work and do your best there are a lot of bonus potentials.
good,"This company was fun and exciting to work at. "
good,Great paid time off and pay. The manager do their job the way it should be done and celebrations are great.  I would recomend working here. The hardest part is referrals.
good,"Great place to work if you have not into organization.  Unorganized company and confused company when it comes to goals, commission based goals, and overall branch goals.  However, management cares. There is good unity among the other lines of business within the company."
good,I've had a contracting relationship with 5/3 Bank for over 5 years and I have always had a positive experience. I am proud of my good reputation with the company and appreciate that they feel that my work is exceptional enough to contract with me for several years.
good,When I was a member of the Team in FL I was so happy. The continually recognized your potential and rewarded the team . Every month they had a party for the whole region! In St. Louis they worked on fear and unrealistic goals.
good,"Some people like being a teller but it's not for everyone. It's not for me. That's not a bad thing either, this has been the best job I've had so far. It's relaxed, and easy but it's repetitive and not very fulfilling."
good,"fast paced, customer focused business, large call volume. learned how to process banking disputes both fraud and non fraud, learned details of the banking industry"
good,Overall nice place to work a little stressful at times but the pay is good and with the right manager you have the opportunity to go far with the company. They have good benefits and pay their workers nicely for the work that they do.
good,Fifth-Third Bank provides many benefits and resources for their employees to succeed. The company trains their employees to be better leaders. More training for new hires can be improved.
good,"Fifth Third is an organization deeply rooted in community initiatives that benefit the bank across all lines of business.  If the work experience is maximized, coupled with an effective manager, many opportunities to connect with other lines of business,, and advancement opportunities are available."
good,Overall I had a great experience working at Fifth Third Bank. I introduced me to the more professional field and all of my management looked out for my professional growth and recognized me for my work.
good,If you are an sales oriented person then this is the job for you. It's focus is sales and getting your numbers for the day. The pay is good and the training is thorough
good,"A typical work day at this location has a lot of down time due to low foot traffic. To avoid stagnant progress we spend a lot of time finding potential leads to make cold calls to. "
good,My typical day starts by reviewing all the previous day's approvals  and checking my funding pipeline for issues that need to be communicated to my dealers. I always touched base with my buyer before I left to make my sales calls to let her know what dealers I was planning to visit and discuss any issues or victories we may have had the previous day. I am a firm believer that to be successful in this business you have to work well as a team. So I always did whatever was needed to help out everyone from the funders to senior management whenever I could.  Over the years I have learned how to manage my territory efficiently with little direct supervision. My goal was always to make my manager's job as easy as possible when it came to my sales market. The hardest part of the job for me was losing out on deals that I could have captured had the F&I manager just submitted it to me..The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was never boring. Every day is different even though you are calling on the same dealerships. I enjoy forming relationships with my customers that I then can leverage into business.
good,Fifth Third Bank was by far the best job I have ever had in my life. It is an excellent place to work. The benefits and salary along with the outstanding work environment made it a very fun and energetic place to work.
good,With each position the opportunity for growth and advancement has been great. Starting each day with a plan and a great huddle. Following up throughout the day with team and at the end of the day as well.
good,Worked for Fifth Third for 3 years.  They offer great Fifth Third products.  The best one out there is their Physician Loan program.  I was an expert with this program and had great success.  Working with processors and underwriters out of town and developed great relationships.  We helped management outside of mortgage division with CSI scores and generating additional products for the bank.  Mortgage management was great and very helpful.
good,"At Fifth Third Bank I had an excellent schedule, it allowed me to spend time with family and friends, and attend school. The benefits were great; the only problem was that I had to change jobs for personal reasons."
good,"Love this job, the people there are fantastic. The company tries to make sure to acknowledge your success and they do very well at hiring from within."
good,A day in collections was fun and exciting something to learn new everyday.
good,Great company to work for; good interaction with fellow employees and bosses; room for advancement; good benefits
good,"Fifth Third Bank has been the winner of Plain Dealer's Top Workplaces for the past two years.  The title is well-deserved.  Fifth Third Bank management teaches you all about the financial industry, including stocks, investments, and how the economy affects financials.  The hardest part of the job is being responsible for so many things and having a newer staff that is not always up to speed on new things to help.  The most enjoyable part is knowing so much about the banking industry which helps to be able to answer customer questions with ease.  "
good,"This job has taught me alot of great customer service prospectives, and leadership experiences. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great people and positive supportive management team."
good,Fifth Third is a great place to work.  There is encouragement of diversity and furthering your knowledge in your job. I was always encouraged to learn a new task and take on more responsibility.  I know that I had some of the best leaders and managers in that field.  We worked together as a family not just employees.  I believe the hardest part of my job was getting regular customers to stop going to their normal people.  For me it was a blessing and a curse at times.
good,Was not there very long for personal reasons but bank had great leadership and was very old fashion which I personally liked.
good,This is a very relaxed corporate setting with good management and enjoyable co-workers.
good,"Take good care of they employees. "
good,"Fifth Third Mortgage was a very busy, sometimes stressful job of which I was well paid.  I was paid a salary as well as on production.  The year that I left I was in the top two closers based on amount of loans produced.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the e-mails.  They would come from loan officers, title companies and processors.  Also were required to do on-line training on a regular basis. The company offered a lot of fun things to do at work, but sometimes our department wasn't able to be involved due to the time sensitive work that we did.  The best part of the job was the friends that I made while working and the benefits that I received."
good,"A typical day starts with planning and communication of expectations and how to achieve them in a team setting before opening.   Follow up throughout a busy day that has many unexpected twists and turns making organization and planning an absolute must.  "
good,"Big Company Atmosphere, Lots of Bureaucracy that slows down progress, Fun Place to Work, Team Environment/Colaborative, People are Motivated to do the Right Thing"

good,"In my current position, I find myself in a very relaxed position. Often I find myself bored but it is great to have to opportunity to learn in my career field."
good,"Was a great place to work, good compensation, friendly coworkers and very good advancement opportunities.  The only drawback was that Business could be slow and the work could be slow."
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed working at Fifth Third. I worked at a corporate office rather than a branch, which makes it more of an office environment. The most negative thing about this place is being glued to your desk. I enjoy moving around but being stuck at a desk all day can make that difficult. It's pretty easy to pack on some lbs in an environment like that. Other than that, I liked the people I worked with, I was able to leave work at work, and I felt like the pay was more than fair. Furthermore, if I had decided to stay with the bank, there's plenty of room for movement through the company and there's always someone to ask about different positions."
good,Great bank to work for. Yes it is hard work and yes high sale goals and  expectations but most retail positions are like that. They give you the tools to succeed in whatever position you have. Wonderful regional manager very engaged. Loved helping customers and making a difference.
good,Overall fifth third is a great place to work.  I learned the in and outs of banking.  They have a great training facility. They really put the time and effort to train you everything you need to know.

good,Typical day at work is leading my team to be successful with production and also giving customers the best experience. I like to give the best version of myself.
good,This was a very responsible position in a small town bank.  Several local businesses making daily deposits and withdrawals along with personal bankers. Opened and closed daily working front line and sometimes the drive thru. Must balance drawer at the end of the day. I learned patience and helping customers plus co-workers to make the day go smooth and keep people happy. Management was very supportive and worked with all employees making the position a positive and fun place to work.  We all felt like family at Fifth Third Bank. The hardest part was on Holiday weeks when we would be short employees and customers seemed to need extra transactions run making some extra work for everyone and sometimes late getting out on time.  The most enjoyable part was forming personal relationships with businesses and customers.
good,Great place to start your career with opportunity for advancement. They have a generous incentive plan for sales goals.

Other than that its a [pretty decent job we didn't have a sup visor for like 4 months

good,Fifth Third train their employees very well.  The company was very good at allowing you to take as many classes as you want to help advance your career.
good,Relative good place to work but difficult place to advance to a management position. The Data Center manager was very good. A good days work with great peers.
good,Typical day at work would be to speak to debtors on a daily and try to calculate plans based on living expenses regarding their financial hardships. Setting up payment arrangements bringing the account out of delinquency and/ bringing account delinquency down on the account. The management was up to par and efficient with their management duties. The co-workers were knowledgeable and  helped one another. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist the customers without jobs that were more than thirty days past due. I enjoyed helping customers and knowing I was able to brighten up their day(s) by updating their information.
good,"cash handling, vault handling, balancing, customer service, selling credit cards and accounts"

I make calls on automated dialer system to deliquent mortgage account holders and assist them with updating there financials to see what options are available to assist them get current or if need to fill out a hardship application for further help or look into liquidating there home.

good,"i enjoy working here.  great management, always been treated fairly and they do things the right way."
good,coming in to work and opening accounts meeting new people that would come up to the teller line for help. I learned a new respect for currency. Management needs more work most people their had only 1 years or less tenure with the company which left self learning a must! hardest part would be locations of the branches didn't make for much resource. I did enjoy my co-workers and us being able to learn and share with one another what we'd learn

good,"I love working for Fifth Third as I was able to develop and enhance my commercial and risk compliance skillset. "
good,It all depends on the area you work in. I worked for Fifth Third in two different states. One was amazing (Indiana) the other wasn't as great everyone was newer and it seemed upper management had no idea how Fifth Third even did anything it was like a circus. Plus they would run really short staffed one day I got sick on the teller line and couldn't leave because there was NO ONE else that could run a drawer.
good,This is a smaller bank and has little footprint in the GA market. The environment is more isolated in terms of job performance. The elements of a successful company are there.
good,Friendly people and culture is great. Work is not hard or boring on a typical day. an employees can learn how a good company does things. The management is so so . /harderst part of job is keeping busy sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people

The hardest part of my job was not knowing how my day would transpire."
good,Able to help many clients with many areas of expertise throughout bank. Weak management.
good,Great place to work with excellent pay and benefits. Several opportunities to advance internally within the company.  Company makes excellent business decisions.
good,I enjoyed working for Fifth Third. I learned so much in such a little time and had a wonderful team that was so eager to help me grown. What I didn't necessarily like was the lack of diversity.
good,Great place too work ...poor management great pay good benifits but childish non professional management. Other than that it's like family.. Advancement isn't easy you have management that tries to stop you to moving to the next level.
good,"Don't think you will just be counting money all day.  Although running a drawer and customer transactions is a must...it is a sales position.  If you are not busy with a customer in your office or branch, you will be making warm or cold calls to keep your sales up. Constant drive to grow book of business required. Day to day customer interaction whether in person or on the phones required."
good,"Great company, Great work life balance with flexible schedules. . Raises were very low the most I would get was like .26 cents a year. The benefits were good."
good,This opinion is not valid due to the context of the setting. I am looking for a position that is closer to where I live. I am not looking to change positions for less income.
good,The Online Banking team with Fifth Third Bank uses the latest technical stacktrace which will make you enjoy working for them. Also there is complete freedom to try any new technologies and showcase your talent.
good,Very much enjoy working at Fifth Third Bank although it is fast paced it is very rewarding.  The culture and Core Values are all about the Customer and Employee Engagement.  Fifth Third Bank truly puts the Customer at the center of everything they do.  Compensation is good and benefits are also very good.

Review submitted documents to confirm the DTI wasn't over threshold. Confirming appraisals were ordered and reviwing them upon receipt to see if final inspections are needed."
good,Fifth Third Bank provided professional environment that requires self focus and drive to complete daily responsibilities. Team reliant and oriented to complete department goals and bancorp objective.
good,The company has a firm grasp on employee engagement. The mid level management is less than desired. The politics prevents positive work efforts of those who are trying to make a difference.
good,"I enjoy working for Fifth Third Bank however I feel that I have more to offer than the banking industry currently has available.  Fifth Third Bank is slow to advance employee's into new positions."
good,"I'm always on the move at Fifth Third Bank. In the mornings we get Green bags that are locked and can only be open with keys. They have ATM bundles located in them and some contain ATM and Branch Capture Work. I would then file the morning Branch Capture work in numerical order. Then in the afternoon We get UPS Branch Capture bags that would contain interoffice mail, Regular Address Mail, and Branch Capture Work. When I got this branch capture work i would put them in boxes in numerical order so when the work gets filed all together its easier to find work."
good,The pay was great and the benefits were wonderful. Strict time management. Unfair work goals and favoritism in regards to advancement.
good,A typical work day at 5/3 includes sending/replying to emails from customers as well as third party vendors. I also review loan documents for completeness and accuracy. Communication with customers on the stage of there loan is crucial to good customer service as well as ensuring closing on time. The most difficult part of working for 5/3 is working with third party vendors that do not always see importance of obtained documents in the allotted amount of time. Having great co-workers who are always willing to help and knowing there is a real person on the other end of the phone that you are helping obtain a home makes the job satisfying.
good,Working with bank clientele with our proprietary software.  I learned how to trouble-shoot software.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of the job were learning the technical side of the program.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the people.

A typical day would include numerous meetings which would not always allow me the time to coach my employees properly, which i think very important to be successful in management"

good,"I enjoyed coming to work because my co workers made it easy to get the job done. Coming from driving the bus and interacting with children for 6 years was a change once I came on board with fifth third. Plenty of overtime was provided if it was available to you. I most appreciated that I had a boss that was understand, patient and free to listen to his employees when there was an issues in the work place or in their person lives"

Many times, I was in charge of larger amounts of cash, whilst managing my own balanced cash drawer.  Each of my co-workers were different but all very helpful and friendly.  We were able to have fun even outside of work and we still keep in touch.  Fifth Third Bank has an incredible sense of management with many opportunities to advance.  There was not one superior I did not prefer.  Each knew the best way to manage employees, as well as offering a listening ear to clients.  Though the work environment was phenomenal, banking was not a personal interest, thus making this the hardest part of the job.

good,"A typical day at Fifth Third Bank is opening the branch along with a few other co workers, doing my daily duties having to do with the Vault, ATM, Night drops, customer issues to finish up along with opening at 9:00 am to start the normal work day. I started at Fifth Third as a part time teller but soon became fulltime with a lot more responsibilities. My co workers are like family, I see them more than I see my own family back at home. We like to have fun at work but at the same time make sure the job gets done correctly & efficient for customers along with us. I think the hardest part of the job is to not so much deal with customer issues or responsibilities but its more about having so much to do in one day and trying to get as much done as possible so that it doesn't spill over to the next day. I love that I get along with my co workers, it makes the day go by a lot quicker and makes it easier to go into work."

My coworkers were the coolest.  We all enjoyed each other.  The hardest part for me was the initial processes.  This was my first job in a bank setting, and I was very unfamiliar with the daily process it took to run a financial institution.  The best part of the job was that I got to talk, all day in the name of sales of course."
good,"I have worked at Fifth Third all throughout college and am proud to say I have been a part of this workplace.
